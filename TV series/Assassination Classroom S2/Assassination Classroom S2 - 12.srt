1
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:05,158
The math exam's last problem.

2
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:09,750
Half of our grade was weeded out before getting this far.

3
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:13,269
The other half had absolutely no time to spare.

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,598
And was so exhausted they
didn't have the energy to solve it.

5
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:22,978
The only students still standing with any chance
of earning full marks in the few minutes left...

6
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:30,834
were these two.

7
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,714
What was it Nagisa always used to say?

8
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,282
You're so talented, Karma.

9
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:22,032
How is there such a gap between the both of us?

10
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,938
Guess some people are just geniuses, huh?

11
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:27,997
Easy for you to say.

12
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:29,467
If you ask me,

13
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:32,661
it's not all that cut n' dry who the real genius is here.

14
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,815
Talent is usually an invisible trait.

15
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,472
More often than not, it's the
result of work other people don't see.

16
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:40,894
Take Sugino.

17
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,286
He can fit in easily with anyone, anywhere.

18
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:49,411
Or Okuda, who can totally lose herself
in something she's passionate about.

19
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:53,891
Even Terasaka, who dives right
in without a second thought.

20
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:57,641
From where I'm standing, we're in the same boat.

21
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,374
Everybody has something,

22
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:02,336
some hidden special ability they take for granted.

23
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:04,044
We're all geniuses.

24
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:05,873
We all have a talent.

25
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,277
Still...

26
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:12,815
The issue at hand is whether or not I can filter
the answer to this problem through the lens of my own.

27
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,461
C'mon, man...

28
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,947
Snap out of it, you don't have time for this.

29
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:21,229
Atoms.

30
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,747
Body-centered cubic units...

31
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,671
Extraneous details.

32
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:26,798
Stay focused.

33
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:31,278
Broken down to essentials, the problem is simple.

34
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,138
Solve for the volume of your specific domain,

35
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:36,760
in a box, surrounded by enemies.

36
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,046
When both sides are evenly matched,

37
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:52,977
their attacks meet in the middle.

38
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:57,187
Of course, from there inward is my domain!

39
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:58,865
That's one enemy down! Ha!

40
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,529
Nice try.

41
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:09,835
But I'm afraid you won't be
encroaching on my turf anytime soon.

42
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:13,547
Eight enemies total, surrounding the cube's perimeter.

43
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,582
If I determine the volume of the
eight areas I've effectively sealed off,

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,140
and subtract that from the volume of the cube,

45
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:24,446
I'm left with A-Zero, my specific domain!

46
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:31,478
Once I've locked down this space, I'll have the answer.

47
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:32,908
Come on, come on!

48
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,644
Ruling my own domain.

49
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,363
Nice overall theme for my goal in life!

50
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:47,098
A different sort of ruler than my father.

51
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:49,465
He's obsessed.

52
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:54,685
The man only cares about proving his "rational"
approach to education superior to all others.

53
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,270
His method may break a person's spirit,
but it won't educate them.

54
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:02,146
It's time to set the record straight,

55
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:05,506
give him a piece of my mind! I have to take control!

56
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:06,959
That...

57
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:10,002
is my responsibility as your son!

58
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,377
There it is!

59
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:18,242
The volume of one of the sealed-off areas is an
aggregate of one hexagonal and three triangular pyramids!

60
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,401
Hang on a minute...

61
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:36,642
This problem doesn't even call for difficult math.

62
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,052
The whole thing's divided out
into this one itty-bitty little cube...

63
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:44,809
and if it's supposedly an atomic crystal...

64
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:45,970
Yeah,

65
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,449
everything on the outside is just more of the same.

66
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:50,935
Which means...

67
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:53,636
The world doesn't end here.

68
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,981
From where I'm standing,

69
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,253
everyone has their own talent.

70
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:02,477
Their own specific domain.

71
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:04,887
We are all in the same boat.

72
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:07,500
I just couldn't see it before.

73
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,782
All I could see from inside this box

74
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:13,657
were fragments of the bigger picture.

75
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:16,596
I have my area, they have theirs.

76
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:17,756
We all do.

77
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,266
That's how this works.

78
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,037
How it's always worked.

79
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:23,579
Everyone's the same size,

80
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:25,446
the same distance apart.

81
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:27,872
And if we're all cut from the same box,

82
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:31,830
those eight contiguous boxes can be
broken up into the same proportion.

83
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:37,230
Each person's individual fragment
accounts for one-eighth of the whole.

84
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:44,570
So what it boils down to is: This box contains
one whole me and one-eighth of eight other people.

85
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:47,026
In other words,

86
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:52,007
inside this cube, the ratio of me to
the other eight fragments is one-to-one.

87
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,565
Simple!

88
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,893
And if it's one-to-one inside the box,

89
00:06:57,212 --> 00:07:00,875
the volume of the area I can call my own
is up to one-half of the cube!

90
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,299
Voila! That's my specific domain!

91
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:08,756
Piece of cake.

92
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,139
They taught us this stuff in primary school.

93
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:23,445
No need for long, drawn-out equations.

94
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:26,123
No need for big, complicated diagrams.

95
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:28,546
Nope.

96
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:32,327
You just have to adjust for the fact
there's a world outside yourself.

97
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:37,021
Pencils down!

98
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:41,329
Time's up, son. The test is over.

99
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,016
Just one more line.

100
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,638
Damn it! I knew the answer!

101
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:53,651
And like that,

102
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,819
the tidal wave of our end-of-term exams broke.

103
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,025
Alright-y, class!

104
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:05,339
Let's all have a look at your compiled exam papers.

105
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:10,289
Did those crucial second blades manage
to pierce their intended targets, I wonder?

106
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:18,433
No splitting hairs over a point or two, understood?

107
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:24,731
The only thing we're concerned with right now is whether
these scores secured a place for you in the top 50.

108
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:30,888
Unless I'm mistaken, the main campus ought to be
posting the results for all to see as we speak.

109
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:34,043
So I see no reason we can't do the same in E-Class...

110
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,481
You... you're kidding me...

111
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,198
I'm forty-sixth?!

112
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,379
Isn't Terasaka dead last even in here, though?

113
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:58,331
If he came in forty-sixth, then that must mean...

114
00:08:58,522 --> 00:08:59,546
Is this for real?

115
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:02,732
We did it!

116
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:06,641
And we beat out the Big Five for the top spots!

117
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:07,690
Go us!

118
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:10,376
Karma! Dude, you got first place!

119
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:13,792
Feels pretty good, doesn't it?

120
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:17,623
Earning the highest rank on
such an unforgiving battlefield.

121
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,497
Whatever. I guess so, yeah.

122
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:24,820
It appears your contest with Asano the
perfectionist came to a head on that last,

123
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:28,140
and I must say, particularly thorny, math problem.

124
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,284
Yeah, about that.

125
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:31,859
Not sure I could say exactly why, but...

126
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,608
If I hadn't spent the past year with you guys,

127
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,784
I don't think I could have solved it.

128
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:39,270
That's the kind of problem it was.

129
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:42,052
Tough haul gettin' to this point, though, huh?

130
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:43,479
Yeah! I don't believe it!

131
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:45,296
And, well, all wanted this so badly!

132
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:48,345
We actually beat A-Class.
Almost sounds too good to be true.

133
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,540
We're back on track for the top tier schools!

134
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:52,379
The ladies'll be throwin' themselves at our feet!

135
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:53,796
Way to go us, right?

136
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,623
Yeah! Chicks everywhere!

137
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:57,810
Feels like a final episode.

138
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,578
Wait a sec! It's not over!

139
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:02,296
Uh. What's with that look, man?

140
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:03,161
Are you okay?

141
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:04,576
Uh, yeah.

142
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:08,016
Uh, it's just that, so much
has happened since I came here.

143
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:10,210
I'm really glad I got kicked down.

144
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:12,562
Aw, why you gotta be all depressing, huh?

145
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:16,087
Besides, why make an ugly face
when this clown has it covered?

146
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:17,233
What does that mean?!

147
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:18,749
Terasaka! Easy, you're choking him!

148
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:19,741
Whaddya think?

149
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:20,698
What do I think?

150
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,849
I think I can get into my dream school now.

151
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:25,464
What are you gonna study? Architecture, right?

152
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:29,795
Yeah. I'm angling for a high school
that's big on engineering and science.

153
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:30,811
Hm.

154
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,779
Ha! Man, those A-Class dillweeds.

155
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,330
What I wouldn't give to see the
looks on their faces right now!

156
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,921
Bet'cha anything they never thought
in a million years they'd lose to us!

157
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:44,629
Now, to be fair, on their part A-Class
performed quite well on the first half of the exams.

158
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,892
But as the questions grew increasingly
difficult on the second half,

159
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,583
more and more students found
themselves running out of steam.

160
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,468
Yeah, well, that's what they get.

161
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,503
Whoever you are, nobody's bloodlust holds out that long.

162
00:10:56,118 --> 00:10:58,347
Even after intensive assassination drills.

163
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:01,755
It's next to impossible staying in
that frame of mind for an entire day.

164
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:04,999
If you expect to boost your system on bloodlust,

165
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:06,839
cramming isn't the way to go.

166
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:10,169
You have to nurture it over time, slow and steady.

167
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,410
How'd this happen?

168
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,444
How'd we lose after everything we put ourselves through?

169
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:17,686
Your study methods worked against you.

170
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:19,854
You were set up to lose.

171
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:21,743
That's what it comes to.

172
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:24,335
Not that my scores are anything to brag about, either...

173
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,830
Rest assured, I'll put this frustration to work.

174
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:31,504
Come high school, I'll be on top again,

175
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:34,203
doing my damnedest to blaze a trail for the rest of you.

176
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:39,597
Just... All I ask is for your support.

177
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:40,884
Asano...

178
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,021
You mean that?

179
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:45,763
Intriguing.

180
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:51,077
Strong words for someone who's lost
the fight on which he staked his future.

181
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,017
Principal Asano.

182
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:58,061
All we may count on in life is the unknown,

183
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:02,623
what seems arbitrary can in
fact be what costs you everything.

184
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:05,410
One can't be sure until the battle is over.

185
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,788
This, you see, is why I insist on always playing to win.

186
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:13,388
I have an obligation to prepare
my students for the unknown.

187
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:17,233
Between now and graduation, you have much to learn.

188
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:19,560
Principal Asano, sir?

189
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:20,284
Hm?

190
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,889
All due respect, it's clear to us...

191
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:24,827
that your methods

192
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:27,187
aren't going to help us beat E-Class.

193
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:30,787
Defeat made them stronger.

194
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,170
Asano's taken that lesson to heart.

195
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,039
We're no match for them, sir...

196
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,504
Their strength is just too... what's the word?

197
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:38,405
Adaptable.

198
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:39,914
Forgive us, sir.

199
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:41,853
We fell short of our goal.

200
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,213
If you think it's appropriate,

201
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,374
transfer us down to E-Class.

202
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,386
I think there's a lot to learn
from their way of doing things.

203
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:54,337
Well, Principal?

204
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:55,885
What do you have to say to that?

205
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:00,671
Asano!

206
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:02,525
Are you all right?!

207
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:07,532
Your face looks like it's glitching out.

208
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:09,589
Uh-oh.

209
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:12,766
Don't tell my I'm finally seeing your fatherly side?

210
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:18,440
Excuse us, sir. We have to be going.

211
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,689
Well, boys and girls!

212
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:40,288
You've officially qualified to
be transferred out of E-Class.

213
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,665
Anyone here ready to leave the mountain?

214
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,762
Yeah. You'd like that, wouldn't you?

215
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:48,353
I don't think so, we've found our second blades.

216
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:50,195
This is where things get serious!

217
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:54,018
If you know a place better suited
to assassination, we're all ears!

218
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,254
Gluttons for punishment, I see.

219
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:02,256
I suppose, then, as your reward
I ought to divulge my most notable weakness...

220
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,590
Huh?

221
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:11,504
Ah! Our building!

222
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:14,467
Evacuate the premises, please.

223
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,212
Principal Asano!

224
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:18,463
The Board reached a unanimous decision.

225
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:22,229
The old campus building is to be demolished today.

226
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,120
Oh, don't worry.

227
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,758
You'll be moved to an affiliate
school slated to open next year.

228
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:31,671
We need students to performance-test
their newest facilities.

229
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:33,921
Wait, you're farming us out somewhere?!

230
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:35,421
It's not all that bad.

231
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:37,634
Let us call it a social experiment.

232
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:39,262
The building is state-of-the-art,

233
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:43,227
with closed-circuit surveillance cameras
and escape-proof architecture.

234
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:45,046
It's similar to a prison.

235
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:48,218
The culmination of my educational philosophy.

236
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,841
But, you can't move us right now!

237
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:51,712
We won't go!

238
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,722
We're graduating from this campus!

239
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,562
I see you'll spare nothing to see your methods vindicated.

240
00:14:58,754 --> 00:14:59,483
Correct.

241
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,627
Oh, and incidentally,

242
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:04,513
your services will no longer be required.

243
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:04,972
Mm.

244
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,055
Yes, I'm afraid so.

245
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,034
This is the part where I terminate you.

246
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,962
Whoa! He just got slapped with walking papers!

247
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,072
I don't believe it.

248
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:18,098
The man actually played the forbidden ace-in-the-hole!

249
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:20,808
Ah! This is wrongful dismissal!

250
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:24,304
The Octopus is ridiculously
susceptible to this mode of attack.

251
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:27,402
Do super creatures have a legal right to protest?

252
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:29,444
Now don't go jumping to conclusions...

253
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:32,560
Actually, this is no more than a
clever means of distracting you.

254
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:36,222
When I said "terminate," I meant it literally.

255
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:38,802
I'm here to kill you.

256
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:39,716
Eh?

257
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,599
You see, Koro-sensei...

258
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,094
You don't fit with my vision.

259
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,437
He can't be serious.

260
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,265
Look, man, we know you're a big Machiavelli and all that,

261
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:51,379
but I'd tread carefully in your shoes.

262
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,810
The Octopus is clever.

263
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:57,203
Hold off on the demolition for now, if you would please...

264
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,586
I have unfinished business inside.

265
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,898
Where the hell'd that notice of dismissal come from?

266
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,454
This is crazy. What is he thinking?

267
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:12,250
Now, then, Koro-sensei.

268
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:15,102
I assume you don't wish to be fired?

269
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,931
And furthermore that you wish to preserve this classroom?

270
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,094
Well, what would you say to a little wager?

271
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:22,761
What's he getting at?

272
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,584
I've prepared five subjects' worth of exam questions,

273
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:28,331
and five live grenades.

274
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:31,486
Four contain anti-Sensei projectiles.

275
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:33,233
That is, they are fatal to you.

276
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:35,370
One is fatal to humans.

277
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,712
All five grenades are identical in appearance and smell,

278
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,043
and designed so that once their pins are pulled

279
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:43,928
they will explode the instant their handles are raised.

280
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,215
I've pulled the pins,

281
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:51,196
and carefully placed the grenades between
random pages of each test booklet, handles down.

282
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:55,709
You must open each book and solve the
problem in the top right-hand corner.

283
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:58,962
But, that'll push the handles to the up position!

284
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:00,109
That's correct.

285
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:02,646
Your teacher will almost certainly
be hit with an explosion.

286
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:04,354
Furthermore,

287
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:06,659
he can't move until the problem has been solved.

288
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:08,679
The first four books

289
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:11,035
are yours and yours alone to open and solve.

290
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:13,632
I will be taking the remainder for myself.

291
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:19,147
Kill me, or force me to withdraw,
and victory belongs unquestionably to you.

292
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,484
You and the E-Class students will be allowed to stay here.

293
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:26,941
Agreed? Terasaka, look sharp.

294
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,905
Use the appropriate formula
to find Koro-sensei's odds of winning.

295
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,129
Why do I have to solve something so messed up?

296
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:37,468
An anti-Sensei grenade won't kill you...

297
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:39,938
The real one will, naturally,

298
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:42,792
but we'd have to save it for the end, so let's see.

299
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:44,980
Four-fifths

300
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:46,171
times three-fourths

301
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:47,171
times two-thirds

302
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:49,552
times one-half equals one-fifth.

303
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,762
So... 20%.

304
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:53,032
Well done!

305
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,712
Yeah, but hold on:

306
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:58,157
The Octopus sits through four explosions
before you even take a turn!

307
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:01,516
This game is rigged! You can just bow
out if you don't like the way it's going.

308
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,075
Dunno about you, but I call that unfair!

309
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:04,773
Young man.

310
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,838
Hm?

311
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:09,835
Life is unfair. It's chock full with injustice.

312
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:13,110
Especially if you're not fortunate enough
to be one of the strong.

313
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,501
Don't you see?

314
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:17,757
This is why I teach the true meaning of strength.

315
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:20,688
So, then. Shall we proceed?

316
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:25,471
Show me how serious you really are
about your chosen profession, Koro-sensei.

317
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:27,441
In fact, if I were you,

318
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,929
I wouldn't waste a single moment.

319
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:33,767
Yes, of course.

320
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:34,957
Let's jump right in.

321
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:37,987
He threatens dismissal,

322
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:41,039
devises a game that's clearly in his favor.

323
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,768
And there's no way out.

324
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:48,910
Mathematically, the odds of it succeeding
are better than anything we've tried.

325
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:52,136
The most important blade is strength...

326
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:54,988
This man is an assassin.

327
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,771
Open, solve the problem, and close.

328
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:01,081
Move quickly enough and the grenade won't go off.

329
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:03,444
Speed is your specialty.

330
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:05,254
This should be walk in the park, yes?

331
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,659
Uh, yes! Excellent point!

332
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:27,795
Planar calculations!

333
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,646
Oh, th-this couldn't be easier!

334
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:31,921
A-All you gotta to do is borrow from the tens

335
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,671
and get three with four left over,

336
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,421
or, ah, actually I believe it's three or thereabouts.

337
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,268
I know how you are with puzzles.

338
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:45,859
You get flustered; Your processing speed declines.

339
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:48,553
This trap is almost too perfect.

340
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:51,936
Koro-sensei...

341
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,843
We'll call the first one a hit... Bravo.

342
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:57,157
Only three more to go and you'll have won the game.

343
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:01,350
Now, please move on to the next
problem before you've regenerated.

344
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:03,234
This is B.S.!

345
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,854
No way can he survive three more of those explosions!

346
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:07,646
He's seriously gonna be taken out!

347
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:09,582
And the setup is so friggin' simple!

348
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,004
You see my point?

349
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:13,062
The weak have to rely on assassination,

350
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,671
whereas the strong may kill at their leisure,

351
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,489
when and however they please.

352
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,937
Soon, I will plant institutions across the nation

353
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,493
that drive home this truth.

354
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:25,354
The Ministry of Defense has been generous.

355
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:26,917
Between them and the bounty,

356
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,943
I'll build affiliate schools all over the world.

357
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,097
It's always about education with him.

358
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:38,613
Come now, Koro-sensei.

359
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:40,940
Validate my ideology.

360
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,054
Be the cornerstone of my vision.

361
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:17,379
Surprise!

362
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,122
Tell us, Kunudon!

363
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:23,379
That festival was a real white-knuckler!

364
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:27,171
Ah, but it looks like those E-Class losers
are down for the count for the count at last!

365
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,987
That's all she wrote!

366
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,055
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Hey there Losers!

367
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:35,381
Just desserts! Yay!

368
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,021
Oh, Mr. Principal!

369
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:42,900
What brings you into the studio?

370
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:46,347
Notice of dismissal!

371
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,729
I'm being... moved.

372
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:49,921
To E-Class?

373
00:22:50,004 --> 00:22:51,774
Hooray for unemployment!

374
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:54,626
Woohoo!
