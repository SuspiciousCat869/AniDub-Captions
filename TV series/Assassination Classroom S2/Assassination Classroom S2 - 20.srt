1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:03,602
Merry Christmas!

2
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:05,787
Merry Christmas!

3
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:07,893
What a magical Christmas Eve!

4
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:10,674
And in February, no less! How festive!

5
00:00:13,268 --> 00:00:14,819
Happy New Year!

6
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:16,827
Out with the old and in with the new!

7
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:18,268
That's right, boys and girls!

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,185
Throw yourself into study and, of course, assassination,

9
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:22,947
with renewed vigor!

10
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:23,978
Now...

11
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:26,505
time to laze the day away.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,245
Where's he going with all this?

13
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:30,602
Oh, I think I'm starting to get the picture.

14
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:35,518
You're trying to cram all the good times you missed out on
over the Winter Break into February, is that what this is?

15
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:36,825
Precisely!

16
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:40,578
Our only Winter Break together,
and not one of you came to visit.

17
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:44,185
'Course, I knew you were worried about me
and trying your hardest to find a solution,

18
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:47,425
which is why it didn't seem proper
to invite anyone over, but still.

19
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:51,312
Seems kinda weird to be all bummed
out about it now, don't'cha think, sir?

20
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,916
Water under the bridge, as far as I'm concerned!

21
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:57,665
We'll simply reclaim the time we
lost by having all the fun at once!

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,090
Koro-sensei's living life to the fullest,

23
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:01,629
as frantically as ever.

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,293
Still. It's February.

25
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:06,582
March is just around the corner.

26
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:08,719
We've got to face the future.

27
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:11,809
Figure out where we're going before we say goodbye.

28
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:15,965
Thirty-two days. That's all the time we have left.

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,951
Koro-sensei deadline is practically here.

30
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:55,765
Future plans, huh?

31
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:58,143
Okay, what high school you goin' to?

32
00:02:58,227 --> 00:02:59,935
I was thinkin' someplace lower level

33
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,518
so I can have a little bit of elbowroom.

34
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:04,610
Well, we've definitely got
fundamentals down through senior year.

35
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,935
High school can be about fine-tuning
what Koro-sensei's taught us.

36
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,799
That's one way to look at it, sure.

37
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:11,810
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna push myself.

38
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:15,692
"It takes a pristine academic record
to make it in Communications these days."

39
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:17,185
So I'm told, at least.

40
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:18,410
Wah-wah!

41
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:22,677
So, Karma, what're your sights set on?

42
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:23,631
Hmm...

43
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,220
I figure I'll just stay at Kunugigaoka.

44
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:30,207
You're gonna subject yourself to
the entrance exam all over again?

45
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:32,160
Wow, seems kinda low profile.

46
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:35,035
With your grades you could get into any school you want.

47
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,115
Put yourself in the shoes of the kids on Main Campus.

48
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:40,768
The guy they thought was exiled is suddenly back,

49
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,895
looming head and shoulders above 'em all.

50
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:48,244
What could be sweeter than sailing by on an ocean
of humiliated faces for three whole years, right?

51
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:50,777
That's a winning personality you've got.

52
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,845
And besides, there are tons of decent schools out there

53
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,101
if all you care about is your transcript.

54
00:03:57,518 --> 00:04:00,309
But do any of 'em boast an arch nemesis worthy of me?

55
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,273
I'm inclined to say no.

56
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:04,977
Have fun while you can.

57
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,857
Broader ambitions can come later.

58
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:10,950
What I want out of life right now
is a good academic battle, or three.

59
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:12,893
That's so you.

60
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:15,860
And? What's your high school of
choice, Nagisa? You picked one?

61
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:17,671
Mh-hm.

62
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:22,590
Just like Kayano. Sugino. Everyone.

63
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,092
It's almost time to part ways.

64
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,288
Each of us going wherever the future leads.

65
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:31,756
Believe it or not,

66
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,648
my top pick is Keisetsu University's high school.

67
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:40,297
It's crazy hard, but hands down the best shortcut
for getting into the college Mom hopes I'll go to.

68
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:43,048
After that? I don't know.

69
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:47,933
I have certain skills. There's no question of that.

70
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:52,151
Trouble is... what I'm good at
puts me out of step with others.

71
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:55,591
Seems like everyone knows where they're going but me.

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,569
Hey. Yoo-hoo!

73
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,768
How many times I gotta tell you? I'm finished!

74
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:03,018
Ha, ha. Oh, sorry about that.

75
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:05,442
Come on, snap out of it already!

76
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:09,241
You're supposed to be giving me the
academic chops to march back into school!

77
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,911
I thought the idea was to enroll this
term, not when I'm like old n' crusty!

78
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:14,810
Hey, don't worry, we'll get you there.

79
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:16,756
Just, dial it back a teensy bit.

80
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:18,148
Huh...

81
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:20,547
You're worried about your own future, aren't you?

82
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:23,057
Junior high kids sure have it rough.

83
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:25,933
I have no earthly idea what I wanna be.

84
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,434
Uh?

85
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:28,968
You have options?

86
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:32,310
Apart from the obvious choice of profession, I mean.

87
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:34,268
Your path seems pretty clear to me.

88
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,268
What've we been doing this entire time?

89
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,223
You're gonna be a teacher, silly.

90
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:40,695
A what?

91
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,229
Of course, if you're not feelin' it, I understand...

92
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:46,240
It took her saying it for me to realize.

93
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:50,070
A teacher. Someone with the power to change lives.

94
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,223
Suppose a kid gets saved by a doctor.

95
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,878
Naturally, he grows up wanting to be one.

96
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:58,960
A kid sees an assassin wielding his blade,

97
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:01,916
and from then on, it's all he can think about.

98
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:03,639
Or maybe,

99
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,746
a kid sees a teacher molding young minds.

100
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:09,368
Yeah, but...

101
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,706
Um, what is that?

102
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:14,174
Uh?

103
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:16,430
Someone's family, I guess?

104
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,977
Go! Go! Nagisa!

105
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:28,411
Go, go Nagisa! Go, go Nagisa! Woo! Yay!

106
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:32,766
Okay, then. Um, is that an actual mob of giants?

107
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:36,435
Ugh. I do not appreciate those
weirdos hogging the send-off ceremony.

108
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,885
Koro-sensei, what in the heck do you think you're doing?!

109
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,877
I'm cheering you on, of course!

110
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:44,222
You didn't suppose I'd let my prize
student's big moment slip by unnoticed!

111
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:45,550
Oh dear! Look at the time!

112
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:47,981
I've got to drop by and cheer on Kimura!

113
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:52,324
And Kanzaki! And Chiba! And Hayami! And Hara!

114
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:53,208
Uh!

115
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,387
You got this! Up, up and away!

116
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,256
I'll never be a teacher like him, that's for sure.

117
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:09,351
The last career counseling session is at
the end of February, after our entrance exams.

118
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:12,568
I've got until then to make
up my mind one way or the other.

119
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:16,174
For now, though, I'll focus on
the target right in front of me.

120
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,143
Okay, I'll just ask. What's wrong with you, Okajima?

121
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:30,310
Uh. What, with me? Nothing!

122
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:32,727
Is it because of the chocolates? Please.

123
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,977
I-I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about!

124
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,747
You're sick.

125
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,560
Uh! It's Valentine's Day!

126
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:38,876
I'm just excited is all!

127
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:41,411
And don't worry. I'm not gonna eat
any of that cheap-o crap you give out!

128
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,785
Excuse me? What is that supposed to mean?

129
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,328
What do we have here?

130
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:48,334
And who's the lucky fella you're giving these to?

131
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:50,810
What are you talking about? They're just a formality!

132
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,227
Why do you have to go there?

133
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,644
Everybody likes chocolate. They could be for anyone!

134
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:55,775
Right.

135
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,055
And by "anyone" I assume you mean this little stud muffin?

136
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:02,641
It's true, it's true...

137
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,881
Weird. Her acting chops are usually more spot on.

138
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:09,672
Not even Koro-sensei wised up to
her before it was almost too late.

139
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,412
It was that kiss.

140
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,226
Ever since Nagisa laid one on her,
the girl's been a bona fide hot mess.

141
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,490
Heh. If we bring the two of 'em together...

142
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:21,461
we can tease two love birds with one stone!

143
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:24,464
We've got a shiny new plaything!

144
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:28,562
His self-esteem isn't exactly the highest.

145
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:32,352
Poor guy can't imagine the opposite
sex wanting anything to do with him.

146
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:33,810
It's why he's avoiding you.

147
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:37,268
See, in his mind, that smooch is
something you're pissed as hell about.

148
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:38,518
That's just how he is.

149
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,727
Till you say otherwise, that's what he'll think.

150
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,060
I know, it's just...

151
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:45,743
I mean, I've played being in love dozens
of times, but this is totally different.

152
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:48,743
I have no real-life experience crushing on a classmate.

153
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:51,732
Like, what am I supposed to say
when I give the chocolates to him?

154
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,924
Ah. Want us to do some recon?

155
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:58,079
Maybe a little covert training would be in order?

156
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,477
Absolutely! Absolutely!

157
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:04,801
I'm, uh, glad you like them.

158
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:08,201
See, in this case the receiver is overjoyed.

159
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:11,137
But observe how the giver is
rather a bit on the cool side.

160
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,524
Total formality.

161
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:15,065
His "overjoyed" face is terrifying.

162
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,421
Impressive.

163
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:24,473
Your shots are just as accurate
when using chocolate ammunition.

164
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,000
Here's the rest. You've more than earned it.

165
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:29,438
Good call.

166
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,870
I respect you. Let's keep it that way.

167
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:33,983
Sure.

168
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:37,900
See? Now there's a couple that's
always on target. Gotta love that skill.

169
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,362
I can't imitate that.

170
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:41,262
I can't even tell if she meant it.

171
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:46,671
Gentlemen, I await your answers with baited breath.

172
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,435
To each of you, a love letter.

173
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:50,393
I put a lot of myself into these.

174
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:53,194
Yourself? More like an ancient curse!

175
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:54,990
She beat me to the punch.

176
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:59,276
I had Okuda cook me up a batch I planned
on leaving in Teresaka's shoe locker.

177
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:01,060
Here's your Valentine's Day cyanide!

178
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:04,102
What is wrong with you?! That's
not what chocolate is for at all!

179
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:07,891
Whoa!

180
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:10,738
All these for me? Is this for real?

181
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,478
I thought you might like to share
them with your brother and sister.

182
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:16,920
Nothing fancy, just bulk stuff from a wholesale store.

183
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,935
Took me four hours to ride there and back.

184
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:19,419
Uh.

185
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:22,231
But how'd you even...? When did you study?

186
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,495
It's not a big deal.

187
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:26,244
After all, I have days before the entrance exams.

188
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:28,893
I'm going to state school.

189
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:30,931
That makes you and me both, doesn't it?

190
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:35,946
Guess so. Hope we can get in.

191
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:37,430
Right?

192
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:39,694
See?

193
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:42,801
Everyone has his or her distinct approach to this stuff.

194
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,893
Best policy is to say what you
have to say in your own words.

195
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:47,124
You should just be yourself.

196
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:50,452
Yeah. I guess so. Thank you, guys.

197
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,160
Only problem I see?

198
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:52,606
Hm?

199
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:55,680
Privacy.

200
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,769
With the Octo-perv on watch, there basically is none.

201
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,560
Oh, you can just leave that to me.

202
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:03,426
Kayano, I do hope you brought the you-know-what.

203
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:05,595
Uh... Oh, yeah.

204
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:09,480
Oughta put Koro-sensei on lockdown
long enough for you to get the job done.

205
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:11,056
Don't worry about him.

206
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:13,374
Concentrate on giving Nagisa those chocolates.

207
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:15,518
Right.

208
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:40,958
Where are my Valentine's chocolates? I
know I got something! Nagisa, help me look!

209
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:43,874
Some joker probably thought it'd be
funny to hide them on the mountain!

210
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:51,311
Huh?

211
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:53,432
Kayano?

212
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,359
What's wrong? Why're you so quiet?

213
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:04,275
Oh, God. My heart's beating so fast!

214
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,023
How do I do this?

215
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,415
Do I look all right? What do I say?

216
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:11,847
Uh, hey, Nagisa.

217
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,159
Where're you headed after graduation?

218
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:18,143
Honestly, I know the career path I wanna follow,

219
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,873
I'm just not real sure that
it's something I'm cut out for.

220
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,114
He wants to be a teacher.

221
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,443
It's obvious he looks up to Koro-sensei.

222
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,629
Not for the reasons most of us do,

223
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:33,379
but because Koro-sensei has a knack
for bringing out the best in people.

224
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:37,056
When Nagisa talks to him at the end
of the month about a future career,

225
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,935
he'll ask about education.

226
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:39,489
Huh?

227
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:43,071
What's Koro-sensei doing up there?

228
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,829
He's fixated, whatever it is.

229
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:54,536
Of course he's out of range.

230
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:57,984
Why would I think he'd leave himself so open to attack?

231
00:12:58,643 --> 00:12:59,256
Oh.

232
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:03,815
That look. I love it when he stares dead ahead like that.

233
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,651
He's so intense.

234
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:10,251
Not that long ago, revenge was my whole life.

235
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:12,685
I should've been crushed when my plan failed,

236
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:13,529
but I wasn't

237
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:16,243
because it was Nagisa who stopped me.

238
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:19,015
He's the kindest soul I've ever known.

239
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:20,571
Sure, he's an assassin,

240
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,756
but his bloodlust filled the hole in my heart.

241
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,357
What do I say to that face?

242
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,399
What words do I use?

243
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:33,131
Nagisa.

244
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,079
As a thank you.

245
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:39,814
These chocolates are yours. For always being by my side.

246
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:41,729
Here.

247
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,302
Are you sure?

248
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:43,858
Yep!

249
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:45,185
Okay, then.

250
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,660
Mission accomplished. Job well done.

251
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,768
Move along. See you tomorrow, okay?

252
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,603
Hope you get in the school you're aiming for!

253
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:52,050
Yeah, thanks.

254
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:56,253
There he goes. Staring dead ahead.

255
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,811
It's not right for me to get
in his way, he needs to focus.

256
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,696
But I can thank him without complicating things.

257
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,772
I'll use the sharpest blade in my repertoire.

258
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,806
My acting ability.

259
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:17,514
Imagine being able to cast your feelings
aside at the moment of truth like that.

260
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:21,263
Wow, there's no question she's Miss Yukimura's sister.

261
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:23,997
No kidding, right? So noble.

262
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,509
Well damn, now I feel guilty
thinking about trying to steal from her.

263
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:29,748
Come again?

264
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:33,004
Uh, never mind. I didn't say anything. So, yeah.

265
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:33,529
Hm?

266
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:36,555
What exactly has Koro-sensei so enthralled?

267
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:41,381
Ah. I had Kayano leave a note and
some chocolates somewhere obvious,

268
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:43,460
with a special photo of course.

269
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:44,628
You dog.

270
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:48,751
If I'd known it was gonna work this
well, I'd have used as bait long before now.

271
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,640
A four-star Valentine's Day dinner?

272
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:57,301
What's in it for you?

273
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:02,138
I'm told you menfolk tend to give
back three times as much on White Day.

274
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:04,477
Seems like an honorable tradition to me.

275
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,672
Of course, I can't imagine how
you could possibly measure up.

276
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:11,006
Ah... We'll see, won't we?

277
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:11,831
I'm out.

278
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:14,743
Don't be like that! At least stay through the meal!

279
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:17,268
That wasn't meant as a jab at your manhood, I swear!

280
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:19,493
You don't know what I went through to get reservations!

281
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,090
I'm surprised a place like this would
let someone like you cross the threshold.

282
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:26,102
Here, from Hinano.

283
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:28,342
She asked if I'd mind passing it on.

284
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:30,748
You're at school so seldom these days.

285
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:34,268
When I see an opening, that man is mine!

286
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:35,324
Poor girl.

287
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,209
She seems to have gotten it in
her head that we're a thing now.

288
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,030
Hm. Bet the boys are brokenhearted.

289
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:45,670
I got a veritable boatload of chocolates, even for me.

290
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:49,253
I'm sure a few kids thought it
might be their last Valentine's Day.

291
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:51,247
Can't blame 'em for going overboard.

292
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:54,377
So, what's goin' on in your world lately?

293
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,648
How's the "big plan?"?

294
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:02,950
The kids think if they can keep the Octopus
from blowing up, everything'll work out.

295
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,810
Of course, we know better, don't we?

296
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,980
That's why we're in a private room at a place she trusts.

297
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,353
I should've known.

298
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,848
Maybe.

299
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,542
I have been meaning to talk to you, actually.

300
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,952
I've been relegated to providing
E-Class with proprietary guidance,

301
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:21,477
so I'm kept out of the loop.

302
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,759
They'll likely only brief me at the 11th hour.

303
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:27,110
But... something is in the works.

304
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:30,643
The government is moving forward
with a secret assassination project.

305
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:31,648
There's no doubt.

306
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:37,083
Seeing it again like this, I'm stunned.

307
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:39,006
But do you think it can eliminate him?

308
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:41,660
You may take my word for it, gentlemen.

309
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,941
The question with this weapon isn't whether it is capable,

310
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:48,706
but rather how efficiently and smoothly it can do the job.

311
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:54,799
A first-rate mind and a first-rate figure!

312
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:02,658
I must say, seeing one of my teachers
so enamored with a questionable photograph

313
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:05,077
does not strictly inspire confidence.

314
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:07,425
Mr. Principal, sir, wherever did you come from?

315
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,721
I find your work ethic wanting.

316
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,049
There will be a corresponding pay cut.

317
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,477
I beg your mercy!

318
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:16,036
Miss Yukimura, I believe.

319
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,158
It's a pity we lost such talent.

320
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,574
Her passion for teaching was matched only by her vitality.

321
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:25,664
Given a few more years,

322
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:28,018
she would've become an outstanding educator.

323
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:29,009
Indeed.

324
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,352
Oh, by the way,

325
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:33,904
I understand there's an excellent
chance of your life being spared.

326
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:37,352
If you do survive this, would you indulge me?

327
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:40,156
I want you to continue teaching E-Class next year.

328
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:46,306
Truthfully, I find your fixed expression and singular
anatomy to be rather, well, suited to the position.

329
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:48,689
I'm flattered, sir.

330
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,727
You judge fellow educators purely on aptitude,

331
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,846
unmoved by sentiment or the shadow of their past.

332
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:58,661
To be offered a job by such a man
is the best mark one could hope for.

333
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,626
Alas, I decided it's best for this
year to be my last at the blackboard.

334
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,027
What will you do?

335
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,248
Anyone's guess, really.

336
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:10,393
I have a mind to circumnavigate the globe in a sailboat.

337
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:15,852
May I just say how delightful it's been
having you as an archrival through all this.

338
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,689
Your dedication is nothing short of inspiring.

339
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:22,009
The feeling is mutual.

340
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,602
I don't suppose you're open to bribery?

341
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:25,030
Uh?

342
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:27,476
In the grand design,

343
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,722
I rule this institution from on high

344
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:34,149
while the Miss Yukimuras of
the world support it from below.

345
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,974
The perfect expression of my educational philosophy.

346
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,769
What's that boy of yours up to these days?

347
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:41,238
Ah.

348
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,406
Arranging the pecking order for high school, I suspect.

349
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:48,317
He'll have the whole system under
his thumb by the end of freshman year.

350
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:51,368
A truly remarkable young man.

351
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,440
Well, we're not quite there yet.

352
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:55,498
He still has a few lessons to learn.

353
00:18:57,977 --> 00:18:59,278
Can I be honest with you?

354
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:02,967
I'm not so sure it'd be such a bad
thing if the world were destroyed.

355
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:04,818
For the kids, anyway.

356
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:08,685
They'll never get over it if they can't kill him.

357
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:11,443
They'll be haunted by that
failure the rest of their lives.

358
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:16,465
And they'd resent having their thunder stolen
by some big shot, government-sponsored mercenary,

359
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,518
or whatever the Powers That Be are cooking up.

360
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:19,547
But think about it.

361
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,143
Imagine those kids watching their teacher die,

362
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,260
the Octopus writhing in agony at
the hands of one of their classmates.

363
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:29,907
They're screwed either way.

364
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,323
The trauma will follow them to the grave.

365
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:36,429
However this turns out, we're talking years of therapy.

366
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:42,351
Being part of something like this just
twists you in a way you can never undo. Ever.

367
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:44,853
Irina.

368
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:45,416
Uh?

369
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:49,889
Once this business is said and done, you should quit.

370
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,962
You're just not built for it.

371
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:54,679
Excuse me?

372
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:57,691
Can't you see? Your feelings run too deep.

373
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:00,074
Over the past year they've taken the wheel.

374
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:02,799
If you're this worried about your students being affected,

375
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,380
what might another job down the road put you through?

376
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,390
Sure. You can dismiss the life
I've made for myself. Why not?

377
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:16,186
It's easy to pass judgment from the nosebleed section.

378
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:18,727
But here on the ground, I'm a killer.

379
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,243
There's no going back from that.

380
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:24,338
No place in the sun waiting for me
to shed the past and reinvent myself.

381
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:28,398
Everything we experience is a
tool for clearing one's path.

382
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,138
That's the most important thing I've learned on this job.

383
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,068
What those kids taught me.

384
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,341
I understand your concern,

385
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:38,662
but they have resilience down to an art form.

386
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:41,213
Whatever they face, however horrible,

387
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:43,445
they know how to let it nourish them.

388
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:47,279
Irina, why don't you come work for us?

389
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:47,758
Huh?

390
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:51,683
You have skill, an impressive
range of professional experience.

391
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:55,608
As far as we're concerned, your past is just that.

392
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,133
With us, you'll save more people than you've killed.

393
00:20:58,526 --> 00:20:59,946
And if you want, every morning,

394
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,258
you can pray for your victims at the shrine.

395
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:04,229
Something to consider.

396
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:07,018
What do you mean a shrine?

397
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:09,702
You are aware that I identify as Christian, right?

398
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,023
And why stay where I hardly know anyone?

399
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:14,581
I don't think you understand.

400
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:18,084
There's no church anywhere near my house, sorry.

401
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:20,518
Uhhh...

402
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:25,143
What?!

403
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:26,014
Wait a minute!

404
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,896
Are you saying what I think you're saying?!

405
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:28,651
Probably.

406
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,520
Wah! A man and a woman can't live together out of wedlock!

407
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:33,935
What will people think?!

408
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:35,018
Suit yourself, then.

409
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:35,643
Ah!

410
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,328
No! It's fine!

411
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,107
It's the 21st century! It's a different world!

412
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:41,315
Wait for me!
