1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:02,832
Okey-dokey, boys and girls!

2
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:05,883
The Second Term midterms are only two weeks away!

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:08,321
The time has come to surpass A-Class!

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,084
I want us going into this red-hot!

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,275
Hotter than Hades! Hotter than the sun!

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,383
That's too hot!

7
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:15,983
Ever since we sidestepped Asano's little trap

8
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,816
at the sports festival, E-Class had been hunkering down

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:19,935
for the midterms.

10
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,951
We were stoked.

11
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:25,178
But at the same time, the atmosphere was uneasy.

12
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:29,738
Only five months left until the assassination deadline.

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,424
The clock was ticking. We were impatient.

14
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,149
Payback time!

15
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:13,948
What a rush!

16
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,076
Yeah!

17
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:18,213
Wha'd I tell ya?

18
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:19,993
Coolest shortcut ever!

19
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,168
Yeah it is!

20
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:24,858
Guys! Wait up!

21
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:25,983
Hey! Not outside of class!

22
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,786
Relax! It's fine!

23
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:29,599
After the pole-toppling match?

24
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,085
People'd be suspicious if we didn't do this!

25
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:33,699
This is incredible!

26
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:35,883
We should always take this route!

27
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,547
Hm? Uh!

28
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,978
What was that noise? Y' all right?

29
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,387
Oh my word! I'll call for help!

30
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:07,617
It seems the gentleman has a
hairline fracture of the right femur.

31
00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:11,167
Doctor says he should be on
his feet in about a week or so.

32
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:14,694
What complicates this is that you kids are a state secret.

33
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,483
He'll likely settle out of court,

34
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,866
but my men have to negotiate a gag order.

35
00:03:20,108 --> 00:03:21,337
I can't believe we...

36
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,146
Koro-sensei...

37
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:33,733
It... It wasn't our fault. The street was too narrow.

38
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:37,045
Yeah, and who'd think an old man'd be
ridin' his bike through there, y'know?

39
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,411
Exactly.

40
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:41,867
I mean, what we did was reckless and everything, sure.

41
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,632
But we were doing it to, like,
sharpen our skills and whatnot.

42
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,124
We gotta unwind. We're under a lot of pressure.

43
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,771
Savin' the world's a big deal...

44
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,862
Will that be reported as my
bringing harm to some of the students?

45
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,015
I'll overlook it this once.

46
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:06,417
I knew the risk when I introduced
a higher level of training.

47
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:09,024
I take full responsibility.

48
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:11,541
You clearly weren't ready. This is on me.

49
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:18,733
Sir, we're...

50
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:19,748
Sorry.

51
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,774
Sorry.

52
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,349
Perhaps you've grown too strong for your own good.

53
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:28,804
You were drunk on power.

54
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:32,944
You neglected to put yourselves
in the shoes of someone weaker.

55
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:37,227
That makes you no different than
your counterparts on the main campus.

56
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,928
It stung to be called out like that,

57
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:42,733
but what could we say in our defense?

58
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,204
We screwed up. It's the least we deserved.

59
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:54,253
We are now exactly two weeks away from midterms.

60
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:57,455
Consider yourselves prohibited from studying for them.

61
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,934
This isn't a punishment.

62
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:03,404
There are simply other, more
important things to study first.

63
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:06,590
I ought to have included them in the syllabus earlier.

64
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,801
Please, accept the offer, Mr. Matsukata.

65
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:11,499
No!

66
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,472
For all intents and purposes,

67
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:15,473
I'll be bedridden for upwards of two weeks!

68
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,441
After what they pulled? Standard restitution won't fly!

69
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:20,566
Oh, no! I'll need something special.

70
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:22,892
Something with a bit of groveling involved, I think...

71
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,066
What the hell? What just happened?

72
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:29,979
Am I losing my damn mind or did this
room just become a florist's all of a sudden?

73
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:33,802
Please accept my sincerest apologies!

74
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,483
I can't tell you how contrite I am, good sir!

75
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:40,108
My would-be assassins and I
have caused you a world of trouble!

76
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,579
I beg your forgiveness!

77
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,170
Attention, children. I have news.

78
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm afraid that Principal Matsukata has been
hurt, and we won't be seeing him for a little while.

79
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,043
Aww...

80
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,233
Now, now. Don't worry, he's fine.

81
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:06,108
And until he's back, these young men
and women will here to lend us hand.

82
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,139
Isn't that nice?

83
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,562
Yay!

84
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:10,698
Hmph.

85
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:13,812
Seriously?

86
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,108
Are you a witch?

87
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,548
Why do I have to watch these freakin'
zygotes for something I didn't even do?

88
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:20,056
Worst job ever.

89
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,216
You're being eaten.

90
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:24,633
Hey, we're a team. We all got a sticky slap.

91
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:28,983
He said for even one of us to learn their
lesson, the whole class has to be on board.

92
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:30,316
I'm sorry, guys.

93
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,066
Aw, it's all right. We got ourselves into this.

94
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:35,780
We should've had the sense to know someone could get hurt.

95
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,274
Yeah, whatever.

96
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,570
As long as I get to appoint myself supervisor.

97
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,668
Though with you clowns,

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,629
it's more appropriate to call me ringmaster.

99
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:43,440
Hey!

100
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:47,078
Huh. I propose we can stealth study for midterms at home.

101
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,423
And thank our lucky stars we got off so light.

102
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:52,830
Two weeks unpaid work?

103
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,983
Small price to pay for the old man's silence.

104
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,073
We should be grateful.

105
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,820
Takebayashi.

106
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:01,608
I can't take you seriously when you're being pantsed

107
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:02,858
by six-year-olds.

108
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,747
Some of these kids are kinda hyper.

109
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:09,061
So, what do you insects plan on doing for us now?

110
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:12,066
You descend on our habitat like a swarm of locusts.

111
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:16,919
I figure the least you can do is work off
some the oxygen you're sucking up, you losers.

112
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,716
And some of them are just plain terrifying.

113
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,718
Uh-oh. Sis Sakura is in a bad mood again.

114
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:23,872
Yeah.

115
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:26,208
These guys aren't gonna get massacred.

116
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,399
You think they know she's been here for five years?

117
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:29,941
Or that she she's spent the past two of 'em

118
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:31,443
rebelling against "The Man"?

119
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:34,191
They don't call Sis Sakura the Elite Neet for nothin'.

120
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:36,108
Isn't she way too old for this place?

121
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,014
I don't know, dude. Don't judge.

122
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,492
Maybe she just really likes it here.

123
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,316
The real question is whether you
troglodytes have it in you to work.

124
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,344
How 'bout an endurance test?

125
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:45,300
Hang on. Wait.

126
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,770
Be careful.

127
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,939
That section of the floor is all wonky.

128
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:53,069
You're getting it fixed, right? The building.

129
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,762
I mean, it does seem to be getting sorta rickety.

130
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:57,502
If only we had the funds.

131
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:02,316
Our principal has a soft spot for children
stuck on the waiting list for primary school.

132
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,294
Takes them in at rock bottom rates.

133
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:07,543
He can barely afford the faculty he has.

134
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,698
Poor man works himself to the bone.

135
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,696
All 28 of us are here for two weeks.

136
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,737
I bet we could do a few things.

137
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,716
Yeah, a whole lotta things.

138
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,416
That's the spirit.

139
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:23,094
All right then, gang. Let's divvy up the workload.

140
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:25,155
First, a strategy meeting.

141
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,166
Yeah!

142
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,583
Please, Sir Karma, you must stop!

143
00:08:33,608 --> 00:08:35,733
I implore you not to hurt anyone else!

144
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,233
Forgive me, Princess.

145
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:39,346
Honor compels me to run the creature down.

146
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:42,126
As long as he lives there can
be no peace in the realm. Ha!

147
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,191
Quit going off book, damn it!

148
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,543
The script says no physical contact.

149
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:49,252
You were gonna smack me around either way, weren't ya?

150
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,988
Oh, wow. The fight choreography is good.

151
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:56,259
No kidding! And the girl's acting
really draw me into the story.

152
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,513
Knock it off!

153
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,166
To your rest!

154
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,441
Suddenly, the mage's magical chloroform

155
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,483
put the beast to sleep, unharmed.

156
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:08,116
And, thanks to chemistry, they
all lived happily ever after.

157
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,624
Sneaky!

158
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,399
That's our show, boys and girls!

159
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:13,675
What did you think?

160
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,024
Kayano's fantastic with kids.

161
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:16,678
Yeah.

162
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,197
Girl's got a real gift for reading the room.

163
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,733
Plus, she's their size.

164
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:23,238
So, what're we doing with all this stuff again?

165
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,158
Oh, you'll see. Chiba and Ritsu have blueprints.

166
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,651
Cool. Leave the decorating to me.

167
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:30,272
And drop.

168
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,691
That's awesome!

169
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:32,616
Do you wanna try?

170
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:33,899
Heck yeah!

171
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:35,691
Aw, she's so adorable!

172
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:38,081
Uh-oh. Is the poor kitty cat lost?

173
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,988
You kids are wonderful.

174
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:41,941
Who'd have thought these children would ever be tutored

175
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:44,649
by students from a prestigious junior high school.

176
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,191
Don't expect much, ma'am.

177
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:49,959
Kunugigaoka might be great, but our
class is definitely bottom of the barrel.

178
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:56,165
Sharp as she is, Sakura's falling behind.

179
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,358
Till she moves on to primary school,

180
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,813
the girl's basically just spinning her wheels.

181
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:03,006
'Kay, let's see.

182
00:10:03,356 --> 00:10:07,280
How do I explain these equations in
a way someone her age can understand?

183
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,433
Man, this whole teaching thing's harder than it looks.

184
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,183
Oh come on! I don't have all day!

185
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:17,250
At this rate I'll be middle-aged
before Tokyo University accepts me!

186
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:18,664
Hey, this takes time.

187
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,398
So, uh...

188
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:24,316
Why'd you drop out of primary school?

189
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,633
If you don't mind me asking.

190
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:26,355
Huh?

191
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:29,647
Why do you think, genius? Bullying!

192
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,327
They treated me like poop.

193
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:34,936
It doesn't make sense.

194
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:37,816
You'd think kids that age would be sweet and innocent,

195
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,194
eyes filled with wonder.

196
00:10:39,283 --> 00:10:41,537
Yeah, well the second they learn how strong they are,

197
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:44,374
all they care about is picking
on the ones half their size.

198
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,479
That was a little on the nose.

199
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:48,990
I know what you're gonna say, so don't bother.

200
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:54,155
"It gets better. Stick it out, otherwise the bullies win."

201
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:58,159
That's the same line my parents feed me.

202
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,297
Whatever.

203
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:02,816
I mean look who I'm talking to.

204
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,374
You're weaker than I am. You know how it is.

205
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:08,566
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!

206
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:09,034
Uh?

207
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:12,236
Oh dear.

208
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:15,008
I don't think she knows how to get down.

209
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,799
Poor widdle thing probably doesn't
have that much tree-climbing experience.

210
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,768
Ya see what I mean?

211
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,510
The higher you go, the more dangerous it is.

212
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,799
That's what courage gets you.

213
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:30,295
Thanks, but this gal prefers to keep
her feet planted firmly on the ground.

214
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,108
Great, now we're dealing with a cat in a tree.

215
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:36,095
I'll handle it.

216
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,441
C'mon, man. Like we did in pole-toppling.

217
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:40,560
Sure, yeah!

218
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,626
I'm on catapult duty! Ha!

219
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:44,636
Look at it this way.

220
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:48,751
Let's pretend the tree is primary school, right?

221
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,138
Where we're standing is, well, this place.

222
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,244
We all start here, essentially.

223
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,301
And it's where our strength comes from.

224
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:03,284
Whoa!

225
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:06,971
We were looked down on, but we never stopped looking up.

226
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,830
Even when the height made us feel dizzy or insignificant,

227
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,585
or scared the crap out of us.

228
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,649
We learned how to climb by taking it one rung at a time.

229
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,164
Who's a good, kitty? Ow, my eye!

230
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:19,442
We reached the top,

231
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:22,932
but along the way we forgot what
it meant to be scared of heights.

232
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:25,727
So every now and then we lost our grip.

233
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:28,562
Learn to climb.

234
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,116
Start from where you are now. Formulate a game plan.

235
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,871
When you're ready, go for it.

236
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,188
That's my advice.

237
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,487
A trade secret from one late bloomer to another.

238
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:40,886
Nagisa.

239
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:49,109
We learned a lot in those two weeks.

240
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,143
And not the sort of stuff they cover in school.

241
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,844
At least not when you're a student.

242
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,876
Before we knew it, time had flown by.

243
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:02,290
Again, sir,

244
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,791
I can't thank you enough for letting us do this.

245
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:06,319
We greatly appreciate it.

246
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,024
Anything to help young people
become more well-rounded, I suppose.

247
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:13,446
How could a fellow educator say no to that?

248
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:17,233
Well, anyway, let's hope that ramshackle lean-to

249
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:19,396
hasn't collapsed under the additional weight.

250
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,445
Hm? Uh?!

251
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:23,129
Before!

252
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:25,537
After!

253
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:29,913
What in god's name have you done to my school?!

254
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:33,358
The wood you see here comes care
of the lush mountain forest in which

255
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,587
E-Class's own facility sits.

256
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:39,718
This was once a cramped and
oh-so humble preschool building.

257
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,533
But what have we here?

258
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:48,315
An elegant and open, multipurpose space.

259
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,192
How in the...? They did this in only two weeks?

260
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,037
Virtual mock-ups guaranteed a sturdy design.

261
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,550
Robust pillars now firmly buttress
the dilapidated main building.

262
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,498
We were inspired by world
architecture and the Golden Ratio.

263
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:09,160
The second floor is divided into
two beautifully functional rooms.

264
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:12,737
One a library, where the children can read in comfort.

265
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,343
To be honest, it's a very simple design.

266
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:16,853
We could only do so much.

267
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,316
But the shelves are packed.

268
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,733
We all scoured the neighborhood for secondhand books.

269
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:22,152
I donated, too!

270
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:26,941
Adjacent to the library is a posh indoor playground.

271
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:31,399
Careful placement of foam mats
and durable netting ensure safety.

272
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:33,524
And, protected by a weather-treated roof,

273
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:36,826
the equipment won't erode from exposure to the elements.

274
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,201
I don't believe it.

275
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,733
Here. Come take a look at the garage.

276
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:43,611
We have a garage now?

277
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:47,514
Goodness gracious!

278
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:51,641
Our illustrious tech squad has completely
remodeled the principal's bicycle,

279
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,051
whose front wheel got banged up in the accident.

280
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:56,957
Once an ordinary conveyance, it's now an ultra-safe,

281
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:59,228
high-load bearing electric three-wheeler.

282
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,980
The rotating jungle gym is linked to the battery charger.

283
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:08,018
Meaning that the bicycle runs primarily on the
kinetic energy produced by the children during recess.

284
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:13,682
Meaning also, the more the children play, the more they
help their beloved principal get from point A to point B.

285
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:15,072
Hooray for science.

286
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,017
This is too perfect!

287
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,999
You kids have gone above and beyond!

288
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:20,899
It's actually a little creepy.

289
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:25,899
Repurposed for use with a handlebar bell, the
principal's old dentures add a touch of nostalgia.

290
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,650
That's entirely too much attention to detail!

291
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:29,762
Damn it, look.

292
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,488
You can spruce up and spit-shine all you want,

293
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,391
but what my kids need are mentors
who can speak to their experience.

294
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,524
If you haven't gotten through to them,

295
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:40,672
this was all just a whitewash.

296
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,421
Hey, Nagisa!

297
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,678
Ta-da! I came in second!

298
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,483
Wow! That's fantastic! Great job, Sakura!

299
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,609
The trick you told me to do really worked!

300
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:55,045
I snuck in for the math portion of the test like a ninja.

301
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:57,435
I finished. I left. Poof.

302
00:15:58,108 --> 00:15:59,295
Pretty cool, huh?

303
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,066
The bullies were too busy with
their own exams to mess with you.

304
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:02,655
Mm.

305
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,458
I caught them by surprise.

306
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,065
The teacher was the only person who knew I was coming.

307
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,999
We call that getting the drop on your opponent.

308
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:13,158
It's how we do things in E-Class,
and it's done wonders for us.

309
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:16,917
Unveil your best attack before
the enemy even gets into position.

310
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,817
I'm so proud of you. Keep on
using those hit-and-run tactics.

311
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:23,691
When you're ready for primary
school, you'll have a full arsenal.

312
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:25,109
Um, so...

313
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:25,825
Uh?

314
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:29,915
You'll, uh, teach me some more tricks, then?

315
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:31,686
Absolutely!

316
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,316
That is one scary dude.

317
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,733
He's terrifying because he has
no idea how terrifying he is.

318
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,638
You little ratfinks.

319
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,342
You've left me no room to complain, damn it.

320
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:47,726
Oh! Welcome back, principal. Look at this.

321
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:52,493
Suppose it's time to run along back class now.

322
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:56,164
I believe there's some important work ahead of you.

323
00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:57,404
Yes, sir!

324
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,454
See you later!

325
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:08,748
And with that,

326
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:11,435
our very special lesson was at an end.

327
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:12,683
Still, though...

328
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:17,227
The midterms were the very next day.

329
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:20,690
It was a disaster.

330
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:24,846
The majority of E-Class got booted out of the top spots.

331
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:33,029
What a total letdown.

332
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:36,612
Oh well. Guess that first time was just a fluke, huh?

333
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:40,060
We didn't even need to crush you at pole-toppling.

334
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:44,828
Aw, what's the matter, dorks? Kitty cat got your tongue?

335
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,576
Grades are the end-all be-all of this institution.

336
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,066
The bottom feeders have no
right to address the top echelon.

337
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:52,137
No kidding?

338
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:56,007
Then by that logic I guess you got nothin' to say to me.

339
00:17:57,066 --> 00:18:01,877
Despite being forbidden to study, one student
remained undaunted by the two-week handicap.

340
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:06,898
Of course, substantial traces of prep work were
clear when I popped by the day of Summer Festival.

341
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:09,854
One can't help but admire the young man's initiative.

342
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:12,666
I shouldn't get cocky.

343
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,941
Teach'll probably be all like,

344
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:16,544
"Nah, it doesn't count 'less you come in first."

345
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:18,354
Whoa, Karma.

346
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:20,705
Don't you people get it?

347
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:23,732
I'm the only one here you gave
it his all this time around.

348
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:27,452
Everybody else was pulling their
punches to give you idiots a fair shot.

349
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,733
See, they were bein' nice 'cause we knew
losing would be worse for you than for us.

350
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:32,926
Excuse me?

351
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,073
So, yeah. This was a freebie and you only get one.

352
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:38,535
C'mon, guys.

353
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:46,853
Ha. Thank you, Karma. You just covered for us.

354
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:53,487
We're sorry for the trouble, Mr. Karasuma.

355
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,092
It won't happen again.

356
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:57,873
No harm, no foul. All in a day's work.

357
00:18:58,566 --> 00:18:59,649
Did you learn your lesson?

358
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:03,299
Did you kids take anything away from this experience?

359
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:04,277
Uh?

360
00:19:05,621 --> 00:19:08,934
That we're not in this just for
the money or to bump up our grades.

361
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,007
We're in this to get stronger,

362
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,247
and to use that strength for the greater good.

363
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,586
To help people.

364
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:18,386
Knowing how to kill gives us the power to save the world.

365
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:22,074
Intelligence gives us the power to change someone's life.

366
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:25,029
And we learned not to be reckless with our strength.

367
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,515
From this point forward, we'll be careful.

368
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,348
Failure and frustration can be wellsprings for growth.

369
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:39,814
Something tells me my boys and girls
will be richer for this experience.

370
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:43,277
From here on out, they'll apply
themselves more thoughtfully.

371
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,057
Now then,

372
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:47,840
time for some BBQ with the foie gras

373
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:49,896
I purchased at a French farmer's market.

374
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:52,372
Glad I could keep this feast on the DL.

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,498
Wh-Where the blazes did you come from?

376
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:05,684
Whoa. That was a serious drop and I barely felt a thing.

377
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,708
Uh? Wh-What's going on?

378
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,149
I scarcely had time to breathe!

379
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:16,459
Sorry, sir. We wanted you to see this.

380
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,233
Brand new equipment from your pal, the government.

381
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:23,991
I told them not to tip their
hand, but they couldn't resist.

382
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:28,988
They felt it was important that you
see for yourself how discreet they can be.

383
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:32,713
Ooh.

384
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,811
Whatever you teach us, we'll use it to kill you.

385
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:38,250
That's how Assassination Classroom works.

386
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:40,586
But don't worry, sir, you have our word.

387
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,684
We'll use what you teach us for good.

388
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:46,188
See, as far as we're concerned,
our strength is for protecting people.

389
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:48,786
Full marks for that answer.

390
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:55,149
When first I came to this class,
what bloodlust I found was aimless,

391
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,748
and even then only a handful of you possessed it.

392
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,524
There was negligible danger of being assassinated,

393
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,380
but the atmosphere was stagnant.

394
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:03,977
Now however,

395
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:07,686
the whole campus is alive with
razor-sharp killer instinct.

396
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:14,193
I bet one of these days you'll
meet someone just as important to you.

397
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,270
Indeed.

398
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:21,828
At the moment, I seem to be surrounded by several.
