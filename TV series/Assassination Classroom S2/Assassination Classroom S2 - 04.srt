1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,333
Itona's tried to kill Koro-sensei a total of three times.

2
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:06,692
It took some convincing,

3
00:00:06,788 --> 00:00:09,019
but in the end he finally joined our class.

4
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:12,309
And so, about a week later...

5
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,431
Well that just about does it, boys and girls.

6
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:16,606
See you tomorrow.

7
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:21,914
Payday today, at long last, so I'll be treating
myself to some mouthwatering Shanghai crab.

8
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:23,979
Yi, er, san, GO!

9
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:26,248
You could treat us to some.

10
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:30,998
Is it me or has our workload gotten
crazy hard now that it's second term?

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,873
Yeah, well you can't exactly blame
Koro-sensei for trying to get our grades up.

12
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:35,801
Guess not.

13
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:38,462
It's just that it's been
forever since I picked up a chick.

14
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:47,496
Hey, Itona. Are you stickin' around?

15
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:49,672
What'cha working on there?

16
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,340
What's it look like I'm doing?

17
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:53,665
I'm building a remote-control tank.

18
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:54,502
How come?

19
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:59,081
The Octopus. He made me cram all day yesterday.

20
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,270
Stressed me out.

21
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:05,275
Focus on the material, please. Next question.

22
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:09,376
I'm pissed. So I'm gonna use this to kill him.

23
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:13,341
It's like the idiot said. What's his name? Terasaka.

24
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:16,734
If I fail a hundred times, so be it. Who cares?

25
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:18,855
Only gotta kill the task master once.

26
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:20,531
Good way of lookin' at it.

27
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:24,463
Wow, this stuff, it's, like, stupid high tech.

28
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:02,201
I mean, is it even for real?

29
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:04,823
Kudos.

30
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:07,602
This puppy's using modified camera phone parts.

31
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,009
Wow, Itona.

32
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:11,519
You came up with all these tweaks yourself?

33
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,497
It's not really a big deal.

34
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,341
I picked up electronics workin' for my old man.

35
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,620
Anybody could do this stuff. Except Terasaka.

36
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:21,990
What a change.

37
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,547
Compared to how he was when he had tentacles, I mean.

38
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,502
Still has a sharp tongue, though.

39
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:57,561
Wow.

40
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,937
Are you kidding me?

41
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,640
That thing barely even makes a sound.

42
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,348
When it moves or when it shoots.

43
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,515
I used electrical parts instead of gears.

44
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:07,458
Noise cancellation is paramount.

45
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:10,477
The camera feed is linked to the controller.

46
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:12,933
I've got it lined up with the sights on the main gun.

47
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,969
Wow. Cloak and dagger!

48
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,953
Okay, suppose you could sneak up on him.

49
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,248
Where're you gonna aim?

50
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,352
Where else? That's right.

51
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,890
I'll let you guys in on a little secret, you see.

52
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:25,270
Koro-sensei has a single weak spot.

53
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,193
This is news to me.

54
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:28,758
His heart.

55
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:31,968
It's located directly behind that necktie.

56
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,955
If we hit it, we can take him out in one shot.

57
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:43,956
No doubt he's telling the others
about my heart this very moment.

58
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:45,554
Clever child that he is.

59
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:50,369
Assassination promises to be a good deal
more fun now that Itona's thrown into the mix.

60
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,115
I'm thinking this could work.

61
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,875
Yeah. All right.

62
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:59,390
Let's give 'er a test drive.
Get a feel for how she handles.

63
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:02,262
It is better to test it now than
watch it break when we need it.

64
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:04,995
Let's make it happen!

65
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,758
See ya later, Professor Bitch.

66
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,775
Bye! Have a good one!

67
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,970
Straight home, ladies. No detours, understood?

68
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:18,963
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:20,721
Cool. Snack run?

70
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,077
Um, yeah!

71
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:24,372
Wait. Didn't you just say...?

72
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:28,840
Do ya see anything?

73
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,890
Not a lot. Ugh, this camera totally sucks.

74
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,831
Its field of vision is way too narrow!

75
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:35,290
So? It's not the end of the world.

76
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,641
We'll fit it with a bigger one.

77
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,349
But that would increase the weight, compromise mobility.

78
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:41,829
Target acquisition would be more difficult.

79
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,261
In that case.

80
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:47,540
We'll just install a fisheye
lens on the camera we already have.

81
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:48,931
Takebayashi!

82
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,457
If we write a program

83
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,816
that can correct image distortion in the data feed,

84
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:56,725
even a relatively small lens
can give us a wide field of view.

85
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:58,012
That's good.

86
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:00,831
Right. Fisheye lens with a big viewing angle.

87
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,206
I've got it taken care of.

88
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:02,874
Ritsu.

89
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:04,368
Hello!

90
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:07,015
Can you build an image correction program for us?

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,141
Of course!

92
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:10,973
I have no idea what you're
using it for, but I'm on the job!

93
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,411
Takebayashi, you're a genius.

94
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,206
We need to be able to record.

95
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,334
Absolutely.

96
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:20,415
We'll wanna analyze the upgrades as effectively as we can.

97
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:23,007
Weren't we all just put off by an underwear thief?

98
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:25,287
In the name of assassination,

99
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,645
onward...! Uh, Prototype Zero!

100
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:36,124
I'll flip it over!

101
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:38,140
Yeah, sure. Thanks, man!

102
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:41,327
There's not much in the way of
a suspension system, apparently.

103
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:42,375
Leave it to me.

104
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:46,158
I know a thing or two about drive mechanics and metalwork.

105
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,829
Doesn't the paint job on the
chassis stand out like a sore thumb?

106
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:51,656
That's combat camouflage.

107
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:54,348
Unless we want our target
seeing the tank from a mile away,

108
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,211
we need it to blend in with the school.

109
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:57,567
I got this.

110
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:01,062
Classroom camouflage. Consider it done.

111
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:03,973
We should chart out the territory at RC scale.

112
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,932
In the name of better maneuvering...

113
00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:08,912
I'll draw us a detailed map.

114
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:10,652
They, uh,

115
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,281
really get into it when smut's on the line, huh?

116
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:15,085
It's kinda creepy.

117
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:24,335
S'up?

118
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:27,018
Transmission's ready. I finished it last night.

119
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:28,163
Oh.

120
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,918
And I made us all breakfast.

121
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:34,137
Hey. Think it'll stand out now?

122
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,966
This is great and all, guys, but, uh,

123
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:40,906
you do get that this is for an assassination plan, right?

124
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:43,671
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say, President Poverty. Sure.

125
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,548
Okay! Let's give this sucker a proper
field test before all the girls show up!

126
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:48,454
Yeah!

127
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:51,606
Funny how nobody's tardy on a day like today.

128
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,031
Ritsu won't boot up until precisely eight o'clock.

129
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,686
You see, I didn't want her to see what we were doing.

130
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,027
Oh. Yeah.

131
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:06,938
Step aside! I wanna take a shot!

132
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,620
Turns out there was no reason to
worry whether Itona would fit in with us.

133
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,678
He did better than most, actually.

134
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:16,078
Smut, killing, making stuff.

135
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,065
Talk about hitting all the right buttons.

136
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,916
All of a sudden, he was the center of attention.

137
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,277
Itona. This thing should have a codename.

138
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,867
Seems only fair it should come from you.

139
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:29,694
I'll give it some thought.

140
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:35,671
The tentacles once asked me
what kind of person I wanted to be.

141
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:38,577
I told them I wanted to be strong.

142
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,527
Soon, that was all I could think about.

143
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,554
My mind raced with images of fighting, winning.

144
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:50,941
Over time, you can spin even the
weakest material into good, strong thread.

145
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:54,811
"Itona" means "becoming thread," you know. Remember that.

146
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:57,369
How did I forget my roots?

147
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,260
It's in my name.

148
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:02,603
Aw, dammit! It crashed.

149
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:03,831
Watch what you're doin', Terasaka.

150
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:05,373
Shut up! It's not my fault...

151
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:06,664
"Becoming thread."

152
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,540
This is where I'm finally gonna live up to it.

153
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:18,015
It's a monster!

154
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,796
Pull out!

155
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,725
No, fire!

156
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:23,640
Crap! The main gun's not strong enough!

157
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,445
It's okay. We'll tweak that, too!

158
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:40,858
Well, damn. Outdone by a squirrelly little weasel.

159
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,498
Next time, we need to designate who's what.

160
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,681
Which means, first off, we need a gunner. Chiba?

161
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:48,136
Yeah. Sure.

162
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,077
It's all right. Screw-ups are a part of the process.

163
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,231
We all agree Itona One was a dud.

164
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:59,926
So, we'll just keep spinning till it's gets stronger.

165
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,040
I might fail a hundred times.

166
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:04,502
But I'll be sure to kill him
before it's all said and done.

167
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:07,259
You've got my back, right, guys?

168
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,745
'Course we do!

169
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:11,271
Nothing binds like bloodlust.

170
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,622
I think this is going to be fun!

171
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,623
Okay! Back to the drawing board, men!

172
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:19,665
We put our heads together, this
baby'll be lookin' up skirts by March!

173
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,290
When did that become the goal?

174
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,356
Uh, what's all this I hear about skirts?

175
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:26,706
Kataoka, it's not what you think!

176
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:29,456
We were talking about the kind of skirts you put on cars!

177
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Yeah, sure.

178
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:31,849
Boys suck.

179
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,599
Uh-huh. And who's big idea was this?

180
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:36,521
Itona, perhaps you'd care to tell me?

181
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:37,506
Okajima.

182
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:38,325
What?

183
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:40,652
Ah! Good morning, everybody!

184
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,623
Oh, hey, Okajima, about that program you
wanted for correcting fisheye lens distortion,

185
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,230
I finally have it ready.

186
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:50,806
Hang on. It wasn't me, all right? Tell 'em!

187
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:54,014
Tell 'em what? Don't try to pull me into this, ya perv.

188
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,623
You have got to be kidding me!

189
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:58,113
Guys, we really oughta 'fess up.

190
00:10:58,264 --> 00:10:59,681
Whether you do or don't,

191
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,807
it's clear you're all involved in this disgusting scheme!

192
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:03,675
Boys make me wanna puke!

193
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,540
What's going on in here?

194
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,903
Why don't we just call it a crime of passion.

195
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:15,072
So it's true. Boys really do only think about one thing.

196
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:18,304
Karma, I'm gonna ditch class today.

197
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,890
Where's a good spot to go?

198
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,657
Wow, so you can talk. Follow me.

199
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:25,200
Hey! Where you goin'? Hold on!

200
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,068
Apparently, Itona's a cooler customer than we thought.

201
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:39,126
Huh. So that's what "Itona" means in kanji.

202
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:41,464
Well, I think it's awesome!

203
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,331
Yeah!

204
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:44,723
"Becoming thread." Pretty cool.

205
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:48,390
It is what it is. Lots of kids
in the class have weird names.

206
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:51,839
Hang on a sec!

207
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:55,089
"Justice"? I thought your name was "Masayoshi."

208
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:00,229
Yeah, if you write it out in kanji,
but my parents insist on saying "Justice."

209
00:12:00,598 --> 00:12:02,864
Koro-sensei's just nice enough to say it my way.

210
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,348
When they called you at opening ceremonies,

211
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:06,441
I got nervous hearing them yell "Justice."

212
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,713
Yeah, no kidding.

213
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:12,289
I know. And when they do it again at closing
ceremonies, it'll be even more public humiliation.

214
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:15,293
Kimura's parents are both in law enforcement.

215
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:19,456
Apparently they're very passionate
about the fact that they're cops.

216
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,748
When I was a kid, I'd complain about having a weird name,

217
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:25,135
but mom and dad would just get all upset at me.

218
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,537
They didn't put a whole lotta
thought into the kind of hell

219
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,081
they were setting me up for
once I started going to school.

220
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:32,866
You can't expect parents to
have your best interests at heart.

221
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,878
Does a cute name like "Kirara"
go with this face? Seriously?

222
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,516
My name makes me sound like a sparkly princess.

223
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:40,509
I-I... yeah.

224
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:43,051
My mom lives in her own little fantasy world.

225
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:47,611
When the least little thing threatens to break
the illusion, she goes into full-blown hysterics.

226
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:50,912
You have any idea what it's like
growing up in a house like that?

227
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,722
Well it doesn't make living up to a
ridiculously adorable name any easier.

228
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:57,065
Getting' saddled with a weird name?

229
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,242
How do you poor bastards manage to cope?

230
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:02,095
What? Oh, c'mon.

231
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,154
What's not to love about being named Karma?

232
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:09,142
Both of my parents have pretty bizarre
taste, and I guess I inherited that from 'em.

233
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:11,619
Come to think of it,

234
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,028
I'm far from satisfied with my name.

235
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:16,729
Hang on, I thought you liked being called Koro-sensei.

236
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:18,877
Kayano gave you that name, didn't she?

237
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:21,623
It's because I like it that I'm not satisfied.

238
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:24,040
There happen to be two people in this very room

239
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:26,176
who refuse to address me accordingly.

240
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:29,345
At best, Mr. Karasuma talks to me using nothing but,

241
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:31,150
"Hey. Hey, you."

242
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:33,931
What are we, a middle-aged couple?

243
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:34,998
We're adults.

244
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,290
We don't say things like "Koro-sensei"

245
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:39,254
because it makes us sound like idiots.

246
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:41,248
Here's a thought.

247
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:43,640
We could call each other by specially chosen code names,

248
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:44,347
couldn't we?

249
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:45,617
Are you serious?

250
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:46,831
Yeah!

251
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:48,248
I mean, codenames are actually kind of appropriate

252
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:49,384
for this classroom.

253
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:51,991
The assassins we met on the island all had one, remember?

254
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,150
They used them to keep their real names a secret.

255
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:56,729
Personally, I think it made them sound

256
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,369
really polished and professional.

257
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:01,062
Yes, of course. That's an excellent idea!

258
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,770
Here's what we'll do, then.

259
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:04,463
Write down a suggested codename

260
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,790
for each of your classmates and place them in the box.

261
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,627
We'll call each other by whatever codenames I draw out.

262
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,931
Sounds like fun, but won't we
have to do separate drawings?

263
00:14:13,114 --> 00:14:15,609
I'm writing down the first thing that pops in my head.

264
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,272
Also, I should mention this.

265
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:21,556
For the rest of the day, real names are forbidden!

266
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,585
What?

267
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,806
Baseball Geek. Come in, Baseball Geek!

268
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,723
Can we confirm that the target's on the move?

269
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,873
Sorry, Lanky Artist, that'd be a negative.

270
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:36,490
Codename Da Densest is still hiding
out there somewhere in the pine trees.

271
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:40,216
President Poverty's team will come up
from the rear and chase him toward the swamp.

272
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:41,706
When he's out in the open,

273
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,370
Hot-n'-Cold Sniper will take the shot.

274
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:47,954
All right. Let's do this!

275
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:49,797
Congratulations!

276
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,173
You just let your target slip away from the scene.

277
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,265
Shape up, Womanizing Scumbag!

278
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:57,015
I told you! Always hold your gun at firing height!

279
00:14:57,098 --> 00:14:58,513
I'm not letting you get away!

280
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:02,033
Director Mushroom! Mistress Kanzaki! Fluffy Stag Beetle!

281
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:03,183
He's headed your way!

282
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:04,873
Don't worry, we've got him!

283
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:08,403
He pulled a fast one!

284
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:11,786
Home Plate! Loofah! Picture-Book Graduate!

285
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:12,607
I'm on it!

286
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,246
That's right, keep those eyes on the ground.

287
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:21,640
Nicely done, Pseudo-Takaoka.

288
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,790
Don't get comfortable!

289
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:24,986
Scoring a hit on me doesn't mean anything.

290
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:27,098
It certainly doesn't mean you can get helped!

291
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:29,696
Poison Specs! Forever Flat!

292
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:32,581
If I can see your positions, I can dodge your shots!

293
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:36,783
He spotted us. Dignified Didact, take over!

294
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:37,981
All right!

295
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:40,889
English Lass, Gender! You two get a move on!

296
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:41,891
Roger, that!

297
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:45,616
Nice shooting.

298
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,182
They didn't give away their position.

299
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,146
That has to be thanks to Dignified Didact's leadership.

300
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,831
Keep your distance back there. Wait for your chance.

301
00:15:53,962 --> 00:15:57,558
Terminal Perv and This Manga is
Amazing aren't too bad, either.

302
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:00,561
Semi-Senioritis has blocked the escape route.

303
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:04,097
It's all on you now, Dating Sim Emo Character.

304
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:15,148
Dating Sim Emo Character!

305
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,350
I told you, a sniper has to assume
his target is always on high alert!

306
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,314
I know, but the one taking you down...

307
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:24,125
is Justice!

308
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,378
How'd it go?

309
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:38,650
Using those codenames felt pretty great, huh?

310
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,599
Actually, it was kinda painful.

311
00:16:41,718 --> 00:16:43,948
"Scrunchies and Boobs"? Really?

312
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,915
Try being called "Amazing Ape" all day.

313
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:47,873
Ah, yes. Well, I see.

314
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,581
Could someone explain what "Box o' Moe" means?

315
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,567
Uh, isn't it pretty obvious?

316
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:53,903
Excuse me, sir?

317
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:57,288
My codename was just the same thing as my real one.

318
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:58,616
Correct.

319
00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:00,931
Because I knew what you'd be doing in P.E.

320
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:02,342
Given your agility,

321
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:05,146
it was all but certain you'd have a special role to play.

322
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:10,556
And considering the moves you showcased out there
this afternoon, I'd say "Justice" fits perfectly.

323
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:12,137
You bet it does!

324
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:16,348
Now, now. Rest assured, Kimura my boy.

325
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:21,040
If you don't like it, requesting a name change is
simply a matter of filling out the right paperwork.

326
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:22,347
Yeah, I guess you're right.

327
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:25,032
You should bear in mind, however.

328
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:28,248
If you wind up being the one to actually assassinate me,

329
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:31,461
I'm certain people are going to
be quite gracious about your name.

330
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,762
"Justice indeed," they'll say.

331
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:37,650
"Wow, what else do you call the
man who saved the entire world, eh?'

332
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:42,781
Honestly there's very little significance
to the names our parents give us.

333
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:45,537
We don't choose what we're called,

334
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:48,826
but we can choose what people come to associate with it.

335
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,765
Names don't make us who we are.

336
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,040
They're merely part of what we
leave behind as we walk through life.

337
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:55,516
Footprints in the sand.

338
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,407
That said, cherish them.

339
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,567
If nothing else, for their potential.

340
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,884
"Justice," for example.

341
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,595
Why not hold on to that until after the assassination?

342
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:09,889
What do you say?

343
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:10,969
Hmm...

344
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:14,703
Yeah! I think I will.

345
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:16,865
Now then!

346
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,827
Since everyone got to use their codename today,

347
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:22,094
it's only fair that I divulge my own.

348
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:25,461
From this point forward, kindly refer to me as follows:

349
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,304
"Prince of the Fateful Eternal Wind."

350
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:34,473
Why do you get to pick one that's all fancy-schmancy?

351
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:36,903
And wipe that smug look off your face!

352
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:40,165
Aw, c'mon! Just for one day, then! Please?

353
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:41,748
And for the rest of the day,

354
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:45,123
Koro-sensei was referred to by a very different name.

355
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:47,431
"The Octopus of the Idiotic Perverted Chicken!"

356
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:48,604
Octopus?!

357
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:51,543
Well, that was fun.

358
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,846
The codename thing was a blast!

359
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:56,779
Maybe he'll let us do it again sometime.

360
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:59,806
Hope so. Right, Picture-Book Graduate?

361
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,752
Shut your face, Baseball Geek.

362
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:03,872
Call the burn unit!

363
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:05,829
My codename doesn't even make sense.

364
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:07,806
Yeah! And while we're at it,

365
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:09,915
who's brilliant idea was "Forever Flat?"

366
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:11,523
Like that means anything!

367
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:14,454
So it was you.

368
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:17,467
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

369
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:23,110
Hey, I could go for a bowl of
that disgusting ramen. Let's go.

370
00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:24,297
Not cool, man.

371
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:26,869
He's fittin' in with Terasaka's group pretty well.

372
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:28,120
Sure looks like it.

373
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:30,750
And so time marched on,

374
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:34,158
all of us determined to give
Second Term everything we had.

375
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:39,776
Of course, being E-Class, it was more or less a
given that the good times wouldn't last forever.

376
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,829
Dare I ask how things are coming along?

377
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:49,848
Of course, I trust you realize any response short of

378
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:52,706
"exceptionally well" would be unacceptable for A-Class.

379
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,040
Things are going exceptionally well.

380
00:19:55,181 --> 00:19:58,306
Any student who lags behind gets left behind. Period.

381
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,298
I have no patience for slackers.

382
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:02,864
None. I rule with an iron fist.

383
00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:05,541
And when it comes to midterms, the bar has been raised.

384
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,662
That is encouraging.

385
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:13,350
However, it appears you are still the
subject of much derision among the student body.

386
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:16,281
Letting E-Class get the better of you in the First Term.

387
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,555
It's not a stain that washes out.

388
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:29,089
Let people say what they like. I'll crush them!

389
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:32,234
Will you now?

390
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:35,123
At its most basic, this institution

391
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:38,441
is divided into two groups: The weak and the strong.

392
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,286
Which group you belong to is, on
principle, of no consequence to me.

393
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:46,487
That being said,

394
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:48,881
allow me to offer you a little guidance.

395
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,804
True leadership requires an aptitude for winning.

396
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:53,439
And on top of that...

397
00:20:55,139 --> 00:21:00,290
to triumph, a leader must first consider the
where and when, and the how soon will follow.

398
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:01,931
Should a loophole present itself,

399
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:04,435
it is to be exploited mercilessly.

400
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:09,393
Good word, "aptitude."

401
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,764
Something without which you haven't a
prayer in the world of besting me, Asano.

402
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:15,831
Very well.

403
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:23,075
Then my aptitude will be on
full display, Mr. Principal, sir.
