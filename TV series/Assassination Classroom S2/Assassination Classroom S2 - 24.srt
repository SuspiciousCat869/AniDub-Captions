1
00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:03,039
From the start, we'd been protected.

2
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:07,326
Because our teacher, our larger than life mentor,

3
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:11,591
was as kind and as caring as he was strong.

4
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:22,551
Kayano.

5
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:23,926
I don't even know what to say!

6
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:25,709
Nagi... achoo!

7
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:27,299
It's cold.

8
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,416
What-what happened to my top?

9
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,109
Wh-what?

10
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:37,415
I'm so sorry.

11
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:38,217
Shut up!

12
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,279
Easy now.

13
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:42,509
Hey, at least Koro-sensei managed to fix your hair.

14
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:43,625
I know, but...

15
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:45,984
I wish he could've done something about my clothes.

16
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:46,795
So, uh,

17
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:49,519
I don't know if this is appropriate for me to ask, heh,

18
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:52,577
but is it just me or did she
come out of that a bigger cup size?

19
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:55,113
Koro-sensei. You can do that?

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,636
I am exhausted.

21
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,402
As we watched him collapse,

22
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:09,349
we couldn't shake the impression.

23
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,781
He looked spent, but happy.

24
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,395
Come now.

25
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:20,361
What kind of assassin lets a target
linger indefinitely on the brink?

26
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:23,889
Don't you understand?

27
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,956
At this point, we're just running out the clock.

28
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:30,888
I'm sorry, children.

29
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,670
All good things must come to an end.

30
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:36,640
That's life.

31
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:39,174
That's the nature of the classroom.

32
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,631
The red light from above began to swell,

33
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:48,827
indicating eloquently, cruelly, that the hour had come.

34
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:54,930
It hurt, but we didn't have a second to waste.

35
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,196
Guys.

36
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:02,024
We have to make a decision one way or the other.

37
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,873
We could stay out of it,

38
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,654
leave Koro-sensei's fate up to them.

39
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:18,938
Let's take a vote.

40
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,585
Who here doesn't want to kill him?

41
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,467
All right, thank you. Hands down.

42
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:41,590
Who wants to kill him?

43
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,538
They were a part of us.

44
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:05,114
Our guns. Our knives. Our teacher.

45
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:17,199
This is it. This is our answer.

46
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:20,805
We're assassins.

47
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:24,364
Our target is our teacher.

48
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:32,532
These were the nonnegotiable terms of our bond,

49
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:35,566
the only way to graduate with honor.

50
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,618
We knew what had to be done, and it hurt.

51
00:03:57,592 --> 00:03:59,640
You can't move if we're all pinning you down.

52
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:00,800
That right, sir?

53
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:03,634
Precisely, Nakamura my dear.

54
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:07,728
Though I can't help but feel you're
being a tad bit lax on that grip.

55
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:14,941
We didn't give much thought to why.

56
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:18,200
Just tried to focus on the task at hand.

57
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:25,150
He'd praised us, scolded us, nurtured us all year,

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,525
and here we were, holding him down,

59
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:29,949
clutching for all we were worth.

60
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,894
Your heart, it's-it's under your tie, you said?

61
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:39,102
Which one of us... is gonna...?

62
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,369
Guys... please.

63
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:57,344
Let me. I'll do it.

64
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,410
Sure, I got no beef with that.

65
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:10,731
Well, you are the head of the
class, so I suppose it makes sense.

66
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:28,742
Sir...

67
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,469
It's all right.

68
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,043
You can actually stab through the tie.

69
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,437
There's been a hole in it
since the day it was given to me.

70
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:49,725
I decided to leave it like that...

71
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:52,601
For... sentimental reasons.

72
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:59,346
Ah, before you proceed...

73
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:02,531
Let me say farewell to my fellow educators.

74
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:06,146
Miss Irina, are you sure you won't join in?

75
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:09,180
I'd hate for you to miss out on the bounty.

76
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:14,075
No, thank you. I'd really rather not.

77
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,872
Who gives a damn? It's only money.

78
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,772
What I've learned in this class is more valuable.

79
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:21,893
It isn't about me.

80
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:25,071
It's about the bond you share with these kids.

81
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:29,482
Indeed.

82
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:31,992
Mr. Karasuma.

83
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,145
I thank you.

84
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:37,942
You've had a hand in molding these
children into what they've become.

85
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:42,519
If you please, continue to guide
them on their way after I'm gone.

86
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,052
Of course.

87
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:46,721
You've given me no end of trouble over the past year.

88
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,344
But, even so, it's been a year I'll never forget.

89
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:55,150
Rest in peace. Koro-sensei.

90
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:56,954
Quite.

91
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:05,114
Okey dokey, class, it's about that time.

92
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,509
There's so much more I could say, but alas,

93
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:10,889
I'll be lucky to squeeze in what I can.

94
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:15,412
In lieu of tearful goodbyes, if you'll indulge me...

95
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,335
I'd like to call roll... one final time.

96
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,276
When you hear your name called,

97
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:25,587
please say, "here."

98
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:29,314
Look me squarely in the eye and answer in a loud voice.

99
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,428
Once we've gone through everyone,

100
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,581
you may commence with the assassination.

101
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:35,432
Wait!

102
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,960
Please tell me that you're all present and accounted for!

103
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,901
I don't want the last thing I do
to be marking one of you absent!

104
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:42,153
Get on with it!

105
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,237
Very well, then.

106
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:52,182
Karma Akabane.

107
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:53,999
Here.

108
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:01,560
Yuma Isogai.

109
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:02,966
Here.

110
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:11,023
Taiga Okajima.

111
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:12,159
Here.

112
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,547
Hinata Okano.

113
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,056
Manami Okuda.

114
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:30,773
Yes, sir! Here!

115
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,956
Meg Kataoka.

116
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:39,274
Here.

117
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,910
Kaede Kayano.

118
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:48,205
Here.

119
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:56,123
Yukiko Kanzaki.

120
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:56,887
Here.

121
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,658
Justice Kimura.

122
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:05,883
Here!

123
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,717
Hinano kurahashi.

124
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,827
Here!

125
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,542
Nagisa shiota.

126
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:24,504
Here.

127
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:32,369
My sweet, young assassins...

128
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,885
Sosuke sugaya.

129
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:39,807
Here.

130
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:46,662
As you ready yourselves...

131
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:48,657
To snuff out a life...

132
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:54,314
Tomohito Sugino.

133
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:55,403
Here.

134
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:05,302
You understand better than
anyone the value of what's lost...

135
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:10,585
Kotaro Takebayashi.

136
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:11,665
Here.

137
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,221
Ryunosuke Chiba.

138
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,318
Here.

139
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,103
Because you've studied...

140
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:33,132
Ryoma Terasaka.

141
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,293
Yo.

142
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:40,504
Fretted...

143
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:45,980
Rio Nakamura.

144
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,348
You know it.

145
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:54,910
Turned it over and over in your mind...

146
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,790
Kirara Hazama.

147
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,109
Here, sir.

148
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,696
Rinka Hayami.

149
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:10,578
Here.

150
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,092
And in the process,

151
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,991
without even realizing it,

152
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:21,311
given that life meaning.

153
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,641
Sumire hara.

154
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:27,572
Here.

155
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,897
It's been a privilege watching you grow.

156
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:40,537
Yuzuki Fuwa.

157
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:41,619
Here!

158
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:48,276
But the best part...

159
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:51,016
Was growing right alongside you.

160
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:57,198
Hiroto Maehara.

161
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:06,334
Koki Mimura.

162
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:07,328
Here.

163
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,025
So please...

164
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:19,771
Takuya Muramatsu.

165
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:20,596
Yeah.

166
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:26,944
In this moment...

167
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:32,736
Toka yada.

168
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:34,705
Here!

169
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:42,166
Let me be the finest expression...

170
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:44,112
Of your bloodlust.

171
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:50,023
Taisei Yoshida.

172
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:50,851
Here!

173
00:12:56,301 --> 00:13:01,050
If I die knowing I've helped
these 28 souls find a brighter future...

174
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,912
Autonomous intelligence fixed artillery,

175
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:07,794
Ritsu.

176
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,660
Here.

177
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,762
I die exquisitely happy.

178
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,546
Itona horibe.

179
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:24,699
Here.

180
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,929
All things considered,

181
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:35,280
I'd say it's been an exceptionally fun year.

182
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,958
I say this with all sincerity.

183
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,830
It's a privilege to be assassinated by you.

184
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:53,206
As a fellow spirit, from one traveler to another,

185
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:56,454
give a yell for all life...

186
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:00,769
And strike.

187
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,323
This is it.

188
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,563
This is the part where I kill him.

189
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:32,287
I'm shaking.

190
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,577
Why can't I stop shaking?

191
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:08,317
Don't kill me with anguish in your heart, Nagisa.

192
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:11,421
Nice, deep breath.

193
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,028
Give us a smile.

194
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:14,243
Yeah... Goodbye... Koro-sensei.

195
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:21,275
Goodbye... Nagisa.

196
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:25,938
The bare minimum.

197
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,392
That's all I could bring myself to say.

198
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,786
Gratitude. Regret.

199
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:34,805
I put everything I felt into that blade.

200
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,657
Like I was channeling my soul.

201
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:43,075
With every fiber of my being, I thanked him...

202
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:45,649
With my knife.

203
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:08,808
As his life ebbed away,

204
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,304
it was as if he were saying, "congratulations."

205
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,714
Very soon, it would be midnight.

206
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:29,939
Graduation day... at Kunugigaoka.

207
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:34,436
We'd finished the year a little early.

208
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:37,563
Time to turn our sights on what lay ahead.

209
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,949
Afterward, we went back to the classroom,

210
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:11,142
hoping to find some trace of Koro-sensei.

211
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:13,835
There were diplomas waiting for us.

212
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:17,157
And a yearbook. One for each of us.

213
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:21,391
And copies of "Koro-sensei's rules to live by."

214
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:25,466
Apparently, the laser fired off at some point,

215
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,612
but it mattered so little.

216
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:29,980
I don't think any of us even noticed.

217
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:33,085
A reconnaissance squad showed up later.

218
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:36,885
Mr. Karasuma took it upon himself to lay down the law.

219
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:40,887
He told them we fell under his jurisdiction,

220
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:44,513
that students and classroom
alike were to be left in peace.

221
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:49,357
Koro-sensei's book was thick.

222
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,981
It had more pages than a dictionary.

223
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:57,128
And while it began as a friendly, easy-to-read manga,

224
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:58,726
before long...

225
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,872
I'm especially proud of the workbook appendix.

226
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:04,647
And the short stories composed for the vocabulary section

227
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:07,354
are absolutely riveting, if I do say so myself.

228
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:09,824
You know what would be a great idea?

229
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:12,676
A spinoff manga starring me, still alive!

230
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,909
Ooo! I can be the big bad!

231
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,110
His advice was great,

232
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,747
but we got kinda fed up with the level of detail.

233
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:26,597
Before we knew it,

234
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:30,242
our tears had washed away in the sweet release of sleep.

235
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:37,949
We woke to find sunlight pouring through the windows.

236
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:42,087
The cherry blossoms were in bloom.

237
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:46,743
Small. Delicate. And strong.
