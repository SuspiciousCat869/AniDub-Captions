1
00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:03,460
The target is liquidated.

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:05,071
The planet is safe.

3
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:07,961
Your hard work over the past year has paid off.

4
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:12,028
I imagine you'll find a few things difficult to swallow.

5
00:00:12,486 --> 00:00:15,126
Being stuck under constant surveillance, for example,

6
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:18,518
or the fact that you've all been slapped with a gag order.

7
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,943
Naturally, I'll do whatever I can to lessen the burden.

8
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,461
My apologies in advance for the inconvenience.

9
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,768
It's all right, Mr. Karasuma. We'll be fine.

10
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:33,986
No worries. Whatever settles this, we're on board.

11
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:35,060
We can handle it.

12
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:38,062
Seriously, we don't wanna complicate things for you.

13
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:41,438
That said, though, we do have one tiny request.

14
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:42,551
Hm?

15
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:46,722
Kunugigaoka's graduation ceremony is this afternoon, sir.

16
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:49,611
I think we've earned the right to be a part of it.

17
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:52,832
Let us walk across the stage
in honor of Koro-sensei's memory.

18
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:54,231
Mm.

19
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:56,820
Sure. Yes, of course.

20
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:59,776
I'll handle things and make the necessary arrangements.

21
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:05,043
E-class, rise!

22
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,430
Mr. Karasuma. Professor bitch.

23
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:15,410
For everything you've taught us, we are eternaly grateful.

24
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:17,334
We are eternally grateful!

25
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:22,527
So, where's the ceremony exactly?

26
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:24,236
Main campus is on lockdown.

27
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,277
They're probably having it at the civic center.

28
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:28,402
Our parents are gonna have to bring our uniforms.

29
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:35,385
They've been to hell and back, and look at 'em.

30
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:36,657
So tough.

31
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:39,437
Are these the same kids from a year ago?

32
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:30,395
For all his advice, Koro-sensei never said
anything about the E-class system being unjust,

33
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,111
or that we should try to spark a change.

34
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:33,361
Hinano kurahashi.

35
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:33,994
Sir!

36
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:37,618
There's no shortage of absurdities in the world, I guess.

37
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,486
I say if you have the time and energy to brood on them...

38
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,972
Nagisa shiota!

39
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:44,267
Sir!

40
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:47,604
You have time to subvert them,

41
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,614
maybe even have a little fun in the process.

42
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,588
My, what a confident look.

43
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,607
No doubt we have your former instructor to thank.

44
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:00,474
A word of advice, sir.

45
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,842
Maybe go a little easier on your students from now on.

46
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,086
See ya 'round!

47
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:15,944
What a nice little ceremony.

48
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:17,027
I was moved.

49
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:17,857
Me, too!

50
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,449
Mom. Dad.

51
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:25,207
What're you doing here... together?

52
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,209
Kind of surprising, huh?

53
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,745
At the end of last month your, uh,
teacher paid me a little visit.

54
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:36,385
Right off the bat, your son asked for a favor.

55
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,486
He prefers to be called by his first
name, as opposed to his last, you see.

56
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:44,944
So there won't be any awkwardness
if he goes back to using his father's name.

57
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:47,714
He wanted to nip that in the
bud before it became an issue.

58
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:50,908
He's a good student. I have no complaints.

59
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:55,286
All signs point toward Nagisa
meeting his goals by mid-march.

60
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:59,719
All I ask... is that you give
his graduation your blessing,

61
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,030
as a family.

62
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,129
He and your mother told me how hard you've worked.

63
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:07,617
It takes a lot of determination
to come as far as you have, son.

64
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:11,810
We've, been talking, and feel it's best for everyone

65
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:16,205
if we follow your example and
give our marriage another shot.

66
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:25,667
How much of himself...

67
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:28,203
did our teacher need to leave behind?

68
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,819
Ceremony's over! They're letting out!

69
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,615
Time to get some reactions!

70
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,040
Easy, folks! This place is off limits to the media!

71
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,465
Tell us about the monster! Did he die?

72
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,397
How did he die?

73
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:43,347
Can you tell us how your feeling at the moment?

74
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,245
Are you kids really the ones who killed him?

75
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,890
Gimme a break! I'm tryin' to do my job!

76
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:49,097
Have you no shame!

77
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:51,221
These children have already been through enough!

78
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,277
You're all vultures!

79
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,309
Yeah, yeah.

80
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,445
All right, everybody outside, now!

81
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:58,106
There's a bus on standby at the main gate!

82
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,416
Excuse me... ow!

83
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,023
Hey! What the...?!

84
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:08,377
What's the big idea?!

85
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,502
You're messin' with our coverage!

86
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:10,430
Hmph.

87
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:13,487
Ugh... coverage?

88
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:15,652
You people are messing with our moment in the sun!

89
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,311
Y'know, the Internet's gonna go nuts when I post this.

90
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,013
Remember, we know what you look like, scum! Ha!

91
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,572
There. Nothing to worry about, love.

92
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,011
Permit us to be your escort to the front gate.

93
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:29,982
With graduation comes a clean slate.

94
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:33,906
But abandoning former classmates in
their time of need would be disgraceful.

95
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:36,221
I may be ruthless,

96
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:39,270
but as your future leader, I'm not about to court shame.

97
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,632
Akabane.

98
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:47,064
Seems like you're the only one coming back.

99
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:51,504
Fair warning, when all this is over,
I'll put you on the rack if I have to.

100
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,555
This Koro-sensei seems fascinating.

101
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:57,153
You're going to give me all the gory details.

102
00:06:57,444 --> 00:07:00,361
I mean, I could, but thick-skulled as you are,

103
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:02,492
you might struggle to understand.

104
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,027
Move it. You're bringin' up the rear.

105
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:05,567
Whoa!

106
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,357
Off you go.

107
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,986
So many reasons to cry.

108
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,085
A day like today I'll never see again.

109
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:45,475
Goodbye, Kunugigaoka junior high.

110
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:49,789
Goodbye, class 3-E.

111
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:52,982
Goodbye...

112
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:55,556
Koro-sensei.

113
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,731
Afterwards, lots of stuff went down.

114
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:15,221
Kunugigaoka came under fire for involving
its students in an assassination plot.

115
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:20,278
The whole concept of E-class was abolished, thankfully.

116
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:21,786
After we left,

117
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:24,996
the old mountainside building shut its doors for good.

118
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:28,101
As for the principal,

119
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:32,161
he was tried in the court of
public opinion and forced to resign.

120
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,720
Of course, he is who he is.

121
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:38,230
Something tells me he had a backup plan.

122
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,361
Whatever else can be said about him,

123
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,775
there's no denying he's a man of conviction.

124
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,175
We haven't seen the last of him.

125
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:47,638
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

126
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,348
Anything you need, sir, we're glad to help.

127
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:57,704
Ah! Nagi! Mori! It's been years!

128
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,527
We heard you're having trouble,

129
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:03,018
and were worried about you.

130
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:06,856
Not just you, actually, all the kids that came after us.

131
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,909
Please, sir, there has to be something we can do for you.

132
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,466
Let us help an old mentor in his darkest hour.

133
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:19,854
In point of fact, your timing is excellent.

134
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:26,026
You two can help me celebrate.
I've been saving this bottle.

135
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:29,158
New beginnings are rather high
on the list of reasons to toast.

136
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:31,452
Raise a glass with me.

137
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:35,147
Get me up to speed on your lives. I'll air my complaints.

138
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,192
We're glad to lend you an ear.

139
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:41,589
All three of us.

140
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:47,120
The bounty was promptly paid.

141
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:52,428
No fuss. Just cold, hard cash.

142
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:53,977
Hush money, really.

143
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,250
Mr. Karasuma told us as much and we understood.

144
00:09:57,385 --> 00:10:00,594
So... all that was left was how to spend it.

145
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:03,828
We consulted "Koro-sensei's rules to live by."

146
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,919
The accomplishment is its own reward.

147
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:11,368
Nothing stunts your growth quite like
immediate access to troves of money.

148
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,822
With that in mind,

149
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:15,627
we all set aside a little something to live on,

150
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:20,164
college tuition, charitable donations we believed in,

151
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:24,558
and one big-ticket item that we purchased as a class.

152
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:31,422
The rest of it, we gave back to the government as
a thank you for the incredible year they'd given us.

153
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:34,820
Mr. Karasuma, excuse me,

154
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:37,804
agent Karasuma's career is sure to take off.

155
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,880
Slowly, the Crescent moon began to crumble.

156
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:45,842
Under its own gravity,

157
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,957
it would end up a much smaller sphere than before.

158
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,357
The explosion had moved it, though.

159
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,257
It now orbited a lot closer to earth.

160
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:58,164
After a while,

161
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,978
the shape, size, gravitational pull, what have you,

162
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:05,840
would come to resemble the moon
as we'd known it all our lives.

163
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:10,494
The Crescent that symbolized our year together...

164
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:14,285
Ever so gradually... would forget its shape.

165
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,002
There's sectarian violence brewing in the middle east.

166
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,237
A group of radicals is on the warpath.

167
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,152
We need a sleeper agent.

168
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:41,035
An operative who's willing to infiltrate enemy ranks.

169
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:44,394
You'll ship out tomorrow, understood?

170
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,872
Yeah. Sure. If that's the job.

171
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:50,926
Oh, but I'm scared! Whatever shall I do, chief?

172
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:56,375
Imagine a sumptuous creature like moi
getting captured in hostile territory.

173
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:58,712
Or does the idea get your motor running?

174
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,586
Your poor, defenseless wife

175
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,655
having all sorts of horrible things
done to her by burly men in the desert.

176
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,779
This assignment reflects my faith in your abilities,

177
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:11,966
but if you genuinely see
yourself as poor and defenseless...

178
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:14,659
Ugh. Well then.

179
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,111
You give me no choice but to assign someone else.

180
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:17,789
Uh!

181
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:19,592
Wait! It was a joke!

182
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:22,372
Is it too much to ask for you
to show a teensy bit of concern?!

183
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:24,327
C'mon, sweetie! Don't be this way!

184
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:26,733
So are you going or not?

185
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:27,997
Yes! Yes!

186
00:12:28,236 --> 00:12:29,459
Then go get ready!

187
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,532
Sir! With pleasure!

188
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,523
It's been seven years since we've met.

189
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:41,416
She hasn't changed... at all.

190
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:46,256
I think about those kids.

191
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:49,465
Our kids.

192
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,825
Whatever became of them, I wonder.

193
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,677
What're they doing with their lives?

194
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:13,816
Ooo! We have a celebrity!

195
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,237
Hi, guys!

196
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,277
Look at you! You're in costume?

197
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,419
Are you sure you've got time for all this?

198
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:27,002
Sure! I snuck off the set during my lunch break.

199
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:29,333
I can't let you do the heavy lifting without me.

200
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:31,445
Awesome!

201
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:34,862
Okay, people, let's get this place up to code!

202
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:36,633
All right!

203
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:40,176
Yep! Class president till the end!

204
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:40,924
Hey now,

205
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:43,410
you're the ones who wanted me to hold on to the keys.

206
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,872
What can we say, man?

207
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:47,359
We know who best to delegate this sort of thing to.

208
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:05,336
Hey. You ever finish reading Koro-sensei's advice book?

209
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:07,902
Nowhere near, actually. It never ends.

210
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:10,074
Place is gettin' rough around the edges again.

211
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,792
We shoulda hired a groundskeeper
when we bought the mountain.

212
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:13,986
We can handle it.

213
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,819
If you let it get messy, you clean it up.

214
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,701
That's one of the old rules, remember?

215
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,124
Wow. Talk about hitting the big time, Kayano.

216
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,014
You've made it!

217
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,753
You bet she has. She's got the look.

218
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:26,361
She can do her own stunts.

219
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:29,294
Did you see her dive off that cliff
like she was jumping into bed?

220
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,984
It'd be weird if she hadn't made it!

221
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,036
Oh, come on.

222
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,647
I'm just using all the cool stuff I learned here.

223
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:36,259
Hey, uh, Okajima?

224
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:39,216
Could you stop playing paparazzi
and get back to work, please?

225
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:43,649
We wanted a memorial to visit, but not a grave.

226
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:49,314
After all, it didn't feel like they were gone.

227
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:54,987
This is their home, a place where they can dwell in peace.

228
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,942
Somewhere those who love them can always come back to.

229
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,361
I've been thinking, guys.

230
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,798
We really oughta put this place to good use, y'know?

231
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:07,944
Preserving it's fine and all,
but it doesn't feel like enough.

232
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,627
Okano's using the back of the mountain a lot lately.

233
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:14,197
You know she put together an acrobatic
performance squad for her college, right?

234
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:17,391
Said this was the training
ground she's used to, so why not?

235
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:21,045
Okay, let's run the circuit! Try to keep up!

236
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,402
Let's see some hustle!

237
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:27,504
Pretty sweet, huh?

238
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:30,894
And recently kurahashi started
giving nature tours to kids.

239
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,612
No kidding?

240
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:34,011
Well, she's always known how to make money.

241
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,375
Here we go! Are we all ready?

242
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,390
Be careful where you step, okay?

243
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:40,043
Okay!

244
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:43,219
Huh.

245
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:46,555
We've grown up exactly as Koro-sensei taught us to.

246
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:49,217
Just look at manami and Takebayashi.

247
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:53,324
They've literally taken a page from
our life manuals and put it to good use.

248
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,602
Koro-sensei hinted at a cell activation recipe
they're now researching to make artificial blood.

249
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:02,941
Dear god. The lives we can
save. The number is mind-boggling!

250
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,904
Well, Okuda handled the development phase.

251
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:07,278
Credit goes to her.

252
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,779
Personally I'm eager to explore the clinical side.

253
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,196
Our, uh, name for it is "rh slither blood."

254
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:15,819
And there's Sugino,

255
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,283
who's become a college baseball star.

256
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,544
Strike three!

257
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,569
Yeah!

258
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:32,736
His versatile pitching style caught
the eye of pro scouts from all over.

259
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,986
Incredible. So the rumors are all true.

260
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,429
They don't call him "slithery Sugino" for nothin'!

261
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:43,109
As for Terasaka, his particular skills
caught the eye of a certain professor politician.

262
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:46,032
Hop to! Ugh! We're late enough as it is!

263
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:48,209
Damn it, kid. Are you a man or a mouse?

264
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:52,437
Son of a bitch. Way to drive me like a mule, you old fart!

265
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:56,074
Once he's out of college, he'll
be promoted to personal assistant.

266
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:58,481
Yoshida and Muramatsu are thriving.

267
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,442
They've taken over the family businesses.

268
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:01,270
Purrin' like a baby kitten.

269
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,788
Ha-ha. I guess so.

270
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:04,877
Takuya! Get a load of this!

271
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:06,694
Heh! Makes your mouth water, doesn't it?

272
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:07,119
Uh!

273
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:09,778
You have any idea how much that thing cost?

274
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:12,401
How the hell are we supposed to make a profit, genius?!

275
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:16,557
Itona went to work in his father's
factory right after high school.

276
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:21,761
Well, if this doesn't do the trick, I know some
guys. They'd be happy to come help me out with it.

277
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:22,873
So he's good.

278
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,002
Speaking of technical stuff,
Ritsu's completely online now.

279
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:31,022
I'm parallel processing with
computers from every corner of the globe!

280
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:35,306
I can make songs. I can draw.
I can explore my emotional range!

281
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:39,358
Yep. She's living the life. A free spirit.

282
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,838
And she loves nothing more than
to help out her old classmates.

283
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,527
That's what we're up to.

284
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:48,717
Adapting ourselves as necessary,
seeing where life takes us.

285
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:53,540
Oh! Do you here about Karma?

286
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:57,322
Dude, he passed the national civil
service exam with flying colors.

287
00:17:57,354 --> 00:17:58,611
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

288
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,493
Good luck seein' him tank, right?

289
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,900
Yeah, well, they say the hard part comes after.

290
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:07,578
He's good, sure, but now there'll be a lot of red tape.

291
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:11,742
Tons of interviews. Training. Interdepartmental hazing.

292
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,000
Of course, if anyone can thrive
in that environment, it's him.

293
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:16,009
Huh.

294
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:19,457
Gotta say, I'm likin' the looks of my new wallet.

295
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:22,602
Yeah. He's gonna be just fine.

296
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:24,954
As a matter of fact, we all are.

297
00:18:29,937 --> 00:18:31,752
Wait! Stop! I wasn't ready!

298
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:32,402
Oh!

299
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:37,527
O-ka-ji-maaa.

300
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,936
What part of your brain told you that was a good idea?!

301
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:44,371
It was an accident! I swear! Ah!

302
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:46,596
Honestly,

303
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,409
I think whatever path we chose in life,

304
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,572
it's a safe bet Koro-sensei would've approved.

305
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,122
I can see him saying, "it suits you."

306
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,816
We had one year together.

307
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,178
You can live a lot of different lives in that time.

308
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:05,942
They become part of you.

309
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,182
They become your guide.

310
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,017
Your world.

311
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:19,806
There's the life of pride...

312
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:23,194
Outrageous! This is ten times the estimate!

313
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:26,202
Don't you dare! I'm an artist; I charge what I'm worth!

314
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,379
The life of service...

315
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,569
I thought we'd visit the park today.

316
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:31,987
Is that something you'd like?

317
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,369
The life we're given...

318
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:38,016
I know! That show has totally gone off the rails!

319
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,672
The life we hope to bring into the world...

320
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:46,691
Whatever happens... We're connected.

321
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:49,258
Every one of us. Forever.

322
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:53,373
Trading lives back and forth,

323
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:57,045
across a classroom steeped in bloodlust.

324
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:02,876
This classroom. Our tribute to Koro-sensei.

325
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:04,408
And who knows?

326
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:09,112
Maybe one day a new generation
will live as many lives here as we did.

327
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:18,375
So, tell me the truth.

328
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,652
Have you been keeping in touch with Nagisa?

329
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,245
What's the story there?

330
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:23,629
Well.

331
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:25,766
There isn't one.

332
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:28,952
I'm not really on his radar these days, sadly.

333
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:30,525
You know how he is.

334
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,876
Always keeping his eye on the target.

335
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,632
Okey dokey! Hey, class!

336
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,850
I'm your teacher in training, Nagisa shiota.

337
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:40,177
Pleased to meet you.

338
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:43,076
It's been seven years.

339
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:45,087
I'm way taller than I used to be,

340
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:47,256
and I'm a beloved teacher.

341
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:51,770
In my dreams, at least.

342
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,976
A teacher in training?!

343
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:55,111
You gotta be shittin' me!

344
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:57,194
C'mon, guys, leave the poor girl alone!

345
00:20:57,277 --> 00:20:58,861
Why're you dressed like a boy?!

346
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:00,795
What're you? Junior high?

347
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:04,219
Life is so unfair.

348
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:08,007
You'd think I’d have a few inches
on my junior high self by now.

349
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,502
Everyone else shot up like weeds.

350
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,408
And Karma?

351
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:14,404
He's over six feet tall now! No, seriously!

352
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:19,171
For my training, they put me in the last circle of hell.

353
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:22,134
Nothing like our assassination classroom.

354
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:24,295
Totally different dynamic.

355
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,300
You have any idea the hurt you're in for in this place?

356
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:31,176
From now on this is a study hall, you got that?

357
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:33,361
Uh, the bell's rung.

358
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:35,601
I'd like to ask you to take your seats, please.

359
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:37,668
Oh-ho, that's cute!

360
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,902
Shut up. You don't get to boss us around.

361
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:45,634
We'll kill you.

362
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:50,482
What?

363
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,151
Kill... me?

364
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:57,139
Interesting word... kill.

365
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,096
Evocative, but overused.

366
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,678
It's lost some of its mojo.

367
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:07,936
For some of us, though,

368
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,646
it still holds the right kind of magic.

369
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:29,407
You're welcome to try.

370
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:30,248
Huh?

371
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:33,165
You have until graduation.

372
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:49,134
All right, people.

373
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,969
Let's get started, shall we?
