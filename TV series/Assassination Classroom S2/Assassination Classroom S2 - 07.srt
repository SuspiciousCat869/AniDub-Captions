1
00:00:02,214 --> 00:00:04,005
What cha think, Professor Bitch?

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:06,714
Is the gear we got yesterday awesome or what?

3
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:07,367
Right?

4
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:09,963
Mr. K sure knows how to kick things up a notch!

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,339
FYI, I had a teeny bit of input in the overall design.

6
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:15,880
For which, you're welcome.

7
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:18,130
That oaf wanted the same style for the whole class.

8
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:19,797
Glad he vetoed the "Irina."

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,332
It's cute, just not super functional.

10
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:23,811
Yeah, well.

11
00:00:23,836 --> 00:00:25,963
'Least one of your teachers understands women.

12
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:29,062
Blockhead couldn't even be bothered to get me a present.

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,348
Huh?

14
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:35,163
Oh, no! Of course! October tenth was four days ago!

15
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:39,421
Huh? Professor Bitch's birthday!

16
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,087
Before I came here,

17
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:20,305
I had legions of sugar daddies falling all over themselves

18
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,354
to buy me expensive things.

19
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:24,008
Now?

20
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:27,803
If it doesn't come from him, I'm not interested.

21
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:29,784
What the hell is wrong with me?

22
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:34,353
And why haven't I been able to get ahold of Lovro?

23
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:37,956
Being alone sucks.

24
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:42,214
Professor Bitch, do you have a little time
to go over some more conversational francais?

25
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,177
Do what?

26
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:44,595
Oh, that's right.

27
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,793
You had your heart set on working overseas.

28
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:49,328
Yeah. Oh, excuse me, I meant to say oui.

29
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:52,130
Well, all right then, take a seat and we'll drill...

30
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,589
Actually, the weather's so nice,

31
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,636
I was thinking we could do this outside.

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,795
But why?

33
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,431
C'mon! It'll be fun!

34
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,206
Man, those two are lucky to have
us around to push things along.

35
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:04,103
We're a go.

36
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,139
The Fox and the Hound have been separated.

37
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:09,221
We'll keep our fingers crossed
for the Birthday Present Squad.

38
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,672
Right, let's do this.

39
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:15,172
Now what exactly are you supposed to get
someone who already has two of everything?

40
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:17,005
It's not gonna be easy.

41
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,486
Everybody pitched in.

42
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,861
Not a whole lot, but it's better than nothing.

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,245
Question is, will it be enough
to by a proper grown-up gift?

44
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,119
Hey, over here!

45
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:28,272
Everything thing end up okay with that man?

46
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:30,939
You know, the old-timer on the bicycle?

47
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:31,769
Uh...

48
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,660
You're the flower guy who called the ambulance!

49
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,775
He managed to forgive us after a couple of weeks, yeah.

50
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:39,698
Uh, thanks for helping us out.

51
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:42,988
No sweat. I'm glad it wasn't as bad as it looked.

52
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,103
Beg pardon, I couldn't help but overhear
you're in the market for a grown-up gift?

53
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:48,711
Yes! Yes we are!

54
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:50,743
Well, what about something like this?

55
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:54,150
Oh, I get it! A bouquet!

56
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:56,851
In this day and age, we can have whatever we want.

57
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:59,213
But flowers are still the go-to gift of choice.

58
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:00,737
Why do you suppose that is?

59
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:01,999
Hm?

60
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,622
It's not just about romance.

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,727
Their color, their shape, and scent.

62
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,626
The fact that they don't last.

63
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,558
Flowers are an ideal metaphor for the human condition.

64
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:14,537
Oh my. You're a persuasive salesman, sir.

65
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Quite the, poetic little speech.

66
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,732
That calculator part of the symbolism?

67
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,282
Hey, I'm just trying to make a living.

68
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,204
So, uh, you in?

69
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,319
I'll cut you a deal. It's flowery fate.

70
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,366
Wow! Then what?

71
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:36,583
Is there some magic word that
brings a Frenchman to his knees?

72
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:38,262
What's with you today, Toka?

73
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:40,772
You've never been so enthralled;
You're hanging on every word.

74
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,161
Well, yeah, I wanna learn French.

75
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:44,068
Hey, Miss?

76
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:46,689
Can you play piano for us like you did at the hotel?

77
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:47,964
C'mon, Professor Bitch!

78
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:50,172
Let me draw you in one of your killer poses!

79
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:52,338
Hold on! I asked her first, y'know!

80
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,625
Uhh...

81
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,232
What's the deal with these brats all of a sudden?

82
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,003
I'm so popular!

83
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:00,080
Ha! Don't fret my little darlings!

84
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:02,110
There's enough Professor Bitch to go around!

85
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:04,860
Just don't get turned on. That would be crossing the line.

86
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:08,642
It's a very nice bouquet of flowers, don't get me wrong.

87
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:10,683
But why me?

88
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,145
They'd mean so much more coming from you.

89
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:17,269
Ugh. Can somebody actually be this clueless?

90
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,172
Mr. K, please. Look at it this way:

91
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,482
Professor Bitch is a vital asset to the mission.

92
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,825
All in a day's work, sir.

93
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:26,120
Winning over your colleague can only help things, right?

94
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:30,117
Hah. Just let her think they're from you. Cool?

95
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,246
I see your point.

96
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:36,251
Very well. I'll do it. Thanks for your dedication.

97
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:47,055
Wait, I...

98
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,637
Come on, you don't all have to leave at the same time.

99
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,536
Well damn. How do you like that?

100
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,522
Urgh. Nice. Absolutely perfect.

101
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,885
I'm right back to being Miss Lonely Hearts.

102
00:05:58,797 --> 00:06:00,755
Hey, Karasuma! You won't believe what just happened!

103
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,589
Those self-centered brats...

104
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:03,446
Oh, Irina. Good timing.

105
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,156
Uh... What is this?

106
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,151
I know I'm late, but... Happy Birthday.

107
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:11,430
Wait, these're for me?

108
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,230
And they're from you?

109
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,160
Sorry I let the actual day slip by.

110
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:20,392
Things got busy.

111
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:25,000
No, it's fine. I'm delighted.

112
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:26,684
Thank you so much.

113
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,738
You old dog! I thought you forgot it!

114
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,367
Is this real, or is there something up your sleeve?

115
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:35,368
I do want to mark the occasion.

116
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:39,444
This is the first and last of your
birthdays we'll celebrate together.

117
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:46,015
Oh, don't be silly. What is that supposed to mean?

118
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,533
Just what it sounds like. Stands to reason, yes?

119
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:52,497
Either the mission's going to end or the world will.

120
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:55,954
One way or the other, in half a year, this'll be over.

121
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:58,964
Hm?

122
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,103
Oh. Hey there.

123
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,405
Well, we're screwed.

124
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:05,709
I figured you had to be behind this.

125
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,630
A bouquet of flowers, huh?

126
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,231
Like the square would think of doing
something like that for me of his own will.

127
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,966
You enjoy yourselves?

128
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,241
Stringing me along so you can watch a pro
assassin get her pathetic little hopes up.

129
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,505
That's not the case at all, Miss Irina!

130
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,461
The children's intentions were utterly pure...

131
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:26,803
Save it, Octorazzi!

132
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,340
Who gives a damn?

133
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:34,939
This is a business relationship, nothing more.

134
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,005
I've been so caught up in my role,

135
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,832
I've forgotten who I really am.

136
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,773
You've opened my eyes.

137
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,572
Best birthday present ever. Thank you.

138
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,192
Hold on!

139
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:50,629
Professor Bitch, please!

140
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,099
Not to point fingers or anything, Mr. K,

141
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:56,097
but that was kind of cold of you, don't you think?

142
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:59,140
Don't tell us you still haven't noticed how she feels?

143
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,072
You kids don't really believe I'm that oblivious, do you?

144
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:05,526
I'm a heartless bastard for good reason.

145
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:08,912
Emotions can't be allowed to get
in the way of what needs to be done.

146
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,332
We're professionals.

147
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:13,830
If her feelings for me can dull her blade,

148
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,204
then she's not qualified to be an assassin.

149
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,492
That's all there is to it.

150
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:22,068
But, Mr. Karasuma...

151
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:25,873
I am so pissed off right now!

152
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:28,733
Karasu... To hell with that! More like Crapsuma!

153
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,139
Damn! It's hard to say!

154
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,527
Maybe... Maybe it's time to leave.

155
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,838
What's left for me here anyway?

156
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:42,376
Nothing. Not with what I'm capable of.

157
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:49,629
After that, Professor Bitch essentially disappeared.

158
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:52,639
She hasn't been here in three days.

159
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,022
We really crossed the line this time, guys.

160
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:57,415
Well, I'm off.

161
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,783
You can call me if there's any news on Miss Irina.

162
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:02,089
Meanwhile, there's a fútbol tournament in Brazil

163
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:03,130
I must attend.

164
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:04,936
So... ciao!

165
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:07,180
Okay then, guess he's outta here.

166
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,881
What's the deal with him and soccer all of a sudden?

167
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,193
Typical "once-every-four-years" fan.

168
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,661
What happened to baseball?

169
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,995
I'm starting to get worried. I just hope she's okay.

170
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:20,863
Yeah, no. Not much luck getting through.

171
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,164
My GPS scan is coming up negative.

172
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:25,478
No matches on the closed-circuit feeds either.

173
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:26,438
Seriously.

174
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,105
You don't think she would leave over something like this?

175
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,862
I'm sure that can't be the case.

176
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:33,453
After all, there's still something
important you need her to do.

177
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:36,606
Yes, exactly. Plus she knows we like having her around.

178
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:37,330
Right.

179
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:39,570
You children have bonded rather nicely with her,

180
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:40,897
there's no denying that.

181
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:41,533
You see,

182
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,298
my preliminary reconnaissance confirmed as much.

183
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:47,672
Your connection gives me something very handy to exploit.

184
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:48,564
Huh?

185
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:56,310
It was so... so casual.

186
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:58,836
He walked in like he owned the place.

187
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:01,085
Hello.

188
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,059
I'm the assassin commonly known as The Reaper.

189
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,711
And today, boys and girls, class it going to be fun.

190
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,500
What the...?

191
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:21,997
It's him.

192
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,105
A flower tends to throw people off guard.

193
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,567
There's hardly a soul alive immune to their charm.

194
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:29,053
Remember my sales pitch?

195
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,253
Nagisa, you were taken in.

196
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:36,147
But you see, there's a reason flowers evolved

197
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:38,364
into such lovely, fragrant varieties.

198
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:42,224
Ritsu, would you bring up the image I sent?

199
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,527
Their purpose is to draw insects. Is that Professor Bitch?

200
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:50,965
I'll cut to the chase.

201
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,964
It's simple. If you want her to live,

202
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,969
show up when and where I tell you to.

203
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:58,106
And yes, I mean the entire class.

204
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,879
Not a word of this to your teachers.

205
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:03,120
'Course, I can understand if you're
not comfortable with those terms.

206
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:06,249
If you'd rather not come, there's
always the option of sending her to you.

207
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,548
In tiny, individual wrapped pieces. One per student.

208
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:13,423
If that's the preference, fine.

209
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:16,356
Though, one of you will likely be my next flower.

210
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,399
We didn't see him coming.

211
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:21,378
That's when it dawned on me.

212
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:24,897
What scared me most of all was not being afraid.

213
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,179
'Kay, first off,

214
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:32,121
we got no obligation to save that pushy bitch,

215
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,510
so thanks for playin', but no dice.

216
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:37,563
Second, what's to stop us from beatin' the piss out of you

217
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,272
right here and now, ya kidnappin' bastard?

218
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,551
A bold assessment, but entirely wrong.

219
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:44,569
The woman means more to you than you know.

220
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:49,169
In fact, I suspect that if you were to
let her die, you'd be beside yourselves.

221
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,253
As to your second point,

222
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,284
no human being is capable of taking down the Reaper.

223
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:56,962
Conversely,

224
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:00,267
human beings are the Reaper's preferred prey.

225
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,787
"Come to the location shown on the map.

226
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:13,757
Arrive as a group at six P.M. and tell no one."

227
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:14,942
Huh.

228
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:17,332
Exactly like with Takaoka and Shiro.

229
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,630
They wanna take us hostage.

230
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,855
Draw out Koro-sensei with us as the bait.

231
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:23,452
Damn!

232
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:25,977
We usin' these?

233
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:32,089
We're doing this to protect someone. So, yes.

234
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,906
I don't care if he's the
greatest assassin who's ever lived,

235
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:38,648
we're not about to let that oily
SOB's plan go off without a hitch.

236
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,713
That's gotta be the way in.

237
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:48,754
Bird's eye loop-around's negative.

238
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,178
There's no sign of anybody close by.

239
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,839
Makes it more ominous.

240
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,737
'Kay, Ritsu.

241
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,913
If we don't all make it back here by midnight,

242
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:57,805
tell Koro-sensei what's going on.

243
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:01,174
Got it. Good luck. Be stay safe, everyone.

244
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:02,652
Let's go!

245
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:18,839
Lotta space he's got.

246
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,554
Is that all of you? Good. Watch the doors.

247
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:29,324
Ah. You like to keep an eye on us, huh? Kinda kinky.

248
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:32,039
Reaper, Peeper. All right. Sure, why not?

249
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,203
Look, we've held up our end of the bargain!

250
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:37,525
So give back Professor Bitch, and
let us get on with our lives, okay?

251
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:41,018
What the hell?

252
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,757
Whoa! The whole room's going down!

253
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:52,689
Trap is complete.

254
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:55,187
Ensnaring you as a group is the best way.

255
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,517
Saves me a lot of time.

256
00:13:58,086 --> 00:13:59,299
Professor Bitch!

257
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,880
Ugh! Crap!

258
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:02,850
No worries.

259
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,011
If he comes quietly, no one gets killed.

260
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,347
What about if we, like, resist or something?

261
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:10,537
Would you be mad enough to kill us then?

262
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:13,853
Oh, relax. It's pitiful how scared you are.

263
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:17,047
Uh, sorry, I can't really do much about it.

264
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:19,630
Here! This section sounds hollow!

265
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,011
A fitted charge.

266
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,196
A few smokescreen capsules.

267
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:36,187
Yes, good! Make it fun!

268
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,868
Okay. Moment of truth's upon us.

269
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:43,830
Hello, E-Class? Can you hear me?

270
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:48,867
Nice work. Honestly, I'm happy you escaped.

271
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:51,584
It'll be a good warm-up for the real game.

272
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:53,531
I expect great things.

273
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:56,430
I knew it. It's a game to him.

274
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,797
This isn't some vindictive act,

275
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,981
like with Takaoka.

276
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:04,494
It's different. He's an unknown quantity.

277
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:12,908
Seven to one.

278
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:13,988
Huh?

279
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,664
Mmm-hmmm. Indeed.

280
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:20,160
Letting XY stand for seven to one
gives us a lovely math problem...

281
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,839
Oh, dear me,

282
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,571
I seem to have angered the locals somehow.

283
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,255
Did I insult a sacred custom?

284
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:35,052
I ought to pick Maehara's brain on this. He knows soccer.

285
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,834
We're sorry, the number you've dialed is out of range.

286
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,505
Uh. Isogai, then? Perhaps Hinata. Or Terasaka.

287
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,754
I have a bad feeling about this.

288
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:49,088
We'll intercept him here.

289
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:50,863
Whichever way he decides to come from,

290
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:53,150
we'll still have him outnumbered, so stay alert.

291
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,380
Ritsu, we need some backup, 'kay?

292
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,201
Yeah, not feelin' it.

293
00:15:57,297 --> 00:16:00,545
Be realistic, like I'm gonna go up against the Reaper.

294
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:04,678
I'd rather power down than, like, do stuff.

295
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,209
Ritsu's been hacked!

296
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,089
He's coming.

297
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:16,229
Huh?

298
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:23,030
I can't make him out.

299
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,438
What the...? How is he doing that?

300
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:27,630
Take him down!

301
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:29,536
Dumbass is walking right into us!

302
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,337
Hand-to-hand combat was the first skill

303
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,877
I honed as an assassin.

304
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:39,833
So as you might imagine, I'm rather good at it.

305
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:43,437
A talent 99% unnecessary in this profession,

306
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,523
but without it, 1% of my quarry would survive.

307
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,955
If you want to be a killer, it's an indispensable tool.

308
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:52,497
Take my word for it.

309
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,774
Ah, females are so fragile.

310
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:01,357
Don't expect me to handle the rest of you this delicately.

311
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:03,977
Everyone. Stay back.

312
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,083
Leave this guy to me.

313
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,752
Are you outta your mind?

314
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:10,484
She's all right.

315
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:14,083
That crunching noise was the sound
of her gear absorbing the impact.

316
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,490
Still, though.

317
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:17,810
The Reaper thinks her ribs are cracked,

318
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,953
which really pisses me off.

319
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:22,585
When I'm like this,

320
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,859
my bloodlust demands satisfaction for all of us.

321
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:29,726
With these hands...

322
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,836
Whoa!

323
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,289
Well, damn. This isn't gonna work.

324
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:50,963
The classic stunner clap.

325
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,054
Yours and Lovro's might conceivably startle a cat.

326
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:57,820
But in sufficiently skilled hands,
the move can accomplish quite a bit more.

327
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,506
Human consciousness has a frequency, you see.

328
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,636
The higher the peaks, the more
sensitive one is to stimulus.

329
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:07,497
When your prey's in a particularly agitated state of mind,

330
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:10,786
a powerful enough sound wave can work wonders.

331
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:16,064
Of course, they'll be startled, but that's hardly all.

332
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:17,024
Oh, oh no,

333
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:20,606
the voluntary nervous system
will be temporarily paralyzed.

334
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:25,810
This is... This is top-level stuff.

335
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,219
Huh. So that's it?

336
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:33,382
Well, okay then. Except I seem to be short a few of you.

337
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:37,505
Professor Bitch!

338
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,047
She's still breathing!

339
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:43,810
You're in charge of taking care of her.

340
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:46,064
Man, I always get stuck with the grunt-work.

341
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:46,602
'Kay.

342
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,914
Let's rendezvous with the others
and get the hell out of here.

343
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:51,631
Yay! What a relief.

344
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,630
I thought for sure she was a goner!

345
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:54,598
Yeah, right?

346
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:01,038
Um, Professor Bitch?

347
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:02,953
Ah.

348
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:06,513
How lovely to finally be myself.

349
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:10,064
Six whole months asleep before my prince came to wake me.

350
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:12,939
Now, then, to put you brats out of commission.

351
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:14,329
What're you talking about?

352
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:16,085
This can't be real.

353
00:19:16,284 --> 00:19:19,534
Time for your final lesson, boys
and girls. I hope you're ready.

354
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,464
Son of a...!

355
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,690
Oh! I stepped on a rock barefoot.

356
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:28,689
Jeez. C'mon, miss. Let's...

357
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,152
Not cool.

358
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:36,368
That was a dirty trick.

359
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:39,420
We were actually worried about you there for...

360
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,730
Yeah, well, whad'ya gonna do?

361
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:44,505
Blame it on the experience gap.

362
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:47,046
I've seen a little bit more carnage than you punks.

363
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,894
Already? You took them out all by yourself.

364
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:53,840
I was only following your advice.

365
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:57,494
There's no point throwing in with
a bunch of snot-nosed know-nothings.

366
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,297
Glad you've finally seen the light.

367
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,980
They're only children after all.

368
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:04,145
For all the good they are to us they
might as well be from another world.

369
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:07,052
They breathe clean air, we breathe blood mist.

370
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:11,080
You there. What'll it be then?

371
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:15,648
Will you come quietly, or stand
your ground in a losing battle.

372
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,829
Blah, blah, blah. Dude, bring it on.

373
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,132
Itona and I'll kick your crazy ass.

374
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,340
I surrender.

375
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:24,094
Huh?

376
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:26,430
If we fight, we're toast.

377
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:28,686
This guy's on a whole other level.

378
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:30,172
You're kidding me.

379
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:33,684
It's like you said. If we lose today, so what?

380
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,180
All we gotta do is win once. Be patient.

381
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,556
So now what?

382
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:44,130
Listen, buddy. I don't know what your
big plan is for killing Koro-sensei,

383
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:46,928
but I wouldn't count on it goin' smoothly.

384
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:49,860
Oh, don't worry. I'm a gifted improviser.

385
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,155
That's my job.

386
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,769
I can work with bad Intel as well as good.

387
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:54,643
Hm?

388
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:55,652
Huh?

389
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:57,487
Karasuma?

390
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,127
Why is he here?

391
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,153
Pro'ly the Octopus.

392
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,093
He told us once if there was
ever a wall we couldn't get over...

393
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:09,540
he'd take over from there.

394
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:11,200
We're gonna be okay.

395
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:13,005
I've got their scent!

396
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,372
Ha-ha! Didn't I tell you?

397
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:17,088
In this clever canine disguise, I'm a natural!

398
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:20,560
There is absolutely nothing natural
about what you're doing right now.
