1
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,299
I... I got in!

2
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:11,873
Oh, thank goodness the hard part's finally over.

3
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:15,710
Congratulations all around! Well done!

4
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:17,603
Those second blades twinkled!

5
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:20,735
Everyone was accepted into a
top tier school of their choice!

6
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:23,914
You'll be entering into freshman
year like the rock stars you are!

7
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:26,740
Ah! What a tremendous weight off my shoulders!

8
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,530
We're meant to begin our final round
of career counseling sessions today,

9
00:00:30,578 --> 00:00:33,238
but there's something I'm rather keen on doing beforehand.

10
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,550
What might that be, you ask?

11
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:37,990
How to mark such a joyous occasion?

12
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,904
Editing. Of course.

13
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,231
Say what?

14
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:42,523
Oh, yes!

15
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:46,697
We will be commemorating
E-Class... with a special yearbook!

16
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:23,439
You're putting together a yearbook just for us?

17
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:24,213
Yes!

18
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:28,558
Oh, that's right. We didn't get to have
any pictures of you for the regular one.

19
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,606
Mr. Karasuma stood in as the E-Class teacher.

20
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,002
Not that we didn't appreciate that, but it
does kinda suck you weren't in a single shot.

21
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:39,789
Um... he managed to photo-bomb
a few under the radar, actually.

22
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:41,818
Makes it look like the school's haunted.

23
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:42,828
Precisely!

24
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:46,020
Why rely on those pictures
for memories when we have these?

25
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:50,584
An entire year's worth of candid moments!
A treasure trove of student-teacher selfies,

26
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,206
thirty thousand strong!

27
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:56,106
Now, then, let us sort through
and find the best ones together!

28
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:57,407
When did you take them?

29
00:02:57,523 --> 00:02:59,050
Anyone else creeped out?

30
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:03,127
And if it so happens we absolutely
hate pictures of ourselves, are we exempt?

31
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:04,148
Seriously?

32
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:05,692
My eyes are too small.

33
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,773
Not to worry.

34
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:10,809
I've taken the liberty of using the
"big eye" filter for maximum cuteness.

35
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,844
Wow. That's so nice of you.

36
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:16,731
You know, the shots they used for the
regular yearbook are sorta by-the-numbers.

37
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:20,193
And if we did one ourselves, maybe
we could go a little more avant garde.

38
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,597
That's the spirit!

39
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:24,898
Here we have cool beauty Hayami at a local pet shop!

40
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:29,414
And here we have a wonderfully kinetic
nighttime shot of Mimura on air guitar!

41
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,689
He-He was there for that?

42
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,539
And I'm just getting warmed up!

43
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:37,536
Princess Kataoka, resplendent in fresh royal vestments!

44
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:41,167
Sensitive Muramatsu, reacting to an icky cockroach!

45
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:42,588
And Okajima,

46
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,099
tearing about the campus in the nude for some reason.

47
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:46,724
Whoa! Hang on a sec!

48
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:50,689
I feel like this means there might be some
questionable photos of me floatin' around out there.

49
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,567
More questionable than that?

50
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:55,623
Everybody find your photos and destroy them!

51
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:56,462
Leave no trace!

52
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:57,421
Well, well.

53
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,663
Who would've have thought yearbook
editing would get you all so fired up?

54
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:15,910
Who did he think would want to see that?

55
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:17,347
Okey dokey!

56
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:19,873
Let's choose our picks for the School Events category!

57
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:22,591
What do you think of these, eh? Bring ya back?

58
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:24,506
Not bad.

59
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,564
This was definitely a year worth remembering.

60
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:29,481
Argh! I should've taken more!

61
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:31,005
This isn't nearly enough!

62
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,768
I wanted our yearbook to be at least ten thousand pages!

63
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:35,564
Why don't we burn 'em all just to be safe?

64
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:37,852
Friggin' dictionary's not that thick.

65
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:39,998
Outside, boys and girls!

66
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,756
What we need is a random assortment of cosplay shots!

67
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:43,963
That's it!

68
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:45,885
Oh, that's money.

69
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:47,814
Very nice.

70
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,151
Excellent! More outfits!

71
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,402
Is it me, or have things gotten chill?

72
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,081
I mean, Koro-sensei helped us
study for the entrance exams,

73
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:58,733
but aside from that, February's been a free-for-all.

74
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,397
Eh, it's more like we're at the mercy of his whims.

75
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:03,848
No. You're being spoiled.

76
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:04,398
Huh?

77
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:07,210
He's just proud of how far you've all come.

78
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,561
Figured it's time to let you kids unwind.

79
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:12,148
Everything up to now's been so intense.

80
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,922
Where's the harm in having fun?

81
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:16,338
That's what he's thinking anyway.

82
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:17,439
Oh, I see.

83
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:19,207
What about you, Mr. Karasuma?

84
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,067
All things considered, do you think we turned out okay?

85
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:23,537
Of course.

86
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,642
You've shaped up quite nicely.

87
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,977
In fact, if I ever fall on hard times,

88
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,321
you'll be the ones I call.

89
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,094
A man and a woman together in April.

90
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:35,664
Living together in as one in April.

91
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,903
Making love on average ten times a day.

92
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,439
She's been mumbling to herself a lot lately.

93
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,375
Maybe she found religion or something.

94
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:46,515
Huh?

95
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:48,680
Uh, what is this?

96
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:53,210
Come on now, don't be shy! You simply
must get in on the cosplay action!

97
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,792
Or don't you find the outfits suitable?

98
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,189
Oh, darling, think of our first night together!

99
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,621
Not a chance!

100
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,206
Phew! All righty, then.

101
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,883
That oughta be enough for all the campus photos.

102
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,281
Hang on a minute!

103
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:08,465
Do you mind telling us why the heck
we're all stuffed in a giant purse?

104
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,331
Alas, campus photos alone are not remotely sufficient.

105
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,828
What's needed now are mementos of a world tour!

106
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:14,814
You're insane!

107
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:15,727
What're you gonna do?!

108
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:17,107
Seems like a lotta work!

109
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:21,479
Nonsense. I promise this'll be fun.

110
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,992
A little time, a little effort, a little ingenuity.

111
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:27,167
And voila!

112
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,698
Gum-Gum... Slingshot!

113
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:52,324
So all I really need to do is pass this test?

114
00:06:52,523 --> 00:06:53,141
Uh-huh.

115
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:56,714
Just think of it as your ticket
for back-to-school confidence.

116
00:06:56,857 --> 00:07:01,426
If you can handle what's on here, you ought to be
able to breeze through first term without any trouble.

117
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:04,540
And in your free time you can
adjust to the new environment.

118
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:05,675
Right.

119
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,990
This is my ticket back to school.

120
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:12,285
This is my ticket back to school.

121
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:15,074
This is my ticket... back to...

122
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,033
school.

123
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:29,400
My secret blade.

124
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:37,012
Not exactly the use it was designed for... but...

125
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:39,227
Nagisa?

126
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:42,811
You've got this. Just stay calm.

127
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:47,030
Focus on the here and now. Believe in yourself.

128
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:49,596
Okay.

129
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,750
Getting to see that look on her face?

130
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:54,418
Totally worth it.

131
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,154
Now then,

132
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:02,276
where are we on what you'd like to be when you grow up?

133
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,730
Any progress?

134
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:06,995
Well, actually...

135
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,205
I think I want to be a teacher, sir.

136
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,572
Granted, I can't get up to Mach 20.

137
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,838
I'm not exactly, you know, invincible,

138
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,136
and my brain doesn't have the processing power of yours.

139
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:24,775
But still, I want to mold young minds like you.

140
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:29,575
Excellent. I think we've got it.

141
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,152
You and your classmates are equally endowed
with the same extraordinary but fleeting gift.

142
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,400
The sweetness of youth.

143
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,984
Keep swimming, Nagisa. Never stop.

144
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:45,250
Take advantage of what you have while you have it.

145
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:46,212
Right!

146
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,737
G'bye, sir! See you tomorrow!

147
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,566
Yes. Indeed you will.

148
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:59,206
I take it that was the last of
the career counseling sessions?

149
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:00,163
Mm-hm.

150
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:03,397
My, such exciting prospects these children have.

151
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,131
The only task that remains is
editing the E-Class yearbook.

152
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,914
Seems I'll be spending my nights here for a while.

153
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:10,761
Oh yeah?

154
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:14,648
We need an article on the development
of yours and Miss Irina's relationship.

155
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:17,523
If you wouldn't mind an interview,
it should only take five hours.

156
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,826
Oh to hell with that! I'm gone.

157
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:23,727
Uh?

158
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:28,351
Write about yourself. You should preserve your wisdom.

159
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:35,106
There's no getting around it.

160
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:37,433
Unconventional as this class has been,

161
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:38,927
we've all learned something.

162
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:41,930
The students.

163
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:44,274
Me.

164
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,257
Report.

165
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:53,417
Yes, sir. He's in the classroom by himself.

166
00:09:54,414 --> 00:09:56,596
He'll be there for the foreseeable future.

167
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,377
Well done, Special Agent Karasuma.

168
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,189
You heard the man.

169
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:06,154
We make our move tonight, March 6th.

170
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:08,878
Now, commence with the assassination.

171
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:11,997
Confirmed direct hit on the school.

172
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:12,981
Target?

173
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:14,530
Getting a visual now.

174
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:18,526
Ha-ha! Look! Not so much as a
scratch on the entire building.

175
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:22,235
Our Anti-Tentacle-Creature Permeable Laser satellite,

176
00:11:22,546 --> 00:11:24,276
a.k.a. "The Spear of Heaven!"

177
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:28,606
Modeled on the tortoise and
powered by antimatter life forms

178
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:31,910
the beam is amplified by a giant particle accelerator

179
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:34,246
and fired from 250 miles.

180
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:37,981
It's designed to pass through any and all barriers,

181
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,697
only liquefying creatures like our target.

182
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:43,819
A powerful weapon we've just deployed

183
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,465
without the slightest hint of advance warning.

184
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:53,409
What in heaven's name was that? My tentacles...

185
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:56,920
Impossible.

186
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,206
He dodged it! He actually dodged it!

187
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:01,654
A high-speed laser?

188
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,007
What uncanny intuition he has.

189
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:07,020
No matter, this is far from over.

190
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:12,112
Since he has the poor manners to be alive,

191
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,004
he'll likely hedge his bets and make a run for it.

192
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:17,847
But no matter, we're ready.

193
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,528
Tonight... will be a night of surprises.

194
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:40,081
Our Anti-Tentacle-Creature.

195
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:43,902
Permeable Laser Barrier, a.k.a.: "Shield of Earth."

196
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:49,675
Strategically placed camouflaged ground
facilities that emit a matrix of laser beams,

197
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,766
enclosing the entire mountain.

198
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:56,491
Is this?

199
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:01,228
There's nowhere to run.

200
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,223
The lasers penetrate into the ground.

201
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:06,689
A cage of light; Not to kill him,

202
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:08,791
merely to prevent his escape.

203
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,168
I'd hoped to finish him off with that first shot.

204
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:14,289
Once we set Plan B in motion,

205
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,815
it's a fair bet all hell will break loose.

206
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:21,335
Ready the ground troops! Case B-One deployment!

207
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:21,796
Sir!

208
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:24,434
What the...?

209
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,412
What's all the light?

210
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:30,050
We were so naïve.

211
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:34,008
Somehow, we got it in our heads
this would all end peacefully.

212
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,995
The government left nothing to chance.

213
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:39,259
They had everything in place.

214
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:42,628
Right down to the smallest, most horrible detail.

215
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:46,123
As you can see, these measures
serve to contain and eliminate

216
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:48,960
the clear and present danger to mankind's existence.

217
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:50,064
Thanks to the Shield,

218
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,748
the entity in question now has no place to go.

219
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:57,024
As it turns out, this is the creature
responsible for the moon's destruction last year.

220
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:59,148
We've only learned today that this creature,

221
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,481
this monster, rather, has not only made explicit threats

222
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:04,438
involving the destruction of Earth

223
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:06,606
but has been posing as a teacher, of all things,

224
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:10,623
in order to take a classroom of
junior high school children hostage.

225
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:13,614
We don't know why, but the evidence speaks for itself.

226
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:15,164
We have no choice.

227
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:16,189
What's going on?

228
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,284
What is that?

229
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:19,771
Nothing to see here. Move along, please.

230
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:22,599
This road is closed until further notice.

231
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,928
We're looking at another week
until the shot is charged up.

232
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:29,830
Perhaps firing the first one
at 20% capacity was a mistake.

233
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:31,076
He still saw it coming.

234
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:35,574
Since the jig is up, the next one will fire at 100%.

235
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,623
His death is assured.

236
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:42,725
In the meantime, we'll manage the inevitable
fallout from people looking to interfere.

237
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,664
Nagisa!

238
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:47,840
Kayano!

239
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:50,342
Do you see all this! What in the world is going on?

240
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,947
What?!

241
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:53,511
Trespassing my ass, it's our school!

242
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:55,173
Look, I told you to back off!

243
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,910
Nagisa! Kayano! D'you see the news?

244
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:59,102
This is absolutely terr...!

245
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,206
There they are!

246
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,556
Are you the poor children the
monster's been holding hostage?

247
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:05,637
Can you give us a few words?

248
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:08,499
When did it first dawn on you that
you were being held against your will?

249
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,207
How do you feel knowing your teacher was dangerous?

250
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,597
Koro-sensei's been captured?

251
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,863
Can you tell our viewers what it was like in a
classroom where the teacher could explode at any second?

252
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,898
Can you confirm the allegations he was train...

253
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:22,373
That's enough! It's none of your freaking business!

254
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:24,426
Do some basic fact-checking, people!

255
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:27,706
The probability of Earth blowing
up is less than one percent!

256
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,164
Our teacher's not as dangerous
as he's been made out to be!

257
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:31,591
Leave him alone!

258
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:34,022
The stuff they're saying about him isn't even true!

259
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:35,002
Yeah! Perfect!

260
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,700
Here's the human angle we've been lookin' for.

261
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,823
Are these your own words or simply
what the monster told you to say?

262
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:41,380
We know it must've been awful.

263
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:43,350
You're in a safe place. Let it all out.

264
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,370
Clearly these boys and girls are devastated.

265
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,451
Possibly suffering from Stockholm Syndrome.

266
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:52,106
No doubt the trauma inflicted on them
by this reprehensible creature runs deep.

267
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,783
Let's hope they get treatment soon.

268
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:56,998
I can't imagine. They're only babies.

269
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,333
Who could do such a thing?

270
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,545
As far as I'm concerned, this devil
deserves whatever they do to him!

271
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:03,023
I don't get it.

272
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:05,540
Everyone feels sorry for us.

273
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:07,774
You don't have permission to film here!

274
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:09,189
Pack up your equipment and go.

275
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:12,648
Excuse me, the public has a right
to know what's going on here, sir!

276
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,242
Oh, please! You're battering children for ratings.

277
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,577
Don't get high and mighty!

278
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,269
Everyone leave!

279
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:21,319
By order of the Defense Agency, this area is off limits!

280
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:24,371
Failure to vacate the premises will be actionable.

281
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,333
The students are safe.

282
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,613
They'll be taken into protective custody.

283
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,993
Mr. Karasuma, what have they done to Koro-sensei?

284
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:36,249
I'm afraid we're out of time.

285
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:41,111
The government had no choice but to initiate
their end game strategy before it was too late.

286
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:42,993
End game strategy?

287
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:44,947
So is that what this barrier's all about?

288
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:48,525
The barrier's just a means of
keeping him from being able to escape.

289
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,203
In a week, they'll use a
high-powered laser to finish the job.

290
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:55,817
You're kidding me! This was our assassination!

291
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,050
Yes, and your efforts have not been unappreciated.

292
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:01,289
But it's time now for you step aside.

293
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:04,017
So we do all the ground work and you reap all the glory?!

294
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:06,489
This isn't fair. Why didn't you tell us anything?

295
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:10,773
And how come the media's totally making
it sound like Koro-sensei manipulated us?

296
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:12,456
This is not cool, sir.

297
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,767
We were supposed to assassinate
him, and now we're being dealt out?

298
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:18,246
You know Koro-sensei won't stand for this.

299
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,183
He's expecting to be killed by his students!

300
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,064
Come on, Mr. Karasuma! Please!

301
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:24,106
You've gotta tell them to let us in there!

302
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:26,166
The mountain's been fortified, I'm sorry.

303
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:28,542
Elite forces have established a perimeter.

304
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,512
There're no openings to be taken advantage of.

305
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:32,939
Your work's done here.

306
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,110
No, it's not!

307
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:36,873
There's too much we still haven't talked to him about!

308
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,742
So many things we wanna try!

309
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:41,881
If you're not gonna help us, then get out of our...!

310
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:46,584
You know I can't let you in there.

311
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,898
National security is on the line right now!

312
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:53,187
Now, you listen and you listen good.

313
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,166
Do not give me a hard time.

314
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:58,287
Is that clear?

315
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,789
Give it up, Nagisa. He's not on our side.

316
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,874
Just another stiff-collared company man.

317
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:10,371
When it's down to the wire, only thing a
guy like him ever does is follow orders.

318
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:12,364
You're damn right.

319
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:15,791
And my orders are to protect the
people I'm entrusted with at all costs.

320
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:18,989
Bottom line. One way or another, he has to be killed.

321
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:21,343
Who does the honors isn't up to you.

322
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,488
Get 'em out. Have 'em escorted to a secure area.

323
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:29,988
Yes, sir!

324
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:36,397
Son of a bitch! Do you believe this bullshit?

325
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:37,996
Did you hear what he said?

326
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:39,012
What?

327
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:41,148
About giving him a hard time?

328
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,062
I have a feeling he didn't
just choose those words at random.

329
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:46,176
Okay. So?

330
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:47,472
Don't you get it?

331
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:49,562
Think back to what he told us earlier.

332
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,063
You've shaped up quite nicely.

333
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:54,623
In fact, if I ever fall on hard times,

334
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:56,084
you'll be the ones I call.

335
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:57,824
Those words.

336
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:02,163
I think saying "don't give me a hard time" was
his way of getting across that he believes in us.

337
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:06,706
Mr. Karasuma is counting on us to handle things.

338
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:07,731
I'm positive.

339
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:11,561
So, let's put our heads together and devise a plan.

340
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:14,365
We all know what the goal is here.

341
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:16,749
We know exactly what we're capable of.

342
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:21,540
The question is: What would Koro-sensei want us to do?

343
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,481
Buff, buff, shine, shine, make is sparkle, make it gleam.

344
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:29,677
That's the way!

345
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,282
Nothing like cleaning to pass the time.

346
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,431
It's a bit lonely, yes,

347
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,348
but there's no point worrying at this late in the game.

348
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,068
Of course, if I had one wish.

349
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,209
I'd like to see them again.

350
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,378
Just one last time.

351
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:13,589
I'm up a creek.

352
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:16,583
At least that's what everyone's thinking right now.

353
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:22,899
Alas, I'm a super-being capable
of moving at Mach 20 speed.

354
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:26,132
Fortunate, given how much I have left to do.

355
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,024
I can't bring myself to choose!

356
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:38,127
That does it!

357
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:41,664
The E-Class yearbook will have to be super-sized!

358
00:22:48,122 --> 00:22:50,395
Countdown to Koro-sensei's deadline,

359
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:53,271
approximately... three hours.
