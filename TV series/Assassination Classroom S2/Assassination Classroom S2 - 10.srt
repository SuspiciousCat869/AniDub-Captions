1
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:03,111
Surprise!

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:04,817
Tell us, Kunudon!

3
00:00:05,703 --> 00:00:07,786
Well hello there, boys 'n girls!

4
00:00:07,869 --> 00:00:09,036
Fall's here at last!

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,411
And you know what that means!

6
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:12,869
Food, studying, and festivals!

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,198
Kunugigaoka Academy's Fall Festival is the real deal!

8
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:18,806
With a great return-on-investment ratio!

9
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:23,109
Head-hunters from top tier corporations
come to scout out potential hires,

10
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:24,828
so be sure you make a good impression!

11
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,411
Unemployment is at an all-time high!

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:32,369
Don't be like those students whose poor business
sense makes them a laughing stock of the upper class!

13
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:34,210
Nouveau riche!

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,990
Hurray!

15
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:39,367
Our franchise is happy to lend its support.

16
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:43,563
Kunugigaoka's Annual Festival is extraordinarily popular.

17
00:00:43,786 --> 00:00:45,826
Projected sales of our product is one thing,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,828
but the publicity would be huge.

19
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:49,098
Mr. Asano.

20
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:51,261
These are very impressive figures you've drawn up.

21
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:52,999
I believe we have a deal.

22
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:55,596
A pleasure doing business with you.

23
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:59,704
Uh! What Junior High kid gets a corporate sponsor?

24
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,444
No blind spots.

25
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:05,472
E-Class will be blown out of the water.

26
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:42,259
Wow.

27
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:45,284
The main campus is really goin' nuts
over this year's festival, huh?

28
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:47,078
The hype is insane.

29
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,200
Probably 'cause they think we're up to something.

30
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:52,442
Word is Asano made a deal with some big restaurant chain.

31
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,690
Yeah, well. I wouldn't put it past the guy.

32
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:56,886
Then we will go for the jugular.

33
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,244
Figuratively, of course.

34
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:01,912
This competition will be decided by skills
not assassination related.

35
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:04,637
I really don't wanna lose to the A-Class jerkwads.

36
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,774
But what are we supposed to do?

37
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:08,054
Mm.

38
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,589
Asano has the right idea.

39
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:13,338
This all about providing something unique.

40
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:15,618
Give people a bargain and you'll draw them in,

41
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:17,111
even on a shoestring budget.

42
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:19,036
Sounds nice, but how we gonna do that?

43
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,411
Come now, children!

44
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:22,197
The answers are all around you!

45
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,040
E-Class can give customers a one-of-a-kind bargain.

46
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,550
On this baby!

47
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:27,962
And this!

48
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:28,969
And these.

49
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:30,089
And these!

50
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:32,531
Ingredients that have a lot in common with you!

51
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:36,203
You're all tucked away in the mountains
where your value tends to go unnoticed!

52
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:39,078
I get it! We'll hit our customers where they least expect!

53
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,786
What a cool idea! Assassination restaurant!

54
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:43,619
In a manner of speaking, yes.

55
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:47,079
Now brandish these secret blades
like you're going in for the kill!

56
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,433
Don't miss out!

57
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:54,611
Genuine acorn noodles, made from genuine acorns!

58
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,774
The brand new taste sensation straight from
the mountain's natural goodness to your mouth!

59
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:02,219
Ah! Upperclassmen! You know
value for money when you see it,

60
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,333
but you've never had anything like this!

61
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,290
Yeah? Can it seriously be all that?

62
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:08,369
Oh, yes!

63
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:10,634
Come experience the fresh-picked taste!

64
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:27,542
Hey. Cool place you got here.

65
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:31,110
Uh! The high school thugs from our class trip!

66
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,351
What the hell are you doing here?!

67
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:34,525
Hey, guys.

68
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,910
Huh, come to kidnap another girl?

69
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:38,801
Yeah, 'cause I'm an idiot.

70
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:42,518
You think I want your freak show
of a teacher on my back? No thanks.

71
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:46,048
'Course, I don't gotta get physical to wreck your day.

72
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:51,448
Not at all. I could just start tellin'
everybody your food tastes like crap.

73
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:54,054
Maybe write a bad review online.

74
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,044
C'mon, bring out the grub, son.

75
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,089
Our signature dish...

76
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:01,435
Acorn noodles!

77
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:03,303
Whoa! This looks great!

78
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,542
Uh, hey, Ryuki? Would it be okay if I get a Mont Blanc!

79
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,744
Dude! I gotta try the smoked fish! Pretty please!

80
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:11,160
Knock it off! Your stupid is showing!

81
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:14,228
Heh. One bite and I'll puke.

82
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,817
Only a Junior High kid would cook this up.

83
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,251
It's delicious!

84
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:26,343
Originally we were gonna do a
more impressive reaction shot,

85
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,911
but sadly there's already another
cooking anime that's called dibs on that.

86
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:30,824
Do what?

87
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:35,362
Not bad, right? I spent like a solid week
researching and refining the recipe.

88
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:38,369
The noodles are made from acorns,
thickened with grated yam.

89
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,953
The flavor was super earthy, though,
so I went with a rich dipping broth.

90
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:44,194
Turned out to be the perfect balance.

91
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,538
It was hard work, lemme tell ya.

92
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:50,988
But the end product is tonkotsu
soy-sauce acorn noodles fit for a king!

93
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:53,038
No kiddin'.

94
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:55,244
I ain't never tasted nothin' like it.

95
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:57,638
For Muramatsu, it's kind of a miracle.

96
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:59,719
Well, so much for blandness being a selling point.

97
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:00,703
Hey, Itona!

98
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,977
Shut up and get back to work!

99
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,644
Whoa! This stuff is da bomb! We should try everything!

100
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:06,741
Let's do the "Slender Caesar Mushroom" next!

101
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,161
It sounds awesome!

102
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,119
We're supposed to say it tastes like crap, dumbasses!

103
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,597
Oh... oh, dear.

104
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,286
Aw. You boys don't like any of the food
my students have prepared for you?

105
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:17,453
What a hottie!

106
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,328
No, no! It's amazing!

107
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:20,383
Really?

108
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:24,061
Then might I recommend the persimmon-loquat gelatin?

109
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,073
The texture is as soft as my skin!

110
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,089
Yes, ma'am!

111
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:30,458
And why stop there? Try the whole menu!

112
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:32,536
It would make me so very happy.

113
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:34,619
I need more cash.

114
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,623
There's an ATM at the station.

115
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,634
You can pull out all the cash you need.

116
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:40,744
Be right back!

117
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:42,613
Okay! I'll be waiting!

118
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,786
Not ideal, but I guess it's a start.

119
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:47,553
Yada's at the bottom of the mountain drawing in customers.

120
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:49,400
And Professor Bitch is at the top.

121
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:51,488
That's a sharp combo right there.

122
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:53,563
With Sugaya's beautiful signage,

123
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:56,053
Okajima's superb food photography,

124
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:58,551
Hazama's mouth-watering menu descriptions,

125
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,324
and Mimura's sleek website design,

126
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:04,511
we have everything we need to
pique our customer's interest!

127
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,353
Remember, it's only day one.

128
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:08,002
The battle is just getting started.

129
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,578
If my recon is correct,

130
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,796
A-Class is better at pulling in customers.

131
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,985
Welcome to our school festival debut!

132
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:18,836
Oh!

133
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,867
Hey Asano!

134
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,600
Hello, glad you could come.

135
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,744
Now you ladies enjoy yourselves.

136
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:26,844
We have events every hour on the hour.

137
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:30,624
My idol singer friends and some
comedians I know are performing for free.

138
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,129
The cover charge includes unlimited food and drinks.

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,036
When whatever's playing on one side of the stage ends,

140
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,604
the next show begins immediately on the flip side.

141
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:43,536
The entrance fee is only good
for half the performance space,

142
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:45,161
so people will keep going around,

143
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:48,041
shelling out their hard-earned cash for each new act.

144
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:50,337
Before long, their stomachs'll be full,

145
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,173
and E-Class high and dry.

146
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,262
Right, gentlemen. Let's do this.

147
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,528
I'll start hammering out a few power riffs.

148
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,869
You guys get ready.

149
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:11,286
No, seriously.

150
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:12,953
Is there anything he can't do?

151
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:16,378
I know! To be honest, it's
rather disgusting how good he is.

152
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,182
He's good.

153
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,136
But remember: He's not infallible.

154
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:22,369
Well he sure isn't going to lose
to E-Class, I guarantee you that!

155
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:24,136
That'd be a nice change of pace.

156
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:27,694
I'm sick of seeing our leader get his
butt kicked by those friggin' nobodies.

157
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:30,308
He's not the only Chosen One at this school.

158
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:31,666
I mean, after all,

159
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,400
we learned our instruments between study sessions, too.

160
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:36,676
Whaddya say we get out there and back him up?

161
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:37,569
Yeah!

162
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:38,500
This, please.

163
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:40,675
Ah-ha! There you are, Nagisa!

164
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,590
Look who I've got in tow!

165
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,230
Hey, Sakura!

166
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,451
You brought Mr. Matsukata and the gang!

167
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:49,636
Aw, that's sweet, Nagisa you kept in touch.

168
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,391
Yeah.

169
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,278
I help her study sometimes.

170
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,569
I had to show up!

171
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:57,583
When your personal tutor asks you to try out
their restaurant, you really don't have a choice.

172
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:58,911
Good business strategy.

173
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,293
With this bunch, we'll make bank on volume alone!

174
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:03,994
Sorry we don't have deeper pockets, but we're here.

175
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:08,826
Oh, my! Now this is superb!

176
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:11,566
Something so tasty is bound to sell out before long.

177
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:14,236
It's been kind of a struggle, actually.

178
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:17,744
Cooking it is one thing, getting
the word out there is another.

179
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,065
Really?

180
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:21,257
I wouldn't worry too much, though.

181
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:24,661
You guys have like this mysterious power, y'know?

182
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:25,637
Of course.

183
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,863
Keep doing what you do and word'll get out.

184
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,926
Let your customer base find you.

185
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,208
Thanks again!

186
00:09:33,244 --> 00:09:33,765
Bye!

187
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:35,130
Come along now, Sakura.

188
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:36,164
Huh.

189
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:38,873
Keep doing what we do and word'll get out.

190
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,152
It'd be great if people started talking.

191
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,122
We just have to be patient.

192
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,666
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

193
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:48,159
I, uh, heard all about your mom.

194
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:49,803
And why your hair's long.

195
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:51,741
I'm sorry I teased you so much.

196
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,563
Honestly, I never meant to hurt your feelings, Nagisa.

197
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:56,761
No, no. We're all good.

198
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,553
I can take a little ribbing from
you and Karma. It's no big deal.

199
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:00,418
Oh, good.

200
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:03,381
But I'll go a little easier on you from here on out.

201
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,411
Wassup?

202
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,696
Oh crap, I know that voice!

203
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:11,470
Nagisa! Long time no see!

204
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:13,344
No! No! Not Yuji!

205
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:14,309
We know him?

206
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:15,115
Oh, wait.

207
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:16,703
That guy from Summer vacation!

208
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,828
The one who thought you were a chick
and totally had a thing for you!

209
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:22,786
How... how'd you find out where I went to school?

210
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:25,675
It was easy. I just looked up the island's guest registry.

211
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:29,449
Uh, I've been kinda stalking you online
and I saw the big Autumn Festival.

212
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:31,396
Um, okay.

213
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,328
Hey Nakamura!

214
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:34,963
What the...? Stop!

215
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,296
Okay, I promise this is the last time for real.

216
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,411
We just had a conversation about this!

217
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:43,019
The kid is loaded, isn't he?

218
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:47,221
So, c'mon, don't be shy, we have to
raise our customer average any way we can.

219
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:50,053
Take one for the team, Nagisa!

220
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,801
Like it or not, the fate of this
enterprise rests on your skills as a hostess!

221
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:04,098
Man, did I pick the right time to come or what?

222
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:07,116
Pretty lucky I got you as a waitress, huh?

223
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,301
Yeah. Great spot, too.

224
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:10,818
Thanks for bringin' me here.

225
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,344
I'm lovin' the privacy!

226
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:15,649
And I'm lovin' that fact that no one else can see us.

227
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:16,953
Huh?

228
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,662
Cue cards? Really?

229
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:22,085
So, um, you know what I want?

230
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:25,203
I, uh, "want you to eat all of my favorites."

231
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:26,208
Sure thing, babe!

232
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,368
Just ask and I'll get everything on the menu!

233
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,869
This idiot's a total goldmine.

234
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:35,694
And a big eater. Rake in the cash, Nagisa!

235
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:38,506
Did I tell you I stopped smokin' those sketchy cigarettes?

236
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:40,952
You were so worried about me, it got me thinkin'.

237
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:41,937
Ah...

238
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,329
Here we go.

239
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,494
Oh! This looks amazing!

240
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:46,451
Lemme get a pic!

241
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:51,560
I feel bad about it, but if I don't keep it up
things'll get more awkward than they already are.

242
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:56,033
Okay, that is definitely crossing a line!

243
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,824
Hey! Brought you a gift, Karasuma.

244
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:01,737
Uh!

245
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,017
The colors up here are breathtaking.

246
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:07,005
I heard some rumors that the Reaper took you out.

247
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,111
He tried, it was rough there for a while.

248
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,828
But hey, I ain't no spring chicken.

249
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:14,076
I'm gonna need you to conceal that gun.

250
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:15,578
Who the heck is that?

251
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:16,666
And is he packing?

252
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,238
Want me to call the police?

253
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,203
Whoa! Whoa!

254
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:21,893
It's okay, uh... We know this guy.

255
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:22,935
He's...

256
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:25,453
"Mr. Yoshioka from the local hunt club."

257
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,621
Yoshioka?

258
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:28,647
What kind of name is that for a foreigner?

259
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,736
Oh, he changed his name.

260
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:32,308
Big anime fan.

261
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:34,478
Oh. Guess that makes sense.

262
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:35,299
Uh.

263
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:37,904
Well enough about this Yoshioka dude, or whatever.

264
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,604
Nagisa. Can...

265
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,305
Can I... Like... Ask you what you think...

266
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,080
Lovro.

267
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:50,559
The Octopus extended invitation.

268
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:51,639
Yes, of course.

269
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:53,753
I'm just glad to see you're still alive.

270
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,716
Your protégée's been worried, you should talk to her.

271
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,756
Indeed.

272
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:00,290
Wha... what's with the creepy old dude?

273
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:02,190
He step out of a horror movie?

274
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,350
He's Mr. Mild Yagyu.

275
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,244
He's kind of a big deal on the Asakusa theatre scene.

276
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:08,793
That guy's a comedian?!

277
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:12,212
He and Mr. K were talking about a, uh, a bit!

278
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:16,363
Yeah. His protégée used to be on the circuit,
but retired and became a teacher.

279
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,722
Mm-hm...

280
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:20,360
Ooo-hoo!

281
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:22,703
My gun's never tasted so good!

282
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:23,721
Oh wow!

283
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,027
I wouldn't turn down a bowl of
this stuff if it were poisoned.

284
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,011
Fellow comedians from Asakusa!

285
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:29,648
Ha, ha!

286
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:34,004
The one eating wasabi Mont Blac is building up
his tolerance for an extreme-eating sketch!

287
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:35,453
What can I tell you, huh?

288
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:37,377
We get to know all sorts of people.

289
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:38,815
Give it a rest.

290
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,244
Huh?

291
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,963
I can tell you're lying.

292
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:45,878
My old man's a big name in the industry.

293
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:50,194
I've been seeing burnouts and wannabe's
suck up to him since I was a little kid.

294
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:53,554
I know a front when I see one.

295
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,406
I can spot phonies from a mile away.

296
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,972
The girl I met on the island?

297
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:02,245
Let's just say a fake smile doesn't suit her.

298
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:05,783
You got me there.

299
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,317
Some talent, Yuji.

300
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:08,903
If you wanna use that word.

301
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:12,240
Not a lot of good about the baggage
you take from a skeevy childhood.

302
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:15,844
Look, I'm sorry.

303
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:18,915
I didn't mean to lie to you. It's not your fault.

304
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,994
I've essentially looked like this
ever since I was a little boy.

305
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,483
It's kind of a pain.

306
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,040
"Little boy"?

307
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:26,358
Lately,

308
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:29,828
I've learned that even a talent you're
ashamed of can be a source of confidence

309
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,643
if you used it to help someone else.

310
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:34,599
So I'm starting to make peace with how girlie I look.

311
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:36,648
I'm a guy.

312
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,119
Is the point I'm trying to get across here.

313
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,472
Well that's another lie.

314
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:43,453
No.

315
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:44,998
Well that's another lie.

316
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,703
It's not. I promise.

317
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,320
Show him the goods already!

318
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:49,019
What?!

319
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:52,514
Look at me and say this is the face of a liar.

320
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:54,802
This is for real...?

321
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:59,092
From the right angle, our flaws can be weapons.

322
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,804
If I've learned nothing else
from this classroom, it's that.

323
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:04,725
It's what we do.

324
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:06,973
It's how this café came together.

325
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,492
It's what brought everyone here today,

326
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:12,257
what made us a part of so many peoples' lives.

327
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,261
This may sound weird, but,
the thrill is out of this world!

328
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:22,744
Hey! Hold on! I'm sorry I tricked you!

329
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:24,328
Here, I'll give you your money back!

330
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:26,016
Whatever. I just...

331
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:28,353
I feel like a total idiot is all.

332
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:30,569
Peace out.

333
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,972
What? Aw, why's he leaving?

334
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:39,328
I was gonna see what he'd be
willing to pay for a cosplay shoot!

335
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,019
Exactly how much money d'you expect to make off me?!

336
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:45,228
Sorry, Yuji.

337
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,047
Bad move on my part.

338
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:55,444
Well, I suppose our first day went sort of okay.

339
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,428
They posted the sales report earlier.

340
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:01,936
Honestly at this rate we don't have a
snowball's chance in hell of catching up to A-Class.

341
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:03,764
Uh?

342
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:05,161
Pick up the pace!

343
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:06,655
We'll miss the morning broadcast!

344
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,124
Wha...?

345
00:16:07,171 --> 00:16:08,428
Is that a TV crew?

346
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:09,994
I don't get it, what're they covering?

347
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,083
The only thing up there's the E-Class building.

348
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:14,600
What the hell?!

349
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:15,760
Look you guys!

350
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:18,889
Somebody posted an online review
that's spreading like wildfire!

351
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:22,823
I did a little digging to try and track
down the source, and you'll never believe this.

352
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:24,507
It's by Yuji Norita!

353
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,286
Who happens to be, wait for it, the
biggest name in the food blogosphere!

354
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,619
Since he grew up rich,

355
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,994
he's tried everything from caviar to crocodile,

356
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:36,303
so the boy's palate, annoyingly
enough, is highly developed.

357
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,358
He's got a money-is-no-object, I'll-try-anything approach.

358
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:40,325
People love it!

359
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,565
Okay, then.

360
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:45,665
Of all the places to find great food,

361
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,239
you wouldn't think a school festival would be one of them.

362
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,203
But let me tell you: This place was "out of this world."

363
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,221
The menu changed my whole outlook.

364
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,628
Sustainable, organic.

365
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:59,918
They've turned a poor location into a big advantage.

366
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:03,270
"From the right angle, our flaws can be weapons."

367
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:06,163
Those words come from a buddy of mine who works there.

368
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:09,809
When I heard them, I thought to myself: Wow.

369
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,845
I've been so spoiled all my life.

370
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:16,189
Living in the shadow of my big-shot dad.

371
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,469
The privilege I've grown up in?

372
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,011
That's my weapon.

373
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:22,997
I can use it to help people,

374
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,667
which is exactly what I'm trying to do with this blog.

375
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,320
Trust me.

376
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:30,828
You've only got one more day,
so cut a beeline up that mountain now.

377
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:32,197
You won't be disappointed.

378
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:34,911
Taste it while you can and it'll change your life!

379
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:37,648
After that, we ran ourselves ragged.

380
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,588
With every new order, we foraged.

381
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:41,392
Cooked.

382
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:42,479
Served.

383
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:43,925
And sold.

384
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:46,252
Just about everybody we knew showed up.

385
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,033
People from school.

386
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:49,536
People from other places.

387
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:50,519
Everybody.

388
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,164
Uh-oh, guys!

389
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,219
This isn't good!

390
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,119
We're almost out of acorn noodles!

391
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:03,453
We sold a heck of a lot more than I thought we would.

392
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,371
Doesn't change the fact that A-Class
will have made more revenue.

393
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:09,840
It's okay, the side menu have
been selling like crazy, too.

394
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:12,453
I say in the time we've got left,
we should just stick with them.

395
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,928
We can go a little deeper into the forest if we need.

396
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,587
Pad our ingredient reserves?

397
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:17,818
Hm...

398
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:18,740
Huh?

399
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,597
No, I think it best to stop here.

400
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:24,303
But, sir, if we do that we won't win.

401
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:25,619
Perfectly all right.

402
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:29,453
Any more foraging and we run the risk of
upsetting the mountain's delicate ecosystem.

403
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:30,069
Hm...

404
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,161
We're all interconnected.

405
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,916
Every action resonates through the web of life.

406
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:36,953
Can you feel it, boys and girls?

407
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:39,436
The intricate bonds of shared fate,

408
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,471
of lives that have been touched?

409
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:43,090
People who've taught you.

410
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:44,619
People you've helped.

411
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:46,203
People who've caused you trouble.

412
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:47,928
People you've caused trouble for,

413
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:50,426
unlikely friendships, bitter rivalries.

414
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,560
We're all part of one another!

415
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,036
Ah-ha.

416
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:56,844
So today was just another lesson all along.

417
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,704
Aw, man, I really wanted to win this thing.

418
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:06,519
Oh, I'm very sorry. We're all sold out...

419
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:09,881
Really? Well, you are popular.

420
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,048
Uh!

421
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:13,389
Mom.

422
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,174
Here you go: Our last crimson-glory-vine juice.

423
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:18,931
It's good.

424
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:19,828
Thank you.

425
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:23,514
I have to say, this class is really something.

426
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,255
I can see why you're passionate about staying.

427
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,063
Yep.

428
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:32,738
So, uh, about all the unpleasantness the other evening...

429
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:36,433
Looking back at it now, I knew.

430
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,073
My boy's grown up.

431
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:41,294
He's ready to cut the apron strings.

432
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:44,368
That business about graduating from me,

433
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:45,703
you meant every word.

434
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:51,121
I don't know where you found the strength to say it,
but somewhere along the way, you got tough.

435
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:56,062
Just, please, for right now,

436
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:59,010
stay with me a little longer, till you're of age.

437
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:01,162
That's all I'm asking.

438
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:03,183
The world'll be yours soon enough.

439
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:07,830
I'm not ready to let go of my baby just yet, Nagisa.

440
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,817
Whatever else I may be, I'm still your mother.

441
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:17,161
Every connection we encounter in this world

442
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:19,890
teaches us a little something about ourselves.

443
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:21,374
So please,

444
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:24,045
as a friend, let me give you a proper birthday.

445
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:27,375
The connection we had.

446
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,998
Am I doing right by what it taught me?

447
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:32,896
Hey.

448
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,477
You?

449
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:36,344
Nagisa's mother just apologized to me.

450
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:38,369
Apparently she tried to start a fire?

451
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:39,447
Oh, that.

452
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:40,911
Water under the bridge.

453
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:41,763
Good enough.

454
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,440
Now maybe you can explain what she whispered in my ear.

455
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,661
She promised she would keep my toupee a secret!

456
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:48,994
What does that mean?!

457
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,863
A-Class is amazing!

458
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,477
They even beat out the high-schoolers!

459
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:58,867
Well, it is Asano.

460
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:01,331
Yeah, but check out E-Class!

461
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:03,095
They managed to come in third,

462
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,700
and that's after shutting down
halfway through the second day!

463
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:08,226
If you ask me, that's an even bigger accomplishment.

464
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:09,703
So did you actually visit?

465
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:11,660
After all the hype they were getting on TV?

466
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:12,719
How could I not?

467
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:13,661
I don't get it, man.

468
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:16,179
I thought bein' in Class E was supposed to be punishment.

469
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:18,657
But, they're all like doing really well for themselves.

470
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,327
I'm actually a little bit jealous.
