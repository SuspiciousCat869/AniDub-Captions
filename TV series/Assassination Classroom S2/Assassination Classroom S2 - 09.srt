1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,218
November: Maturity month.

2
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:07,097
Everyone's really started thinking for themselves.

3
00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:08,407
Which is good.

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:12,370
Because we only have four months
left to assassinate Koro-sensei.

5
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:16,596
Is the Octopus for real?

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,908
He's giving you kids career counseling now?

7
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:20,452
Wow, look at you!

8
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:21,896
In a normal outfit!

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,059
Yeah.

10
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:24,628
Thought I'd go for cheap and plain.

11
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:27,990
Just tryin' to fit in to your
regular old world, that's all.

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,372
Oh, come on.

13
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:33,320
Don't tell me all of a sudden you wanna see more skin?

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,343
No, leaving more to the
imagination is somehow even sexier.

15
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:39,218
You've really grown as a person!

16
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:39,843
Uh.

17
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:44,318
Uh! Nakamura! Did you write this?!

18
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:46,359
That's my future you're messing with!

19
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:49,495
Sorry, sweetheart, men's work just doesn't suit you.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,385
Hey, Nagisa.

21
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:50,959
Huh?

22
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:52,276
Which would you prefer,

23
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,651
Thailand or Morocco after graduation?

24
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:57,066
I'm kinda partial to Thailand myself.

25
00:00:57,091 --> 00:01:00,380
Why do I get the feeling
everyone's dead-set on neutering me?

26
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:03,344
Careers? Seriously?

27
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,222
Why're we talking about this stuff when
the Earth's on the verge of being destroyed?

28
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,497
Hm. What do I wanna be?

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,499
A bureaucrat, eh?

30
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,026
Interesting choice.

31
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:04,306
If I may say so, administrative duties seem rather, um,

32
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,664
restrained for someone of your temperament.

33
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,051
Well, remember the last quake?

34
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,637
How the politicians were completely useless?

35
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,943
I won't disagree with you on that.

36
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,605
The country should've been paralyzed, but it wasn't.

37
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:17,946
Everything kept functioning.

38
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:19,923
Who do we have to thank?

39
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:23,635
Behind every talking head at a podium
is some bureaucrat pulling the strings.

40
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,882
That's what real power's all about.

41
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:27,776
Does that make sense?

42
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:31,293
You know, I take it back, that's a good fit for you.

43
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:36,386
Take my advice, Terasaka.

44
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:37,586
Don't be a politician.

45
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:38,237
Huh?

46
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:43,139
I mean, sure: People love seeing a big-mouthed,
impulsive idiot on the ballot, don't get me wrong.

47
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:46,084
It's just that making you a puppet'd be way too easy.

48
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:46,776
Huh.

49
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:49,797
You're delusional, man. Like I'd be somebody's puppet!

50
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:53,239
Who the hell said I wanna be a politician?

51
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,376
Nakamura.

52
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:57,441
You aspire to be a diplomat?

53
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:00,905
Oh, to aim so far above one's modest beginnings.

54
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:03,892
You don't have to put it like that, sir.

55
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:07,753
Believe it or not, back in primary
school they said I was a certifiable genius.

56
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:08,943
In first grade,

57
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:10,828
I actually tested at a sixth-grade level.

58
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,424
I always placed in the top of my class.

59
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,755
The thing is... it really sucked.

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,868
I just wanted to be normal.

61
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:22,023
Not caring about grades, goofing off with your friends:

62
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,396
That's normal.

63
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:26,989
So, when I made it to Kunugigaoka, I played dumb.

64
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:30,086
After a while it wasn't an act.

65
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:32,843
Then I saw how disappointed my parents were,

66
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:35,346
and the importance of what I'd thrown away really hit me.

67
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:39,772
I still wanted to joke around, but
I knew I needed to apply myself, too.

68
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:43,035
This class is the best of both worlds.

69
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:46,405
What I mean is... Thank you.

70
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,527
Aw...

71
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:49,551
Miss Irina! Miss Irina!

72
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:50,551
Can I hear more of the story, please?

73
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:51,618
To look at them,

74
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:54,397
you wouldn't believe anyone's thinking all that hard.

75
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,273
But they are.

76
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:58,766
Uh-oh.

77
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,968
Miss Irina's top.

78
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:01,540
The tag's still on.

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
She's not used to buying stuff off the rack.

80
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,299
You think maybe we should tell her?

81
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,547
I'll take care of it.

82
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,250
Believe me, I earned that car.

83
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,267
Putting the moves on the CEO of a tech company

84
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,776
is challenging to say the least.

85
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:14,650
Oh, yes.

86
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:16,699
For one thing, the hours are atrocious...

87
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,801
if Karasuma hadn't forbidden
me to drive the damn thing here.

88
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:23,018
He says I won it by defrauding a man.

89
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:24,993
"I'm Karasuma and I hate fun!"

90
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,133
Okey-dokey. Last but not least.

91
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:31,401
So, have you decided on a prospective career,

92
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:32,566
Nagisa m'boy?

93
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:37,849
Sir, I... I think, well, uh.

94
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,759
I think I have a talent for killing people.

95
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,358
I'm pretty sure I could get to
where I do what the Reaper does.

96
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,756
We all know I don't have any other strengths.

97
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,445
So, I mean, what else can I reasonably shoot for, right?

98
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,767
Koro-sensei, should I...

99
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,658
Should I become an assassin?

100
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,587
Please, sir. What path should I follow?

101
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,659
'Cause I don't know.

102
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,298
You're a sensible young man, Nagisa.

103
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:13,906
And a good student.

104
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:18,615
I'm sure you would've weighed the risks of
becoming an assassin before coming to me with this.

105
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:22,269
For the record, you have a gift for the work.

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,836
No one who's seen you in action could doubt that.

107
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:27,401
Whether facing an otherworldly monster,

108
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,897
an unhinged teacher, or an evil genius, you prevail.

109
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:34,718
Your attacks are thought-out,
well-timed, and without fear.

110
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:37,609
All indispensable qualities for a master killer.

111
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,724
That said, of course.

112
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:44,499
While you are courageous, there's a tinge of desperation.

113
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,047
Uh!

114
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:50,535
You never give your safety, or dignity,
a second thought. You strike without fear

115
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,794
because you feel you have nothing to lose.

116
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:56,377
To what end should your talents be put to use?

117
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:58,418
More importantly, for whom?

118
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,926
Reexamine those questions more closely.

119
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,718
We'll talk again after you've
done a bit more soul searching.

120
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:06,506
I give you my word,

121
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,667
if you still wish to be an assassin,

122
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:11,073
I'll support that decision wholeheartedly.

123
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:16,385
Whoa! You beat it? Even the secret boss?

124
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,755
Not my first time.

125
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,035
I had to play it twice before I got enough experience.

126
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:23,331
Oh, I see, I'll start over. Cool!

127
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:27,337
I'm home.

128
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:31,365
Welcome back, Nagisa. Have a seat, please.

129
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:33,947
Sure, mom. What's up?

130
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:36,838
Not your grades, certainly.

131
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:38,572
Fifty-fourth on midterms?

132
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:43,424
The cutoff for being permitted back
onto the regular campus is fiftieth place.

133
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:46,428
I'm disappointed, but don't lose hope.

134
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:48,906
Tanaka's older brother was once sixtieth.

135
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:52,420
Of course, this was three years ago
now, but he managed to bounce back.

136
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:57,457
The school made an exception for him on
account of his family's rather generous donation.

137
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,269
The same gesture should work for us.

138
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:02,735
Whatever gets you out of that dreadful E-Class.

139
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,978
The sooner the better.

140
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:08,885
I'll be scheduling an appointment with Mr. Ono of
D Class very soon and I expect you to come with me.

141
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,740
No, wait! You... you can't!

142
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:13,968
Please! You gotta let me stay where I am for right now!

143
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,840
I know you don't like it, but honestly,

144
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:18,058
I'm bringing my grades up, and it's a lot of fun!

145
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,810
Look, I'll go to whatever college you want, I swear!

146
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,612
But for junior high I really, really...

147
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:24,334
Uh-oh.

148
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,801
She's in one of her moods, not good.

149
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:29,161
Here it comes.

150
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,252
Shut that filthy, ungrateful mouth!

151
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:36,420
I did not raise my son to be
driftwood, do you understand me?

152
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:39,048
Do want to live the rest of
your life in the shadow of failure?

153
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,443
You have no idea what it's like!

154
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:44,498
I work and slave to spare you the fate of
your poor mother and this is that thanks I get!

155
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,479
Do you think money grows on trees?!

156
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,741
You think I just pulled this donation out of thin air?!

157
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:50,221
Well I've got news for you!

158
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:52,554
I put myself through hell to secure your future!

159
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,152
Who do you think you are?!

160
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:56,985
There's no talking to her when she's like this.

161
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,189
It's my fault for not bringing
this up when she was in a better mood.

162
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:03,041
I'm sorry, mom.

163
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,504
I was being selfish. I wasn't thinking.

164
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,114
Dad doesn't have the stomach for confrontation.

165
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:13,401
This is why he walked out on us.

166
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:14,818
Now, then.

167
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:16,127
You listen to me.

168
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,357
You're a child.

169
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:20,559
You have no earthly idea how
to make your way through life.

170
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,609
But mother knows all the twists and turns.

171
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,392
I won't let you end up like your father and I.

172
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:28,957
See, I have it all planned out, just trust me.

173
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:32,318
The long-term goal is to get you into Keisetsu University.

174
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:34,439
One of the top schools in the country.

175
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:35,918
Mom didn't make the cut.

176
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,318
It's a great Alma mater.

177
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,826
Big companies take notice.

178
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,593
In the real world, it's not what you know,

179
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:42,775
it's who you know: School ties are everything.

180
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:47,135
A Keisetsu graduate could even have a shot at
working for an elite corporation like Hishimaru!

181
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:49,925
They're a famous company, who didn't hire her.

182
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,934
Have I ever told you how badly I wanted a little girl?

183
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:56,981
Only about a million times.

184
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,665
Your grandparents discouraged me from being too feminine.

185
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,572
It was always studying and hard work.

186
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,151
That's why Hishimaru didn't want me.

187
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:04,733
They're all about looks.

188
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:07,117
I promised myself if I had a daughter,

189
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:10,120
she'd get to wear are the frilly
things I was never allowed to.

190
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:11,201
Ah!

191
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,968
See how nice this looks with your beautiful, long hair?

192
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,665
Yeah. Looks great.

193
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,328
Except I'm a boy.

194
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,091
It's chilling how determined she is.

195
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,787
I don't think I'll ever be able to get out from under her.

196
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,472
Koro-sensei saw right through me.

197
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,694
I'm not, and never will be, the hero of my own life.

198
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,581
Not even close. It's her RPG.

199
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:35,496
I'm just her new play through.

200
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:37,635
Oh, and by the way.

201
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:41,782
Just so you know, I'll be dropping by the school
tomorrow to meet with your teacher for a transfer.

202
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:44,681
Huh?!

203
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:46,385
That's a little out of the blue, mom!

204
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:47,843
I think he might be busy!

205
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,909
It's for the best, Nagisa dear.

206
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:53,411
Now, if I were you, I'd say goodbye to my E-Class friends.

207
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,319
She's gone dark again.

208
00:10:56,314 --> 00:10:58,792
Nothing I say will make any difference.

209
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:00,810
I see.

210
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,844
Your mother seems to be rather single-minded.

211
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:06,561
Yeah, I know. What do I do now?

212
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:08,437
She won't listen to a word I say.

213
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,968
Mr. Karasuma's out of town on business.

214
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:14,285
I can't ask one of his subordinates
to meet with her on his behalf.

215
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,715
I'm just... I can't.

216
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:19,242
I'm not ready to leave E-Class yet.

217
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,568
Now, now.

218
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:21,752
Don't you worry about a thing.

219
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:24,772
I'm a super being capable of
destroying the planet, after all.

220
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,734
A simple parent-teacher meeting
should be a walk in a park!

221
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,198
Uh... I'm not so sure about that.

222
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,885
Wow, seriously? Your mom?

223
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:40,593
She's one tough cookie.

224
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,426
Koro-sensei seems pretty sure he can handle her, but...

225
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,977
I see no reason I couldn't play your teacher.

226
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:46,422
Uh?

227
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,010
Problem is, officially it's Mr. Karasuma.

228
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:51,379
His name's on file.

229
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:53,551
If our parents talk to each other it won't add up.

230
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,073
Mm. Yeah. Good call.

231
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:58,301
Ha, ha, ha. There's a simple solution.

232
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:01,557
Yours truly becomes Tadaomi Karasuma.

233
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:03,154
Koro-sensei?

234
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:03,978
Ha!

235
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:04,900
Why, no!

236
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,468
I'm Karasuma!

237
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,502
Worst cosplay ever!

238
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,414
Did you draw lines on your face with a marker?!

239
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,371
It's a furrowed brow to accentuate his bleak worldview.

240
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,284
Details!

241
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:16,833
Why do your arms look like summer sausages?!

242
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:18,868
These are Karasuma's bulging muscles!

243
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,639
You look ridiculous!

244
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,697
All I can do at this point is pray.

245
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,796
With any luck, mom will fall for the charade.

246
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:29,291
Please just let me stay in E-Class.

247
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:31,776
That's Nagisa's mom?

248
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:33,318
She's a knockout.

249
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,258
More like she'll knock you out.

250
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:38,516
It's a pleasure to meet you.

251
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,977
I'm Ms.Shiota, Nagisa's mother.

252
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:43,260
Yes, yes. Please, have a seat.

253
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:44,387
Good to see you.

254
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:48,240
Trekking up the mountain is
quite a journey, you must be tired.

255
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:50,472
Might I offer you a refreshing beverage?

256
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:51,176
I...

257
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,168
I guess it's kinda convincing?

258
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:55,885
If I may say so, madam, you're quite stunning.

259
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,266
I see where Nagisa gets his looks.

260
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,443
Why, thank you!

261
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,954
You know, if only this one had been born a girl,

262
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,757
I'd have groomed her to be my ideal!

263
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:07,235
Not quite sure I follow you.

264
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,206
Well, you see.

265
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:12,735
I wasn't allowed to wear my hair long and a
girl is ever so much prettier with flowing locks.

266
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:16,713
Oh, Nagisa, what I wouldn't give
to have had lovely, full-bodied hair.

267
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:18,760
I was so mad when he started tying it back

268
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:21,010
for school this year. But it looked so good,

269
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,174
I just had to let it slide as
long as he wouldn't cut it off.

270
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:25,478
Ah.

271
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,318
But we're here to discuss his future.

272
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,689
We can't afford to discourage them at this age.

273
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:32,104
They're far too impressionable, in my experience.

274
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,843
You're familiar with Kei U?

275
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:36,921
They've accepted several graduates
from Kunugigaoka High School.

276
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,051
I'd very much like Nagisa to go one day,

277
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:42,337
but I'm afraid being so far off track
in Junior High will hurt his chances.

278
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:44,676
So I've come here, with all due respect,

279
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:48,301
to talk about what we can do to get him out of E-Class.

280
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:50,757
And I trust you spoke with Nagisa on the matter?

281
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:54,385
Oh, he's too young to understand what's
at stake, believe me. And at any rate,

282
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:58,447
it's my job as a parent to steer him
clear of the mistakes I made at his age.

283
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,385
Mom. I, don't...

284
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,979
Hush up now, sweetheart, the adults are talking.

285
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:03,582
Uh.

286
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,204
Yes, well...

287
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:12,801
I believe I'm starting to get a clearer picture
of how Nagisa became the person he is today.

288
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:13,236
Huh?

289
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:15,602
Ugh!

290
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,844
Yes. Indeed. I, Tadaomi Karasuma,

291
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:20,703
wear a toupee!

292
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,209
High schools, colleges, and hairstyles.

293
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,260
Ma'am, forgive me for saying so,

294
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,936
are decidedly not a parent's prerogative!

295
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:31,650
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:34,337
Nagisa must be permitted to live his own life.

297
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,970
You'll get nowhere foisting your complexes onto him.

298
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,242
Ms. Shiota. Let me be perfectly clear.

299
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:44,291
Unless Nagisa so desires,

300
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,650
he will not be allowed to leave E-Class.

301
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:48,478
Uh.

302
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:53,897
What's the hell is your problem?!

303
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,969
Since when does a teacher talks like that to a parent?!

304
00:14:55,994 --> 00:14:56,901
How dare you?!

305
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:58,360
"Foisting my complexes onto him"?!

306
00:14:58,385 --> 00:14:59,635
If you think I'll sit by...

307
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:00,468
Whoa.

308
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:01,843
Holy crap!

309
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:04,630
That is one seriously pissed of lady right there!

310
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,426
Of course! That explains your attitude

311
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:09,292
at home lately, this bald idiot's been giving you ideas!

312
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,201
Well, watch this!

313
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:13,020
When I'm done with you, your eyes will be wide open!

314
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,561
Koro-sensei.

315
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:17,056
Hm.

316
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,631
That was a bit more tactless than I'd planned.

317
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:20,925
Still, though...

318
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,010
There's a lesson to be learned here.

319
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,946
You need to communicate your
intentions more clearly from now on,

320
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,290
speak your mind.

321
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,204
It's not that easy.

322
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,643
Mom won't listen to anything I say.

323
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:34,697
She only sees me as her second play through.

324
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,641
It's not as though you're powerless.

325
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:39,721
If assassination is your forte, what can't you do?

326
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:44,788
The first round of your own RPG started
here in this classroom, remember that.

327
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:49,675
My first. My first round.

328
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,443
Looks great, thanks.

329
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:55,426
Sorry for earlier, darling.

330
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:57,866
I ought not have blown up at your teacher like that.

331
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,962
It's just that I'm so invested.

332
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:01,635
Yeah.

333
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:02,719
Well, anyway.

334
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,674
I've been doing quite a bit of thinking today.

335
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:09,981
And I've decided I simply will not have someone who
thinks they know better than me interfering with my life.

336
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:10,754
Period.

337
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:17,149
All obstacles must be removed.

338
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,127
It's time I gave you a new outlook on life.

339
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:21,581
Nagisa.

340
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,218
Wha... What the...?

341
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:33,538
Mom?

342
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,468
This is where it all started going downhill.

343
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,385
When you started disobeying me.

344
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:40,672
This place turned into a monster.

345
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,546
Burn it to the ground.

346
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,885
With your own hands.

347
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:45,734
Get your life back on track.

348
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:47,771
Mom, please. What're you doing?

349
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,676
Calm down!

350
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,703
Mother knows best, honey. Listen to me.

351
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:54,372
Burn it down and the guilt will keep you from
being able to face any of these people again.

352
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:59,110
Plus, with the building gone, the main campus
will have no choice but to take you back in, yes?

353
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:00,276
No! I don't want to!

354
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:02,290
I brought you into this world, Nagisa!

355
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:04,635
I scraped to send you to cram school, then private school!

356
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:06,653
You have no idea what it cost me!

357
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,193
I do everything for you!

358
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:12,593
Every night dinner's on the table,
no matter how exhausted I am from work!

359
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:14,612
Does E-Class do that for you?!

360
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,475
I made you who you are! You owe me!

361
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,723
You will do what I tell you!

362
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:22,661
She's wrong.

363
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:24,400
But she's right.

364
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,977
How do I tell her, what do I say?

365
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:33,363
You need to communicate your intentions
more clearly from now on, speak your mind.

366
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:40,497
Mom, listen. I...

367
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:45,257
How 'bout you quit shrieking, you old bag.

368
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:48,117
Sit back and enjoy the show like a good girl, hm?

369
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,800
That bloodlust. He's an assassin!

370
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,741
Actually, it's you who's in my way.

371
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,584
It's Wednesday night.

372
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:59,295
He comes here to watch his favorite
TV shows on the Autonomous Artillery.

373
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,895
He'll shoot through here at the speed of sound,

374
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:05,627
and when he does, I'll split his
head open with my whip and kill him.

375
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:08,137
Kill? Oh, dear.

376
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:09,470
I have to call the police...!

377
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,499
Wouldn't do that if I were you.

378
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,593
The bounty's void if I kill the kid,

379
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:18,083
but nothing in the rules says I
can't take out a whiney old hag.

380
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:22,129
Okay. She's afraid.

381
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:25,267
Which probably means the assassin has his guard down.

382
00:18:26,502 --> 00:18:27,205
Mom.

383
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:30,121
I've spent my whole life learning how to read you.

384
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:33,323
It's given me a very specific set of skills.

385
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,365
Maybe not the ones you'd prefer me to have,

386
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,519
but they come in very handy.

387
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,689
Especially in E-Class.

388
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:47,544
The first round of your own RPG started
here in this classroom, remember that.

389
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:50,316
Mom. Believe it or not,

390
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,955
I'm giving this class everything I've got.

391
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:56,038
Before I graduate, I'll get results.

392
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:57,841
And when I do,

393
00:18:58,248 --> 00:18:59,375
I'm cutting my hair,

394
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:02,631
and paying back every scrap you've spent on me.

395
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:06,318
If you can't find it in your heart to forgive me...

396
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,866
What is this?

397
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:09,933
Then I'll graduate again,

398
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,030
from you.

399
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:22,477
Mom.

400
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,699
I'm grateful that you had me.

401
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:27,049
Grateful that you raised me.

402
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:29,845
It may be asking a lot,

403
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,880
but if you can just be happy that you have a child.

404
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:36,692
That, all things considered, turned out relatively okay,

405
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,402
that's all I need to be happy.

406
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:43,278
Who are you, Nagisa?

407
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:44,890
What in the world have you done?

408
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:48,507
Certain unsavory types have made
this their after hours hangout,

409
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:51,565
I recommend you give the area a wide berth at night.

410
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:53,420
Koro-sensei.

411
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:55,166
Just for the record,

412
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,476
you just vowed to kill me before March.

413
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,478
No takesies-backsies!

414
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,526
You heard all that, huh?

415
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:02,766
Now, then, ma'am.

416
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,220
Nagisa has quite a bit of growing left to do, I agree.

417
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:09,345
What he needs more than anything is a loving mother.

418
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:12,588
Don't take his stubbornness so personally.

419
00:20:12,905 --> 00:20:17,219
Every little birdie needs to leave the
nest at some point, that's the way of things.

420
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,785
My baby is...

421
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:23,733
pulling away. He's leaving me.

422
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,122
Mom, no!

423
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:26,343
It's all right.

424
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:28,340
The adrenaline rush got the best of her.

425
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:30,926
Why don't I take the two of you back to her car?

426
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:32,094
I'll drive you home.

427
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,943
So tell me, Nagisa.

428
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:38,449
If you did manage to assassinate me,

429
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:42,358
would you marshal your talent toward
becoming a full-fledged professional?

430
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:44,957
Good question.

431
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:46,410
I don't know.

432
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:48,676
Probably not.

433
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:50,740
I mean, when we're talking about talent.

434
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:53,806
It's not like it's only for one thing or the other.

435
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:55,633
I'd be good at killing,

436
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:58,080
but I'd be good at protecting people, too.

437
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,148
But definitely not by being an assassin.

438
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,935
Way too dangerous for me.

439
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,367
I'd rather find a career that wouldn't worry my folks.

440
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,367
No rush. You have plenty of time.

441
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,210
Ah, and keep in mind:

442
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:14,618
With your parents, communication is key.

443
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,261
Right.

444
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:20,933
Ugh! Come on, there's no cross traffic!

445
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,078
How long does it take to get a green light?!

446
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,568
And what's all this?

447
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:31,697
I'm making breakfast from now on.

448
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:35,114
So, uh, you can take it easy in the mornings now.

449
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:38,267
I'll start taking out the trash, too.

450
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:42,240
And hey, I promise to get into a high
school every bit as good as Kunugigaoka!

451
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:44,051
Just please, mom.

452
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,744
Let me stay in E.

453
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:51,400
If that's what you want, fine.

454
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,895
I really couldn't care less.

455
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:55,246
Ha!

456
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,850
I'm an assassin!

457
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:59,988
Holding my head high till graduation!
