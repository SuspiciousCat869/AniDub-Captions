1
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:44,989
"To be a guide. To be a teacher."

2
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:34,874
"To be weak," I said. "To be flawed. Vulnerable.

3
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:43,807
'Cept, of course, I'm not
really sure how to give you this.

4
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,662
A byproduct of antimatter organisms.

5
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:42,592
A little tight, sure. But crazy stylish!

6
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:07,256
A mere one tenth of a gram of antimatter
puts out as much energy as an atomic blast.

7
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,180
A present for me?

8
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,693
A year had passed since this unlikely pair's meeting

9
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:45,598
After all this time, the name's grown on me.

10
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:13,634
Aguri!

11
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:33,468
Ain't really like you to call
us all together like this, Nagisa.

12
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:18,077
All one need do is attach sensors.

13
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:41,547
All right. Time for a test drive.

14
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:54,022
An anti-matter discharge from
a lab rat on the lunar surface!

15
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:53,162
An assassin can't afford to be reckless.

16
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:02,162
An entirely new kind of learning environment.

17
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,291
And despite it all, she was hopeful.

18
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:40,712
And don't assume we're strictly in this for the science.

19
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:57,537
And he understood her.

20
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,945
And presto! A supersonic projectile!

21
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,574
And since you don't know when you were born,

22
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,265
And suddenly it came to me.

23
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,615
And the number of us hatching
assassination plots over the Winter Break?

24
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:26,635
And who's had time to think about were it was leading us?

25
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:53,552
And yet...

26
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:48,993
Anyway, I'm down.

27
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,489
Are the experiments doing this to me?

28
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:53,259
Are you kidding? That kiss happened to save my life!

29
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,597
Asked what I wanted to be.

30
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:59,803
Assassination plans were just hard to think about.

31
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,362
Awkward.

32
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,369
BFFs for life!

33
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:18,005
Because as of today, it's been a year since we met.

34
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:52,313
Before he realized it,

35
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:56,213
Before it's all over, we have to kill our teacher.

36
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:38,861
Block him in and fire at will!

37
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:49,809
But I know I'm more than equal to the challenge.

38
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:11,928
But knowing where Koro-sensei comes
from doesn't make this any easier.

39
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,711
But now it genuinely feels like she's part of the team.

40
00:02:19,952 --> 00:02:22,102
But your smile would be open and honest,

41
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:57,295
But... I'll give it my all. I'll honor Aguri's memory.

42
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:12,616
By splicing the particle acceleration cycle
of antimatter into the life cycle of a cell,

43
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,011
Bye, Kayano.

44
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,670
Carry on her work the best way I know how.

45
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:30,117
Coursing through the subject's body, antimatter energy
appropriated the tissues to create tough, flexible limbs,

46
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:26,458
Dammit! Don't just stand there like idiots!

47
00:17:02,993 --> 00:17:04,976
Do you know what it means to kill?

48
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,111
Don't be so dramatic. This wasn't your fault.

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,998
Don't go there.

50
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,144
Don't leave!

51
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,764
Don't push your luck, guinea pig.

52
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:24,838
Done!

53
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:45,934
Drop the acrylic shield!

54
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:46,993
Drop the jerk face and find
someone who treats you like a person.

55
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,114
Everyone spent the break wondering how
we're gonna face what's left of the year.

56
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:18,659
Fawning on every man you meet!

57
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,838
Feelings are difficult to kill,

58
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:53,343
Fire!

59
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,405
For sure.

60
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,289
Frankly, you're not even worth
the trouble of taking as a hostage.

61
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,215
Go on! Intercept him!

62
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:42,579
Goodbye.

63
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:46,186
Gradually, the nature of what
we'd been asked to do dawned on us.

64
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:22,577
Grafted onto human beings,

65
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:45,820
Guess I forgot to factor in the glass.

66
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:13,336
Hang in there, okay? You've got what it takes.

67
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:02,455
He could see there was no love between
her and her fiancé, the brutal Yanagisawa.

68
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:06,284
He knew that her little sister was an acclaimed actress.

69
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,550
Hearing his story, we understood the
reasons he'd decided to become our teacher.

70
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:34,313
Heh. If I take the Earth with me, so much the better.

71
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,861
Her many faults had been part of her charm.

72
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:30,713
Hey, Akari.

73
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:01,482
Hey. Karasuma.

74
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:23,286
His subject, the legendary assassin known as
the Reaper, underwent a daily battery of tests.

75
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,338
How best to reach her cherished E Class?

76
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:20,213
I bet one of these days,

77
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,138
I can't do this!

78
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,509
I can't give up on other people.

79
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:19,396
I can't quit.

80
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,869
I could get through one more year.

81
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:06,677
I could have slaughtered the
likes of you whenever I pleased.

82
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,168
I could've saved her.

83
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,220
I don't die that easily!

84
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:49,802
I don't imagine the holidays were all that much fun.

85
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:52,964
I don't know!

86
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:05,244
I don't think they choose their shape at random.

87
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,862
I evaluated my experience,

88
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:11,849
I guess so...

89
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:14,679
I just... I mean, why a present out of the blue?

90
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:06,304
I just... I'm too green.

91
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:14,463
I knew the risk, accepted it, and chose my priorities.

92
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,587
I know it... in my heart...

93
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,003
I mean it's been blast, right?

94
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:58,289
I mean, the latest crop of students...

95
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:32,887
I need out.

96
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:56,937
I racked my brain, day and night.

97
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,323
I think it's about time to
go. Sooner than expected, maybe.

98
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,736
I think we should try to save him.

99
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,356
I vowed to use my abilities to the fullest.

100
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:20,666
I want everyone to play hard and kill hard!

101
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:55,578
I was shot through the heart.

102
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:42,373
I was the top assassin in our class, hands down.

103
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:15,154
I will never turn my back on them.

104
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,156
I will take up the torch in your honor.

105
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:31,822
I wish I could hold you...

106
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:47,608
I wouldn't have become a teacher in the first place.

107
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,963
I'll die in a year either way.

108
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,521
I'm defeated, bumped out of the top spot.

109
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:42,510
I'm not even sure it's possible...

110
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,753
I'm not sure I can reach 'em.

111
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:38,917
I'm sorry...

112
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:54,949
I'm totally in your debt now!

113
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:51,867
I've been here long enough.

114
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,026
I've killed you...

115
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:31,427
I-I had a sneaking suspicion

116
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:58,500
I... I hadn't expected her to react as she did.

117
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:36,660
If I had your strength, I could...

118
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:44,843
If I wasn't prepared to adapt as needs demanded,

119
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,724
If I'd been there a fraction of second quicker,

120
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,500
If I'd thought about using these
tentacles for something other than killing...

121
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,109
If you could sacrifice a little bit of your time,

122
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:45,512
If you do, there's no turning back!

123
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:51,935
If you tell me all about this guy who's caught your fancy.

124
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:58,304
If you're trying to hit a major artery...

125
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:13,473
Imagine what you'd be now if you
hadn't been born where you were.

126
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:48,061
In a way, they're like you.

127
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,201
In the time I have left, I will be a teacher.

128
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:22,933
Ironically enough, the same day
as our graduation from Kunugigaoka.

129
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,410
Is this the thanks I get for taking you in?! Is it?!

130
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,471
Isn't it obvious?

131
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:25,606
It doesn't matter...

132
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:55,376
It looked super cute on the mannequin.

133
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:33,745
It was... It's like I was being brainwashed or something!

134
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:44,470
It was... the only thing I could
think to do in the heat of the moment.

135
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:08,186
It'd been nine months since Koro-sensei appeared.

136
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:31,506
It's Yukimura. Unlock door One.

137
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:39,868
It's a tube top with a cute oni pattern!

138
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:41,404
It's been fun, Aguri.

139
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,690
It's just possible they reflect
how you'd prefer to see yourself.

140
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:54,552
It's not responding!

141
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:06,702
It's on me.

142
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,541
It's really only a matter of stopping his heart.

143
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,314
It's students like them that make
we want to teach in the first place!

144
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:20,573
Just think about it. She's been on the outside looking in.

145
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:36,699
K-Kill him!

146
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:11,919
Kotaro, please!

147
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:11,975
Later.

148
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,939
Let's reap the fruits of torture
and see what I'm capable of!

149
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:37,004
Listen... You have a year left...

150
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,345
March 13th of next year.

151
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,039
Maybe I should...

152
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,979
Much obliged, Yanagisawa.

153
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:05,199
Nagisa flung me back down to Earth.

154
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:11,849
No matter what...

155
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,583
No one made me come after you.

156
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:53,494
No, no!

157
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:11,221
No, no, I...

158
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,546
No, stop!

159
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:56,092
No, wait! This isn't you! You're not the person you were!

160
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,065
Nobody had a better chance of killing Koro-sensei!

161
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:21,699
None of us wanted to face what this was about.

162
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,919
Not so much.

163
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:05,243
Now that I've been told the truth,

164
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:31,572
Oh! I almost forgot! You haven't seen
the fancy new top I'm wearing today yet!

165
00:18:35,743 --> 00:18:38,439
Oh! I almost forgot. I owe you an apology.

166
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,389
Oh, God, Aguri.

167
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,952
Oh, don't give me that line.

168
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:02,785
Oh, really? With what? Those little arms?

169
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,957
Oh. You're not a fan.

170
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,078
Okay, it's settled.

171
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,876
Okay.

172
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,660
Okay. The algorithm projects.

173
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,671
Okay... That was really stupid...

174
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:15,677
Okey-dokey, class!

175
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:07,304
Only when they're cold and buried
do we train our sights on the second.

176
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,625
Our feelings are always the first target.

177
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:49,864
Our mission became all too real.

178
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,558
Professor Bitch...

179
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:38,956
Question is: What does that do to
your sense of being their teacher?

180
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,151
Right! Calculate how long we have until our
human subject reaches the same breaking point!

181
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:08,400
Right, right. Let's go.

182
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:11,348
See you in a couple days.

183
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,953
Sh-Should've paid closer attention to where I was going.

184
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:51,191
She had seen everything.

185
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:25,649
She taught me to truly look at people.

186
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:49,775
She understood that the Reaper knew
neither his real name nor the day he was born.

187
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:36,359
She was wonderful. Through
her, I found my purpose in life.

188
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:43,967
She, in turn, was not unaware of the danger.

189
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,029
Slated for March 13th.

190
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:31,993
So I'm doomed to die a horrible death. So
what? It's not like I don't have it coming?

191
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:53,443
So is that a yes?

192
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:09,673
So now I play the part of his friend?

193
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,313
So please, as a friend,

194
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:18,801
So unless you want a pointless death, leave. Now.

195
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:41,799
So, how's it goin', Kaya... Sorry, Miss Yukimura.

196
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:57,588
So, then... cell division, exceeded natural limits?

197
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:55,021
Someone who can take them as they are.

198
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:48,579
Sometimes I'll be wrong.

199
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:52,233
Sometimes my old self will bubble up to the surface.

200
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:40,633
Sorry about the kiss. Honest!

201
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:47,410
Sorry about your Winter Break.

202
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:52,909
Sorry.

203
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:27,142
Sorry...

204
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:13,700
Still, though. This may sound cheesy,
but, they're a good group of kids.

205
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:02,895
Such wonderful tentacles...

206
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:37,746
Ta-dah!

207
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:13,000
Take my word for it.

208
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:03,737
Take the children as they are.

209
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:57,969
Taken down by a kiss.

210
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:12,801
Tentacle mines!

211
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:16,537
Thanks...

212
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:07,827
Thanks...?

213
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:55,095
That his easy smile and gift for small talk
were simply part of his wheelhouse as a killer.

214
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,900
That said, it'd be a shame to
waste this power in the meantime.

215
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,308
That stunning intellect?

216
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,664
That's just how important to me you are, silly.

217
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,513
That's my story, boys and girls.

218
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:10,553
That's the cost of doing business, and it's high.

219
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,453
The Assassination Classroom.

220
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:57,063
The artillery panels are stuck in the closed position!

221
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,695
The atmosphere's changed.

222
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:10,117
The bastard's been playing us from the beginning!

223
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:12,048
The day the Reaper will die and
take the entire world with him.

224
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,678
The end was nigh.

225
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,865
The first time they knew one another's touch,

226
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,255
The fun times.

227
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:34,141
The happy times.

228
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:32,592
The infuriating times.

229
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:46,881
The moon?!

230
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,554
The person who taught me how to be a teacher

231
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:51,478
The question was: How?

232
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,027
The scary times.

233
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:26,437
The tentacles spoke to me.

234
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,837
The truth was gonna come out one way or another.

235
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:42,230
Then he really understood.

236
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,390
Then, of course, I did give you quite a bit to work with.

237
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,982
There is no one as important as you.

238
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,741
There's something I wanted to talk to you about.

239
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,981
They feel the gravity of what needs to be done.

240
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:25,688
They need a teacher, someone who believes in them.

241
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,949
They're so, I dunno, unique.

242
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:17,291
Third term is upon us!

243
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:29,454
This hurts so much.

244
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,008
This is my life from now on!

245
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:03,188
This new body... it's effectively invincible.

246
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:06,502
This ought to keep you warm, and
more importantly, it's fashionable!

247
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:00,876
This was something completely new.

248
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,866
Those tentacles do a good job of keeping you honest.

249
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:47,831
Those tentacles gave me an
edge. Speed, firepower, the works.

250
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:07,828
To actually end someone's life?

251
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:49,317
To pass the gift of personal growth on to you.

252
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:41,071
To perceive weakness in others.
Not to exploit, but protect.

253
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:28,214
To respect everyone as an equal,

254
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:08,083
Too... whatever.

255
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:33,415
Turns out my schedule's open tonight. Wanna grab dinner?

256
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,243
U-Um! What're you talking about?!

257
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,177
Ugh, what a relief! I was sure you were through with me!

258
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:55,581
Ugh...

259
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:52,206
Uh... Um... It's too out there, isn't it?

260
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:07,963
Unless your abilities surpass mine, sweetheart,

261
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:41,713
Very little, actually.

262
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:28,096
Vividly, in living color, our minds
flooded with memories of the past year.

263
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,035
Wandering in the dark,

264
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:56,976
Warts and all.

265
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,071
Was precisely zero.

266
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:56,674
We don't kill out of greed, we
don't kill out of desperation.

267
00:20:57,247 --> 00:20:59,359
We don't let ourselves become animals.

268
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,474
We put him down like a dog.

269
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:06,662
We should probably head out.
I'm certain she needs her rest.

270
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:11,220
We'd all grown by leaps and bounds.

271
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:38,909
We're listening.

272
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,236
We've all been in denial.

273
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,732
We've rung in the New Year. Today is January sixth.

274
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:37,655
Well, all right, then.

275
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:52,344
Well, hey, at least I'll make it back for the new term.

276
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,362
What about you? D'you make use of the time off?

277
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:09,962
What do you mean?

278
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:15,153
What should we do, sir?!

279
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,440
What the hell am I supposed to do?!

280
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,675
What's the deal?

281
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:17,258
What's the matter? You good?

282
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,877
What's wrong with the security system?!

283
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:15,274
Whatever his past, he was the
best teacher we could've asked for.

284
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,623
Whatever you kids decide, think it through first.

285
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:30,202
Whether it's here or somewhere else.

286
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,191
Who do you think you are?!

287
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:38,870
Who's the new man in your life?

288
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:34,672
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

289
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,824
Why didn't I...? Why couldn't I just...?

290
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,983
Why do you sound like you're
on cloud nine all of a sudden?

291
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:52,923
Why must it always be death and destruction?!

292
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:45,836
Why? There was more than enough time...

293
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:29,249
Why? Why did you...?

294
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:55,521
Why? Why...?

295
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:08,672
With hands like these... you could reach them...

296
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:38,111
Yanagisawa dubbed these "tentacles," and
reinforced the restraining table as a precaution,

297
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:52,622
Yanagisawa's hounding me to quit my
teaching job and work here full-time.

298
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:17,200
Yanagisawa's research enabled rapid
regeneration of organic compounds.

299
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:38,820
Yeah, especially those.

300
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:03,403
Yeah. I'm sorry. It's all my fault, really.

301
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:02,761
Yeah. You keep saying your neck is cold, so...

302
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:58,096
Yes!

303
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:02,743
Yes, sir!

304
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:50,415
Yes, sir! Seventy percent destroyed!

305
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:54,732
You bet. Your treat.

306
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,202
You can call Kayano.

307
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:27,054
You can't be surprised.

308
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,921
You can't blame yourself.

309
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,765
You can't give up without trying! There has to be a way...

310
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,368
You gonna stop me?

311
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,382
You have to do something right now! Help him!

312
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,207
You knew the kids'd be like this.

313
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,448
You know I'm engaged!

314
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:29,209
You listen to me babble on about my personal
life all the time, and give me great advice.

315
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,189
You mad at me?

316
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:33,049
You never learn, huh?

317
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,365
You should've been the one to kill me.

318
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,034
You stupid bitch!

319
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,604
You worry too much.

320
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,199
You! Notify the Americans immediately!

321
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:17,629
You'd still be smart, slightly
perverted, a little bit goofy,

322
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,416
You're gonna need more than this.

323
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:33,164
You're right: It's all fun
and games until things get real.

324
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:49,276
You're... You're better than this!

325
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,674
You've been my rock through all this.

326
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:36,677
Your taste in clothes sets women back by ten years.

327
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:01,416
a grain of sand will do the trick.

328
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,474
and somewhere along the way,

329
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,877
but instead of killing Koro-sensei,

330
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:20,707
but they're a lot harder to resurrect.

331
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:43,319
collected all the knowledge I could,
and prepared to pick up where she left off.

332
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,042
give the children the tools to succeed...

333
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:55,546
his smile was no longer just a means to an end.

334
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:41,098
leaving Aguri alone to monitor his creation.

335
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,538
let me give you a proper birthday.

336
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,321
not define human beings by their weakness.

337
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:23,794
not just a means to an end.

338
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,560
not to mention remarkably stubborn.

339
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,510
possessed of an astonishing dexterity.

340
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,908
there's at least some sense of closure about Aguri.

341
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,608
they become the ultimate killing machine!

342
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:15,754
they'd become something not unlike old friends.

343
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:52,027
waiting for someone to turn on the light.

344
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:22,034
was none other than Aguri Yukimura.

345
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:23,487
was three hours before the moon exploded.

346
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:22,899
why not treat our "anniversary" like your birthday?

347
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:33,792
yelling wouldn't be enough to stop you.

348
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:11,594
you don't have a prayer of stopping
me anymore than you do saving me.

349
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,859
you'll meet someone just as important to you.
