1
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:03,824
End-of-term exams were over.

2
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:05,103
Victory was total,

3
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:08,650
but no sooner had we gotten the
results than the principal showed up,

4
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:11,198
Koro-sensei's walking papers in hand.

5
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:14,353
The man challenged his rival to a one-sided game.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,888
Come now, Koro-sensei.

7
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:20,615
Validate my ideology and be the cornerstone of my vision.

8
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:37,266
Mm?

9
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:39,256
Alright-y, then!

10
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:41,505
Open, solved, and closed!

11
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:44,900
Fortunately, I just so happen to remember more or less

12
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:48,102
which questions are on what page
in this particular series of books.

13
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:50,144
Math was the only trouble spot.

14
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:53,685
That one's been loaned out to a student
for so long I'd forgotten.

15
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:57,093
You know these books backwards and forwards?

16
00:00:57,644 --> 00:00:59,519
A rather remarkable coincidence.

17
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,226
Oh, not just these.

18
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:04,113
I've committed all of Japan's test materials to memory.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,848
You say no moving out of the blast radius
until the given problem is solved?

20
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,777
Very well.

21
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:11,953
That little caveat is nothing to a passionate educator.

22
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:13,625
I'm sorry, sir.

23
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,322
You sincerely thought you'd gotten the better of me, huh?

24
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:17,338
My, my.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,209
A-Class' crushing defeat must have you in a tizzy.

26
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:25,772
I'm afraid this one-dimensional stratagem
may wind up getting the better of you.

27
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:28,454
There we have it. The last book.

28
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:30,257
Your turn, I believe.

29
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:32,812
What does it feel like,

30
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:35,266
staring your own demise in the face?

31
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:40,588
They say one's life flashes before one's eyes.

32
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,359
What do you see, Principal?

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,271
What's flickering by in that exemplary brain?

34
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,161
Sir?

35
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:49,506
Sir?

36
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:51,053
Mr. Asano?

37
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:30,647
Two monsters, teaching at the same school.

38
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,166
One to atone for his strength.

39
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:38,017
The other to atone for his weakness.

40
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:42,583
A noble effort, Ikeda.

41
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:45,101
Maybe next time. Hey.

42
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:48,660
A deal's a deal. So, study and behave yourself today.

43
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:53,632
Uh. Aw, dang! No fair, sir.
You're totally a superhuman or something.

44
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:55,981
Hey, Mr. Asano?

45
00:03:56,553 --> 00:04:00,352
Why does a beast like you start a cram school
in an abandoned shack like this?

46
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:03,935
I'd have thought you'd graduated from some big college
with loads of credentials and stuff.

47
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,611
No offense, sir, but it seems
like a waste of talent to me.

48
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:09,031
Not to mention how far we all gotta hike.

49
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,306
Come now, Nagai.

50
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,573
Nothing is for naught in this world of ours.

51
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,894
This mountain is wonderfully scenic.

52
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,103
And the hike is good exercise.

53
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:18,685
What about funds?

54
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:20,435
Bet this place is in the red.

55
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:22,477
Don't worry, Mori my dear.

56
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,310
My stock portfolio more than makes up for the deficit.

57
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,610
I don't mean to brag, but I'm
something of a financial wiz.

58
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:31,502
As you can see, this month I'm happily in the black.

59
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:33,060
He's superhuman!

60
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:36,394
So why does someone so awesome
get into teaching in the first place?

61
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,546
If you wanna make us that awesome,
you've got your work cut out for you.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,767
Don't overthink it.

63
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:43,534
All I ask is you try to be good students.

64
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,998
Remember, the bar is set differently for everyone.

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,804
But your enthusiasm is an asset, Ikeda.

66
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,060
As is Mori's cleverness.

67
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:55,549
And of course Nagai's diligence.

68
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:56,463
You see?

69
00:04:56,857 --> 00:05:01,352
Each of you has your very own strength, but you're right.
I do have my work cut out for me:

70
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,857
To properly teach you,

71
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,527
I'm going to need to have all
your strengths combined and more.

72
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,342
The private cram school was off to a promising start.

73
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,458
Three students of my inaugural term were ideal.

74
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:19,542
In the peace and quiet of the mountain, I
could shape their minds to my heart's content.

75
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:23,667
A model education. My dream come true.

76
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,795
Ow!

77
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,229
Aw c'mon, don't be a baby. I gave you a heads-up.

78
00:05:28,254 --> 00:05:30,423
Next time move. What're you, a snail?

79
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:31,769
Uh. We just got out.

80
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:33,644
Really? Why're you so rowdy?

81
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:36,327
Whatever. Basketball stars can't just study!

82
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:39,077
Gimme a break. I've got tons of pent-up energy!

83
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:41,812
You don't say? A basketball star?

84
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:43,293
Heh. Fine dream.

85
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,011
How 'bout you and I play a little one-on-one?

86
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:49,894
U-Uh. Yeah, right!

87
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,024
Like I could win against a superhuman!

88
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:52,919
Good point.

89
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:56,758
I have one or two abilities
you haven't cultivated in yourself just yet, huh?

90
00:05:57,935 --> 00:05:58,912
Interesting.

91
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:02,115
Your classmates could just as well say the same about you.

92
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:06,144
I, uh, sorry, Nagai.

93
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:07,425
Oh, it's cool.

94
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,348
Everyone has faults.

95
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,266
We all have to grow into our strength, but also
come to understand how it affects those around us.

96
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:21,078
I put everything I had into my daily lesson plans.

97
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:26,689
In just one year the students
were coming along brilliantly.

98
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:30,890
What's this?

99
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:33,910
A Kunugi oak-leaf tie clip! Neat, huh?

100
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,935
We pooled our allowances together to buy it.

101
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:39,193
Pro'ly peanuts compared to what you make
off your stock portfolio.

102
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:40,891
Now, now.

103
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,714
Just because it's grown a thousand percent...

104
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,282
Wow. You seriously could've kept that to yourself.

105
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:47,916
I... I'll cherish this.

106
00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:51,523
Ha, ha. Hey, you got us into our first-pick schools!

107
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:53,770
Yeah! No way we could've done it without you!

108
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:55,852
When I grow up, sir.

109
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:57,830
D'you, mind if I come and visit some time?

110
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,043
How time flies.

111
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:04,961
They'd grown into such wonderful students.

112
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:09,410
Parents saw my track record.

113
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,921
Soon, children enrolled from all over.

114
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,699
Three short years later, my
little cram school was booming.

115
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:21,700
Ah! How long has it been?

116
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:25,644
Ikeda! Great to hear from you!

117
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,020
Long time no see!

118
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:29,185
Things are going good for you, huh?

119
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,585
Can't complain. What can I do for you?

120
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,727
Oh, nothin' really.

121
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,125
I just wanted to catch up and see how you were doin'.

122
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,105
That's very kind. Thank you.

123
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,785
Uh, ah, what about you?

124
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,854
Not out there causing trouble, I hope?

125
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,820
Ha! No sir!

126
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:47,060
I'm just a regular Samaritan now, thanks to you!

127
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:50,362
Anyway, you sound busy. I should let you go.

128
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:53,884
Let's do dinner sometime! Your treat, of course.

129
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,701
Later!

130
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:02,069
I have business in that neck of the woods next week.

131
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:03,963
Perhaps I'll stop by.

132
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,278
They said it was a suicide.

133
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,824
Some horrible older boy on his team
drove him to it, apparently.

134
00:08:20,077 --> 00:08:22,077
Used to beat him up, and take his money.

135
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:23,644
Poor thing couldn't take it anymore.

136
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:24,724
That's awful!

137
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,202
And he'd been such a sweet boy since junior high.

138
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:28,174
Still, though.

139
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:31,963
I mean, you'd think the young
man would stand up for himself.

140
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:36,798
What on earth have I been teaching these children?

141
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,980
How to be good students? What was I thinking?

142
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:43,598
Does dying make you a good student?

143
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:47,428
I have an obligation to make them strong,

144
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,615
or this will have been for nothing.

145
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:54,269
But then, what is strength?

146
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,402
Until I have the answer, I have no right to teach.

147
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,703
From there, things changed quickly.

148
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:07,774
I learned all sorts of strengths.

149
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:12,076
I sweet-talked the men who drove my student to suicide,

150
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:15,495
put them on the road toward a
disastrous gambling addiction.

151
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,695
That's how I fine-tuned my brainwashing techniques.

152
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,487
Soon, I opened another school,

153
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:28,209
and the old campus building that symbolized my weakness

154
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,448
would stand as a lesson to others.

155
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:35,382
Strong. I wanted to make them strong.

156
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:41,086
Strong young men and women who could survive,
sacrificing others if need be.

157
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:44,379
To that end,

158
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:47,509
I would need more funding, more staff.

159
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:50,839
If it could serve my goal, I would use it.

160
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:56,221
All to educate, to breed true strength.

161
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,269
Yet here I stand,

162
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:02,190
abandoned by the strong and the weak alike.

163
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,639
The only thing before me, certain death.

164
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,516
What will it be, Principal?

165
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:11,973
Will you open the last book, or fold?

166
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,244
You may be an exceptional human being, sir,

167
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:18,285
but taking a grenade blast won't end well for you.

168
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:20,275
This was your idea, 'case you forgot!

169
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:23,362
But hey it's no big deal, just gracefully admit defeat.

170
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:30,224
And just so you're aware, fire Koro-sensei all
you want, it doesn't make any difference to us.

171
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:32,977
Don't get us wrong,
it'll be sad to leave this place behind.

172
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:35,676
But whatever comes, we're going right along with him.

173
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:36,859
That's right!

174
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:40,337
Even if we gotta run away from home, or hole up in a cave!

175
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,158
We'll keep this class going.

176
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,245
It's not over until March!

177
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:47,350
Why have I indulged them this far?

178
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:50,386
E-Class has been a thorn in my side all year.

179
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:55,824
Such presumptuous, bald-faced defiance. Such a stain.

180
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,393
Koro-sensei.

181
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:00,372
Eh?

182
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,399
You may well destroy the Earth.

183
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:05,625
Even so, as far as my educational philosophy,

184
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:08,681
it would make absolutely no difference whatsoever.

185
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,852
Whether now, or in March,

186
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,253
death will come for us all in the end.

187
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,756
Strength won't matter.

188
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:23,777
My students won't suffer alone, and, in a way,

189
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,271
my vision will have been fulfilled.

190
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,973
Somebody forgot about my molt.

191
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,301
Your once-a-month trick?

192
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:44,206
And why precisely would you not use it on yourself?

193
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,685
Because I was saving it for you, silly man.

194
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,873
I suspected if I won, odds were fairly good
you'd think nothing of blowing yourself to bits.

195
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,127
But, how could you be so sure of what I'd do?

196
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,376
Because, we have a lot in common.

197
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,346
We're both stubborn education fiends,

198
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:07,300
willing to forfeit our lives
for the privilege of molding young minds.

199
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:09,644
I hope you won't mind,

200
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:13,019
but I took the liberty of speaking
to your old cram school students.

201
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:15,663
I wanted to get their impressions of you as a teacher.

202
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:22,230
Imagine my surprise upon learning that the
idea of teaching you exemplified 12 years ago

203
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:23,479
is identical to mine.

204
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:26,143
Though as far as students are concerned, I've been lucky.

205
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,421
E-Class is a marvelous proving ground.

206
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,852
There are a fair number of students, you see,

207
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:33,235
and they all share the same predicament.

208
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:35,517
These boys and girls work as a team,

209
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,452
unafraid to ask for help or to hold each other up.

210
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:41,372
And if I may point out,

211
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:46,411
credit for conceiving of and implementing
this class, goes first and foremost to you.

212
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,098
There you have it. Don't you see, sir?

213
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,654
You've been abiding by the same
vision you began with all along.

214
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:57,494
Incidentally, I'm the only thing this knife can kill.

215
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,838
The taking of human life plays no part in our approach.

216
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,352
You and I are one and the same, Principal.

217
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:06,455
We don't teach killing, we teach life.

218
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:10,511
So why not stay true to ourselves
and continue down this road?

219
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,736
Playing outdoors is fine, Ikeda.

220
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,524
Playing hooky? I don't think so.

221
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:19,468
Heh. I'm an athlete. I can't be cooped up.

222
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,056
Right? Gimme a break!

223
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:23,449
I propose a game.

224
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,348
Once every school day.

225
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,810
You have my permission to try and attack me.

226
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,574
Manage to get a hit and I'll
let you skip class for that day.

227
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:34,147
You serious?! You'd really let me do that?!

228
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:34,881
Sure.

229
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:36,631
You gotta deal, sir!

230
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:39,093
If I hit ya, I get to ditch! No take-backs.

231
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:40,338
You have to see it through!

232
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:45,195
My philosophy's always been right on the nose.

233
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,227
Students have to be strong.

234
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,156
My successes over the past 12 years prove this.

235
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:54,727
And, I suppose, so long you
acknowledge its proper function,

236
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:59,455
I see no reason why you and E-Class
can't remain here as you are.

237
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,701
Still too proud to admit defeat, I see.

238
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:10,830
Oh, and do mind if pop by and try my
hand at killing you once in a while?

239
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,131
Be my guest.

240
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,440
Always happy to oblige a worthy rival.

241
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,700
That pristine facade is crumbling.

242
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:26,784
You've lost. I can tell by your face.

243
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,035
Something I can help you with, Asano?

244
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:33,224
No, no. Just thought I'd come by to cheer you up.

245
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,108
That and show you my wounded face.

246
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:39,437
Perhaps some monetary compensation
would help ease the pain a bit?

247
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,101
Ha, ha. Feel free to take me to court.

248
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:45,017
Though of course, don't expect to win.

249
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,264
You'll never win against me, Asano.

250
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:49,815
No matter how strong you think you've become.

251
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:52,369
And what makes you so certain of that?

252
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,795
Because I don't intend to ever stop growing.

253
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:58,164
As a teacher. Or as a father.

254
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,686
So, yeah. About that reward?

255
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:05,410
Um? Oh, yes!

256
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,337
In return for ranking in the top 50,
I promised to share a critical weakness.

257
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:12,650
Well, children,

258
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:16,730
I have in fact very little power. I'm designed for speed.

259
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:18,702
When at a perfect standstill,

260
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:22,419
one of my tentacles can be
held down even by a single person.

261
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:26,369
Hey, wait, if eight of us teamed-up on you all at once...

262
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,903
You're saying we could essentially paralyze you, right?

263
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,249
Man, if we had known that sooner,
this would have been easy as pie!

264
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:34,449
This is bunk!

265
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:36,731
You only told us 'cause you knew it'd be impossible!

266
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,938
Not having any luck?

267
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:41,179
The trick is to pretend you're
hand-fishing for slime eels.

268
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,597
A drama festival?!

269
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:48,607
But we're about to take high school entrance exams.

270
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:49,791
I know, I know.

271
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:51,794
I did complain to the student council.

272
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,692
Asano fired back, though.

273
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:55,995
What's the problem?

274
00:15:56,161 --> 00:16:00,406
Memorizing lines and stage directions
quickly is good mental exercise.

275
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,923
It's part of the curriculum.

276
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,482
Besides, you'll figure something out.

277
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,754
You always do.

278
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:08,851
At least he gave us respect.

279
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,272
You could be the leading lady, Nagisa!

280
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:13,185
Just, y'know, throwin' it out there.

281
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:15,580
Why do I get a bad feeling about this?

282
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:16,894
What about Kayano?

283
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:17,518
Huh?

284
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,631
The preschoolers adored you.

285
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,738
You had 'em on the edge of their seats.

286
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,369
Um, I don't know if that...

287
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:25,480
That ain't gonna play in junior high.

288
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:29,060
People need to identify with the
main character, and you're too short.

289
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:30,016
Shut up!

290
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:33,051
I'd rather be in charge of handling props anyway.

291
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:34,019
Uh...

292
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:34,649
Right.

293
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,890
So then for our main crew, Mimura will direct,

294
00:16:38,202 --> 00:16:40,074
and Hazam will write, naturally.

295
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,052
Mm?

296
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:42,196
Thoughts on our leads?

297
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,285
You know, I'm available.

298
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,477
You're supposed to be a state secret!

299
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,854
This is our play! No adults allowed!

300
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,560
But I have the makings of a phenomenal lead!

301
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:53,279
What if this is my one and only shot?

302
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,307
You can't deny me the limelight!

303
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,356
All right, then. I have a play.

304
00:16:58,087 --> 00:17:00,073
One where you can be the lead without upstaging us.

305
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:01,422
Everybody's happy.

306
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:04,546
Great. Sounds like plan.

307
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:08,375
Let's put on a show the likes of which
those main campus chumps have never seen!

308
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,452
Okay. E-Class goes on next.

309
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:16,981
Heh. I say we eat loudly and
sneer through the entire performance!

310
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:21,166
A peach.

311
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:22,858
Uh...

312
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:27,680
The greatest medical minds are baffled,

313
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:31,709
but by some strange miracle there's a baby growing inside.

314
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:35,760
Upon hearing this, the old man's eyes lit up.

315
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,552
"Excellent," he thought.

316
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:39,535
"This peach will bring riches!"

317
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,498
What a stroke of luck! A miracle indeed!

318
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:47,971
People will pay good money to see this peach! They'll
come from far and wide! I'll be richer than any king!

319
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:48,368
Mm?

320
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,132
Divorce papers.

321
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:54,717
The old woman had been thinking
of leaving him for some time.

322
00:17:54,993 --> 00:18:00,357
His greed, choice of words, and complete
disregard for child welfare decided her.

323
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:03,504
At long last, she's had enough of his selfish nature.

324
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:05,443
The marriage was over.

325
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:06,953
For good.

326
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,257
The rift between them was as wide as the river

327
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:16,114
in which she'd washed his clothes for over
30 years without thanks or acknowledgement.

328
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:23,061
The atmosphere at home had become as dry and as
suffocating as the smoke from a mountain wildfire.

329
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:26,016
The peach rightfully belongs to me.

330
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:29,185
I am the head of this household, do you understand woman?!

331
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,323
I'll decide how to divide our property!

332
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:32,307
Uh?!

333
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:34,523
Lawyers.

334
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,145
We'll be representing your wife from here on out.

335
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:40,523
Any and all communication
must be handled through our office directly.

336
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:42,242
Regarding the miracle peach.

337
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,365
Since this marriage has technically
been on the rocks for over a decade,

338
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,199
we're well past the mandated
cut-off date for carving up your combined assets.

339
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:54,077
Oh, and fair warning: Our client
is seeking reparations for emotional distress.

340
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:57,269
For 30 years she'd born her husband's cruelty,

341
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,749
his disinterest.

342
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:01,943
Not only had he consistently
failed to bring home the bacon,

343
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:05,446
the old woman possessed incontrovertible
evidence of his infidelity.

344
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,268
In court, he wouldn't have a prayer.

345
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:11,727
In desperation he hired a band of thugs to strong-arm her.

346
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,678
But, being incompetent, they were hauled off by police.

347
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:18,595
The old woman shed her misery and started over.

348
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,536
She gave the miracle peach pride
of place in her lovely new home.

349
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,144
Life was sweet, as it had been in her youth.

350
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:27,423
Happiness and serenity surrounded her.

351
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:28,423
Hooray!

352
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:38,941
A dog, a monkey, and a pheasant.

353
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,516
An unlikely trio, trained to attack human beings,

354
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:47,689
devouring their food with the abandon of
wild animals, in thrall to their wicked master.

355
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:52,060
All-consuming greed had driven
the old man to unspeakable evil.

356
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:58,518
Perhaps the fabled demon-haunted island of
Onigashima is none other than the human heart?

357
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,514
The miracle peach will bear its child very soon.

358
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,462
Will it, too, be prey to demons?

359
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:13,001
Uh...

360
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,935
Great. My appetite's ruined!

361
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:22,608
Say what you will about my writing style,
words leave an unmistakable mark.

362
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:26,413
I did it! I transported them!

363
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,741
What the hell did I just sit through?

364
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:32,753
He has my school in his grip,

365
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:36,574
as surely as if his very tentacles
were wrapped around the campus.

366
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:42,367
Even so, carefree though they seem,
E-Class won't get a fairy tale sort of ending.

367
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,838
The Ministry of Defense has big plans, and yet,

368
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,660
based on my experience of such things,

369
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:54,140
the only person qualified to
predict what may happen next, is me.

370
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,749
I can't help but wonder, Koro-sensei.

371
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:01,538
Can one be a teacher amidst the coming storm?

372
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,227
Surprise!

373
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,713
Not needed, Kunudon!

374
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:41,352
Now that he's served his purpose,

375
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:45,119
Kunigigaoka's beloved mascot
has been transferred to E-Class.

376
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:48,151
Huh? Hey! What are you lookin' at?

377
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:51,261
Yeah, that's right: I used to be somebody!

378
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,369
Yay for unemployment!

379
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:55,763
Bye-bye, Kunadon!
