1
00:00:01,738 --> 00:00:03,190
How 'bout that play, huh?

2
00:00:03,544 --> 00:00:04,628
Talk about fun!

3
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:06,988
Sugino gave the performance of a lifetime.

4
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:09,876
Didn't know you had it in you to make such an evil face.

5
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:13,602
The whole time all I could think about
was how it must've looked to Kanzaki.

6
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:17,184
I was hideous. She probably hates me now...

7
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:18,891
That's not true, silly!

8
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:22,388
I... actually thought it was cool
you could be so believable in the role.

9
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,131
Seriously?

10
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:26,279
Wow! Maybe I oughtta retire
from baseball and pursue acting!

11
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:27,863
No need to pick one or the other,

12
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:29,276
pitchers need to act.

13
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:32,922
Ah, what a pleasure to see
unexpected talent on full display!

14
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:13,920
Aw, man.

15
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:16,505
That's gonna be a pain to clean up.

16
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:19,238
Yeah, I was cleaning up and my hand slipped.

17
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:20,078
Sorry.

18
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:23,046
These are the beads we used for the river in our play.

19
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:25,400
I got 'em on loan from a prop supply store.

20
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:27,847
No worries. We'll tackle it together.

21
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,976
Thanks, Nagisa!

22
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:33,696
I didn't wanna get in the way of everybody's
assassination plans, so, y'know...

23
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,458
Ah-ha.

24
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:37,595
I was wondering where the pair
of you suddenly disappeared to.

25
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm glad to be of assistance if needed.

26
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:44,437
Oh. That'd be wonderful, sir!

27
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,489
He's got his back to us.

28
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:51,038
Defenseless.

29
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,414
Of course, if it were really that simple,

30
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,044
we wouldn't have had to work so hard this past year.

31
00:02:57,671 --> 00:02:59,356
Something smells fishy...

32
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,696
Oh, during the school festival,

33
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:04,093
we used this place to smoke fish.

34
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:08,366
So many different school events.

35
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,687
Uh-huh. No kidding. Feels weird.

36
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:13,507
Once this is cleared up, they'll all be behind us.

37
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:15,477
Yeah. Lot of memories though, huh?

38
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:18,854
Makes me think of the first
time Koro-sensei showed up here.

39
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:23,113
You children were complete amateurs back then.

40
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:25,543
I know... I couldn't get anywhere near you.

41
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:27,498
Neither could Sugino.

42
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,363
Remember how when Karma came,

43
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:33,638
he grilled you about Koro-sensei
and even then, nothing he tried worked?

44
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,529
Or how jealous I was of Itona?

45
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,963
I was so sure he was gonna get him first.

46
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:41,523
Whoa-ho!

47
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:44,606
Another of Okajima's hidey holes, apparently.

48
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:48,251
This class let me do so much.

49
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:50,318
Stuff I'd have never done on my own.

50
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:53,557
Not to be ungrateful, but this is kinda sad.

51
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:55,060
First of all, I can't even swim.

52
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:58,004
When my mind's fixed on something, I just keep rolling.

53
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:58,778
I guess.

54
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,713
That's what it is to be an assassin.

55
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:03,291
Not even your close friends get to see your true blade.

56
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:06,716
I'll get you.

57
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,695
It's only a matter of time.

58
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,343
As for my true blade...

59
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:33,175
I have more than one.

60
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,016
Didn't you notice?

61
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,865
Whoa! A pitfall!

62
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:44,541
Oh, Koro-sensei.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,067
How I love you!

64
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:48,975
Please die...

65
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:53,258
Kayano... You...

66
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:55,815
I watched closely.

67
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,738
Saw different assassins try and fail.

68
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:02,322
But the one thing they used that seemed most effective...

69
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:04,006
was a simple pitfall.

70
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:09,988
Oh no! An anti-me pool!

71
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,413
I have to get above ground quickly before it's too late!

72
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,313
Pretty good, right?!

73
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:17,894
I know exactly how your tentacles move.

74
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,969
After all, I studied you for over a year.

75
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,010
From the best seat in the house!

76
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,337
One more oughta do it!

77
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,744
Koro-sensei, are you all right?

78
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,698
What in the world? What just happened?

79
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,417
Are those what I think?

80
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:03,977
Since when does Kayano have tentacles?

81
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,350
Aw, dammit.

82
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,987
And I attacked you with everything I had.

83
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:09,830
You're slipperier than I thought.

84
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:10,759
Clearly.

85
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,898
Kaede! What is the meaning of this?!

86
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:16,921
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

87
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:19,245
FYI: My real name's not Kaede.

88
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,105
I'm Aguri Yukimura's little sister.

89
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:25,179
You get it now, don't you?

90
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:27,015
Murderer.

91
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,216
Wait, Yukimura?

92
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,117
When the girl we all thought we knew
suddenly dropped the act,

93
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:36,852
her face looked cruel...

94
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:38,854
Like it belonged to someone else.

95
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:40,316
Oh well.

96
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:43,691
No point cryin' over spilt milk. I'll just have to reset.

97
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,672
Let's give it another whirl tomorrow, Koro-sensei.

98
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:48,610
Don't worry: I'll tell you where.

99
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:51,604
Now that we've fought tentacle-to-tentacle...

100
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:55,942
I'm feelin' pretty good about this.

101
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:57,452
Like I can kill you.

102
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:11,295
It's unthinkable.

103
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:14,781
If she grew those tentacles without a maintenance regimen,

104
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:17,110
the pain would've been beyond hellish.

105
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,515
There's no way she could've powered through it...

106
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:20,922
Not with a straight face.

107
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,044
Yeah, whatever.

108
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,577
I'm stuck on her being Yukimura's little sister!

109
00:07:25,622 --> 00:07:28,206
She, uh, used to be our homeroom teacher, right?

110
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:29,921
Oh, man. Unbelievable.

111
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:32,155
I thought I recognized Kayano from somewhere.

112
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:36,198
Seeing her with her hair down and that
evil look on her face jogged my memory.

113
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,071
Do you remember Haruna Mase?

114
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:42,540
The acting prodigy who could disappear
into any role they threw at her?

115
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:45,838
She turned her back on the business years ago.

116
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,031
She looks and acts so different now.

117
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:49,937
I-I didn't even make the connection!

118
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,536
Which one is real?

119
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:57,486
The girl or the actor?

120
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:05,343
When I first set foot in the classroom,
I was surprised to say the least.

121
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,727
Who knew an unexpected reunion awaited me?

122
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,836
Aguri Yukimura's younger sister, a.k.a. Akari Yukimura,

123
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,499
ingratiated into the enemy camp under a false name.

124
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:22,115
I realized who she was and investigated.

125
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,475
As suspected, she was hiding tentacles.

126
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:30,320
Not only did she understand how they worked
and how to use them,

127
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,675
she gleaned the knowledge in a remarkably short time.

128
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,267
As tenacious as she is intelligent.

129
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,912
Able to maintain the facade under unimaginable pain.

130
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:46,116
Simply put, her mental fortitude cannot be overstated.

131
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:50,009
Nor can her considerable acting prowess.

132
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:54,317
Day after day, no one could guess her murderous intent.

133
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:58,121
She has a gift for assassination.

134
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:01,354
And in E Class, that means something.

135
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:21,966
I was on my way to see her.

136
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,461
We had a lot of catching up to do.

137
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,863
The talent agency had put my career on hold.

138
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:34,041
People stopped noticing me on the street.

139
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:38,269
Where's this freedom been all my life?

140
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,557
I'm almost tempted to apply for a day job!

141
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,527
What just happened...?

142
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:05,344
I was small, so I could crawl through the rubble easily.

143
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,250
If I'd have known what was waiting for me...

144
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:30,206
Aguri...

145
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:32,723
Big Sis!

146
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,676
Oh, God, talk to me!

147
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:37,957
Wake up! Aguri, please!

148
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:00,390
That's when I saw them.

149
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:02,263
On the ground next to her.

150
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:04,710
Vials of tentacle seed.

151
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,815
I don't know why I felt the need to take one with me.

152
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:15,482
I guess... some part of me understood if
I was going to avenge my sister's death,

153
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,144
the stuff in that vial would be necessary.

154
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:24,189
"The Weaponized Tentacle Prototype
is compatible with human physiology.

155
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,795
Provided a strict regimen is adhered to,

156
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:30,655
otherwise, the pain is excruciating."

157
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:34,954
Nothing to it.

158
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:38,202
On principle, no different than being an actor.

159
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:42,202
When my mind's fixed on something, I just keep rolling.

160
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:47,269
I believe this is the first instance we've seen of
someone passing the entrance exam out of the blue.

161
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,977
Forgive me. Kaede Kayano is it?

162
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,979
Yes. Thank you very much, sir.

163
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,251
Forged ID papers.

164
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:57,455
The name of a bit part I'd played in a made-for-TV movie.

165
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:01,299
And, presto, I was in.

166
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:08,578
Excuse me, but I understand this school has
a special class for students with behavioral issues?

167
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,946
Or is that just a rumor?

168
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:20,000
If my instincts were on point, in Kunigigaoka's E Class.

169
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:23,545
I'd find the monster that murdered my sister.

170
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:27,675
Oh, Akari. You're so lucky you're cute.

171
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,823
What I wouldn't give to have
taken after mom's side of the family.

172
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:32,872
You're cute, too!

173
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,273
Please! When it comes to looks,
hair color's all we have in common.

174
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:39,172
So I dyed it.

175
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:46,164
Why the monster wanted to take over my
sister's teaching position, I had no earthly idea.

176
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:50,321
But... unless I wanted him to walk away Scot-free...

177
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,468
I had to stay in character...

178
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,555
Play the part to perfection.

179
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:02,154
Hello. You must be the new girl.

180
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:04,881
Mm-hmm! Just transferred here today!

181
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:09,664
Your hair's really long.

182
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:12,805
Yeah... Eventually I wanna cut it short,

183
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,581
but for now I don't have much of a say.

184
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,762
Even if I don't stand out, I'll be watched.

185
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:21,519
Let's play around with the casting a bit.

186
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,028
Someone else can be the main character.

187
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,589
Kaede needs to blend in with the scenery.

188
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,558
There you go! Now we look the same!

189
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,729
Kaede Kayano! Pleased to meet ya!

190
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:36,932
The tentacles spoke to me,

191
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,092
asked me what I wanted to be.

192
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:43,169
"That's easy," I said,

193
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,187
"an assassin."

194
00:13:46,671 --> 00:13:50,136
I choked back the pain, hid my burning hatred.

195
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,688
All the while silently picking my moment.

196
00:13:58,321 --> 00:13:59,924
If I die, so what?

197
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:01,919
Revenge will have been worth it.

198
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,064
Just as I thought.

199
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:07,471
You don't heed instructions.

200
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:12,995
Did I or did I not warn you to wait
until my preparations were complete?

201
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:15,624
What makes you such an authority?

202
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,024
Look at the piss-poor shape you left Itona in.

203
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:24,291
This attitude of yours may well be
an indicator of metabolic imbalance.

204
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:29,282
If you continue to ignore the dangers of
untamed tentacles, it's only a matter...

205
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:32,063
Mind your own business.

206
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,454
I can kill him without your help.

207
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,422
Understood?

208
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,747
So mercilessly cold...

209
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,630
And to your own family.

210
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,088
I'll kill you!

211
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:51,049
You'll die like the animal you are!

212
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:51,509
Give me back my mother now!

213
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,385
Uh-huh.

214
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:52,715
Give her back to me!

215
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,228
Definitely Kayano.

216
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:56,317
That's crazy.

217
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,863
It's like she's a split personality or something.

218
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:01,846
That'd explain how she's been
able to keep her identity a secret.

219
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:05,270
Kayano might've always done her own thing,

220
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,559
but still, we all adored her.

221
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:10,759
Why was she so close to me?

222
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:15,553
Was I part of her cover? Did my bloodlust disguise hers?

223
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:18,039
Now that I think about it,

224
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:20,504
the whole pudding thing was just a ruse.

225
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:24,347
We'd have gotten suspicious if she
hadn't contributed something to the cause.

226
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:30,640
Turns out the harmless, ditzy Kayno
we all thought we knew isn't even real.

227
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:32,778
It's all been a performance.

228
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:37,130
Excuse me, sir. Why did Kayano, well...

229
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:38,966
Why did she call you a murderer?

230
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:43,391
Does it have to do with your past?

231
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:46,347
Talk to us, Koro-sensei, please.

232
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:50,272
What happened? We trust you. So just be honest with us.

233
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:53,139
He's right. We deserve to know the truth.

234
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:56,047
Please. It's unacceptable to stay quiet.

235
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:58,240
You understand.

236
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,726
Unless you tell us something, we're done here.

237
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,998
I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.

238
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:12,621
I don't blame you.

239
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:16,077
Very well, then. It's time my past came to light.

240
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:18,818
I'll tell you on one condition:

241
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:21,588
You hear my big secret as a class.

242
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,124
Meaning of course, that we must find Kayano.

243
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:44,243
So you showed up.

244
00:16:44,892 --> 00:16:47,102
Great! Let's end this!

245
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:51,829
I gave you your name.

246
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,713
Practically makes me your mother.

247
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:54,817
What's the old joke?

248
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:58,264
I brought you into this world, I can take you out of it?

249
00:16:58,672 --> 00:16:59,566
Listen to me.

250
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:02,689
It's too dangerous for you to keep using those tentacles!

251
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:06,281
They have to be removed; Your life is in jeopardy!

252
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:08,402
What are you babbling about?

253
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,085
They're in peak condition!

254
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,610
You're not gonna break my composure with a bluff.

255
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:13,407
Kayano.

256
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,377
I thought we were classmates.

257
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:19,191
But this whole time, you were acting?

258
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,904
All the stuff we've done?

259
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,806
What we've been through as friends?

260
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,244
It's what I do.

261
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,564
I'm an actor. I act.

262
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:30,655
Watching Nagisa take that beating from Takaoka.

263
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:33,172
It took everything I had not to step in.

264
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,196
When I was kidnapped by thugs,
kicked in the ribs by the Reaper,

265
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,244
I was pissed enough to have killed them.

266
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:43,367
But I maintained. Never once let the mask slip.

267
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:45,480
Poor, pitiful Kayano.

268
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,887
The frail little girl everybody loved.

269
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,718
You did all this for your big sister?

270
00:17:52,296 --> 00:17:54,148
Koro-sensei murdered her.

271
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:56,095
She never hurt anyone.

272
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:59,003
All she wanted to do was teach.

273
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,866
How she used to brag about all of you.

274
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:05,789
Come on, now. Put your minds to it!

275
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:10,880
Apply yourselves and E Class can open up a world
of possibilities! You can do it!

276
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:16,220
That's all fine and good, Miss Yukimura,
but... we gotta do something about your shirts.

277
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,532
What are you talking about?! This style is hot right now!

278
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:22,751
Kayano, we... We know.

279
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:25,842
We only had her a couple of weeks.

280
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,479
It was March of last year.

281
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:31,115
But that was long enough to see
that she was a passionate teacher.

282
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,946
Could Koro-sensei murder someone?

283
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:36,185
I mean, like, actually in cold blood?

284
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,878
I just don't see it.

285
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,587
Nothing we know about him remotely jibes with that!

286
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,196
Yeah! Maybe you're wrong.

287
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,002
Maybe you don't have the whole story yet.

288
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,323
Give him a chance!

289
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:48,363
C'mon, Kaede you've been here for a year.

290
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:50,590
You should know what kind of person he is by now.

291
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:52,336
I get it.

292
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:54,473
We have to deal with him eventually.

293
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:57,223
But you can't think he murdered your sister.

294
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,550
This shouldn't be about revenge.

295
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,528
That's not how this works.

296
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,492
Feel like you're overheating, but
the nape of your neck is ice cold?

297
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:09,504
It's a good indication your metabolism is in shot.

298
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:12,716
Which means those tentacles
have just about taken the wheel.

299
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:15,837
You fight in that condition, they'll sap your life force.

300
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,005
Trust me. I have experience.

301
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,063
Worst-case scenario, you die.

302
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:26,110
Shut up. I don't recall asking you for a prognosis.

303
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:29,455
Every weapon comes at a price.

304
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:32,106
But if it's the least bit usable, you polish it.

305
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,300
Guess who taught me that, Koro-sensei?

306
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:36,904
If my body overheats, so much the better!

307
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,421
I'll use it to my advantage.

308
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:40,551
Flaming tentacles can do a lot of damage!

309
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:42,396
No! I must insist...

310
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:49,040
See? I'm in the best shape of my life.

311
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,280
Every cell in my body's on high alert.

312
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:54,005
All your weaknesses are mine to exploit.

313
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,959
Stop it, Kayano!

314
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,297
This is insane! Even if you win, it's suicide!

315
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:04,404
If I've learned anything in this class, it's
that no target is worth sacrificing yourself for!

316
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:06,797
Aw, that's so sweet of you to be concerned.

317
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:07,639
Still, though.

318
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:09,816
If you think I care...

319
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:11,912
you're wrong.

320
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:17,179
When my mind's fixed on something, I just keep rolling!

321
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,110
Holy crap...

322
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:24,753
It's like a meteor shower!

323
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:27,811
This is the real Kayano, not the character.

324
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:30,146
This is the person behind the mask.

325
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:32,334
Ripped off a chunk!

326
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:34,269
Look at that, it's still all wriggly!

327
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:37,171
She's been in boss-battle mode for maybe 15 seconds

328
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,113
and already the tentacles have
gotten a foothold on her brain.

329
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,123
Aw, what's the matter, Koro-sensei?!

330
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,218
The headaches aren't an issue anymore!

331
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,904
Wow! This pain's starting to feel good!

332
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,501
If she's that far gone, it's too late.

333
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,730
Whether she gets her revenge on Koro-sensei or not,

334
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,754
another few minutes of this...

335
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:58,644
she's dead.

336
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,258
Kayano...

337
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:02,496
Is this...

338
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:06,000
Is this really how you wanted the assassination to go?

339
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,835
Come on! It's high time for you to die!

340
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:11,599
Kayano...

341
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:14,897
Kill you! Murderer!

342
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,772
Kill you! Kill you! Die, die, die, die...!

343
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:19,989
Koro-sensei...

344
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:21,777
Please...

345
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:24,129
Save me...
