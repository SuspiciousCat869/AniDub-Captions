1
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:06,705
Koro-sensei: A mysterious super
being who's blown up half the moon

2
00:00:06,788 --> 00:00:09,746
and vows to destroy Earth by March of next year.

3
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:14,118
The powers that be have a bounty
on his head: Ten-billion yen.

4
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:17,596
We're Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High,

5
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,538
also known as the End Class.

6
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,740
And believe it or not,

7
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,235
we're the misfits who're supposed to assassinate him.

8
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:27,509
Even though we'd pinpointed some of
his weaknesses before summer vacation,

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,858
we still haven't managed to hit our target.

10
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:34,358
This is Class 3E: The Assassination Classroom.

11
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:37,527
The bell rings, another day begins.

12
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:19,801
Our "assassination vacation" was almost over.

13
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:21,525
Almost, but not quite.

14
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:25,513
We'd decided to make the most of
what little time we had left on Okinawa.

15
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,330
A test of courage? On our last day here?

16
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:30,399
Of course!

17
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:33,005
What better activity for a fine midsummer's night?

18
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,830
Yeah, nice try. You just wanna have fun at our expense.

19
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:37,830
Unlike some who shall remain nameless,

20
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:40,458
I've been too cooped up in a shell to have any fun at all!

21
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:42,826
We're on a tropical island, for cryin' out loud!

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,163
I think a test of courage sounds like a blast!

23
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:45,954
No kidding!

24
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:49,180
Aww. But I don't like being scared.

25
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,485
Don't worry! Koro-Sensei'll be playing the ghosts, right?

26
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,513
Oh yeah.

27
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,027
So it won't be scary.

28
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,343
There's no way we could've known at the time,

29
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:02,408
but Koro-sensei's real purpose wasn't just to scare us.

30
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,866
This ocean cavern is the ideal spot.

31
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:11,718
I want everyone to walk through in boy-girl pairs.

32
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,036
So, uh, you're not bothered by this kind of thing?

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,677
Nah. I don't mind spooky stuff so much, actually.

34
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:25,068
Jump scares, though, I'm not a real big fan of.

35
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,371
Don't be surprised if I freak out a bit.

36
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:30,788
With Koro-sensei as quick as he is,
he's bound to catch me once or twice.

37
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:34,084
Hm? Is that an Okinawa shamisen playing?

38
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:42,982
Oh no!

39
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,477
Beware.

40
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:48,263
You have entered a cave drenched in blood and tragedy.

41
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:53,121
For here, routed in battle, members of the Ryukyu royalty

42
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:56,605
met a most terrible and violent end.

43
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,113
Is that actually true?

44
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,621
Possibly, but odds are he's just
making it up to create atmosphere.

45
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:04,951
You would be wise to stay together.

46
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,739
Anyone left alone in this cave

47
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,343
will be haunted by restless spirits!

48
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:15,025
You gotta admit it's starting to sound kind of authentic.

49
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,154
I vote we go through as quickly as we can.

50
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:19,465
Beware.

51
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:21,221
You have entered a cave drenched in blood...

52
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:24,413
Hearing him give his spiel to
the next couple adds to the realism.

53
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:26,291
Now that's what I call spooky.

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,288
No question my students have gotten stronger.

55
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,038
But as far as they've come,

56
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:35,829
there's still a little something missing.

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,353
Specifically...

58
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:40,077
a love scandal!

59
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,368
A few were on the verge of
pairing off before the summer break,

60
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:47,680
but they've been so hyper-focused on
assassination no one's had time to spark a romance!

61
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:50,737
Thankfully, there's nothing quite like abject terror

62
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,371
for bringing two people together.

63
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:54,099
I'll get material yet.

64
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,403
For my trashy, based-on-a-true-story,

65
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:58,871
mass-market novel about love-struck teenagers!

66
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,080
Let no one say I don't have a big heart!

67
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,574
Afraid of not being afraid? I don't get it.

68
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:07,210
Look.

69
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:11,246
When Nagisa faced off with
Takoka, it knocked me on my ass.

70
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:12,476
And not 'cause he beat him.

71
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:17,227
The way he was during the whole thing,

72
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,181
it was like, I dunno...

73
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,723
He wasn't the least bit affected.

74
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:24,934
I mean, in a fight, I'd win. We all know that.

75
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:29,104
But to an assassin, winning a fight doesn't mean squat.

76
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:31,662
That's when it dawned on me.

77
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:35,302
What scared me most of all was not being afraid.

78
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:38,359
Still, though.

79
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:40,545
I won't lose.

80
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:44,103
I'll definitely be the one who ends our teacher's life.

81
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,550
Take my word for it.

82
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:49,330
Okay! I can't wait to see who
finally winds up killing him.

83
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:50,412
Hang on a second.

84
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:51,016
Huh?

85
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:53,694
Wasn't this supposed to be a test of courage?

86
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:57,065
'Cause it's lookin' to me like the Octopus
has something a little different in mind.

87
00:05:58,163 --> 00:05:58,630
Urgh.

88
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:01,083
Why are none of these kids falling for each other?

89
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:03,402
Next couple for sure!

90
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:06,620
Beware.

91
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:09,552
You have entered a cave drenched in blood and tragedy.

92
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,641
For here... Ah! Monster!

93
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:15,288
I've been scaring the crap out of people

94
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:16,746
since I was little girl.

95
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,293
They don't call me Miss Courage Tester for nothin'.

96
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,055
Scariest girl in Japan.

97
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:21,992
Okay.

98
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:24,941
Well as long as you're enjoying yourself I guess, right?

99
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:30,903
That was only an average g-g-ghost, wasn't
it? Not the restless spirit of Ryukyu royalty?

100
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:34,517
Oh! He has no eyes!

101
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:38,430
Ah! I felt something slithery!

102
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:40,513
Oh! Creepy Japanese Doll!

103
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:42,996
Ah! Horror manga-ka Shigeru Mizuki!

104
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,696
Oh! I'm not even sure what this is, but I feel like...

105
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:48,816
Kinda weird he's more freaked out than any of us.

106
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:52,016
Yeah. We, uh, we should go.

107
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:58,560
Good gracious. What an unmitigated disgrace.

108
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,940
So let me get this straight.

109
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:02,272
This whole thing was about scaring us into hookin' up

110
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:04,163
so you could have material for a book?

111
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:06,628
We so knew that's what you were doing.

112
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:10,288
What's wrong with wanting to see tender
feelings blossom between two bright, young things

113
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,080
before their best years are behind them
and they wind up stuck in loveless mar...

114
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:14,621
Well, this is awkward.

115
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:16,293
Are we sure he's an adult?

116
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,080
Not that we don't appreciate the thought and all,

117
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:20,110
but, come on, we're just kids.

118
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:24,140
Did it ever occur to you that maybe some of
us don't feel like being in a relationship?

119
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,531
And no offense, but isn't shipping us sorta creepy.

120
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:29,802
I know. I'm sorry.

121
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:34,362
Pathetic. You call that a test of courage?

122
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,794
There was no one in there! What a waste.

123
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,439
You can let go of my arm any day now.

124
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:41,913
This is not what I need after an all-nighter.

125
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,163
Ugh! Shut up! You're a man, aren't ya?

126
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,900
It's your damn responsibility to escort pretty women!

127
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:55,205
Hey. So is anyone thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

128
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:57,848
That Professor Bitch is...?

129
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,746
Uh-huh.

130
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,205
Should we do something?

131
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:01,913
We don't head home till tomorrow morning,

132
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:03,473
so there's time.

133
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,460
Then let's hook them up.

134
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,399
Our final operation on the island was about to start.

135
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:12,626
Turns out we're just as into shipping as Koro-sensei.

136
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,505
Ugh! You're killin' me! The man's so obtuse!

137
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,095
Isn't that a bit out of character for you?

138
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:24,432
You're supposed to be known for
wrapping guys around your little finger.

139
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:27,455
But when it comes to her own
love life, she doesn't have a clue.

140
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:30,705
Oh, knock it off. Love? Don't make me laugh!

141
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:32,209
What? You're not in love?

142
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,015
No! I'm attracted to the challenge
of conquering a world-class square!

143
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:40,607
I just wanted to see if I could
make him fall for me, that's all.

144
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:45,065
And I got... carried away.

145
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,481
That was kind of adorable.

146
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:50,030
More like embarrassing.

147
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:51,047
Don't judge me!

148
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,527
Professor Bitch is a lot more
awkward than she first comes off.

149
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,696
Maybe all the stuff she's had to do

150
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,102
makes it hard for her to own her feelings.

151
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,748
Hey. It's cool, really. We've got this!

152
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:02,320
Huh?

153
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:04,981
Let us set the stage and you can take it from there.

154
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:06,071
Yeah!

155
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:08,247
Well, if you think you can.

156
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:10,996
Excellent!

157
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,836
In that case, I call the Class
3-E Love Consultant Meeting to order.

158
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,487
Eager much, Octopus?

159
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:20,163
Come now, it's only natural to
encourage romance between colleagues.

160
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:23,746
A female educator aching for
the touch of her stoic counterpart.

161
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,871
If that's not a trashy best-seller in the making,

162
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:27,261
I don't know what is!

163
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:29,921
Uh, I think you're planning something racier than we are.

164
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:31,468
If we're gonna do this right,

165
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,871
we need to start by overhauling your fashion sense.

166
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,435
Hm?

167
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,930
I'll say. Revealing might be appealing for some,

168
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:41,791
but parading the goods doesn't cut
it for stuffed shirt like Mr. Karasuma.

169
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,830
Your wardrobe should be more... understated.

170
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:47,424
Understated? Huh, okay then.

171
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:51,055
Use the way Kanzaki dresses as
a model and you can't go wrong.

172
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,486
As a matter of fact. Is what you wore yesterday dry?

173
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:55,598
Yeah. Of course.

174
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,033
See? It makes you look like a, uh...

175
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,401
How in the world did that make her even sexier?

176
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:04,413
Well, to begin with,

177
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:06,496
the fit's a little snug in places.

178
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,226
Man, I don't even wanna tell you what I
think about when Kankazi's in that thing.

179
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:13,196
Fine. Whatever. Huge boobs we can work with.

180
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:17,318
Not like we have a choice, and bust size
doesn't really matter that much anyway.

181
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:21,156
Have we established Mr. Karasuma's type?

182
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,555
Yeah! That girl in the ad.

183
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,913
I think he's, I don't know, utterly infatuated with her?

184
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:29,195
Said she's his ideal type, or something.

185
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,089
Whoo boy. Now that's the whole package.

186
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,274
And the best part? There are three of 'em!

187
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,722
He meant his ideal military type!

188
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:41,591
Well, the quickest way to a man's heart is his stomach.

189
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,926
They serve some pretty good stuff here.

190
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:47,708
We could arrange it so the two of you
eat his favorite dish together on the beach.

191
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:51,885
Trouble is, I've only ever seen the
guy eat burgers and cup ramen, so...

192
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,865
Doesn't exactly set the mood for a romantic evening.

193
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:58,679
This match was doomed from the start!

194
00:10:59,298 --> 00:10:59,895
Yeah,

195
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:03,390
I'm starting the think maybe the problem is Mr. Karasuma.

196
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,538
See? He's such an idiot!

197
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:05,955
I should've seen it before.

198
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:08,538
A man who never laughs at my jokes is a lost cause!

199
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:09,788
With no other options,

200
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:12,131
we settled for insulting Mr. Karasuma.

201
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:13,750
There's no help for it.

202
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:16,197
Even so, let's do what we can before dinner.

203
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:18,589
The ladies are in charge of hair and makeup.

204
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:20,229
The gentlemen are tasked with setting

205
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,363
just the right ambiance for the table.

206
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,459
Roger!

207
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:32,479
We're supposed to be eating as a group, right?

208
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:33,963
So, where do I sit?

209
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:35,596
Well not here obviously.

210
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:37,263
It looks like there isn't enough room.

211
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:40,129
Is our favorite teacher trying
to force his way into a seat?

212
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:42,331
Honestly, you'd just get in the way here.

213
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:45,634
How about you be a good sport about
it and eat your dinner outside, okay?

214
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,302
Huh?

215
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,225
Where did that come from all of a sudden?

216
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:54,056
I mean I realize I'm out of touch
with young people, but seriously.

217
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,938
Hm?

218
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:10,074
Why the hell'd just the two of us get kicked out?

219
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,091
Oh, uh. Who knows?

220
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:14,490
So, what's up with the shawl?

221
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:16,996
It was pulled off the bargain wrack at a boutique shop.

222
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,663
I borrowed a sewing machine and
remade it to look like a brand name.

223
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,172
Home Ec. Always was your best subject, huh?

224
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,871
All the pieces are in place.

225
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:25,461
Go get him, Professor Bitch!

226
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:31,889
This shawl. It wouldn't stand a chance in high society.

227
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,726
And this amateurish table setting.

228
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:39,954
Worlds apart from the posh restaurants
I frequent in the line of duty.

229
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,196
Ha! And don't get me started on the lack of privacy.

230
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,843
Still.

231
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:51,721
It's fun! Who would've guessed?

232
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,406
I'm starting to love those little brats.

233
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:59,680
I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna seduce the square! Watch me!

234
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,676
The trip was rough. So much happened.

235
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,472
But at least we got results.

236
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,720
I didn't count on how,

237
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:18,280
but I sure got to see those kids
reinforce their fundamental training.

238
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:21,728
Optimistically, I think we'll get him during second term.

239
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:25,414
Of course, you realize I'm gonna rely heavily on you.

240
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,329
Something wrong?

241
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,736
Hey. Karasuma.

242
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,320
Do you know what it means to kill?

243
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,124
To actually end somone's life?

244
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:58,735
Got a little dark there, didn't I?

245
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:00,969
Your napkin.

246
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,979
It's all bunched up in your collar.

247
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:20,529
I really like you, you know. Well, goodnight.

248
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,295
Ugh! You awkward, brainless idiot!

249
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,569
You were supposed to talk about
how you feel, not how you kill!

250
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:37,538
What kind of half-assed,

251
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:39,121
G-rated kiss was that?

252
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:39,651
Huh?

253
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,273
Come on! I thought grown-ups use their tongues!

254
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:44,813
Do not start even start in on me with that crap!

255
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,000
Being a grown-up is a lot harder than it looks!

256
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:48,330
Don't lose heart, children.

257
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:52,538
I'm sure she has something appropriately
indecent in mind for later on, right?

258
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,485
Wrong! Don't say that, you pervert!

259
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:56,184
Uh...

260
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,084
I'm gonna go ahead and ignore that.

261
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,866
Duty comes first. Period.

262
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:06,887
It's second term. Training is about to get very real.

263
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:08,920
We have to kill him.

264
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:11,200
And so,

265
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,290
our "assassination vacation" came to a close.

266
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:20,211
Wait.

267
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:22,968
Was she practicing a new seduction technique?

268
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:25,334
That was impressive.

269
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,210
Before school started back up,

270
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:40,448
we were all spending the last
days of summer doing our own thing.

271
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:44,537
How's your mom?

272
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:46,293
You two getting along okay?

273
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,497
You can't be having that much fun as strict as she is.

274
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:53,736
Sorry I'm not around much anymore.

275
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:55,350
I wish I could be a better dad.

276
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,686
Don't worry about it.

277
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:59,989
She's not so bad if you don't tick her off.

278
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:02,723
Is that right?

279
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,424
Y'know the other day, I...

280
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,017
You what? I'm listening.

281
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:13,482
A summer festival?

282
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,513
The last day of summer vacation!

283
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:18,011
Let's hang out and have some
mindless fun! What do you say?

284
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,195
I thank you.

285
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,444
Uh, thanks for the sushi.

286
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:27,416
Whoa. You're already finished?

287
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:29,108
Sorry. I gotta get going.

288
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,311
See ya! Let's do this again sometime. Take care!

289
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:40,438
He's cheered up since last I saw him.

290
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:42,719
Huh.

291
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:44,260
A summer festival?

292
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:46,190
I just thought of it today!

293
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:47,413
I asked the whole class,

294
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,621
but almost everyone seems to have other plans.

295
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,759
I'm starting to feel rejected.

296
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,390
All right. I'll go.

297
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:58,068
Eh. It's not like I was doing anything else, anyway.

298
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:01,627
Festival, you say?

299
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:05,568
I'm honored my target would think of inviting me.

300
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,869
But I'm afraid I'm out of country on business.

301
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,830
Argh!

302
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:11,636
I'll pick you up! It's no trouble!

303
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,371
Please! Mr. Karasuma's in a meeting! You're my last hope!

304
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,038
If you don't come, no one will be there!

305
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:18,455
Don't be ridiculous. I'm working.

306
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:19,391
Yes, yes.

307
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,330
Well, feel free to pop by and kill me anytime.

308
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,325
I will, thanks.

309
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,148
According to Karasuma,

310
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:33,176
our young friend pulled off the secret move I taught him

311
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:35,274
as though to the manner born.

312
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,533
Indeed. Every country has its Natural.

313
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,822
It's rather a shame I couldn't bring him with me.

314
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,919
From the day you were born,

315
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:56,860
from your first breath, I've been beside you.

316
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:09,675
Be not afraid. Fear not the name of the Reaper.

317
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:18,275
And I got a super great deal!

318
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Yeah you did!

319
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:23,391
It's so fizzy!

320
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:27,586
Excellent! Quite a few more of you
showed up than I'd been led to expect.

321
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:29,842
In the event that no one bothered to come,

322
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:31,502
I was contemplating seppuku.

323
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:34,164
Oh. Guess we really shouldn't have showed up, huh?

324
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:39,924
Chiba? Hayami? Why are you guys so depressed?

325
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,745
We both got banned from the shooting gallery.

326
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,342
It was so easy we sorta got carried away.

327
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:47,877
We needed the practice.

328
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:52,104
So far I've only scored as high
as fifth place on any of your games.

329
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:55,830
Seeing as that drives down the probability
of winning fourth place or above to,

330
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,996
hold on, let me give you a concrete figure.

331
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:00,597
Hey, how 'bout that? 0.05.

332
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:03,155
I was wondering if the prizes are worth what I've spent.

333
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:06,080
I mean, if you don't trust my
math, we could always ask a cop.

334
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:07,572
All right, I get it.

335
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:09,801
You can have your money back. Just keep quiet.

336
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,227
Oh, I don't think so.

337
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,612
I didn't blow my cash to get a refund.

338
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:15,526
I want that game console.

339
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,011
Karma sure is persistent.

340
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,436
He knew that guy was a cheap
before he even started playing.

341
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:23,827
Ooh.

342
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:27,586
Seriously, man, is there anything you can't
do, or are you just that freakin' awesome?

343
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:28,878
It's all in the wrist.

344
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,434
You've gotta flick like you
would if you were holding knife.

345
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:32,694
That oughta do it.

346
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:34,887
Okay, good haul.

347
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,723
See, this is how you make a feast when you're dirt poor.

348
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:38,716
I hear ya'.

349
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,680
Should I pan fry them or go sashimi?

350
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,450
Wait. That's his dinner?

351
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:45,159
Wow. Everybody's raking it in.

352
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,192
Yeah.

353
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:49,577
Turns out assassination skills
come in handy in the everyday world.

354
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:53,899
Like getting all the men in the Chamber of
Commerce tent to buy you drinks? I can see that.

355
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:55,455
Where's Koro-sensei?

356
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:56,853
Being entrepreneurial.

357
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:59,330
End of the month. He's strapped for cash.

358
00:19:59,365 --> 00:19:59,818
Huh?

359
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,482
The food stalls? Really?

360
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:04,942
Only one at first, but he branched out.

361
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:09,163
Started setting up in the stalls that closed
early after they sold out of all their stuff.

362
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:09,860
Uh-huh.

363
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:13,705
So basically he's taking advantage of
all the stalls we put out of business.

364
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:14,539
Of course.

365
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,312
Awesome!

366
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:26,704
Cool!

367
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:27,735
Gorgeous.

368
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:37,979
What a vacation, huh? Sure was packed.

369
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:39,201
Mh-hm.

370
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:42,959
But something tells me

371
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:45,701
our second term's gonna be even more packed.

372
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,233
So, the reward stands.

373
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:50,570
If he's not killed by more than one person.

374
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:53,211
Given what we know transpired over the summer break,

375
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:56,077
however, it's wise to anticipate a group effort.

376
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:58,427
The children did have him fairly cornered.

377
00:20:58,596 --> 00:21:00,343
They seem to work well as a unit.

378
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:05,427
If they succeed as a unit, the reward will be tripled.

379
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:11,164
However it all plays out,

380
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:12,674
when this class is over,

381
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:15,557
none of us will be who we were when it started.

382
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:19,450
And like most things in life,

383
00:21:19,788 --> 00:21:21,921
this term will have its ups and downs.
