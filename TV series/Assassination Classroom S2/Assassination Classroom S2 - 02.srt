1
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:06,441
I've gathered you all here today,
even though we're still on break,

2
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:08,161
for a very important reason:

3
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:11,524
Our nation's current egg surplus crisis!

4
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:15,057
Poultry farmers across the land
are throwing out their excess in bulk!

5
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:17,996
Right. I heard about that on the news.

6
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:19,149
It's a real waste.

7
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:19,951
It is!

8
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,095
So I've drafted a proposal to salvage those eggs,

9
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,149
and assassinate Koro-sensei in a way

10
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,378
that's almost guaranteed to be foolproof!

11
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:29,941
We're killing him with surplus eggs?

12
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:31,941
What? You gonna make an omelet?

13
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,649
Throw in a couple of these babies?

14
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,066
Like he won't see that comin' from a mile away.

15
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:38,914
I gave it a little bit more thought than that.

16
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,948
In fact, my plan's already in
motion, thanks to Mr. Karasuma.

17
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:45,483
Right. All the stuff you need's been set up outside.

18
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,511
Egg-cellent! Everybody to the yard!

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,545
They're creative, I'll give 'em that.

20
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,469
How they come up with this stuff, I'll never know.

21
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:55,955
Whoa.

22
00:00:56,083 --> 00:01:00,083
So we have a ton of eggs and a mold. Are we making?

23
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:02,483
Yep! It's exactly what you think.

24
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,691
We are going to whip up a ginormous pudding!

25
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:08,254
I give you... Operation Pudding Popper!

26
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:46,204
Operation Pudding Popper, huh?

27
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:49,460
Well, Koro-sensei does have a pretty serious sweet tooth.

28
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:50,700
Bingo!

29
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:53,821
And the target's recent crucial
confession only confirms it!

30
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,649
You'd scarf down a mountain of these if you could.

31
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:58,921
Oh, without question!

32
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:02,950
What a dream come true it would be to
gorge myself on a mountain of pudding!

33
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:06,890
Too bad I don't have the funds to make it happen.

34
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:10,066
So, let's make that crazy dream a reality!

35
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,887
Saving some for ourselves, of course.

36
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:17,576
The idea is to plant bombs and anti-Sensei
BB's into the giant pudding's base.

37
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,976
When he eats his way to the bottom, we detonate.

38
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,791
This is starting to sound like it's worth a shot.

39
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:25,887
I'm with you on that.

40
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,858
Koro-sensei loses his marbles
when it comes to anything sweet.

41
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,274
And since Kayano's usually not that proactive,

42
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:32,691
there's the element of surprise.

43
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:33,974
He won't be suspicious.

44
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,108
All right then!

45
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:38,441
Let's wait till he's not around
and make ourselves a giant pudding!

46
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:39,797
Yeah!

47
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:47,687
This equipment comes from an
inactive line at a mayonnaise factory.

48
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:50,483
Once the eggs are prepped, they'll be going in here.

49
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:51,874
Step one: Crack 'em.

50
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,099
Step two: With help from the government,

51
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,886
we do the mixing manually.

52
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:58,286
It's a lot of work, but eyes on the prize.

53
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,670
Step three: Add sugar and milk.

54
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:03,887
Lots of it. Plus some vanilla extract to give it flavor.

55
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,072
Hey, Kaede?

56
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,615
I saw them try to make a giant
pudding on TV once, and it didn't work.

57
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:13,104
It weighed too much. Totally collapsed. Just sayin'.

58
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:14,914
That thought occurred to me,

59
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:17,316
which is why we're using gelatin and agar.

60
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,586
Not common for pudding.

61
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,255
The agar's fibers make it a great coagulant.

62
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:25,983
Plus, did you know that it has a
significantly higher melting point than gelatin,

63
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:29,233
making it perfect for keeping our
pudding firm in the September heat?

64
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:30,232
Whoa.

65
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,409
Commence pouring in the first batch!

66
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:39,371
That's the way!

67
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:42,492
Once that's all in, swap out with Team Second Batch!

68
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:45,983
We'll increase the ratio of cream as we go up,

69
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:49,968
maintaining firmness while ensuring the
lower layers don't bear too much weight.

70
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,138
And what're these for?

71
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:57,594
Fruit sauce in edible mousse wrappers
to add the occasional burst of new flavor.

72
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:00,153
Vanilla is scrumptious and all, but think about it,

73
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:03,608
wouldn't you get sick of the same taste
bite after bite in something so large?

74
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:04,571
Sure you would!

75
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:07,160
Okay, that's great.

76
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:10,490
Once the mold's full, drop the
lid on and let the whole thing chill.

77
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:12,728
This isn't just any old pudding mold, either.

78
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:16,233
The outer walls are fitted with pipes
that have coolant circulating through them.

79
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,346
Pretty neat, huh?

80
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,358
A pudding with this much volume
needs to be chilled through.

81
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:22,149
We're talkin' inside and out.

82
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,669
Wow.

83
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,214
Who in the world would've ever thought
you could be an expert on giant pudding?

84
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,366
She's got the engineering part down pat.

85
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,471
And she knows how to make it taste great.

86
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,319
Nice work, Kayano.

87
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:41,101
You really thought all this up after
reading an article on the country's egg surplus?

88
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,998
Sorta.

89
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:45,471
Actually, I've wanted to try and do this for a while now.

90
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,941
And since the Ministry of Defense was
willing to shell out the money this time,

91
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:50,675
I figured why not go for it?

92
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:52,316
When my mind's fixed on something,

93
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,464
I just keep rolling, I guess.

94
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:56,213
Most of the time,

95
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:58,922
Kayano's more in the background than center stage.

96
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:02,227
That's probably why I've always
pegged her as the supporting role type.

97
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:04,165
But look at her now.

98
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,370
I never imagined she could get so fired up.

99
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,274
Proof anyone can shine when
what they're into becomes relevant.

100
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,585
We've got another early day tomorrow.

101
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,858
Once we've let it chill overnight,

102
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,801
we check to see if it's firmed up enough.

103
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:21,184
If it is, we remove the pipes.

104
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:24,187
After that,

105
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:26,547
we loosen the bolts holding the lid in place.

106
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:30,980
Then we blow air between the walls
of the mold and the pudding itself.

107
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:32,697
Next...

108
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:34,387
Release internal lock!

109
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,427
When the pudding is completely free of the mold,

110
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:44,883
we carefully shore up the sides
with softened gelatin and agar

111
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:47,028
to add just a bit more firmness.

112
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,608
Then we top it off with a caramel sauce.

113
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,417
And lightly brulee the top!

114
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,113
We did it!

115
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,465
Wow! That looks sure delicious!

116
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:06,119
You completely forget there's a bomb planted in there!

117
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:07,891
And with that,

118
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:11,434
Kayano's gigantic killer pudding was ready to be served.

119
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:19,041
And-And I'm allowed to eat this entire thing?

120
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,475
Oh, uh, sure.

121
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:23,224
I just didn't want those eggs going to some landfill.

122
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,337
This was all Kayano's idea, you know.

123
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,557
You've made me so happy!

124
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:30,899
We'd better get goin'.

125
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,090
Yeah. Don't wanna be late for English.

126
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:35,563
Now, you've gotta promise to eat every last bite!

127
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,176
Not a problem!

128
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,536
At last my dream's come true! Thank you!

129
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,781
Come on. We'll watch the detonation from inside.

130
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:47,370
Oh. Yeah, okay.

131
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,677
Wow, he's really gettin' after it.

132
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:56,149
I have a feeling it won't be very
long till he reaches the bottom.

133
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:56,880
Don't worry,

134
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,191
I've installed a security camera into the base.

135
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:00,511
I'm keeping my eye on it.

136
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,663
The second he reaches the bomb,

137
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,888
we'll detonate it by remote control.

138
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,256
We'll know he's eaten his way to
it once light starts pouring in.

139
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:14,166
My pudding. It'll be...

140
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:24,806
It'll be tastiest if the flavor changes halfway through.

141
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:27,062
Ah, that makes sense.

142
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:29,881
I'll use a scale model to test its strength first.

143
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:33,529
Aww! Not another collapse!

144
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:36,980
Pudding...

145
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:40,750
My pudding!

146
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:44,399
I can't let something I've put my heart
and soul into be blown to smithereens!

147
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,931
Kayano, take it easy!

148
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,774
It's a damn pudding, not the family pet!

149
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,816
It's supposed to be blown to smithereens!

150
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:51,723
We can't!

151
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:55,504
It should stand in the schoolyard forever as a monument!

152
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,846
Ew, gross!

153
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,968
Phew! My jaws need a break.

154
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:03,775
By the way, amid all the deliciousness,
I caught a faint whiff of this.

155
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,644
The bomb! And the detonator's been detached!

156
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:12,959
I ate a path from caramel to pudding to dirt and
proceeded to tunnel from underneath to remove it.

157
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:17,210
I assume the bomb was your handy work, Takebayashi?

158
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:22,108
Well, your calculations were spot on, and
if had I not picked up the distinct scent

159
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:25,274
of plastic explosive, your
scheme might've very well worked.

160
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,233
Next time, you'll account for strange odors, right?

161
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,197
Right.

162
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:31,632
C'est la vie!

163
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:36,016
But since you worked together to create this
wonderful concoction, you should enjoy it together.

164
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,441
I set aside a nice, clean portion for each of you.

165
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:41,616
So he gets the drop on us yet again.

166
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:43,889
And it was such a clever idea, too.

167
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:45,152
Incidentally,

168
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:50,733
consuming eggs headed for the landfill is, strictly
speaking, a violation of sound economic principles.

169
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:55,941
So, we'll be exploring the complex role of a
perishable good surplus in our next civics lesson.

170
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:57,451
Yes, sir.

171
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:00,319
Kind of a shame, isn't it?

172
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,584
I bet you're relieved, though.

173
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:08,223
Honestly, no offense, but I didn't
think you had it in you to be so hardcore.

174
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,983
It was cool to watch. A nice change of pace.

175
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:11,617
Mmm.

176
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:15,017
That's what it is to be an assassin.

177
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:17,623
Not even your close friends get to see your true blade.

178
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:22,691
Oh, yeah. There's more where that came from.

179
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,837
I've got all kinds of jiggly weapons.

180
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:28,172
Here even a pudding expert can be a top-notch assassin.

181
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:41,548
Huh?

182
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,375
Once the break was over,

183
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:56,276
Mr. Karasuma got down to business
and really ramped up our training.

184
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,977
Today's P.E. class was a first.

185
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:01,916
Parkour crossed with Cops n' Roppers.

186
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,175
The cops being our toughest teachers.

187
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:05,358
How 'bout this?

188
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,781
If we manage to round 'em all
up, they get double the homework.

189
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:11,149
Ugh, stop makin' this about role play.

190
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:13,816
Aw now, ain't no reason it can't be fun.

191
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,743
You're just tryin' to hog all the good times for yourself.

192
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,441
Puttin' me in charge a holdin' down the fort.

193
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:21,649
What did you expect?

194
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,028
You can't be the chaser. This is training.

195
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,030
Mr. Karasuma will catch up to us eventually,

196
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,274
but it's a big mountain!

197
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:29,421
And there's a time limit,

198
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,813
so at best he'll tag maybe two or three of us, tops.

199
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:33,290
Yeah, if even that many.

200
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:34,298
No kidding.

201
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:36,680
I heard that.

202
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:39,861
Ridge. Eighty meters. Boom.

203
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:48,985
You're under arrest.

204
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:50,590
Caught ya' red-handed.

205
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:57,574
Okajima. Hayami. Chiba. Fuwa. You're out!

206
00:11:57,691 --> 00:11:59,941
Dude, I'm tellin' ya, don't get caught.

207
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:02,316
He's making us do worksheets. It sucks.

208
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,125
Come on.

209
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:04,867
This isn't some battle manga.

210
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:08,179
Seriously, how'd you not know he was
on your tail till after he tagged you?

211
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:09,680
Look, just be careful.

212
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:12,151
He's like a ninja. For all you know, he's right there.

213
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,191
Sugaya? Sugaya!

214
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,274
Big man's on the hunt all by his lonesome?

215
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:21,757
Well that works for me.

216
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:24,768
I'll just pull him down by his tagging hand and booyah.

217
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,850
We'll go at it right here in the wilderness.

218
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:29,851
"Bad Cop, Good Cop" will take on a whole new meaning.

219
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:32,028
Bring it on, you son of a bi...

220
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,633
Sugaya and Professor Bitch, you're out!

221
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,916
Uh-oh. We're droppin' like flies!

222
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:41,847
We should rename this place Mount Slaughter!

223
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,608
They just got tagged out, right?

224
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,083
Huh. Wait a second.

225
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:47,355
This is Cops n' Robbers. Technically...

226
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,400
We can tag 'em back in! Okuda, you're a genius!

227
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:52,378
Yeah, sure. Have fun.

228
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:56,858
Like anybody's breakin' out of jail
with the supersonic Octopus on duty.

229
00:12:56,941 --> 00:13:00,554
If it was possible to come in under
his radar, we'd have offed him months ago.

230
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:01,748
You have a point.

231
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:05,981
Sugino? You come to bust us out?

232
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:07,546
Ah-ha!

233
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:09,658
Yeah?

234
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,209
Ooh.

235
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,735
Just this one time.

236
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,387
Sugino! Now!

237
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,267
Five prisoners free.

238
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:24,959
Damn it!

239
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,166
Mind explaining how prisoners are escaping on your watch?

240
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:30,233
They're shrewder than we gave 'em credit for!

241
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,006
But good heavens! Those things are really enormous!

242
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:34,223
Are you taking bribes?

243
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:37,607
Look, whatever, if you let the
next group escape, so help me!

244
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,467
Actually, Koro-sensei.

245
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:41,119
Yup?

246
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,995
My little brother's come down with a rare illness.

247
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:46,577
Poor guy's been bedridden for weeks.

248
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,983
When I told him what we're playing, he texted back:

249
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,383
"Win one for me."

250
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,833
If he finds out I was captured,
the shock might be too much.

251
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:54,316
Go.

252
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:58,675
This cop never saw anything, so go.

253
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,907
Thank you, sir! You're the best!

254
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,292
Four more prisoners free.

255
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,404
Come in, Karasuma! Do you copy?

256
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:09,396
How are these inmates breaking out of my prison?

257
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,488
That's my line, you moron!

258
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:15,358
Time's up! Game over!

259
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:17,856
Finally.

260
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:18,637
Can't breathe...

261
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:19,538
About friggin' time.

262
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:20,387
Need air.

263
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:25,862
When it was over, our game of Cops n'
Robbers-slash-parkour ended with us getting away.

264
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,066
Koro-sensei's stint as warden left a lot to be desired

265
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:31,058
as far as Mr. Karasuma was concerned.

266
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:33,243
But it was good training for us either way, really.

267
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,476
Yep. Things were going fairly well.

268
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,113
Second term was off to a promising start.

269
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:47,123
No way.

270
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:53,789
An excellent beginning to second term, it must be said.

271
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:57,760
The mutual respect and trust the students
and I share grows stronger by the day.

272
00:14:57,983 --> 00:15:00,191
How wonderful it is to see their shining faces

273
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,560
look up at me with such... unbridled disgust?

274
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,855
They're totally talking about you, aren't they?

275
00:15:09,902 --> 00:15:11,139
How could you do that stuff?

276
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:13,108
We're very disappointing in you, sir.

277
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,810
No, wait! I'm innocent!

278
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:16,858
I don't even know anything about this!

279
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,524
So, have an alibi?

280
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:19,323
A do what now?

281
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:22,398
Where were you on the evenings
of the incidents in question?

282
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,361
And can anybody back you up?

283
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:25,567
Let me see.

284
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:28,992
I was vigorously shaking a bag of seasoned fries.

285
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:32,858
Alternating between an altitude of ten thousand
meters and three thousand meters, respectively.

286
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,399
No one can back that up!

287
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,943
That's enough, guys. Come on, he's not a perv.

288
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,816
He's done some creepy things, sure.

289
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,290
But even if you add 'em all
together, what've you really got?

290
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:45,351
He's read some adult magazines.
Been bribed with dirty pictures.

291
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,036
Stared intently at pinups during recess.

292
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:53,066
Spammed lingerie companies with requests
to let him give their models a tentacle bra.

293
00:15:53,138 --> 00:15:54,041
Daddy help.

294
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:57,881
Koro-sensei, just turn yourself in.

295
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:59,318
Et tu, Isogai?

296
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:01,941
This is an outrage! I stand wrongfully accused!

297
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:04,483
Don't you believe me? Very well. To the teacher's lounge!

298
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,024
I'll show you the kind of upright citizen I can be!

299
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,049
Behold! My pinup stash.

300
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:13,112
I'll toss every last one of them
without so much as a twinge of reservation!

301
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:16,853
You're kidding.

302
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:20,331
Oh my god, guys! Check out the roll book!

303
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:22,866
He put letters next to all the girls' names.

304
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,710
Koro-sensei knows our cup sizes!

305
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:26,726
Huh?!

306
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,311
What the hell is "Forever Flat" supposed to mean
you eight-armed, two-bit, emoji-faced peeping tom?!

307
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:31,129
And what about this?

308
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:34,524
A breakdown of all the girls in
Kunugigaoka with an F-cup or above?

309
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,077
Wait, I... That can't possibly...

310
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:40,994
You know what we need?

311
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,916
A good, old-fashioned, afterschool barbeque!

312
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,191
Doesn't that sound like fun?

313
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:44,672
Here!

314
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:47,094
Get a load of these succulent skewers I threw together!

315
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:54,874
Wow.

316
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,294
This is nauseating.

317
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:57,289
Gross.

318
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:08,054
That... That's all for today, b-boys and girls.

319
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,413
I, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

320
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:19,613
We certainly put the Octopus
through the ringer, didn't we?

321
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:21,899
Some people just can't take the heat.

322
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:25,230
Is he stealing underwear? That'd be pretty serious.

323
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,399
I mean, we're talkin' an actual crime.

324
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,959
Compared to blowing up the Earth? I say it's precious.

325
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,317
Okay, but...

326
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,608
I don't know what I'd do with super speed,

327
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:37,290
but I can tell you one thing, if I stole underwear,

328
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:40,619
I sure as hell wouldn't be sloppy
enough to leave evidence behind.

329
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,576
I found that in the equipment shed.

330
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,941
Koro-sensei's no fool. He understands.

331
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:50,868
Knows he'd be dead to us over something like this.

332
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,530
His whole life's about being a teacher.

333
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:57,248
Between losing our respect and being assassinated,

334
00:17:57,774 --> 00:18:01,435
everyone knows which of those things
he'd go more out of his way to avoid.

335
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:04,358
Yeah. Have to agree with you.

336
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:06,816
Then who's the sicko doing all this stuff?

337
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:08,093
An impostor.

338
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:09,088
Fuwa?

339
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:13,281
That color. That laugh. We're dealing with an archetype.

340
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:16,941
A fake sensei! The Double! The Doppelgänger!

341
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,138
Oldest super villain trope in the book!

342
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:24,754
Which means our culprit is intimately
familiar with Koro-sensei and his quirks.

343
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,433
Hey, let's you and me play detective, Ritsu.

344
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,045
Yes!

345
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,856
Something along those lines.

346
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,818
As for what's in this for the real culprit,

347
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:35,316
your guess is as good as mine.

348
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:36,691
But we gotta put a stop to him.

349
00:18:36,774 --> 00:18:39,066
If the rumor mill runs Koro-sensei out of town,

350
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,399
there goes our bounty, and then what's all this been for?

351
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:42,940
We'll lose our shot at this.

352
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,380
If, on the other hand,

353
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,723
we catch the real guy ourselves,
Teach will be in our debt.

354
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:48,405
Yeah!

355
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:49,917
"Forever Flat."

356
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:59,899
Ha. Justice will prevail now the great,
and very mature, detective is on the case.

357
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,333
You say "on the case,"

358
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:04,066
I say "exploiting our parkour skills to trespass."

359
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:05,566
Hey, remind me again.

360
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:07,899
Of all the places in town, what makes us so sure

361
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,897
the creeper's gonna strike here next?

362
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:13,188
First off, this place is a camp for pro entertainers.

363
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:14,554
The cincher, though?

364
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,381
A phenomenally popular, bazonga-licous girl group

365
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:19,590
has been staying here for the past couple of weeks.

366
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:20,431
Right.

367
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,768
And based on the suspect's profile,

368
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:27,042
the probability that he'll show is 99.78%.

369
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:30,067
Indeed, because camp's over after tomorrow.

370
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:34,566
And no way is our man gonna let these
top-tier trophies slip through his fingers!

371
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:35,807
Uh-huh.

372
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:43,257
Koro-sensei!

373
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:46,229
Okay, please say that he's here to nab the bad guy, too.

374
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:49,177
That getup ain't exactly helpin' me presume his innocence.

375
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:51,566
Look. He's so pissed off at the real criminal,

376
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,127
just looking at all that underwear gets him steamed.

377
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:56,891
Right. Wrongfully accused my ass.

378
00:19:59,233 --> 00:19:59,957
Heads up.

379
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,317
Someone's here!

380
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,302
A big guy with a yellow head!

381
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:04,733
I knew it!

382
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:06,608
So it is a frame-up.

383
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:09,621
Look at him move, that's not normal.

384
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:10,974
Uh-oh! He's getting away!

385
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:11,932
Gotcha!

386
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:15,083
How dare you impersonate me
and act out my lurid fantasies!

387
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,999
Well, so long as everyone thinks
I'm pilfering unmentionables,

388
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,964
I might as well take yours!

389
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:21,425
I dunno.

390
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,086
I think this might make him worse than an underwear thief.

391
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,806
Hey, the eyewitness reports were right about his head.

392
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:29,801
Now. Let's see your true face, Imposter!

393
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,729
Hang on, isn't that that guy...

394
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:39,215
Mr. Karasuma's underling?

395
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:41,067
You?

396
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:44,404
What earthy reason could you have for... Ah!

397
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:50,846
The government was kind enough to let
me have one of Karasuma's men on loan.

398
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:55,899
I required a decoy to lure you
into this pen of anti-Sensei sheets.

399
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,566
Not unlike the ruse your students devised on the island,

400
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:02,326
yes?

401
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,870
Such nimble minds the young have.

402
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:08,023
Lure, confine, and strike.

403
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:09,588
That voice.

404
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:12,289
Now, then, Koro-sensei.

405
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:15,714
Let your final death match begin.

406
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:20,758
So strong, but compared to me...

407
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:24,151
so weak.
