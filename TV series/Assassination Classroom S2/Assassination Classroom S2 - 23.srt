1
00:00:01,683 --> 00:00:03,198
Listen to me, class.

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:07,138
There's something I neglected
to mention in my earlier lesson.

3
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:12,404
A clever assassin may avoid confrontation for a while,

4
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:15,176
but sooner or later, the fight will come.

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:16,582
And when it does,

6
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:19,593
every last ounce of strength will be put to the test.

7
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:25,893
In my case, that would be now!

8
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,050
Koro-sensei!

9
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:31,956
For every attack, a corresponding sonic boom.

10
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:35,874
Clearly, this was not your garden-variety battle royale.

11
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:38,638
We couldn't make out their moves,

12
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:42,730
but there was no mistaking it,
Koro-sensei was losing ground.

13
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:43,938
Big time.

14
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:51,404
Koro-sensei!

15
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:00,470
Sufficiently hopeless yet, guinea pig?

16
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,601
A little math theorem.

17
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,104
Square the inverse of your tentacles and solve for genius.

18
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:09,544
Factored by the power of hatred.

19
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,078
And you get superiority!

20
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:26,562
Please! Teach me to kill like that!

21
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,193
You're sure about that?

22
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:34,440
I did just murder your father. You're not at all upset?

23
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:35,747
Who cares about him?

24
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,854
You. You're an artist! I'd
give anything to do what you do!

25
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,666
Nothing in my life has any meaning.

26
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,296
Take me in. Teach me what you know. Please!

27
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:49,308
I'm willing! I'm willing to risk my life!

28
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:53,979
The child had no concept of right and wrong,

29
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:55,480
but his eyes,

30
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:59,073
his eyes shone with an intelligence
and a singular determination.

31
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,173
There was the fork in the road,

32
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:05,579
the point where I might've steered him differently,

33
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,194
spared his sanity.

34
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,867
They're in totally different leagues.

35
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,277
This is a one-sided fight.

36
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:31,090
All our hard work, down the drain.

37
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:35,062
Everything we'd done the past year... meaningless.

38
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:40,165
We were barely a distraction,
too stunned even to run away.

39
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:45,112
Not just failures... Koro-sensei's failure.

40
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,901
He's dodging them. Am I seeing things?

41
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,507
Heh! Let's see you deflect this!

42
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:06,071
What the...?

43
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,155
You're kidding me!

44
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:20,474
Koro-sensei's using evasive moves with minimal energy,

45
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:22,851
throwing handfuls of soil to block the light.

46
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,799
That closes the gap between them significantly.

47
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,587
He's analyzing and adjusting
for his own weaknesses mid-battle.

48
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,727
I'm not surprised. That's our Koro-sensei.

49
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,754
You may chalk this one down to experience!

50
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:45,080
I am the teacher. You are the student.

51
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,451
I take full responsibility for your lapse, but first...

52
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,319
Yanagisawa, I'd like you to leave.

53
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,180
This is a place of learning, not a warzone.

54
00:05:57,516 --> 00:05:59,683
You have no business being here!

55
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,078
You just won't let go of this fantasy
of being an educator, will you?

56
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:08,082
Deranged little guinea pig.

57
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:10,680
Answer me this, teacher!

58
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:15,088
Why do you suppose we chose this of
all moments to launch our final offensive?

59
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:20,706
You will protect them, right?

60
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:22,954
That is what a teacher's meant to do.

61
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:34,043
What the hell's goin' on?

62
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:34,975
Where're the children?

63
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,319
Are you all right, sir?

64
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:51,683
Koro-sensei!

65
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:56,116
Well, well, aren't you the model protector?!

66
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,833
You could easily dodge these blows if you had a mind to,

67
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,744
yet you stay for the sake of
your poor defenseless charges.

68
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:07,199
I believe it's time. Another, please.

69
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:14,979
And another.

70
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:17,567
And another.

71
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:21,643
And another. And another. And another.

72
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,903
I don't think I've ever seen hatred more intense.

73
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:32,336
When fueled by bloodlust,
there's no emotion more destructive.

74
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:36,207
Killing won't satisfy a man like that.

75
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:38,749
He won't stop until his target is obliterated.

76
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,600
Mind, body, heart, and soul.

77
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:47,274
Koro-sensei...

78
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:52,478
Coral the guinea pig with his precious students
and this was all but a foregone conclusion.

79
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:55,567
Sorry, boys and girls. You chose poorly.

80
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:00,024
Showing up here tonight only increased
the likelihood of his dying by our hands.

81
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:03,988
Shut up, Yanagisawa.

82
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:06,952
I think we've all heard just about enough out of you.

83
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:09,573
Huh?

84
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:12,283
Karasuma!

85
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,781
Make yourselves comfortable and enjoy the show.

86
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:19,863
I'm afraid at this juncture
there's really nothing else you can do.

87
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:26,266
We'd seen it. All along.

88
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:31,011
We'd seen, but... we looked away.

89
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,902
Optimistically, I'd say seven or eight.

90
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:39,356
Surely you can't just leave
these poor young people to drown, can you?

91
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:42,276
How does it feel...

92
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:48,409
watching your student's quake with despair
as they realize how much of a hindrance they've been?

93
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:53,240
Do you understand now?

94
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,861
They are your greatest weakness!

95
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:01,256
He's absolutely right. It...

96
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:04,246
It's u...

97
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,126
That is preposterous!

98
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:13,126
You're a fool if you think
I'll believe it's that cut and dry!

99
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:16,352
These children, they've risked life and limb to save me.

100
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:20,014
What they've gone through just to
be here tonight is extraordinary!

101
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:23,558
Their determination, their unflappable spirit,

102
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:27,021
students like these are the
greatest gift a teacher could ask for!

103
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,808
They are not a hindrance! They are not a weakness!

104
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:32,479
They are my class!

105
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:35,611
And I am proud of each and every one of them!

106
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:40,101
Call it what you will, but when the chips are down,

107
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:43,062
I will give my life to protect them!

108
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:49,537
Yes, that's all fine and good. So dutiful.

109
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:52,937
And yet, I'm afraid, we have to
deny you even that satisfaction.

110
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:55,567
See, your strength will run out soon,

111
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:58,158
at which point the children you're protecting...

112
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:01,534
let's just say their future
won't be as bright as you'd hoped.

113
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,644
Everything you've gained over the last year
you've gained by destroying our lives.

114
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:10,416
I will ensure that it was all for nothing!

115
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:13,848
Then and only then will my revenge be complete!

116
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:17,808
Now then, let's continue. Where were we?

117
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:20,873
Yes, of course! Mind that you pay close attention.

118
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,064
Idiot!

119
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:25,155
What the...?

120
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:29,212
Make a run for it, sir!

121
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:31,766
Find a place to hide. You need to recover.

122
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:33,090
I'll buy you some time!

123
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,965
Kayano, what're you doing?

124
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,434
Ah-ha.

125
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:48,057
Even with the tentacles excised,
your kinetic vision remains.

126
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:51,559
No, Kayano! Stop this at once!

127
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,745
It was all my fault.

128
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:56,232
I brought us down.

129
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:59,284
Because of me, everyone had to face the truth.

130
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:03,049
We'd been like a family and I ruined it.

131
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:07,530
So, please, just let me do this.

132
00:11:08,183 --> 00:11:10,283
As your student, I owe you one.

133
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:12,225
You can't put this on yourself, Kayano!

134
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:15,033
Sooner or later we all would've had to face reality!

135
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:17,350
Your actions simply made us take stock and regroup...!

136
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:21,735
What do you say, 2.0?

137
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,194
Don't worry, Koro-sensei.

138
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:36,885
I've got this.

139
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:40,502
All I have to do is try. My sister taught me that.

140
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:43,217
So did you!

141
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:21,759
Unbelievable!

142
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:25,255
What're the odds of having both
sisters die right in front of me?

143
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:29,058
Tragic ends must run in the family, eh?

144
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,355
Ha-ha!

145
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,010
Can you imagine if I'd kept her around as a back-up wife?

146
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,297
Too bad for me.

147
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,070
It looks like I have a thing
for women destined to be impaled.

148
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,264
There it is!

149
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:08,810
Oh, but you are a devastating creature when
your emotions twist past the point of endurance!

150
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,511
Black indicates well-nigh unimaginable power.

151
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:17,017
At last, your true colors are on full, glorious display!

152
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:20,925
Isn't it liberating to shed that ridiculous façade?

153
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:24,241
All year long, you've been a smiling hypocrite!

154
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:27,066
How wonderful to see you as you really are!

155
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,227
But alas,

156
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
considerable though your power may be in this form...

157
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:38,975
the new and improved you will negate it effortlessly.

158
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:43,003
Thank you for playing. Behold his final attack.

159
00:13:57,141 --> 00:13:58,904
We need to get out of here!

160
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:01,110
Are you for real?

161
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,962
C'mon! We're wasting time! He's distracted!

162
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:06,703
If we stick around, it'll only make things worse!

163
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,099
You can't be serious!

164
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,799
Living to fight another day
is a perfectly reasonable battle tactic!

165
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,332
This has been the year from Hell, hasn't it?

166
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,986
Well, fortunately it's all over now.

167
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:53,001
What? A white light?

168
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,177
But, he... His tentacles are still black!

169
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:01,047
No. He's gone back to yellow.

170
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:02,660
Nuh-uh. That's red!

171
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,526
He's green!

172
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:06,108
And blue!

173
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:08,420
And white!

174
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,057
Every color.

175
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,544
Every emotion.

176
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:16,682
Every element of my past.

177
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:18,581
My entire life...

178
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:20,711
mixed together...

179
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:24,095
into pure white energy.

180
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,057
Treasured pupil...

181
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:31,182
may your graduation... help you find peace!

182
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:43,004
Shit! No, no! The barrier liquefies tentacles!

183
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:47,603
Damn you!

184
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:58,369
What're these flowers for?

185
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,014
Uh. I just thought they looked pretty is all.

186
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,908
Figured making arrangements might, I don't know,

187
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:05,607
come in handy one day or something.

188
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,031
Sorry, master, I can move them.

189
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,400
No. Leave them here.

190
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,304
You've got a keen eye.

191
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:21,910
Nicely done.

192
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:24,023
You really mean that, sir?

193
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,477
I can make a fresh bouquet every morning!

194
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:28,415
I suppose you could...

195
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,888
But I'd rather you study chemistry.

196
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:34,439
With what you know now, you'd be lucky to kill a mosquito.

197
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,899
If I'd only seen that smile,

198
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:45,744
I might've led the poor boy
down an entirely different path.

199
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,428
The tentacles spoke to me,

200
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:05,407
asked me what I wanted.

201
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,416
And I said... to be acknowledged by you.

202
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,020
To be like you...

203
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:17,572
To be... like... you.

204
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:20,415
But you are.

205
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,061
You are and you always have been.

206
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:24,992
More than you understood.

207
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:28,829
If by chance we meet again... on the other side...

208
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:31,315
let's pick up where we left off.

209
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:47,158
The fight was over...

210
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,924
but none of us were shouting for joy.

211
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,752
Koro-sensei, Kayano's...

212
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,448
Oh, Kaede.

213
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:17,420
Why don't we lay her down?

214
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,979
Not so fast. One moment, please.

215
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,784
Sorry, I'd rather her cells
not come in contact with the soil.

216
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:26,391
But, sir...

217
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:28,036
Children,

218
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:31,665
I've made mistakes, more than I care to count.

219
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:33,723
What's done is done.

220
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:36,838
The past can never be regained or revised.

221
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:39,762
If, however, we attend carefully,

222
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:42,415
it can teach us how to move forward.

223
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:46,474
What is... that?

224
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,590
You're looking at Kayano's blood and somatic cells.

225
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:53,230
I gathered as much as I could
before she fell to the ground

226
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:56,774
and stored them in a sterile membrane
of compressed air for safekeeping.

227
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:59,641
You-You did all of that in the middle of a battle?

228
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:02,097
I set a few tentacles aside for protecting you.

229
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:06,555
Of the rest, I used some for fighting and some for this.

230
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,112
Okey dokey, then.

231
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:12,045
Time to string these cells together one by one.

232
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:15,413
Faster. And more accurately.

233
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:18,335
You see, class,

234
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,162
I've been improving my skills for some months now.

235
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:23,840
If what happened to Aguri repeated itself,

236
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:26,566
I was adamant about being prepared.

237
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,416
Now, some cells couldn't be recovered,

238
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:32,452
so I'll leave strategic gaps.

239
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:35,075
Those I'll fill in with tiny bits of mucus.

240
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:40,319
In a few days, what cells there are will have
regenerated in sufficient quantities to replace them.

241
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:46,484
I'm a little low on blood. Type AB donors, if you please.

242
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,141
Nakamura! The birthday cake!

243
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:53,546
Collect it and stuff it in my mouth immediately!

244
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:54,802
Do what?!

245
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:57,909
You realize it's been one with the
dirt for the past half hour, right?

246
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:58,877
That doesn't matter!

247
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,625
I have to replenish my energy!

248
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:02,991
Besides, I can't stop thinking about it!

249
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:03,875
Thirty-minute rule!

250
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,218
Thirty-second rule!

251
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,303
I think the wound's starting to close up!

252
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:16,422
He didn't use a single stitch;
Didn't leave so much as a mark!

253
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,181
In a moment, her heart will start
beating and she'll come back to life.

254
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:26,939
According to my handy-dandy. "What
to Do for a Gut-Shot Student" manual,

255
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:28,940
from here on out it should be smooth sailing.

256
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:31,849
But who thinks of writing a manual
for something like that?!

257
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,283
I didn't mention this earlier
for fear of sounding ghoulish,

258
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:38,349
but if ever your bodies were torn to shreds,

259
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:41,700
I was ready and able to put
them back in order piece by piece.

260
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:44,355
The ultimate student-teacher relationship, really.

261
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,947
Because it requires, above all else,

262
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,021
that I properly acknowledge you.

263
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:11,804
What did you...? You saved me again, didn't you?

264
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,848
As many times as necessary.

265
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,097
After all, your sister would've done the same.

266
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:26,922
The important thing

267
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:29,752
is that you not make the same mistake twice.

268
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:34,176
Aguri, thank you for giving me this past year.

269
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:39,198
Such a beautiful gift.

270
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:42,098
I hope against hope I've been worthy of it.
