1
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:04,323
Having gotten our hands on some juicy Intel,

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:06,619
we took it upon ourselves to investigate.

3
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:08,740
At least that was our story.

4
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:13,174
To be honest, we'd infiltrated this café a
good ways from school just for the heck of it.

5
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,223
Wow. He looks just like a prince.

6
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:19,187
Hi. Welcome.

7
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,681
Ah, yes. Good to see you both again.

8
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:23,240
Mrs. Harada, Mrs. Ito.

9
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,156
Li'l Yuma. How are you?

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,198
Now, you realize we come here
more for you than the coffee.

11
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,448
Now, now. If the manager hears you say that,

12
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,051
he's bound to get his feelings hurt.

13
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:34,235
So, the usual?

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,864
Mocha for Mrs. Harada, double espresso for Mrs. Ito?

15
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:38,740
Care for a slice of chiffon cake?

16
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:40,198
It's our special of the day.

17
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,406
Ooh! Yes, please. We'll take two.

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,110
Indeed. Very good, ma'am.

19
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,073
Our leader's not just a man.

20
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,240
He's a prince among men.

21
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:49,031
Ugh. I want him to die.

22
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,680
You're really nursing that tea.

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,112
Sure you don't want somethin' else?

24
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:53,310
Actually, yes.

25
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:55,916
Might as well get the most out of keeping your job secret.

26
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:58,601
Ah, I get it. Good old extortion, huh?

27
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:01,156
This one's on me. Enjoy.

28
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:02,820
He's Prince Charming!

29
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,698
Look how much he can carry at once!

30
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:07,151
He's Prince Charming!

31
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,815
Sweetheart, don't tell me your
poor mother's taken ill again.

32
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:11,704
Well, you know.

33
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:13,380
It's just the two of us,

34
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:16,621
so sometimes I have to help
out in the financial department.

35
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:18,043
He's Prince Charming!

36
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:19,273
Yeah. The only negative thing

37
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:21,196
you could say about him is he's dirt poor.

38
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,492
'Cept somehow makes even that look cool.

39
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,740
Guy keeps his clothes so neat and tidy,

40
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:27,865
you'd never know they're fresh off the bargain rack.

41
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:29,281
He's Prince Charming!

42
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:33,281
Oh, and did I mention he let me eat some of
the goldfish he caught at the Summer Festival?

43
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:35,349
Let me tell you, that boy can cook!

44
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:36,602
He's Prince Charming!

45
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:39,191
Oh, yeah. And I went to the bathroom after him once.

46
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:41,646
He'd folded the toilet paper into a triangle!

47
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:43,108
He's Prince Charming!

48
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:46,789
I fold toilet paper into a triangle. Every time I go!

49
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,992
That's disgusting.

50
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,305
Check him out.

51
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,173
Even middle-aged women dote on him!

52
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,448
He's Prince Charming!

53
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,365
Uh, middle-aged women in my neighborhood

54
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,884
dote on me sometimes.

55
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,074
Who cares?

56
00:01:57,323 --> 00:01:59,115
Did you know Isogai gets love letters

57
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:00,531
from the girls on the main campus?

58
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:01,834
He's Prince Charming!

59
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,170
Um. I get them, too, actually.

60
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:05,814
Forbidden love!

61
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:07,939
Alas, some things are only cool

62
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,573
when done by a cool person.

63
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,560
Like Isogai, or me, of course.

64
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:12,593
He's Prince Cha...

65
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:14,904
What are you doing here?

66
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:17,780
Their honey toast! It's absolutely divine!

67
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:21,586
Enough so that I turn a blind eye
to Isogai's illicit part-time job.

68
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:25,330
I'm rather surprised.

69
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:28,173
You're not the least bit irked
at his being such an ideal man?

70
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,609
Uh? No.

71
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:31,540
Care to explain why not?

72
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,010
I don't get it.

73
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:37,112
He, uh, he's too good a guy to be upset with?

74
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:39,560
Do we need a better reason?

75
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:42,077
Hello! Welcome!

76
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:44,969
What's this? Uh, oh.

77
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,990
Looks like the rumors about a
student working here are true after all.

78
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:51,365
Isogai, you're such a bad student.

79
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:54,104
This is your second violation of school policy.

80
00:02:54,365 --> 00:02:57,076
I expected better. Oh, Isogai.

81
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:00,658
It's Asano. This couldn't get any worse.

82
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,267
The last time you were caught holding down a job,

83
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:40,984
they punted you to E-Class without a second thought.

84
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,656
Such a shame. Have you done no soul-searching since then?

85
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,960
Asano, I'm begging you. Keep this on the down-low.

86
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:51,566
It's only for the month. I need the money. Please.

87
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:52,996
I don't know.

88
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:56,318
Well perhaps we can be gentlemanly about all this.

89
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,608
You can tell when Asano's up to something sinister.

90
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:03,604
He becomes the spitting image of his father.

91
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:06,718
Very well, then. I'll keep your dirty little secret.

92
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:11,644
On condition that you show me your fighting spirit.

93
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:13,123
My what?

94
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,188
I think you heard me.

95
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,549
Our school has a proud tradition of revering
those who can hold their own in class and life.

96
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:25,055
Ample fighting spirit earns enough respect
to forgive a flagrant conduct violation.

97
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:26,803
And to show that spirit...

98
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,558
Pole-toppling at the Sports Festival?

99
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:33,738
Yep. If we can beat A Class,
they'll let Isogai off the hook.

100
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:38,406
Tch. You do know it's a trap.

101
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,841
They're obviously just out to humiliate us.

102
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,406
What're we supposed to do?

103
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,948
We say no, Isogai'll get penalized again.

104
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:48,253
Not a slap on the wrist either. He could get expelled.

105
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:51,604
So what? I don't want you guys getting involved.

106
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:55,435
Terasaka's right. Asano's got something up his sleeve.

107
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,391
Besides, I'm the one who made this choice.

108
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,552
I'll take responsibility for it myself.

109
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,134
Let them expel me.

110
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:05,024
Nothing says I can't stage an assassination off campus.

111
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,344
Wow what a...

112
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,740
terrible idea!

113
00:06:09,823 --> 00:06:10,316
Huh?

114
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,006
You impoverished, cow-licked bastard!

115
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,289
What do you mean cow-licked?

116
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,990
You're overthinkin' it, man. Knock it off.

117
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,962
Look, only thing we gotta do is
beat the nerds at pole-toppling.

118
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:22,845
We got this in the bag!

119
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:23,964
'Course we do!

120
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,816
Hell, I'd say we're lucky the jerks caught you workin'.

121
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:28,531
Golden opportunity.

122
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:29,906
We can payback some of the crap

123
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,281
they're always dishing out on us.

124
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,546
Topple 'em? We'll friggin' destroy 'em!

125
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:35,263
C'mon, Prince Charming.

126
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:36,272
You guys, I...

127
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:39,031
All right! Let's do it!

128
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:40,221
Yeah!

129
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:42,572
How very typical of him.

130
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:45,966
Always putting the needs of
his classmates ahead of his own.

131
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,896
This is personal magnetism in action.

132
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,915
Perhaps the single most important attribute of a leader.

133
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:57,479
As a prince among men myself, I ought to lend a hand.

134
00:06:58,589 --> 00:06:59,717
Pole-toppling, huh?

135
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:02,147
Reminds me of my days at the academy.

136
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:05,762
It's not so much assassination as war.

137
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,932
The relative size of your team can be a major setback.

138
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,448
These kids may be well-trained,

139
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,677
but A-Class' team has them outnumbered two to one.

140
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,155
Woo-hoo! Great job, Kimura!

141
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:30,990
Show 'em how it's done! That's the way!

142
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:33,142
Smile big for the camera! Go, Justice!

143
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,594
Might as well be water.

144
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:41,698
No problem.

145
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:43,017
That's so cool!

146
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:44,193
Indeed.

147
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,090
Assassination has improved overall fitness, equilibrium,

148
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,293
hand-eye coordination, and depth perception.

149
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:52,575
And this extraordinary competition will showcase them all!

150
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:55,090
Holy crap, that pipsqueak can move!

151
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:57,333
Her body's so... aerodynamic!

152
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:00,115
You move to the beat of your own drum,

153
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:01,401
an important advantage.

154
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:04,015
Remember that when it comes to pole-toppling, my boy.

155
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:06,367
Victory is entirely up to you.

156
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,147
Something wrong?

157
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,698
Koro-sensei, the fact of the matter is,

158
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,215
Asano is very talented.

159
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,029
I-I'm no match for him.

160
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:17,903
Huh...

161
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,802
Look at it this way.

162
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:24,433
However talented someone is,
however gifted or well-trained,

163
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,531
the world is a mighty big place.

164
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:28,156
There's always someone better.

165
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,365
What do I do? I can't win.

166
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,378
The guys are gonna get crushed because of me.

167
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:33,943
Talent or not,

168
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:37,106
one person alone can only accomplish so much.

169
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:38,879
Yeah!

170
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:43,531
You've got Asano beat in one
very important respect already.

171
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:46,394
The ability to inspire confidence in your comrades.

172
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:49,176
Should you find yourself between a rock and a hard place,

173
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,615
there'll be quite a few people rallying to help you.

174
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,870
You have the gift of personal magnetism.

175
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:57,656
And between you and me, I'd
much rather have a fellow like you

176
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,427
as a student than Asano.

177
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:03,722
All right!

178
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:07,225
Guys, like always, we're goin' into this guns blazing!

179
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,273
Yeah!

180
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,078
Next up, we have an exhibition match!

181
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,698
E-Class must be feelin' lucky, folks

182
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,781
'cause they've challenged A-Class to a battle!

183
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:18,395
Something tells me Kunugigaoka's
elite will make 'em live to regret it!

184
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:20,072
Who are they?

185
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:22,173
No way can that be regulation!

186
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:25,698
In the spirit of cultural diversity,
this exhibition match will feature

187
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:27,481
our foreign exchange students.

188
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:28,281
All of them.

189
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:29,448
Asano's scared.

190
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:31,254
He brought in outsiders to cover his butt.

191
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,156
Must be a lot riding on this for him.

192
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,447
This is gonna be hilarious.

193
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,356
What'cha gonna do, E-Class? You got nothin'.

194
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:45,490
If they expect to win with so few team members,

195
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:48,929
they'll have no choice but to
break formation and go on the attack.

196
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,056
At which point,

197
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:54,004
our ironclad defensive line will eat them alive.

198
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,056
Hey, uh, do the End Class dorks even wanna win?

199
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,534
None of them are on the offensive!

200
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,912
Okay, apparently E-Class'
strategy is to go all-in on defense.

201
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:06,995
Are they cowed by the gap in skill?

202
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,506
Whatever they're thinkin', let the games begin!

203
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:12,581
Bring it on, Asano.

204
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,250
If you think we can be lured out, you underestimate us.

205
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,642
Offensive line, go Plan F!

206
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,538
Roger that!

207
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,711
Our objective isn't to bring down the pole, per se.

208
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:28,287
No, we intend to crush you once and for all.

209
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,653
Uh, guys...

210
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:34,373
Dammit!

211
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:36,294
We're not just gonna roll over and take this!

212
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:43,698
Two men down!

213
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,615
And not just down, flung to the bleachers!

214
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:49,516
Sir, this is already a disaster!

215
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:51,365
It doesn't matter how tight the defense is

216
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:53,195
if all they do is get picked off!

217
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:57,778
How 'bout instead of tryin' to hold the line
like a bunch of turtles, you step up and fight?

218
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,567
Hmph. Or don't you know the meaning of the word?

219
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,624
Hey, partner,

220
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:05,262
why don't you stop yammerin' and follow your own advice?

221
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,200
Hmph. Bring it on, man!

222
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,647
Okay! Now!

223
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:12,656
Operation: Tentacles!

224
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:18,646
Pin 'em down!

225
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,448
Unbelievable!

226
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:24,281
The E-Class team is pinning down A-Class' offensive line

227
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:25,589
with the weight of the pole!

228
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:26,622
They're playing dirty!

229
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:30,340
Tough luck, big guy, there's no rule
against us using the pole as a weapon.

230
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:31,854
Get the hell off of me!

231
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:33,082
Shut up and stay down.

232
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:35,019
A splendid tactic.

233
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:38,156
But you've only got seven
teammates to create a defense with,

234
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,344
and two of them are down for the count.

235
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,941
You've just given us more of an advantage.

236
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:44,816
Guerilla team, Plan K!

237
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:46,191
Both flanks, move in!

238
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:50,704
There's a gap dead center.

239
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:53,802
If we're going to attack, is has
to be now while they're separated.

240
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,448
All right, let's do it!

241
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,466
Look alive, men! Operation: Runny Nose!

242
00:11:58,495 --> 00:11:59,076
Yeah!

243
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,773
I've got you now.

244
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:06,768
Oh-ho! Classic bait and switch!

245
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:08,898
They pulled an offensive fake-out!

246
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,157
It's like a chess problem.

247
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:16,175
The kids have made their defensive line airtight.

248
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:20,147
But the tide of battle is turning against them quickly.

249
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:29,944
We should do something.

250
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:34,226
The Ministry of Defense isn't gonna like
it very much if the students get injured.

251
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:37,920
Not to worry, my good man.

252
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,113
I gave Isogai some helpful tips during Social Studies.

253
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:44,537
On the subject of defeating an enemy twice your size,

254
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,472
history provides an excellent
example in Hannibal of Carthage.

255
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,259
Ah, yes, called "The Scourge of Ancient Rome."

256
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,293
He led his troops off-road, time and again,

257
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:56,281
popping up where the opposing forces were least prepared.

258
00:12:56,365 --> 00:13:00,365
His defense strategies were
clever, his weapons innovative.

259
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,670
The lesson here is that a good
tactician thinks unconventionally.

260
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:08,659
Successful schemes are often
guided by a touch of the eccentric.

261
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:13,950
Ooh! Ha!

262
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:16,691
The E-Class dorks are about
to get the net closed in on 'em.

263
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:19,073
Yeah, it's beatin' time!

264
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:20,748
Whoa, what the...?

265
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:22,284
Look out!

266
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:32,740
The E-Class team has fled the playing field and
is running amok among the spectators! Total chaos!

267
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:35,027
Hey, there're no rules about boundaries.

268
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,115
Come on. What'cha waitin' for?

269
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:38,704
The whole school's a battlefield.

270
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,915
What're you doing? Damn it! Quit screwin' around, guys!

271
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,163
The most dangerous part of pole-toppling

272
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:49,016
is that even with only a handful of
teammates, you can clamor to the top.

273
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:51,336
Their strongest are...

274
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:55,132
Akabane. Kimura. Isogai.

275
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:56,640
Those are the three to watch.

276
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:58,597
Yuma Isogai.

277
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:01,573
Should E-Class lose this friendly little match,

278
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:04,606
I'll report your infraction and you'll be out in the cold.

279
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:08,617
Order your team to attack unless you care to be expelled.

280
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:12,145
Fall alone or drag your friends down with you.

281
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:13,558
The choice is yours.

282
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:17,308
Not ideal, but those are the
stakes of leading the underdogs.

283
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,946
Isogai! It's about that time!

284
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:21,662
Yep!

285
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,007
And so far, it's all going to plan!

286
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:32,922
What? Where'd those two come from?

287
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,031
Weren't they out of commission?

288
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:36,925
We practiced takin' punches till we were blue in the face.

289
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:40,842
But the hardest part of it all was
acting like we got flung off the field!

290
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:42,271
You're kidding me!

291
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:44,313
These are the goons we pummeled in the beginning?

292
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,711
Right, we're done running!

293
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,507
E-Class, go Sonic!

294
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:49,048
Yeah!

295
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:51,837
Of course.

296
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,840
The scuffle was only to distract our attention.

297
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,439
After those two clowns were
knocked to the seats, they regrouped.

298
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:00,273
Why didn't I see it coming?

299
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:03,977
Now they're taking advantage of
the chaos to rush our main unit!

300
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:05,677
That's their game!

301
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,361
That's our game!

302
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,530
Oh! They got right up in their grill!

303
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:12,596
How you like that, Asano?

304
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:14,365
There may not be that many of us.

305
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,855
But it only takes one to reach the top of the pole.

306
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:25,928
Don't tell me this punk knows martial arts.

307
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:30,567
We happen to be standing on the same stage, you and I.

308
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:36,026
Tell me, are so big a fool you
don't expect to be kicked off?

309
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:40,514
Strong Final Boss vibe. Definitely his father's son.

310
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,823
Uh-oh. A-Class is closing in.

311
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:47,513
Anyone else feel like we're about to watch a massacre?

312
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,734
Make no mistake.

313
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:52,385
Asano is a singularly fearsome leader.

314
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:56,726
Provided they follow his command, A-Class can't lose.

315
00:15:58,213 --> 00:16:01,228
Not the sort of adversary you can trifle with, Isogai.

316
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:05,789
Fortunately... you don't have
to take in on all by yourself.

317
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:08,680
What?

318
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:09,759
Wait a minute!

319
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:12,104
The E-Class offensive has called in reinforcements!

320
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,798
What the hell? That's their defensive unit.

321
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,908
Which means...

322
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,323
They only have two guys left at the pole?!

323
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:20,359
How are they even holdlin' 'em down?

324
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:22,129
A little thing called leverage.

325
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:22,742
Heh?

326
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:25,412
Oh yeah. Physics and stuff.

327
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:26,948
Ha-ha! Nice one, man.

328
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,865
They're totally buyin' that answer.

329
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:30,631
It's simply a play for time.

330
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,135
The two of us can't really hold
down this many people by ourselves.

331
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,160
Lucky for us,

332
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,120
these poor souls don't dare do anything without orders.

333
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:41,484
Could be your boss still has an ace up his sleeve.

334
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:43,606
And of course, in times like these

335
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:46,554
it's better to wait and see
than take the initiative, right?

336
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,889
Stupid four-eyes!

337
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:51,391
Asano! We need orders!

338
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:53,696
I can't give you any!

339
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,073
Looks like the A-Class team is
assuming a defensive posture, too!

340
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,164
If they can hold, E-Class will be out of options!

341
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:02,975
Itona! Now! Do it!

342
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:04,258
Yeah, okay.

343
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:09,467
A secret weapon is best saved for the last minute.

344
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:17,379
I can't lose!

345
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:31,365
Uh... The... A-Class is, uh...

346
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:34,302
Team E-Class... for the win!

347
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:38,740
Outstanding! My students are so cool!

348
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:41,506
Aren't they cool? Look this way, please!

349
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:43,050
That's right! They're mine!

350
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Well, well, well.

351
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,505
It would appear that by some miracle,

352
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:49,097
the underdogs have gotten the better of you again.

353
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:50,517
You were owned.

354
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:53,144
I believe that's how the kids are putting it these days.

355
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,198
Worse still, Isogai turned your strategy to his advantage.

356
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:59,751
You hadn't the foresight to account for a secret weapon.

357
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:03,080
This was a war of information, gentlemen, and you lost.

358
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,876
Because of incompetent leadership.

359
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:07,615
Uh, Mr. Principal.

360
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:10,007
Please, sir, your son did the best he could.

361
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:10,923
Shut up, Kevin!

362
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:12,089
Ya can't win 'em all.

363
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:15,155
You're his father, tell him
defeat can be a valuable lesson.

364
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:17,745
Yes, of course.

365
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,948
You're absolutely right, Kevin. Well said.

366
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,768
Perhaps you could teach me the value of defeat.

367
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:26,656
Your words would carry a great deal more weight,

368
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,727
if I knew what it was to lose, yes? Well, then.

369
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:34,033
Come. Fight. All four of you, please. At once.

370
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,406
There he is! Isogai!

371
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,859
You were incredible!

372
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,139
Oh, thank you!

373
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,281
But it's pretty dangerous stuff.

374
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:48,549
Yeah, yeah, prince among men.

375
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:51,805
Everything's different now. It's like the mood's changed.

376
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:54,403
They don't treat us like the untouchables anymore.

377
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,174
What do you expect, man?

378
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:58,198
Our nothin' little team rocked the boat today.

379
00:18:58,272 --> 00:18:59,511
People are gonna talk.

380
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,172
Think about it, guys.

381
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:04,191
Officially, we're now even cooler than Team Asano.

382
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:14,966
I'm sorry, sir. Please. Please accept my apology.

383
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:16,761
Did you know...

384
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,985
I once took down a black belt

385
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:21,644
on my third day of karate lessons.

386
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:25,323
The first day, I was soundly beaten, you understand,

387
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,017
by some 30-something.

388
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,076
There was so much pain, I vomited.

389
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:32,959
I'd never known a more agonizing defeat.

390
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,431
What do you suppose I did on day two?

391
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:37,265
I observed.

392
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:40,691
Inwardly consumed by flames of my humiliation,

393
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:42,907
certain were I to lose again,

394
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:45,862
I would be mortified to point of insanity.

395
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:49,987
That I would, in effect, die of madness.

396
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,499
On day three, I crushed my sensei

397
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:55,476
without him landing a single blow.

398
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,336
That is the lesson of defeat.

399
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:02,492
Incidentally, Asano.

400
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:06,392
Aren't you mortified? Losing hurts.

401
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:08,934
One would think the pain is eating you alive.

402
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:12,939
You're a monster.

403
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,350
Hey. Check it out.

404
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,654
Oh. It's Asano.

405
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:23,427
We had a deal.

406
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:26,336
You gonna hold your end of the bargain?

407
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:29,051
You're not gonna rat Isogai out for having a job?

408
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:31,258
You may take me at my word.

409
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,031
Unlike some people I know,

410
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,407
I'm not one for underhanded tactics.

411
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:38,569
But next time I won't just take you down.

412
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,087
I will chase you into oblivion.

413
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:44,409
Hah. Someone's a poor loser.

414
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:47,115
Yeah, what a jerk. Let him talk all the smack he wants.

415
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:48,698
We're totally above it.

416
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,148
Don't pay any attention to him.

417
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:51,381
He doesn't even know you, man.

418
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:53,355
Doesn't understand what you have to deal with.

419
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:56,015
Except, that's not being fair.

420
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,844
I don't know him either. His life could be really tough.

421
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:01,442
Plus, I've got super awesome classmates.

422
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:04,408
If being broke led me to you, then I'm glad.

423
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:08,426
Isogai may not look as cool as Asano.

424
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:11,865
He's not on top or out front,
but before you even realize it,

425
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:13,407
he's right there next to you.

426
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,615
Whoa! Leftovers from the bread-eating contest!

427
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:18,825
That's the president of E-Class for you.

428
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:21,962
A prince among men and assassins.
