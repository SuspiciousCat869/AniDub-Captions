1
00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:02,078
Stop it, Kayano!

2
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,071
This is insane!

3
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:05,103
If you think I care...

4
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:06,460
you're wrong.

5
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:11,665
When my mind's fixed on something, I just keep rolling!

6
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:14,564
This is the real Kayano, not the character.

7
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:17,920
She's been in boss-battle mode for maybe 15 seconds

8
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:20,918
and already the tentacles have
gotten a foothold on her brain.

9
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:23,542
If she's that far gone, it's too late.

10
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:26,654
Whether she gets her revenge on Koro-sensei or not,

11
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:28,539
another few minutes of this...

12
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:30,842
she's dead.

13
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:32,915
Kayano...

14
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:35,928
Kill you! Murderer!

15
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,778
Kill you! Kill you!

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,843
Koro-sensei...

17
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:40,321
Please...

18
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:42,027
Save me...

19
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:20,436
Die! Die! Die! Die!

20
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,526
You hear me?! You're going to die!

21
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:26,112
But if he does, he won't be the only one...

22
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:29,390
We have to do something, guys.

23
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:32,487
What, we just stand here while her
life's being eaten away like this?!

24
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:35,373
Children!

25
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:36,749
Koro-sensei?!

26
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,257
Just a face now?

27
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:39,587
Sorry. Partial clone.

28
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:42,746
I'm afraid Kayano's attacks aren't
leaving me a lot of wiggle room.

29
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:46,029
Believe me, it's all I can do
to project an afterimage of this.

30
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,679
It's kinda cool, actually.

31
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:50,379
Her tentacles must be removed ASAP!

32
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,296
They're putting out this infernal
heat at tremendous cost to her body!

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,777
She's so bent on killing me, she's lost all reason!

34
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:59,542
If we don't act quickly, they'll sap
her life force and kill the poor girl!

35
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:02,759
Trouble is, so long as her
bloodlust equals that of the tentacles,

36
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:05,986
they'll be rooted into her nervous
system, impossible to extract!

37
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:09,609
Talking her down isn't an option as it was with Itona.

38
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:11,271
We simply don't have the time!

39
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:13,009
So... what do we do?

40
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,026
The only thing we can.

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,116
I'll have to pull 'em out as we fight.

42
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,754
I'll have to let her hit my most vulnerable spot...

43
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,128
The area beneath my tie.

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,843
My heart.

45
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,878
Should she completely destroy it, death is certain.

46
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:29,564
But if she feels as though she's done me in,

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,305
her tentacles will be satisfied, for a moment.

48
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:37,407
One of you must exploit that tiny window of
opportunity to make Kayano forget her bloodlust.

49
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:40,051
Forget it? How?

50
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:42,587
By any means necessary.

51
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:45,240
Whatever it takes to get her mind off assassination!

52
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,132
Alas, it's the only thing I can't do.

53
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,740
If her intended target were to try anything
funny, her bloodlust would only intensify.

54
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:56,292
Quell it, however, and the
tentacles' bond will temporarily break.

55
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,222
Their grip on Kayano's nervous
system will be loosened just enough

56
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:02,338
to make extraction possible without major damage.

57
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,571
Yeah, but she'd...

58
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,517
I mean, the tentacles would be on
your heart the whole time, right?

59
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,963
Wouldn't you die before we could get them off of her?

60
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,119
I might be able to postpone the moment
of death long enough to regenerate,

61
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:15,375
but optimistically the odds are 50-50.

62
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,119
Then no!

63
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:17,027
Don't despair!

64
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:23,528
The possibility of E Class not being allowed to
graduate is far worse than the prospect of my demise.

65
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:28,605
But... Ugh! Really?

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,670
He wants them to jump into the fray?

67
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,211
These kids aren't magicians!

68
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:34,276
What does he expect them to do against that?

69
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:36,707
Mimura!

70
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:38,494
Give us some air guitar.

71
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:38,992
What?

72
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,750
Come on, man! Show her your mad skills!

73
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,737
But she's gonna go after me!

74
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,936
Just do it!

75
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,029
That's ridiculous!

76
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:46,535
The clap stunner?

77
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:49,974
No. Her mental frequency's too out of whack.

78
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:53,621
I'd never find an opening. At best, she'd just ignore me.

79
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:58,429
Knives? Guns? Out of the question.

80
00:04:58,714 --> 00:04:59,827
We don't want to hurt her.

81
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,195
There has to be something.

82
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:06,501
What've we all been doing with ourselves the past year?

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,822
We're supposed to be trained
assassins, experts in this kind of stuff!

84
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:15,740
Hold on, there's that one killer move.

85
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:20,492
Die! Die! Die!

86
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:21,500
Die!

87
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:28,516
Gotcha!

88
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,065
I made a promise to your sister.

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,146
Forgive me. I'm not letting you out of my grasp.

90
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,387
Nagisa...

91
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,213
What're you doing?

92
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,529
I won't let you say it, Kayano.

93
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:11,195
That this was all an act.

94
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,904
We've made too many memories.

95
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:22,953
Been through too much together.

96
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,896
I won't let you say the only thing you cared about...

97
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:33,236
was revenge.

98
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,457
Will this do? Please say yes.

99
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:42,459
Well done, Nagisa!

100
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,262
They'll come out with ease!

101
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:54,996
Is she...

102
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,610
Is she all right? Is this over now?

103
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,757
I think so. Probably.

104
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,823
The important thing is that she get plenty of rest.

105
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,017
Whew, now that was a kiss!

106
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:09,630
Look at you, goin' all Prince Charming! Way to go, Nagisa!

107
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:13,205
Don't make it a thing. I was distracting
her from her bloodlust, that's all.

108
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,749
I'll apologize to her when she wakes up, so...

109
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:20,167
Fifteen hits on a ten second kiss
is noting to write home about honey.

110
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,398
I'm disappointed...

111
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:22,343
"Fifteen hits"?

112
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:24,907
If you're gonna kiss, get in
there like there's no tomorrow.

113
00:07:24,932 --> 00:07:26,265
Go big or go home.

114
00:07:26,338 --> 00:07:28,539
You could've pulled off a minimum of 40 hits.

115
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,248
Huh... my upper limit's around 25...

116
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,610
Why do you guys make me want to hate this place?

117
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:35,809
It's a red letter day if I get to 20.

118
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,162
Koro-sensei!

119
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm fine...

120
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:45,479
It'll just take a little while
for my heart to fully recover.

121
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:49,212
I realize you're waiting for an explanation, but please...

122
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,008
Indulge me with your patience a bit longer.

123
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:57,071
Stop playing the deathbed angle.

124
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:59,628
You've clearly recouped enough to dodge.

125
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:01,908
It's Shiro.

126
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,109
Pathetic little twit.

127
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,653
For someone so willing to sacrifice
themselves for the sake of retribution.

128
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:12,372
You'd think she'd have managed something
a little more on the nose than this.

129
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:14,557
Quite the monster, aren't you?

130
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,983
How many would-be assassins have you
sent away empty-handed in the past year?

131
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,980
Well... There are still at
least two you haven't deflected.

132
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:28,696
And I will be the last.

133
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:31,535
Yes, the one from whom you stole everything.

134
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:34,672
To whom, in the end, you will give your life.

135
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,707
Ah. So it is you.

136
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:39,559
I thought I recognized that twisted genius.

137
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:43,277
This, boys and girls, is Yanagisawa.

138
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,860
Come, 2.0.

139
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:50,071
March is upon us

140
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,280
and with it, a perfect end to an accursed life.

141
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,626
What's with that guy?

142
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:04,778
What happened?

143
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,779
Ah, Kayano. Thank goodness.

144
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:10,870
Are you, uh... You okay?

145
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:12,857
Mm-hmm...

146
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,946
So you're back?

147
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,174
At first, I was driven by bloodlust.

148
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,987
But, the more time I spent with Koro-sensei,

149
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:26,458
the less and less it seemed to matter.

150
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,422
I started to think, "What's his story?

151
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,233
What about him don't I know?

152
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:35,579
Should I hold off killing him
till I get the whole picture?"

153
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:39,904
But about that time, the tentacles took control.

154
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,039
They refused to let me wait.

155
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:45,906
I'm so stupid...

156
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:49,307
Assassination's been about self-discovery for you,

157
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,359
while I've spent the past year
secretly obsessed with revenge.

158
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:57,770
Kayano.

159
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,956
It's 'cause of you I quit feeling
self-conscious about my hair.

160
00:10:02,196 --> 00:10:05,826
The first time we met, you pretty much
called it out and look at me now, right?

161
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:09,719
And like you said, Koro-sensei's name...

162
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,015
You're the one who gave it to him, remember?

163
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:16,439
Maybe you were just playing a role. Okay, fine.

164
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:20,285
Doesn't mean it wasn't a part of you or
that our friendship was based on a lie.

165
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,462
We all wear masks from time to time.

166
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,164
We're all different on the inside than on the out.

167
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,308
It's still the real you.

168
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:33,266
Here's the deal:

169
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:36,866
Koro-sensei owes us an explanation as a class.

170
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:39,162
None of us expects him to be a saint.

171
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:41,561
We know he doesn't always do the right thing.

172
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:45,446
But as a class, let's hear his story.

173
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:47,735
Okay...

174
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,992
And thanks...

175
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:53,931
It's nice to finally be real...

176
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,709
Don't worry, sir.

177
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,093
What's done is done.

178
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:05,912
As long as you tell us the truth, we'll accept it.

179
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:11,268
Thank you.

180
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,596
I'd hoped to never revisit this chapter of my life.

181
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,620
And yet... I have little choice.

182
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,587
Your trust is vital to me...

183
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,646
I would never do anything to break it.

184
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:24,696
Never jeopardize our bond.

185
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,321
Last summer, on the island,

186
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,241
Mr. Karasuma said of Miss Irina, if you'll recall:

187
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:35,696
"There's a lot more to a good
assassin than meets the eye."

188
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:38,295
Those words are especially relevant here.

189
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,029
You see, children, this class
represents my first go as a teacher.

190
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:48,789
But, all things considered, I think it's fair
to assert I've more than risen to the challenge.

191
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:52,992
After all, I am a gifted improviser.

192
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:55,737
Then... you mean...

193
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:56,837
Yes.

194
00:11:57,678 --> 00:12:01,881
Until two years ago, I was the
assassin known as the Reaper.

195
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:04,597
And that's not all.

196
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:08,800
Whether you kill me or not, come March, I'm doomed.

197
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:12,192
Either I go alone... or I take the Earth with me.

198
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:16,722
That's the only aspect of your
future assassinating me can change.

199
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:26,725
We wanted his story.

200
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:28,362
He delivered.

201
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:30,903
These were his memories of being human.

202
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:41,243
Born in darkness,

203
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,305
he grew to disdain the light.

204
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:46,992
Weaned on soul-crushing poverty,

205
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,599
a child of the slums, he knew
only ugliness and degradation.

206
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:56,154
Life taught him that he could only rely on three things:

207
00:12:56,532 --> 00:13:00,131
Skill, money, and death.

208
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:03,890
Naturally, the assassin's path beckoned.

209
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,487
Those stronger than himself, he killed with knowledge.

210
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,362
Those more knowing, he killed with strength.

211
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:15,712
Those gifted with both, he killed with surpassing charm.

212
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:19,638
When the number of his victims reached a thousand,

213
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,489
fittingly, rumor christened him the Reaper.

214
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,149
Watch how you handle this one.

215
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:35,360
Assume he can kill you regardless
of setting or apparent disadvantage.

216
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:40,350
Of course, it's hard to imagine a more
disadvantageous setting for him than this.

217
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,202
They don't come more clear-headed or hard-boiled.

218
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:47,350
There's no next-of-kin to complain if he dies.

219
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:51,404
The perfect guinea pig for our
experiment if ever there was one.

220
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:53,696
How lucky we are to have found him.

221
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,162
Listen closely, guinea pig.

222
00:13:57,384 --> 00:14:00,935
You may have been the Reaper out
there, in here, you're a specimen.

223
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:04,821
Your daily routine is going to be very unpleasant.

224
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,699
Wow! That's a shock!

225
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,821
You don't look like a ruthless killer.

226
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,077
Someone drew the short straw.

227
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:43,215
Look, ma'am. I won't do anything.

228
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,854
Can't you just get me out of here please?

229
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:49,026
Sorry. It's just that I've developed
an intense allergy to being murdered.

230
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:52,870
I like her. She can be useful.

231
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:57,567
There's only one thing that bothers me.

232
00:14:58,662 --> 00:14:59,853
What's with the shirt?!

233
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:04,041
I'm Aguri Yukimura. It's a pleasure to meet you.

234
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:08,196
ATPase. Rebalance phase.

235
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:11,142
Give him 40 units of SOD inhibitor.

236
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:12,154
Yes, sir.

237
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:18,883
They're wide open.

238
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:22,401
But killing them now would be... premature.

239
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:24,109
Hmm?

240
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:27,718
Ah!

241
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:31,276
Excellent work today.

242
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,208
Take a little while to relax.
I'll check your vitals in a few.

243
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:45,424
Nice shirt.

244
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,300
It's even dorkier than the last one.

245
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,778
Huh?! Oh, come on!

246
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:50,871
I'm just trying to add a little color to your life!

247
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,250
I thought you'd appreciate it!

248
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,207
To be honest, it grinds my gears.

249
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,812
Wish I'd known that before I fell in love with this brand.

250
00:15:56,978 --> 00:16:00,164
Ugh. I guess my students aren't
the only ones who think it's lame.

251
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:01,784
Students?

252
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:02,603
Aguri!

253
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,767
Is there any reason a simple data check takes so long?!

254
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,709
I-I'm sorry, Kotaro, we were just...

255
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,308
If your dolt of a father weren't
one of my core subcontractors,

256
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,256
it'd be you on the other side of the glass!

257
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:16,754
You owe me!

258
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:21,123
I let you slide on the connubial
duties, but here, I expect professionalism!

259
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:24,921
See you tomorrow, guinea pig.

260
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,352
It's going to be a busy day.

261
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:38,721
The chief ambition of Yanagisawa's
research was to generate organic antimatter.

262
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:41,097
To that end, he would stop at nothing.

263
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:47,824
He spliced the particle acceleration cycle
necessary for antimatter into the life cycle of a cell,

264
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:52,394
effectively priming the cell's engine
and infusing it with astonishing power.

265
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,586
Hey, Yanagisawa?

266
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,233
There's no feeling in my hands or feet.

267
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:59,147
And I'm chilled to the bone.

268
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,862
"Mister" Yanagisawa!

269
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,852
Ugh. And peripheral neuropathy is par for the course.

270
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:08,720
I recommend we take him off the alkaloid, sir.

271
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,493
If I can subtly manipulate the process myself,

272
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,811
I'll boost the likelihood of success.

273
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:19,456
Destructive powers beyond all measure will be mine.

274
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:26,734
Wow! Lots to get to on the checklist today!

275
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,435
Best get started if I don't wanna get smacked around.

276
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:32,153
I take it that's a frequent worry for you.

277
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:32,964
Oh, yeah.

278
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,459
Can't let the sense get knocked out of me.

279
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,762
There'd be nothing to pass on to my class.

280
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:39,223
Your class?

281
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,152
Aguri! Damn it, woman!

282
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:42,843
Why must you try my patience?!

283
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,417
I-I was just getting started, dear!

284
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:46,276
Put those clerical skills to use!

285
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:50,019
Or have I overestimated your
capacity for basic grunt work?

286
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:52,561
You have one job! Learn to do it!

287
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,107
Huh?

288
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:02,657
What did you do?

289
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,063
Mister Reaper, you...

290
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,804
He's just immobilized, ma'am.

291
00:18:07,028 --> 00:18:09,880
Relax. You have a classroom to think about, right?

292
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,861
After three months in that dreadful place,

293
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:18,237
the teacher and the killer were as
open with each other as old friends.

294
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:22,965
Quadratic equations?

295
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,285
Might I suggest you dress them up a little?

296
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,814
Never go too easy on college prep school students.

297
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:30,735
Huh?

298
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,968
The mercenary giving career advice to the educator?

299
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:38,112
You know, I'm starting to think you're
better suited to my teaching gig than me.

300
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:42,032
Ah, well, I could definitely play
the part if the job called for it.

301
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:45,513
But, uh... I'm not cut out for the real thing.

302
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:46,654
Huh...?

303
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:50,883
Believe it or not, I had a protégé once. He betrayed me.

304
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:54,838
How do you think I wound up in this place?

305
00:18:58,988 --> 00:18:59,821
Uh-oh.

306
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,999
It looks as though you'll be passing
on more than just your skill set.

307
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:04,636
Don't worry, though.

308
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,434
Your name will live in infamy through a thousand faces.

309
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:12,246
Goodbye, sir. It's been fun.

310
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,201
A shame you never really knew me.

311
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,679
Maybe another time.

312
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:18,745
How could I be so blind?

313
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:20,398
I cultivated his abilities.

314
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,904
Gauged his progress in minute detail.

315
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,023
He wanted to be seen.

316
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:29,112
Huh?

317
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,779
He wanted your approval.

318
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:33,274
Everything he did was just to get your attention.

319
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,155
Believe me.

320
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:37,182
But I watched the boy like a hawk.

321
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,320
Everyone wants attention.

322
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,338
That's the key to winning them over.

323
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,113
Break time's over, guinea pig.

324
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:49,154
Back to work.

325
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,942
On the table, please.

326
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,453
We have some tests to run.

327
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:58,308
The changes our subject's body
is undergoing are unprecedented.

328
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:02,256
I hate to think of the havoc he'll
cause when he decides he's had enough.

329
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:06,761
Oh, if he tries to escape, taking Aguri
hostage will be the linchpin of his strategy.

330
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:11,577
Come now. You didn't suppose I gave her
this job out of the goodness of my heart?

331
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:17,438
She's a pawn. A sacrificial lamb to gauge his mileage.

332
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:28,239
This is the reaction we anticipated.

333
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,898
It's all right. He'll be fine.

334
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:41,616
She was part of the experiment.

335
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:46,470
The Reaper was turning into something altogether inhuman.

336
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,664
She suspected as much.

337
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,787
But didn't wish to burden her superiors with questions.

338
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:01,860
Great job again today.

339
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,077
Take a second to catch your
breath and I'll take your vitals.

340
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:09,367
I'll stick around so we can visit for a while.

341
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:12,654
She looked straight ahead and smiled.

342
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:14,801
Sweet and lighthearted as ever.

343
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:18,321
Of course...

344
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:21,284
Everyone wants attention, approval.

345
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:25,082
Sounds lovely.

346
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:27,560
You bring the exam questions?

347
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:31,192
The legendary killer who'd never shown himself to anyone,

348
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:35,156
at last understood the joy of being seen.

349
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,037
The seasons changed.

350
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,713
A new school year began.

351
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:49,779
A fresh batch of students gathered
under the roof of Kunugigaoka's Class 3-E.

352
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:53,096
Little did they know,

353
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:54,987
in only two week's time,

354
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:57,934
the moon would become a permanent crescent.
