1
00:00:02,476 --> 00:00:06,111
"Spear of Heaven." "Shield of Earth."

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,322
In a desperate, last ditch effort to assassinate
Koro-sensei, the government went high tech.

3
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:16,350
We'd been pushed aside. Given absolutely no say.

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,948
Okay then, everybody.

5
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:21,491
Moment of truth. Our final mission!

6
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,426
We need to see him. This can't end until we do.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,898
Countdown to Koro-sensei's deadline,

8
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:33,829
approximately... three hours.

9
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,856
The Spear of Heaven will be
fully charged in about three hours.

10
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,184
Shame that magnificent bastard'll
be obliterated so completely.

11
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,455
Seems a waste of good test samples.

12
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,743
The things we do in the name of world peace.

13
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,206
Do the kids have a chance? Can they pull it off?

14
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:33,331
Report.

15
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:37,032
There's an intruder on the mountain, sir.
Someone's gotten past the police line.

16
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:41,544
It's more than one!

17
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:46,828
This is a nightmare!

18
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,703
I can't get a visual on how many!

19
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,331
Think you can mess with us?

20
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:59,015
Way to go. Good teamwork, you three.

21
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,218
We've lost comm with B Squad.

22
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:06,205
Sonsabitches are the real deal. Stay alert.

23
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:07,715
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:13,355
What the hell?

25
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:16,494
We've got a sniper!

26
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,099
Our position is compromised! Send reinforcements!

27
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,718
Uh, okay. That didn't really sound so good for him.

28
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:25,870
He's fine.

29
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:28,162
No, honest. All I did was wrap him up.

30
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:30,556
This squad's been neutralized, we're good.

31
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:31,740
Nice.

32
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:33,663
How're things by you?

33
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:34,363
Hm?

34
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,870
At the moment...

35
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:39,043
My sinuses are on fire!

36
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:41,828
Sorry, soldier. But hey, look on the bright side,

37
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:44,992
this is a testament to how
difficult it is to make you scream.

38
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:49,648
Come on, man. I've gotta lure
your buddies here somehow, don't I?

39
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:52,143
I think I can take down two or three more.

40
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:54,996
Hey, Ritsu, what're the odds on that?

41
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:55,583
Good.

42
00:03:56,058 --> 00:03:58,552
At least three more approaching over the ridge.

43
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:01,214
They've got a fixed machine gun on the high ground.

44
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,242
It's stationed over by the fir trees.

45
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,056
Roger that.

46
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:08,720
So if we cut a path through the crimson-glory
vines out past the stone oaks, we should be set?

47
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:10,820
Yep. That oughta get you there.

48
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:12,870
Terasaka, you're up next.

49
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,495
Head that direction and take 'em out.

50
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:16,453
Advance your team to the lone pine.

51
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:17,422
Copy that!

52
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:30,387
Squads C and D are MIA!

53
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,681
Status report, now!

54
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,998
Damn it, Karasuma. What is this?

55
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:37,731
Those boys and girls know the
mountain like the backs of their hands.

56
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:41,346
It's their turf. Where they've
spent most of the past year.

57
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:42,506
What do you expect?

58
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:44,492
You've never set foot in this place before.

59
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:47,383
They know their own hunting ground better than you.

60
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,148
On this patch of campus backwoods,

61
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,289
they're the most terrifying assassins imaginable.

62
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:56,162
Ah! You put them up to it, didn't you?

63
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:57,632
I did nothing of the sort.

64
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:59,120
They make their own decisions.

65
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:02,059
Believe me when I say they're more
than able to operate on their own.

66
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:04,791
I've learned from experience not to hold them back.

67
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,405
They'll get the best of you every single time.

68
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:11,806
Spoken like a proud papa.

69
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,509
All right, Okajima, I'm there.

70
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:16,971
About another 50 meters.

71
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:20,934
Karma Akabane. Easily the best suited to lead.

72
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,961
He's the brains of this outfit, you can be sure.

73
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:25,594
Mind like a steel trap.

74
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,452
Oh God! How many of them are there?

75
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,525
Cool. We'll just give you a li'l taste.

76
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,092
How much are we loving all these booby traps right now?

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,432
We set 'em for Koro-sensei, but
they work just as good on people.

78
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,897
Ah! Hey! Let me down!

79
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:06,651
Tch. Guess there's a few of you jokers still left.

80
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,670
Not bad, kids. You caught us with our pants down.

81
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,495
I'd say you've got this neck of the woods down
better 'n we do if it weren't so obvious...

82
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:19,472
Really? Stun darts?

83
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,287
Thing is, once you know what you're up against,

84
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,144
turnin' the tables ain't nothin'.

85
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:34,958
Karma!

86
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:37,341
Little punks.

87
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:41,624
Listen, if you just behave, this can
be over, and nobody has to get hurt.

88
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:44,495
What's the point of rebelling this late in the game?

89
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:45,574
Give it up already!

90
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:49,412
One way or another,
we're gonna see this thing through to the end!

91
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:52,834
You don't get to march in at the
last minute and tell us what to do!

92
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,928
You have to trust us!

93
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:57,762
We know how to handle Koro-sensei!

94
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,961
Stand down and let us do this our way!

95
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:01,208
Huh?

96
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:08,025
Karma!

97
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,189
Nagisa.

98
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:26,412
Heads up! The guy's still moving!

99
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:27,896
Stupid teenagers.

100
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,928
Hey, dumbasses, what do you think you're doin'?

101
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:34,140
Finish what you started instead of
high fiving each other like losers!

102
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:37,588
None of the troops are responding, sir.

103
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:38,796
Damn it.

104
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,554
I thought that sounded like you.

105
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:52,365
Koro-sensei.

106
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:56,036
You've come so far. Look at you.

107
00:08:03,995 --> 00:08:07,866
Those students crossed the barrier knowing
full well the danger they'd be up against?

108
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,338
What was this stunt supposed to accomplish?

109
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:13,995
We can't just leave a group of
civilians to their own devices.

110
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,637
If the target feels cornered, things could get desperate.

111
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,807
We don't want the situation to get any worse.

112
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:22,032
May I suggest you send us in?

113
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:25,078
Irina and I have experience dealing with these kids.

114
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:25,917
Bleh.

115
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:30,843
The laser's almost charged up.

116
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,933
So it would seem.

117
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:37,628
I imagine they'll probably try firing
the killing shot just shy of midnight.

118
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,070
There's enough concentrated power in that baby
to shut down even my Absolute Defense Form.

119
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:44,604
What do we do?

120
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,345
We have to leave! Let's try to find a way out of here!

121
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,680
Oh, I know! You could take us as hostages or something!

122
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:53,534
I'm sorry, children.

123
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:55,535
There's no stopping this now.

124
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,506
Too many people are aware of my existence.

125
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,146
You knew it'd come to this eventually.

126
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:03,822
You knew it all along.

127
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:07,087
Even if I don't explode, the cat's out of the bag.

128
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:11,155
We'd be fools to think the world would
accept the existence of something like me.

129
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:14,200
Sooner or later, they'll want me out of the picture.

130
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,560
It's a perfectly reasonable reaction.

131
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:21,675
You can't tell me we wouldn't have found
a way around all that if we'd acted sooner.

132
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,589
We could've busted up the barrier protectors.

133
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:27,196
Gone on TV to try and make our case.

134
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,436
You'd have met with resistance.

135
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:31,828
The public would decry you as dangerous.

136
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,625
Possibly demand you to be put under surveillance.

137
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:38,172
And besides, the projectors' defenses are impregnable.

138
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,620
If I so much as chuck a rock at them,

139
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,181
the answer is anti-aircraft artillery.

140
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,747
Likely as not, even given your skill,

141
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,367
you would've been captured.

142
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,745
That's the level of sophistication we're looking at here.

143
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:53,374
No expense was spared.

144
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:55,623
No technical innovation overlooked.

145
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:58,078
In a very real way,

146
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:01,085
my assassination represents the many disparate threads

147
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:05,141
of mankind's cumulative wisdom
brought together for a single purpose.

148
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:08,806
What an accomplishment! In truth, I'm honored.

149
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:15,413
So then, you're saying all the hard work
we put into this... has been for nothing?

150
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:18,544
Come now, Yada. I hardly think that's fair.

151
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,761
Think about it.

152
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:24,597
You've journeyed to outer
space, uncovered vital information,

153
00:10:24,787 --> 00:10:27,005
surely we don't call that "nothing"?

154
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:32,376
Especially when said information brought
our classroom a much-needed ray of light.

155
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,370
The past month may have been short,

156
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,451
but also uncommonly sweet.

157
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:39,819
That's what it's all about.

158
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,115
The hard work gave you heart.

159
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:46,667
And you used every bit of what you've
learned to come and see me one last time.

160
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:50,260
For a teacher, there is no greater happiness.

161
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,287
So time's up, is that it?

162
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,044
Mew?

163
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:57,803
The risk is still less than one percent!

164
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:01,120
And I don't care what other people
say! I'll take those odds any day!

165
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:04,671
We've been a hell of a lot closer to you
than any of the jerks runnin' this show.

166
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,495
They have an obligation to hear us out!

167
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,178
The Octopus isn't dangerous!

168
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:10,613
He's a pervert, sure, but he's not dangerous!

169
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:13,134
As far as they're concerned, we're in over our heads.

170
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,318
Why give delinquents the time of day, right?

171
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:17,193
It's much easier to brush us off.

172
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,322
Like we're just gonna take it?! Bullshit!

173
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,611
Next government suit crosses my path...

174
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:26,560
Terasaka, all of you.

175
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,428
Permit me to give you a word of advice.

176
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,359
In life, we travel upstream,

177
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:35,107
thrashing against the mighty current of society.

178
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:36,412
More often than not,

179
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,526
things simply won't pan out as you wished.

180
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:40,146
Don't apportion blame.

181
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:42,815
Society is in a circumstance of its own.

182
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,437
Resist the temptation to renounce it.

183
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:50,645
Believe me, your time and energy
are far better channeled elsewhere.

184
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,717
When hardship prevails, say, "That's life,"

185
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:57,951
and marshal your dignity towards
navigating the disappointment as best you can.

186
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,771
When the water calms, ask yourself:

187
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:04,037
If society tosses me about like a piece of driftwood,

188
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,667
is it wiser to stay the course, or find another way?

189
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,846
If E-Class has taught you
nothing else, take this to heart.

190
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:14,222
In the Assassination Classroom...

191
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:17,416
you don't have to face hardships head-on.

192
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:20,275
You can run. You can hide.

193
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:24,088
Launch a sneak attack, if it's not against the rules.

194
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:27,290
Avail yourself of unconventional methods.

195
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:31,120
Whatever you choose, above all else, be determined.

196
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:33,162
Don't give frustration the last word.

197
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:36,428
The beauty of trial and error is that there's always hope!

198
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:37,603
Never forget.

199
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:40,186
When the moment calls for a decisive strike,

200
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:41,966
you are an assassin!

201
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:46,589
Ugh. Unbelievable. Of all the times to lecture.

202
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,523
What can I say? A lesson seemed appropriate.

203
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,948
A good educator never passes up an opportunity to teach.

204
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:56,918
Thank you.

205
00:12:57,572 --> 00:13:00,945
Your rescue efforts move me
more than you could possibly know.

206
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:04,664
I'm embarrassed to admit that
I've been holding back tears.

207
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:07,119
Aren't I a mess?

208
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:14,007
How... How can he be so composed?

209
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:17,478
I don't... I mean, if he'd never come here,

210
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,996
he might've been able to lead a normal life.

211
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:25,510
It's us. We were the reason.

212
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,328
By the way, Nakamura.

213
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:33,416
I couldn't help but notice how delicately
you carried yourself during that last battle.

214
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:37,053
And, uh, do I smell something sweet, by chance?

215
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:39,113
Your ears are as sharp as your nose.

216
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,926
It's been exactly one year to
the day since the moon blew up.

217
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:44,953
And if I remember correctly,

218
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,965
Miss Yukimura designated today as your birthday.

219
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,660
Yeah, it's no big deal, but, I mean,

220
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:54,376
if you wanna shower me with praise
for getting it here intact, then I guess... Uh, hey!

221
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,139
Sorry,

222
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,428
but this is my first taste of sweet in a week!

223
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:00,245
Don't you dare get your drool on it!

224
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,979
Ugh. So gross! All right guys, let's sing!

225
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:04,854
And go!

226
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:09,223
Happy Birthday to you!

227
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:13,794
Dude. Do we even have the rights to this song? Er! You!

228
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:20,405
Happy birthday, dear Koro-sensei.

229
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,233
Happy birthday to you!

230
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:30,120
My wish already came true.

231
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,152
C'mon! Blow out the candles!

232
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:35,377
A far greater reward than I could ever deserve.

233
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:51,378
And many more.

234
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,089
Shiro!

235
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:57,543
Yanagisawa.

236
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,363
The hour is upon us.

237
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:03,226
So then, permit me to give you the gift
of the world's cruelest death.

238
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,281
Hello, there.

239
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:08,310
You do know who I am, don't you sir?

240
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:12,187
I should reintroduce him for the benefit of your students.

241
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:17,192
This, boys and girls, is the pupil who
stole the name Reaper from your teacher.

242
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:19,583
As of today...

243
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:26,916
I take the liberty of christening him
the new, and vastly improved, Koro-sensei!

244
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:53,340
Shame you never really knew me.

245
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:54,944
Maybe another time.

246
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,543
It's been fun, though.

247
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,495
I thought if I could pass my skills on to an apprentice,

248
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:05,719
the scope of my work would broaden.

249
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:10,660
And, well, he volunteered so
eagerly, how could I not accept?

250
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,337
Here was a boy who coveted power.

251
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:16,842
So power I taught him, in spades.

252
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:21,871
To inspire loyalty, I emphasized
the chasm between our respective gifts.

253
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:26,765
I gave him profit and awe in equal measure.

254
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:30,055
Betrayal ought not have been possible.

255
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,609
Master, I've looked over the
infiltration route for this job.

256
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,912
I say we take the east side. Fewer guards there.

257
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:40,191
It'll be much easier.

258
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,370
I'm happy to do the prep work for us.

259
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:44,355
Couple of minor tweaks ought'a do the trick.

260
00:16:44,726 --> 00:16:46,888
Hm... I don't think so.

261
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:49,431
We'll stick to the plan as-is, thank you.

262
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:57,412
Master, I've come up with a knife
move that's guaranteed to spill blood!

263
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,903
It's a dual-wield variation on your own signature meth...

264
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,612
Mm. Not terribly effective.

265
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:06,578
Unless you want the blood spilt to be your own,

266
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:09,032
master the method I actually taught you.

267
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,829
I shouldn't have been so hard on him.

268
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:22,523
Truly, I shudder to think how much I didn't know.

269
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,947
He wanted your approval.

270
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,495
Everything he did was just to get your attention.

271
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:29,545
Believe me.

272
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:31,548
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,575
You were the first student I took under my wing...

274
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:37,411
and I never gave you credit.

275
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:46,253
Yanagisawa. Why is he here all of a sudden?

276
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,963
Tell me this is part of the plan.

277
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:52,991
Well, this does give us the
opportunity to collect combat data.

278
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:54,370
Not to mention a body.

279
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:57,559
A single specimen would win the war on terror overnight.

280
00:17:58,037 --> 00:17:59,983
An invincible killing machine.

281
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:03,653
The list of practical applications is virtually endless.

282
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,752
What's that?

283
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:10,891
No, seriously? Oh crap!

284
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:15,070
Reaper 2.0. The one who attacked us.

285
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,065
Okay, before it was just his face,

286
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,543
but now his entire body freaks me the hell out!

287
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:24,436
He underwent the same modifications
as your precious Octopus.

288
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,120
With one difference.

289
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:30,238
Quite unlike Itona and my would-be
sister-in-law, he begged for them.

290
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:32,731
Far be it from me to judge,

291
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:34,956
but I think that puts him a cut above.

292
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,959
I know! Wrap your head around that.

293
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:43,037
A man able to overwhelm you in human
form now possesses unlimited power.

294
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,745
Tentacles fueled by pure hatred.

295
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:47,254
Can you imagine?

296
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:58,787
That was a sonic boom.

297
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,859
His tentacles have an initial velocity of Mach 20.

298
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:04,169
Their top speed, however...

299
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:05,800
is Mach 40.

300
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,562
How-How is that even possible?

301
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:10,526
In short, his basic performance level is doubled.

302
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:15,500
The tentacles amplify 2.0's
ungodly kinetic vision and intuition.

303
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:19,314
He is readily adaptable to a supersonic world.

304
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:23,197
Unlike some people, he took to his tentacles with ease.

305
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,583
He shares that in common with version 1.0.

306
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:28,791
Koro-sensei!

307
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,463
The most significant difference, though,

308
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:36,721
is that his tentacles, quite unlike yours and
those of the Octopus, were designed for sustained use.

309
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:41,281
He requires no upkeep, rendering
him effectively disposable.

310
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:44,118
In exchange for being given three months to live,

311
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:47,804
he can tap continuously into
unthinkable reservoirs of strength.

312
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:51,665
Oh, and his expiration date
does not come with an explosion.

313
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,620
Efficient, deadly, sustainable, and safe!

314
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,457
Why do you always have to do this?

315
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:01,380
Why do you always have to hurt people?

316
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,082
Do your own dirty work for once!

317
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:06,910
You think I'm not willing to?

318
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:16,086
You think I'm not prepared to meet my own demise?

319
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,412
Come now, that's very naive.

320
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:19,868
What did he just do?

321
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:21,052
Oh no!

322
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:25,614
I'm beyond giving a damn whether I live or die.

323
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,301
Everything I cared for was stolen from me long ago.

324
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,528
I'm merely a collection of muscle fibers, joints, nerves;

325
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:38,221
Fertile ground for tentacle implantation.

326
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:42,814
No, an empty temple where God-like powers can thrive!

327
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,101
Know this, guinea pig!

328
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:51,030
Your death will haunt these children
for the rest of their earthly existence!

329
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:53,252
What the...?

330
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,186
Listen to me, class.

331
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:01,971
There's something I neglected
to mention in my earlier lesson.

332
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:07,283
A clever assassin may avoid confrontation for a while,

333
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:10,803
but sooner or later, the fight will come.

334
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:15,173
And when it does, every last ounce
of strength will be put to the test.

335
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:20,813
In my case, that would be now!
