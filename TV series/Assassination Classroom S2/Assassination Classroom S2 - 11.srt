1
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:04,190
We worked hard.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,579
I think the results speak for themselves.

3
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:09,914
The fall festival was a win. I'm quite satisfied.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,914
Ah?

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:14,129
Even with E-Class so close?

6
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:17,142
Well, sir. I grant you they entered with a battle plan...

7
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:20,107
But in any case winning by a wider margin would've been...

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,250
Impossible?

9
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:23,746
They were running a restaurant.

10
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,702
You're saying there's absolutely
nothing you could've done?

11
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:29,219
Not even a simple case of food poisoning?

12
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:30,554
Come now...

13
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:33,178
One has to think outside the box.

14
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:34,540
Is he serious?

15
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:35,899
What were we supposed to do?

16
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:37,807
Dip their cookware in salmonella?

17
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,080
All due respect, sir...

18
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:43,495
I think your policies are to blame.

19
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:46,491
It's all a mystery to me, but somehow,

20
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49,311
E-Class has grown by leaps and bounds in the past year.

21
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:52,695
Enough so that they can compete
on the same level as all of us.

22
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:54,165
More irritating...

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,009
Even my own abilities have increased in parallel.

24
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:00,171
Spurred by a rivalry I find rather insulting.

25
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,665
In fact, my min...

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,137
Uh... Friends... feel more or less the same.

27
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,565
This makes no sense.

28
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,775
You were totally about to call us all minions!

29
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:11,868
I can only conclude
that your philosophy is wrong...

30
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,028
Strength isn't relative.

31
00:01:14,363 --> 00:01:16,332
At least, not true strength.

32
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:19,256
One doesn't develop it by lording over the weak.

33
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:21,210
Excuse me.

34
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:24,324
Would you mind stepping out for just a moment, Asano?

35
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:27,040
I'd like to speak with your friends alone...

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,298
It'll only take about three minutes or so.

37
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,444
Oh, go on. Don't be like that...

38
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:35,273
What's three minutes in the grand scheme of things?

39
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:44,679
What're they doing?

40
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:46,904
You may come back in now, Asano.

41
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:53,093
Ren...! Seo!

42
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:59,722
Kill E-Class without mercy. Kill E-Class without mercy...

43
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:00,766
What have you done?!

44
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:03,646
Simply fanned the flames of their hatred, no more.

45
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:05,765
A few words is all it takes.

46
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:10,024
A few whispered truths to unravel
your absurd idea of strength.

47
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,940
My philosophy, as you call it,
teaches one far less fragile...

48
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,857
Incidentally, I'll be handling
the end-of-term exams myself.

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,406
In absence of the weak...

50
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,791
Strength has no meaningful foil.

51
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,387
Let us go back to square one.

52
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,496
For as far back as I can remember...

53
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,728
my house has been a classroom...

54
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:08,126
My father is the teacher.

55
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,398
I'm the student.

56
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:12,719
Unless there was some lesson he was eager to drive home,

57
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,581
he and I never said so much as a good morning.

58
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,820
Driver. Stop the car immediately.

59
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:25,631
Sir.

60
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:28,022
Hello.

61
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:31,254
You're doing as well as ever I see.

62
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,437
This town is about to change;

63
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:35,198
You feel it in the very air.

64
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,073
In times like these,

65
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:39,129
men such as me can make a killing...

66
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:41,736
No reason not to share the good fortune.

67
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,248
For all the gambling you love so much.

68
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,249
The only real way you can feel the joy of being alive...

69
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,929
Though of course, I am the one who taught you that.

70
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,622
Excuse me?

71
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,117
I can't have heard you correctly, sir.

72
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,175
I need further compensation.

73
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:02,963
The clock is ticking, is it not?

74
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,609
Who knows what will happen before it's all over?

75
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:09,818
I must consider the risks to my students, you understand.

76
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:13,055
One certainly can't expect secrets to come cheaply.

77
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:16,107
Keep in mind, the government's on my turf here.

78
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:19,813
I can sense that you're moving
forward with some final plan.

79
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:21,473
This is extortion!

80
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:22,665
That's enough, Sonokawa.

81
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,582
We can't afford to keep letting ourselves
be shaken down for hush money by this man!

82
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:30,433
By the time March rolls around, he'll have
siphoned off more than the bounty's worth!

83
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,422
I said enough.

84
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,251
He's entitled to compensation in
exchange for letting us use his school.

85
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:37,666
Quite...

86
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:40,487
Wire it to my account if you'd be so kind.

87
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,212
Shrewd instincts, that one.

88
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,607
He even picked up on the final
assassination project we have in the works.

89
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:49,893
Well played, principal.

90
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:52,723
You've got the Defense Ministry in the palm of your hand.

91
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:55,915
Okey-dokey!

92
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,415
Time for an overview of what we've covered this year!

93
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,770
I hope you're all ready for the classwork battle!

94
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,075
I assume you'll be aiming for the top spot, Karma?

95
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,235
I dunno.

96
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,994
Idiots like me have trouble getting
their heads around the hard stuff.

97
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:12,504
Now, as you know for the first-term midterms.

98
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:15,587
I gave all of you the objective of placing in the top 50.

99
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,707
My apologies for that.

100
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,832
I was too impatient for results.

101
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:22,795
Nor did I take into account
how gifted your opponents were.

102
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:24,165
That said,

103
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,583
things are different now.

104
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:27,665
You've matured in mind and spirit.

105
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:30,959
I'm confident the goal I set for you will be within reach,

106
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,865
whatever the opposition has in store.

107
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:38,914
This time you'll place in the top 50, win your
tickets back to the main campus and, heads held high,

108
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,613
proudly graduate from E-Class once and for all!

109
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,332
Wow, you make it sound so easy...

110
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:47,638
A-Class has a new teacher to help 'em prep.

111
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,363
You're not gonna believe who it is...

112
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,139
I will be personally overseeing your lessons as of today.

113
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,264
Best of luck, then.

114
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,060
I expect great things.

115
00:06:57,558 --> 00:06:59,618
So we've come to that, have we?

116
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,774
Bad luck for them. Who wants to be
brainwashed by that creep, am I right?

117
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,624
You guys know what I'm talkin' about.

118
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:08,007
The way he can trap you with that steely-eyed glare.

119
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:11,862
But his teaching methods are hardcore,
and he can't even move at Mach Twenty.

120
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:15,199
If he's the one prepping them for the exams,

121
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,963
they've probably already lost the will to defy him.

122
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,773
The stuff we're drilling is ten times easier than usual...

123
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,361
but twenty times faster!

124
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:31,047
Hashizume, Tanaka, Fujii, Kondo and Okuno.

125
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,843
You're falling behind.

126
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:35,608
How can tell with his back to us?

127
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:38,207
Sir! I'm sorry; It's impossible to keep up!

128
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:40,623
If we were the Big Five, maybe, but please!

129
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:42,060
This is too much!

130
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:44,190
Impossible, you say?

131
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,724
Perhaps because you don't know what it means to fight?

132
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,415
Let's have a chat in the hallway.

133
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:50,727
Three minutes should do.

134
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,978
Just a little pep talk.

135
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:05,539
Kill E-Class without mercy! Kill E-Class without mercy...

136
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:08,357
You do not study for yourselves, boys and girls...

137
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:10,195
You study to grow stronger.

138
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:13,506
To demolish your enemy, E-Class.

139
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:16,781
When the lower grades witness your triumph,

140
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:19,149
they'll be eager to follow in your footsteps...

141
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:22,198
They'll know beyond a shadow
of a doubt that you're elite...

142
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:24,805
and devote themselves to joining your ranks.

143
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:28,952
Make no mistake, students. It's people
like you who push humanity forward...

144
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,214
Ah... Asano, you may leave.

145
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,259
I'd like you to study on your own at home.

146
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,743
I'm sure with your skills,

147
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,911
you'll manage to maintain the top spot.

148
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:40,405
Provided you keep your guard up...

149
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:42,503
I'll see to your classmates.

150
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:50,367
When you think about it, Koro-sensei and the
principal are kind of similar in a lot of ways.

151
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:51,190
Like how?

152
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:54,585
Well, for starters they both have,
like, extraordinary powers...

153
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,493
And yet they settle for being teachers.

154
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,207
Seriously, as manipulative as he is,

155
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:03,540
the principal could've easily been Prime
Minster or a business tycoon or something, you know?

156
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:06,613
But here he is, totally devoting himself to this place.

157
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,102
I mean, it's no wonder he's such a ruthless guy.

158
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,731
Uh. It's Asano.

159
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,749
What the hell do you want?

160
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:17,450
Your lackeys too busy to do recon on us?

161
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,369
It pains me that I have to say this...

162
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,451
But I have a favor to ask of you.

163
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:25,841
Hm?

164
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,066
Let me just cut to the chase.

165
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:32,174
The principal... I need you people to kill him.

166
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:33,064
Uh?!

167
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:37,105
So to speak. I don't mean something
like murdering him, of course...

168
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,035
That would be patently absurd.

169
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,259
I mean you should kill his philosophy.

170
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,278
Not sure I understand. How, exactly?

171
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:46,098
It's easier than you think.

172
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,024
All E-Class has to do is dominate the top spots

173
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,440
on the end-of-term exams.

174
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,072
It goes without saying I'll be placing highest.

175
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:56,598
Of course, whether or not I perform
as expected makes no difference.

176
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,482
For detritus like you to show up A-Class, however...

177
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,329
Now that'd be slap in the face to his policies.

178
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:07,653
All right look, we all know the relationship
between the two of you isn't really the best.

179
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:09,457
But he's your dad.

180
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,703
You want to rake his life's work through the mud?

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,665
To reject his legacy?

182
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:15,135
Oh, on the contrary...

183
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:18,407
Believe it or not, my father
actually wants me to take him down.

184
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:20,104
That's what I've been groomed to do.

185
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:22,395
This will be the fulfillment of his legacy.

186
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:24,265
That's how we are,

187
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,521
that's what our relationship is built on.

188
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:27,925
Then again,

189
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,572
if you didn't know the pleasure of being raised by him,

190
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:34,695
let me assure you, his methods are hell on earth.

191
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:40,780
That should just about do it for today, I think.

192
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,849
Now then. Remember to review.

193
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,940
The only thing supporting A-Class
right now is their hatred of you.

194
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,940
He's pushing them past their limits!

195
00:10:56,606 --> 00:11:01,891
If it raises them to victory, my father's methods will
be the only thing they trust from here on out.

196
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:04,123
We can't let that happen.

197
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:07,620
Hatred only gets you so far. I know this for a fact.

198
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,384
Scorning one's enemies is childish.

199
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:14,399
My flunkies need to learn a
healthy respect for their foes.

200
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:16,644
Otherwise their strength will be lopsided,

201
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:19,109
and I'll only ever be second in command.

202
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:24,247
The thing about defeat is that
it gives you new perspective.

203
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:27,617
So I'm asking you, give the teacher a lesson.

204
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:30,016
Let them all know what it is to lose.

205
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,173
He may sound arrogant, but even so,

206
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:39,215
he's speaking from the heart... I respect that.

207
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:42,434
Proud as he is, he's bowing to us.

208
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,717
Because for once in his life, he's really
worried about someone other than himself.

209
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,869
Heh.

210
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,496
That's big of you and all, but lemme tell ya right now,

211
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:54,089
I'm actually gonna be the one to take the top spot.

212
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:57,822
What'd I say?

213
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:00,872
I said next time we weren't
gonna be taking it easy on you.

214
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:03,073
Prepare to surrender your throne, Highness.

215
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,190
You're goin' down.

216
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:06,890
Oh, don't worry, though;
You'll look just as good in tenth place.

217
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:07,707
Uh oh!

218
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,478
Guess the gloves are off now!

219
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:12,791
Just don't let it turn out like last time, please.

220
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,984
Don't oversell it, man. Just try to do better than me.

221
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:18,618
Asano.

222
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,808
We've been working our butts off to win all along.

223
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,388
Just like you guys have.

224
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,909
When you get right down to
it, everyone's on the same side.

225
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,249
We're stoked when we win, frustrated when we lose.

226
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,152
No need for ranks beyond that.

227
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:35,157
That really should be enough, don't you think?

228
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,690
E-Class'll strive to do the best we can.

229
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,074
That way A-Class will have an opponent
they can be proud to face.

230
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,513
Don't overthink it. Just bring it on.

231
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:45,844
Yeah, try to make it fun...

232
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:48,250
Come at us like you want us dead.

233
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:50,809
How amusing...

234
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:53,635
Very well. I'll fight with my gloves off, too.

235
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:56,200
Wait.

236
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:59,082
All this just for the math portion of the exam?!

237
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:03,676
Well the principal did instruct us to pore through
everything and come up with the hardest questions.

238
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:06,377
Ugh! For god's sake, this is junior high!

239
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:08,920
What? We're preparing them for college now?

240
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,076
I understand raising the bar, but he's out of his mind!

241
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:14,911
Ah...

242
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:17,446
How unusual to see you here, Koro-sensei.

243
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:20,782
I'm not aware of having done anything wrong.

244
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,888
Perish the thought, sir.

245
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:26,511
You're a by-the-book sort of man if ever I've seen one.

246
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:29,775
You wouldn't resort to cheap tricks this late in the game.

247
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:34,207
As this will be our final educational
battle, in a manner of speaking,

248
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,763
I wanted to offer you a small thanks for accepting
my presence here when you certainly didn't have to.

249
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:42,400
Koro-sensei.

250
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:45,443
But this is your first teaching position, am I correct?

251
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:47,414
How did you know that?

252
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:50,323
Let's call it educator's intuition, shall we?

253
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:54,724
It's rather bizarre you won't divulge
why you chose this profession.

254
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:57,893
Perhaps you'll do me the honor after I've won?

255
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,706
There's not much to tell, to be honest.

256
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,570
I can only speak from experience of course,

257
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:07,785
but in general there are only two things
that compel a person to teach,

258
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:10,565
we wish either to pass on our successes.

259
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:13,902
Or, less charitably, disguise our failures.

260
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,176
Which is it for you I wonder, Principal Asano?

261
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:23,777
Indeed.

262
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,529
The second-term finals were only one week away.

263
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,981
Of course, we studied like crazy.

264
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:39,007
Anything we didn't understand, we had Koro-sensei go over.

265
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,384
He did his best to keep up with our questions, but...

266
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:46,500
The poor guy's hands were so full,
his doppelgangers sorta devolved.

267
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,570
Then the day of battle was upon us.

268
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:57,990
Kill E-Class without mercy. Kill E-Class without mercy...

269
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:00,415
Yeah, not the biggest fan of the look in their eyes.

270
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:03,136
Ignore it. You know they're just psyching themselves up.

271
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:04,790
Think you can beat 'em, Karma?

272
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,051
Eh. I dunno.

273
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,021
I mean, if they're planning to actually kill me,

274
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:10,699
that might slow me down a tad.

275
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:14,284
The big showdown between A-Class and E-Class had come.

276
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:17,413
Two camps led by two different monsters.

277
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:18,558
Hungry...

278
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:20,695
ready to massacre each other,

279
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:22,403
on paper, at least.

280
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,526
Unless we assassinate this exam,

281
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:31,126
I don't think we'll be able to hold our
heads high even if we assassinate Koro-sensei.

282
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:34,972
We can do it.

283
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,634
After all, we've learned from the best.

284
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:38,777
This is it!

285
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:41,231
Time to unsheathe our second blade!

286
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,318
We have to show our true target we're worthy.

287
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,533
Or we can't graduate.

288
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,015
Pencils down.

289
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:58,732
It's no good. I couldn't get through 'em all.

290
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,267
This is hard! There's not enough time
to answer every single little question.

291
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,390
The listening comprehension part was a beast...

292
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:07,788
Not even Professor Bitch would know
what all those vocabulary words meant.

293
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:10,590
The first test and already we're wiped out...

294
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:11,750
Even worse,

295
00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:13,791
English is my strongest subject.

296
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:15,391
What the...

297
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:16,867
Uh-oh...

298
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:18,954
It's about to get real!

299
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:21,782
Whoa...

300
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:23,100
Look at that!

301
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:26,700
The grade-point average on this
thing must be ridiculously low!

302
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,543
Even if even one of us passes,

303
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,665
it'll be nothing short of a miracle...

304
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:33,659
What'd we expect, really?

305
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:36,575
This test is designed to take us down a peg.

306
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:37,656
Take that!

307
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:41,112
So? How's A-Class doing?

308
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,440
I sneaked a peak at 'em during the break...

309
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,338
Dude, you talk about seething!

310
00:16:50,263 --> 00:16:52,691
They were like blood-crazed animals!

311
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:55,694
Never underestimate the power of hatred, I guess.

312
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,444
Forget that! Just look out!

313
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,254
Every man for himself!

314
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:01,884
Abunai!

315
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,840
Ritsu?

316
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:12,509
Don't worry; I know what's up.

317
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,311
We land in the top 50 or we're done, isn't that right?

318
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:16,499
Who're you?!

319
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:17,027
Oh...

320
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:18,889
That's the fake Ritsu.

321
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:19,687
Bingo.

322
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:22,131
And the real Ritsu broke it down for me like so...

323
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:25,896
Reaching our goal hinges on low-performers
like me working as hard as we can

324
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:28,365
to drive up the average for everybody else.

325
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,010
Hm.

326
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,193
Right, then.

327
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:32,999
Next round.

328
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:33,593
Begin!

329
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,484
The questions are all uncommonly difficult.

330
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,335
And as many as there are

331
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,941
one has to plot out a method of attack immediately.

332
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:44,190
Hesitate for even a fraction of a second,

333
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:45,891
and you're backed into a corner.

334
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:51,127
But the comrade we were most worried about is doing fine.

335
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,325
Is Terasaka for real with this?

336
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,438
It's a question about probability.

337
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:00,940
He's usin' brute force;

338
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:03,911
Essentially blowing through each
potential answer as quickly as he can.

339
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:06,957
But, uh, aren't we supposed to use a combination equation?

340
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,564
Meh...

341
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:11,082
Best strategy for a lug-head like him,
if you stop and think about it.

342
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:14,149
It's easy to take too long fishing
for the most efficient approach.

343
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:19,426
Sometimes it's better to come out guns blazing before you
can second-guess yourself, especially on this stuff.

344
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:24,096
Now when you see a question like this, don't be perplexed.

345
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,625
Simply use the tactics I've shown you, like so.

346
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,654
Simplicity is your forte.

347
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:32,051
Think raw power and go for broke! Squish-squish!

348
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,082
Screw you, Octopus!

349
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,521
I may be a moron, but I'm hella strong!

350
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:39,406
Ya gotta admire his fortitude, even if he is an idiot.

351
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:40,219
Yeah.

352
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,595
Remember, guys: We are the End Class!

353
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,035
We don't play it cool... We play it quick and dirty.

354
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,909
Heh.

355
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:49,832
Zero in on your target's weakness!

356
00:18:50,165 --> 00:18:51,365
If you know where to aim,

357
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,264
you can take it out in one shot!

358
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,995
You may not get the right answer...

359
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,586
But if you take the right approach...

360
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,945
At the very least you can get...

361
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:01,780
Partial credit!

362
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,045
Woo-hoo!

363
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:06,605
I think that did the trick!

364
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:08,416
No time for review, people!

365
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:09,637
On to the next one!

366
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,660
Aw, crap...

367
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,547
Recurrence relations?

368
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:22,408
At the end?

369
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:26,069
I thought this was just an urban legend...

370
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,558
They put it on a junior high exam?!

371
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:33,315
Mayday! Mayday!

372
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,390
Hold on! I need to reload... Ah!

373
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:46,648
It's not working!

374
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,977
Karma!

375
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:05,014
Oh, c'mon I showed you guys last week.

376
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:07,130
You have to take it to a particular solution.

377
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:09,904
In addition to their regular classes,

378
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:13,477
I had the students tutor each other
on their strongest subjects.

379
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:17,942
One of the best ways to deepen your own
understanding is to teach someone else.

380
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,578
It also fosters a strong sense of teamwork.

381
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,707
The effect on Karma was extraordinary.

382
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,607
It patched up the gaps in his knowledge

383
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,745
and polished him to a brilliant shine.

384
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:31,353
Sure, but that Asano kid is a
real overachiever, too, right?

385
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,521
Correct.

386
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:37,314
And in fact, since grooming A-Class
for the exams is no longer his concern.

387
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:41,841
The boy's marshaled all his know-how and
cunning toward sharpening his own blade.

388
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:44,701
A perfectly valid use of one's strength, of course.

389
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:46,440
Though to be entirely honest,

390
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:48,745
not even I'm sure which method is better.

391
00:20:58,732 --> 00:20:59,496
Relax.

392
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:00,909
Just do your best, okay?

393
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:03,460
You're guaranteed to get at least partial credit.

394
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:04,874
Don't worry.

395
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:06,486
Leave getting full credit to me.

396
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,397
Now, then...

397
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:20,636
How shall I finish him off?
