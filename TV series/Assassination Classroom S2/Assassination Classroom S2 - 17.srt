1
00:00:00,698 --> 00:00:02,753
I'm not even sure it's possible.

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:06,692
But instead of killing Koro-sensei,

3
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:08,517
I think we should try to save him.

4
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:11,448
Save him?

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,636
By like, finding a way to keep him
from self-detonating come March, or what?

6
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,323
Where do we start?

7
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:20,546
Well, I don't know. Yet.

8
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:21,571
But...

9
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:24,962
Totally! I'm game!

10
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:28,625
Koro-sensei's way too good of a
bug-hunting buddy to let explode!

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,422
Kurahashi...

12
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:31,954
Thank you for bringing it up.

13
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:33,933
If you hadn't said something, I would've.

14
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:36,239
Saving him's the least we can do.

15
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,656
So you're on board?

16
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:39,047
Seems appropriate.

17
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,071
It is what this class has been leading to.

18
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:42,350
Damn right. I'm in!

19
00:00:42,382 --> 00:00:44,551
Far as I'm concerned, it's a whole new challenge!

20
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:46,364
Like a new show, sort of.

21
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,597
I really don't wanna live with the guilt.

22
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:51,059
I mean we're obligated to at least give it a shot.

23
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:53,198
Guys, you...

24
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,454
Thank goodness...

25
00:00:55,993 --> 00:00:57,805
They feel the same way I do.

26
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:03,033
I really hate to be the one who spoils the mood...

27
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:05,698
but I'm against it.

28
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:06,655
Huh?

29
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:09,906
We're assassins. He's the target.

30
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:11,494
That's our bond.

31
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,680
Koro-sensei said so himself.

32
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:17,898
I don't know about you, but I cherish that bond.

33
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:19,193
Think about it.

34
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,689
Not killing him would defeat the purpose.

35
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,461
Nakamura, I...

36
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:02,714
You're against it?

37
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:04,769
We get wantin' to save him and all.

38
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,773
But how do we know it's even doable?

39
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:07,868
Well, I...

40
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,473
You act like you're the only
one who's been thinkin' about this.

41
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:15,502
Also, what happens if the clock runs out on
us before we find a way? Did you consider that?

42
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,188
Seriously. You want the Octopus's last thought to
be. "Damn, my students are a bunch of half-asses"?

43
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:24,431
No! But...

44
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,721
We owe it to him!

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,691
Always the talented ones, huh?

46
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:31,852
Figuring whatever the odds, in
the end, things will always work out.

47
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:34,680
Wow. Listen to you.

48
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:37,461
Getting a tad full of yourself there, chief.

49
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,203
Granted, you're the most gifted one in our class.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,425
But seriously.

51
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:45,891
We should just up and scrap the whole assassination plan?

52
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:47,940
What about the underdogs?

53
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,653
Those of us who work ourselves sick just to squeak by
on what little talent we have. How're we supposed to feel?

54
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:57,871
You're like a hot chick tellin' her homely
friends there's no point trying to find a man.

55
00:03:58,147 --> 00:04:01,647
'Course you don't have a problem with
changing the rules. You've already won the game.

56
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,124
That... That's not what I'm trying to say...

57
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:09,390
Besides... I'm not the gifted one. Between
you and me, you're the better assassin.

58
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:12,943
Okay, hearing you talk like
that just pisses me off even more.

59
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:14,976
You know what your problem is, Nagisa?

60
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:18,695
You've got no respect for how hard
this is for everyone who isn't you.

61
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:22,930
Whoa, whoa! Where is this coming
from?! I'm just telling you how I feel!

62
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:25,921
Do you have an axe to grind
with Koro-sensei or something?!

63
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,480
He took us to the movies! He's made learning fun!

64
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:32,355
That's my point! Why do you think he bothered?! Huh?!

65
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:36,808
He didn't want us to end up like a bunch
of whiney, half-assed jerks! And look at you!

66
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:41,322
Assassinating him is what this entire class is
based on. You're just trying to find a loophole!

67
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:43,563
You wanna undermine what Koro-sensei's done?

68
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:47,122
Or do you have the mind and the body of a ten-year-old?

69
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,646
Ah. What's with that look?

70
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,585
Aw, the itty-bitty mouse wanna roar?

71
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,612
Feel like he could take on a lion?

72
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:02,356
No, I...

73
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,798
Got somethin' to say?

74
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:07,563
Kick my ass for once and you can say whatever you like.

75
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:11,831
Oh, don't be shy. What're you
afraid of? Let's settle this like men.

76
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:13,029
C'mon! Ha!

77
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,969
A flying triangle hold!

78
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:27,069
I am not... a whiney, half-assed jerk!

79
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:30,147
Well, all right then. When did Nagisa learn that move?

80
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:30,889
Um...

81
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,802
He's still no match for Karma in hand-to-hand combat.

82
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,407
You little...!

83
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:39,946
Knock it off!

84
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:42,719
What the hell are the two of you trying to prove?!

85
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,691
Okay! I don't think I can hold him back!

86
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:50,991
Damn it, Karma! Will you chill out already?

87
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,364
A good old-fashioned schoolyard fight?

88
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,853
Outstanding!

89
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:58,998
However, you're the Assassination Classroom!

90
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,994
This is how we settle our differences!

91
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,571
What kind of mediator are you?!

92
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,355
Oh, these are just red and blue paintballs.

93
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,858
Red for those who feel I must be liquidated.

94
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,844
Blue for those who beg to differ.

95
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:22,897
Before we begin, I want each of you to state
his or her position clearly and choose a color.

96
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:27,068
Then, after battling it out on the
mountainside like civilized human beings,

97
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,675
the winning team's opinion prevails.

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,258
Absolutely no grudges allowed!

99
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,489
Seem fair?

100
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,272
For the record...

101
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:41,594
Whatever the outcome, I'll respect your decision,

102
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:44,221
provided you defend it with everything you have.

103
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:46,579
You are all a family.

104
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:49,753
I can't abide for my students
to be at odds with each other.

105
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:55,734
If you truly care about me, promise what
we've built here won't crumble into discord.

106
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:00,366
Well, guys?

107
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:07,086
Right. Let's do it.

108
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,539
To kill or not to kill.

109
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,935
'Kay, then. So, guess I'll choose a side.

110
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:21,159
Me, too.

111
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:24,137
The insta-kill shot's almost there.

112
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,361
We've put a lot of work into it.

113
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:31,240
And, as for who, or what, got us this far...

114
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:34,236
I'm sure he'd want to see us take it all the way.

115
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,063
We keep our eyes on the target.

116
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:41,513
Chiba... Hayami, you...

117
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,149
My mind's made up.

118
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:46,011
I've already tried to assassinate him once,

119
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:47,235
and I regret it.

120
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,657
I want Koro-sensei to live as long as possible.

121
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,333
My sister felt the same way;

122
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:54,636
Must run in the family or something.

123
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,245
No more death.

124
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,652
He's entitled to our protection.

125
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:07,683
Having a thing for assassins runs in the family, too...

126
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,233
The power of science is limitless!

127
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:14,031
If it can sow destruction, then
surely it can find a way to save!

128
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:19,790
Right. And it's not as though hope is slim,
we can do anything together. I know we can.

129
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:24,122
Sorry, but us hands-on types?

130
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:27,458
We kinda see this assassination as our big final project.

131
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,413
If Koro-sensei's gonna die anyway,

132
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:35,363
showing him our masterpiece
will be his going away present.

133
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:40,397
Justice is a tricky concept for a kid like me,

134
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:42,338
you're the one who taught me to respect it.

135
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:45,031
My choice is clear: Gotta live up to my name.

136
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,845
I suppose I'm selfish.

137
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,817
I want him to keep giving us good advice.

138
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:56,211
Save the planet or save our teacher?

139
00:08:57,173 --> 00:09:00,230
Blah, blah, blah. We're just goin' around in circles.

140
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:03,019
I'm more of a cut-to-the-chase kind of gal.

141
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:10,813
If you can't be true to your own feelings, what
hope is there in life? I want him to live, that's that.

142
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:14,272
Couldn't have said it better myself.

143
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,730
We're simple guys at heart, the two of us.

144
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:19,329
We wanna save him 'cause we wanna save him, y'know?

145
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,175
Right?

146
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:24,630
Sure. As long as I can still be
sensitive to everyone else's needs.

147
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,349
I'm a simple guy. I joined this class to kill him.

148
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:34,465
I've learned a lot. Even made a few friends.

149
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:37,302
Coming up with ways to kill him has been fun.

150
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:40,026
So, yeah. More of that, please.

151
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:46,970
It may be my prime directive, but after
several attempts to assassinate Koro-sensei,

152
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,313
I'm at a loss. The protocol has changed.

153
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:53,288
I've thought about this, and I've come to the conclusion

154
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:56,465
that the target's death would
be an immeasurable loss to us.

155
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,394
The right course of action is unclear.

156
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:02,986
My current specs are unable to make
an informed decision on the matter.

157
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,395
So in the spirit of cooperation, I'll remain neutral.

158
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:12,277
Not gonna lie... I was in the no-kill camp.

159
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:15,651
But hearing everyone's thoughts... now I'm not so sure.

160
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,256
I have a question.

161
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:21,928
If we do this, does killing
you necessarily mean we hate you?

162
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:23,938
Of course not, Okano.

163
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,154
Quite the opposite, in fact.

164
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:29,158
It's when you're killing me that I feel the most loved.

165
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,744
Well, in that case, Nagisa, I'm sorry.

166
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:36,698
Pretty sure my feelings are more
in line with where these guys stand.

167
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,738
Guess it was a little arrogant of me
to think I spoke for the whole class.

168
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,165
Aw, man.

169
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,756
This is gonna be one hell of a showdown, huh?

170
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:05,586
Uh, hey, I've been kinda wondering about something.

171
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:07,402
So Nagisa and Karma...

172
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,415
They've been friends for a while, yeah?

173
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:13,267
Oh, sure, been in the same
class since they were First Years.

174
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,826
They hang out all the time.

175
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,613
Huh. But look how they act.

176
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,139
There's always this polite distance.

177
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,604
You can hear it in the way they talk sometimes.

178
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,138
Like they don't really feel comfortable with each other.

179
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:28,403
All right.

180
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:30,628
Looks like everyone's picked a side.

181
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,872
The object is to the steal the opposing team's flag,

182
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:49,146
or to wipe them out entirely. It's my job to referee.

183
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:51,438
I'll be watching from midpoint.

184
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,360
If I see zombies or any other
illegal moves, I'll call 'em.

185
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:59,151
Don't worry. For all intents and purposes,
I'm blind to your respective positions, got it?

186
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:03,456
Even if the pro-kill team wins this thing,

187
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:06,530
odds are an assassination at this stage won't succeed.

188
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:10,836
These kids are just too conflicted
to go through with it. Who wouldn't be?

189
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:15,160
Here we go. Are you ready?

190
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,591
Let the intra-class assassination survival game...

191
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,425
Begin!

192
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:23,924
Right out of the gate?!

193
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:24,836
Ugh!

194
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:27,259
Shot just as we were getting into position!

195
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,652
It's hard to establish a BB's trajectory beyond 50 meters.

196
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,189
Chiba and Hayami's super
long-distance sniper shot is incredible!

197
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:38,355
Holy crap.

198
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,932
The killing machines you've made out of those two!

199
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:42,092
Indeed.

200
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:45,024
Though, as you'll see, they're far from the only ones.

201
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,622
Nice job: Keep your sights trained on the enemy.

202
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:54,747
You're kidding me! Wow. Did not see that one coming!

203
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:55,836
I should've known.

204
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:59,612
Kanzaki: Undisputed champion of the online war game.

205
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:05,927
Started playing to help with
assassination and got where I mastered it.

206
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:06,390
What?!

207
00:13:06,558 --> 00:13:10,146
I'm glad I did. The hours it took really paid off.

208
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:14,278
Yukiko. She's been keepin' a low profile.

209
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,535
Hasn't she, though?

210
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:18,061
And her battle style is so classical!

211
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:21,610
A frontal breakthrough on this field is quite difficult.

212
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:26,218
Normally, the best strategy would be to
circle around and attack from the outside.

213
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:27,577
And yet...

214
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:32,264
Oh, that's right.

215
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:35,220
You cut your teeth on a virtual battlefield, didn't you?

216
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:40,670
Trouble is, once I realize you're
making a beeline for a key position,

217
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:43,878
all I have to do is be patient and wait for you to jump.

218
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:53,629
Red Team, it's Karma. I'll be taking the lead.

219
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:58,293
Mimura, there's a highpoint to
Mr. Karasuma's right. You should have a visual.

220
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:00,978
Go for it.

221
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:02,051
Copy that.

222
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,819
Make sure no one sees you.

223
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:07,826
Terasaka and the other stooges, I
want you on defense at Face Rock.

224
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:10,703
We're screwed if they make it
past there, so play it tight.

225
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,871
Man, why are we always pawns?

226
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:13,992
Shut your hole!

227
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,705
Ah! Very well done out there!

228
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,288
I was careless.

229
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,626
We were only two minutes in and I got killed...

230
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:24,158
By Karma's orders, most likely.

231
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:25,741
Incredible.

232
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,170
The red-headed one's so organized.

233
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,896
What else does he have up his sleeve?

234
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:34,715
Karma, I'm at the highpoint.

235
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,495
Perfect.

236
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,872
You should have a clear view of the enemies' movements.

237
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:41,421
Anyone shows up, give me their positions
and I'll order our team to mobilize.

238
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:45,474
Mimura always blends in. Makes him ideal for covert ops.

239
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:50,122
Plus he's got a producer's eye for the field,
which translates into a real knack for reconnaissance.

240
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:52,944
Not that anyone else in class has ever noticed.

241
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:56,223
I see Sugino and Fuwa, I think.

242
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:57,591
Forest, right flank.

243
00:14:57,807 --> 00:14:58,958
Nice. Keep it up.

244
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:02,317
Hazama, this is your cue to advance.

245
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:10,064
Where'd she even come from?!

246
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,105
Stop being one with the shadows, dang it!

247
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,254
Rat bastard used me as a decoy.

248
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,595
You'll be paying for that, Karma.

249
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,410
Why move Hazama into such a compromising position?

250
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:25,286
He had to have known she'd be hopelessly outnumbered.

251
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:30,579
Well, Hazama is a terrible fighter, but
she did manage to take down two enemies.

252
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:33,795
Not least of which was Sugino, the close-combat superstar.

253
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:36,027
Their ranks are in shambles.

254
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:38,204
Now's the time for a surprise attack.

255
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,276
Okano?

256
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,270
On it!

257
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:46,605
Oh no!

258
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:49,804
I lost the Battle of the Hinas. I'm sorry...

259
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:55,143
Ha! Well done! You've been holding out on us!

260
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:59,004
I'm gonna assume you didn't
pick these moves up in gym class!

261
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:02,729
I'm an actor, I take training for a role very seriously!

262
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,272
Now that I don't have to mask
the pain of having tentacles,

263
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:07,148
I can actually focus!

264
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:08,395
Aw, crap...

265
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:12,090
Koro-sensei... I'll keep you safe!

266
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,280
I'm impressed.

267
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:18,995
But I sure wish we could've
seen this side of you before now.

268
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,474
You weren't the only one working hard in secret.

269
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,501
We've all been training. Honing our skills.

270
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,672
However this business ends up,
we'll face it together as a class.

271
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:32,663
No masks. No more secret agendas.

272
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:33,398
Sound good?

273
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,280
Okay, then. We'll see you later!

274
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:38,665
Oh-ho, hey! Remind me to get your autograph.

275
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,480
Ee-hee-yeah-ha!

276
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,834
Let's keep up the momentum and tag someone else!

277
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,105
You sure? But Karma's orders were to hit and run!

278
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:53,399
Yo, look! It's Hara and she's wide open!

279
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,112
Tonight's rations belong to me!

280
00:16:58,061 --> 00:17:00,811
Uh-oh! Ha! Little homemade trap of mine.

281
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,046
Mama is fierce.

282
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:05,647
An unarmed girl alone in the woods
must seem like a pretty easy mark.

283
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,605
I suppose looks can be deceiving, huh?

284
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,460
Hey, no butt-cutting, pervert!

285
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:15,480
Stupid idiot got ahead of himself. Seriously, why
the hell can't people just do what I tell them to?

286
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:16,855
Yeah, it's a tragedy.

287
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,789
Well, looks like it's time for
your lieutenant to finish this off.

288
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,125
Isn't that why you left the stooges over there?

289
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,841
Not bad. You get me.

290
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:25,462
Have fun.

291
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,718
Ah-ha! Over there!

292
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:31,313
Ugh, I figured our formation was leaked.

293
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,755
Mimura can see us!

294
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:36,909
As of now, both sides are down by half.

295
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:41,270
Okay, I think it's time we start
focusing on flag-capturing tactics.

296
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:44,130
Strategic maneuvering is key.

297
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:46,173
We were bound to get here eventually.

298
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:49,563
It's why we took out Kataoka and Takebayashi first.

299
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:51,918
To deprive the enemy camp of options.

300
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:57,057
To that end, Hayami's lookout
position was absolutely crucial.

301
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,023
Couldn't have done it without her.

302
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,604
I'm gonna need you stand guard, Itona.

303
00:18:08,105 --> 00:18:10,795
Chiba can shoot farther and hit the target more often,

304
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:14,163
but her balance and kinetic vision are way better.

305
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:18,272
Give her an active battlefield
like this, and she really shines.

306
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,552
She's not gonna be an easy one.

307
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:23,419
Gotta go in carefully.

308
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:26,288
We could try attacking from the opposite side,

309
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,902
but then we'd have to break through
Terasaka's defensive line, and he's too solid.

310
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:33,795
And the area around their flag
is well within Hayami's range.

311
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:37,179
We've no choice but to take Hayami out first.

312
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:41,185
Hayami, Itona, they'll be coming in droves any second now.

313
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:42,938
Do whatever you can to slow 'em down.

314
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:44,813
If you can take 'em out, take 'em out.

315
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:45,617
Roger.

316
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,188
Nakamura, when the fight starts, I
want you to step in and finish it.

317
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:50,979
Gotcha.

318
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,205
That means we're counting on you, Meat Wall!

319
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,933
Excuse me?!

320
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:56,606
Shut up. Everyone else'll be occupied with Rinka.

321
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,418
I'm gonna rush in while you play the part of my shield.

322
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,292
Once you three are dead, I'll
have time to capture the flag.

323
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:04,779
Good strategy, right? Of course it is.

324
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:06,656
So we're being sacrificed, then?

325
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,046
That is some serious ruthlessness.

326
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,638
Duh! We have to do whatever it takes.

327
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:16,332
I wanna win this... so we can kill Koro-sensei.

328
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,282
I know what this is.

329
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:25,141
You wanted us all to think you
were stupid, so you did stupid stuff.

330
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:29,646
But be honest, you joined the pro-kill
camp because you feel you have a sense of duty.

331
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:34,240
In reality, out of everyone here you're
the one who takes things the most seriously.

332
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,080
The plan's as ready as it's ever going to be I suppose.

333
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:43,038
There's just one hitch: Nagisa.

334
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,483
Not even Mimura can figure out where he is.

335
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,103
Okay, guys. Forget about defense.

336
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:50,440
Take out Hayami and Itona no matter what!

337
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,561
Tag those two, and Karma's the only one guarding the flag.

338
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,746
Let's settle this now!

339
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:58,543
All right...

340
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,035
Let's get over there, guys!

341
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,112
Surround them from the left!

342
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:07,188
Isogai's in the lead.

343
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,647
If I can take him down, we'll have this game in the bag!

344
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:14,720
I sincerely hate conflict,

345
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:18,383
and never once have I managed to
shoot anywhere near as good as Rinka.

346
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:22,132
But this isn't for me. It's for Koro-sensei!

347
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:25,667
Yada...?

348
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,288
I got her!

349
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:28,821
And I'm out, too...

350
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:37,078
Cool, huh?

351
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,413
I had a feeling I was more of a knife guy, y'know?

352
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,022
I mean, there's no way I'm worth a damn with a gun.

353
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:43,011
Son of a...

354
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:44,028
Did they get you?!

355
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:46,840
It doesn't matter. The flag's unguarded either way.

356
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:47,747
It's time.

357
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,470
Nakamura, get in there now.

358
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,403
Yes, sir!

359
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:02,206
From behind at point-blank range...?

360
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,923
Like a bolt of lightning out of the clear blue sky!

361
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,250
Where in the world has he been hiding?!
