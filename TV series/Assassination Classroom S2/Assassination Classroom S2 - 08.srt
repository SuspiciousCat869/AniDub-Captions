1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,336
So he's holding the kids hostage.

2
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:09,615
Indeed.

3
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:13,626
I suspect he's using them as a
means of luring me to my death.

4
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:18,679
Aw, shucks.

5
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:21,753
Well that certainly throws a monkey wrench in my plan.

6
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:24,239
Mr. Karasuma and Koro-sensei!

7
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:26,955
But I though he was in Brazil for that big soccer game?

8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,707
So be it. Plan 16.

9
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:33,638
Hmph. This is my moment to shine.

10
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:44,538
Wh-what's this?

11
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:45,785
The room's going down!

12
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:50,910
Huh? Irina!

13
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,823
Don't worry, my dear. Stay calm.

14
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:34,808
I'm guessing this is your show?

15
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,160
You've heard of the Reaper, yes?

16
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:38,891
That would be me.

17
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:41,457
Lovro has mentioned you before.

18
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:44,595
Precisely why I left the old fool alive.

19
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:49,806
See, when clearing the playing field of
competitors, it helps if my reputation precedes me.

20
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:53,495
Now, be a sport and lower that gun, won't you?

21
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:55,703
Or shall I ventilate your friend?

22
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:58,967
How is he obscuring his presence?

23
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:00,516
Heh.

24
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,624
Her neck's been fitted with explosives.

25
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,428
Same goes for the children.

26
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,224
I give the high sign, they detonate.

27
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:11,670
You suppose if my students are threatened,

28
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:14,008
I'll agree to die quietly. Is that it?

29
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:16,589
Well, I am curious.

30
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,386
No one else is around.

31
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:22,253
So, if I'm mindful of his gun...

32
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,553
Why?

33
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:40,280
My tentacles! He's fast enough to see them?!

34
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:46,729
That was disappointingly quick.

35
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,550
Didn't even get to liquidate a hostage.

36
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,978
Oh, well. Let's go say a fond farewell.

37
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:55,575
Miss Irina.

38
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:57,194
Koro-sensei?

39
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:58,543
Uh. Hello, class.

40
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:00,308
I trust you're all unhurt?

41
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:04,003
No offense, sir, but I can't believe he caught you.

42
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:09,309
Heh. The bars are forged of anti-Me material, I see.

43
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:11,878
Tricky stuff to work around, to be sure.

44
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:15,568
But you'll be thrilled to know
my body has at last overcome it!

45
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,144
Wait, are you serious?!

46
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:21,503
Behold, boys and girls,

47
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:22,920
my top-secret weapon!

48
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:24,484
The tongue!

49
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:30,086
Coated by protective digestive juices,

50
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,961
I'll have the bars worn down to nothing in two days.

51
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,670
We don't have that kind of time!

52
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:35,472
Excuse me...

53
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,131
Not to interrupt, but if you want their neck
braces to explode, by all means keep licking.

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,836
What?! Seriously?!

55
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,260
Okay. Let's get on with it.

56
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,390
This room...? 'S about to be flooded.

57
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:50,586
We are in a drainage canal.

58
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,856
When I send the signal to the control room above,

59
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,878
water will come gushing in at 200 P.S.I. per second.

60
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:00,356
And these bars will essentially
become a giant noodle press.

61
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,349
Hold on!

62
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,406
You're not gonna do that with the kids in there?

63
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:04,781
Of course I am.

64
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,285
It's too late to wait.

65
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:08,404
Irina!

66
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:10,566
You knew this, would happen, didn't you?!

67
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:11,574
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,417
Results are the only priority here.

69
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,523
You wanted professionalism.

70
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,130
I realize my method seems a bit harsh.

71
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:22,170
Would you prefer it if I let
the best chance of saving the world

72
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:23,270
slip through our fingers?

73
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:26,455
Sir.

74
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,743
What if a situation comes up where killing him

75
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:30,332
means sacrificing the children?

76
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,525
Do we have a specific policy on that?

77
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,141
Uh, let's see here. Take it on a case-by-case basis.

78
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:39,609
Odds are it'll come down to that at some point

79
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,295
before this is all over, so,

80
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:44,295
I... I'm certain you'll be able make the right call

81
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,213
on our behalf.

82
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,700
Here we are.

83
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:49,949
And in effect, it's my call.

84
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,698
Save the kids, or save the world.

85
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:56,830
Here's the government's official stance.

86
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:57,453
Hm?

87
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:03,558
Saving the world isn't worth the lives of 27 children.

88
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,197
If these kids are no more than so much collateral damage,

89
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:09,619
I'm going to shut you down.

90
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,645
You tell him, Mr. K!

91
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,345
Wow. He's so cool!

92
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:15,670
FYI, Irina.

93
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:16,214
Huh?

94
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:19,654
A true professional gives a damn about the bigger picture.

95
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,987
If I spend much more time dealing with
this nuisance, my plan will fall apart.

96
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:27,895
Very well.

97
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:30,015
Like hell!

98
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:31,253
Mr. Karasuma!

99
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:33,240
Turn on your transceiver!

100
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,032
Moron. Him and his ethics.

101
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,503
Karasuma may stand apart from the herd,

102
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,727
but the Reaper goes further.

103
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,938
Exhibit A: He trapped the Octopus.

104
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:48,971
Please, Professor Bitch.

105
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:52,808
Irina, I need you.

106
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,540
I've set a booby trap.

107
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:57,649
While Karasuma's trying to disarm it,

108
00:06:58,478 --> 00:06:59,348
shoot him in the back.

109
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:00,715
Thanks!

110
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:02,653
Understood.

111
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,185
Something's not right about this door.

112
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:15,086
Probably a trap. I don't have time for this.

113
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,923
I'll open it and take a chance.

114
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:22,443
That do the trick?

115
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,954
Well, at the very least it slowed him down.

116
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:35,108
Huh. Little more "umph" to that than I expected.

117
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:53,779
You have an excellent nose for this sort of work.

118
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:55,670
Clearly I underestimated you.

119
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,314
This place is like a trade fair for booby traps.

120
00:07:58,484 --> 00:07:59,410
I'm impressed.

121
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,540
Ah, the more skills you pick up, the more you want to use.

122
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:06,346
It's second nature for an assassin
to revel in his bag of tricks.

123
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:10,534
Mind your aim, Irina.

124
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:12,257
Oh, don't worry.

125
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,856
My next shot'll definitely land.

126
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:17,286
You're going to die.

127
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,351
You know it.

128
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,480
Believe me, I'm more than prepared.

129
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:23,015
I don't expect you to understand that,

130
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,064
but some people can relate.

131
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,933
The Reaper and I are cut from the same cloth.

132
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:29,507
She's right.

133
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,659
Do you know what I was before I was called to this work?

134
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:39,200
A scared kid living moment to moment in a warzone
where every second, every breath promised to be my last.

135
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:42,694
A place that taught me you can only rely on three things.

136
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:45,110
Skill, money, and death.

137
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:49,957
Irina and I know what it is to
be nurtured on blood and darkness.

138
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,069
Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,158
And what it means to be a pawn.

140
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,211
Wow. You're alive.

141
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,600
Guess I should've known, huh?

142
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:22,951
Shame you're not in a position to chase me.

143
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:24,476
Full disclosure?

144
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:27,351
I only enlisted your associate as a decoy.

145
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:30,729
Irina.

146
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,638
Aw, well.

147
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:36,295
See you at the grand finale.

148
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:37,133
No!

149
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:38,921
Mister Karasuma!

150
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,239
Come in, Karasuma!

151
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:41,470
Are you okay?!

152
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:41,948
Uh?

153
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:43,981
What's wrong?

154
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:44,936
Oh, thank goodness!

155
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:45,925
I finally got through!

156
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,022
We heard an explosion!

157
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:47,858
Are you hurt?

158
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:48,843
I'm all right,

159
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:51,180
but I'm afraid Irina's trapped under the rubble.

160
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,111
I don't have time to dig her out.

161
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,334
The Reaper's getting away.

162
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:55,829
Wait!

163
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,562
You have to do something, you can't just leave her!

164
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:01,573
Kurahashi...

165
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,364
Look, the woman took her chances
when she partnered with that psychopath.

166
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:10,128
Being a pro means assuming a level of risk.

167
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:11,369
That's part of the job.

168
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:13,481
What does that have to do with being pro?!

169
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,706
I know I'm only a kid, but still.

170
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:19,083
Poor Professor Bitch! She's barely even 21!

171
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,342
And childhood was a total nightmare for her.

172
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,170
If life's a puzzle,

173
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,283
Miss Irina didn't get all the pieces.

174
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,572
Who can say what she'd be now if she had, y'know?

175
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:34,217
Please, sir.

176
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,677
Don't leave her behind.

177
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:36,973
I'm begging you.

178
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,818
You forgive us when we screw up, right?

179
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:41,971
What's the difference with her?

180
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:48,924
The village has been wiped out.

181
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:53,682
This one escaped, killing a militia member in the process.

182
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,517
What do you think, my dear?

183
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,261
Good eyes.

184
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:05,242
You have one decision, child.

185
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,446
Follow our bloodstained path into life of an assassin,

186
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:13,316
and the horrors you've witnessed
so far will become routine.

187
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:17,342
You're free to seek peace, of course.

188
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,401
But you'll be hounded by nightmares all your life.

189
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:23,444
Only by embracing them can the horrors be tamed.

190
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,562
A cruel choice for a child to make.

191
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:31,356
We will find refugee camp.

192
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:32,366
Hm?

193
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:36,371
There's no turning back.

194
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:40,240
There you have it.

195
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,809
All my life I waded through a cold sea of blood.

196
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:48,653
Death by betrayal is a fitting end.

197
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,476
I'm just glad it's all over.

198
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:56,015
If I'd held out much longer,

199
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,203
I might've remembered what the sun felt like.

200
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,690
Well don't just lie there, damn it.

201
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,462
I can't hold this much longer.

202
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,448
Uh... What in the...?

203
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:17,438
They've all escaped?

204
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:22,316
No matter.

205
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:24,287
Killing a few ought to rein 'em in a bit.

206
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:27,988
They took them off?!

207
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,292
Oh, they're good.

208
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:34,314
Those collars were crap.

209
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,672
All his RC can do is detonate and unlock.

210
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:37,848
And if it'd been up to me,

211
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,350
I'd have made it so the bombs go off

212
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,622
when the person tries to get out of 'em.

213
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:41,725
It's just bad design.

214
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,283
This really sucks.

215
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:48,717
I'm impressed by the design for these
outfits, though! They're so lightweight!

216
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:51,188
Good thing the security camera has a blind spot.

217
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,079
He couldn't see us makin' the camouflage!

218
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:55,287
Excellent job on the shading, Sugaya.

219
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:56,407
Hey, no prob.

220
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:58,306
My paint worked great on this fabric.

221
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,579
Do I have an eye for color-matching or what?

222
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:02,462
Fantastic.

223
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:05,902
The RC Creeper Squad is never
gonna let us hear the end of this.

224
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:08,750
So... What about Koro-sensei?

225
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,936
He comes with his own built-in camouflage.

226
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:12,003
Meaning he's essentially

227
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:13,592
buck-naked right now.

228
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:15,395
Now I'm ruined for marriage.

229
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,343
Stop blushing! He'll see!

230
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:22,070
Your left arm's probably fractured.

231
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:23,439
Mm.

232
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,542
Anywhere else you feel pain or discomfort?

233
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:29,186
Huh? Hey, you're bleeding.

234
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:29,999
I'm fine.

235
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,962
Seeing you shirtless just has me
all hot 'n bothered, that's all.

236
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,036
I was worried there might be some head trauma.

237
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,220
It's good to know this is status quo for you.

238
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,178
Hm?

239
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:38,650
Huh?

240
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:39,842
He's back.

241
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:42,161
The kids figured he would be.

242
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:45,117
Listen to me.

243
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:48,184
E-Class is a far cry from the world you grew up in.

244
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:49,210
But...

245
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:51,696
What the hell, I'll just come right out and say it.

246
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:53,444
O-Our world really needs you.

247
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,023
Huh?

248
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:03,920
Irina?

249
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:05,103
Where's Karasuma?

250
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:05,862
No idea.

251
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,824
He was already gone when I came to.

252
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,471
Pretty underhanded stunt, by the way.

253
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:13,616
Did you have to try and kill me, too?

254
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:15,713
Sorry, couldn't be helped.

255
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:17,400
My hands were tied.

256
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,091
"Can't make an omelet," and all that.

257
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:22,888
There may be honor among thieves,
but assassins traffic in deception.

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,021
What do I care?

259
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:28,602
Who am I to talk?

260
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:31,772
I'm just a bitch who switches from one man to another.

261
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:37,364
You...

262
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:39,103
You're out of your mind!

263
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,615
Y'know, I've been wondering.

264
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:45,277
Is this Reaper guy all he's cracked up to be, or what?

265
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:52,149
What was that splash just now?

266
00:14:58,778 --> 00:14:59,770
Look. Don't get me wrong.

267
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:01,151
Your skills are on point.

268
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:03,510
You just don't have any endgame strategy.

269
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:04,297
Huh?

270
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,327
You've certainly dressed me down.

271
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,273
What the...?

272
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:14,939
Surprised? Don't be. After all,

273
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:19,034
having no face makes it a whole
lot easier customize disguises.

274
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,028
Heh.

275
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,541
Yours will make a delightfully
rugged addition to my wardrobe!

276
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:31,920
What's going on down there?

277
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:33,086
Um, er.

278
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,095
The Reaper has a knife!

279
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:35,545
No, wait! It's a wire!

280
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:39,753
He tried to strangle Mr. Karasuma, oh,
wow! Karasuma parries and does the... thing!

281
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:44,336
A-And, the Reaper stops him but then Karasuma
comes and, oh, wow, somehow this is so wow!

282
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,770
What a stupendous fight!

283
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:47,686
We can't understand what you're saying!

284
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,878
Stupendous!

285
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:50,593
Explain it so we can visualize!

286
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:55,129
I shouldn't have pulled him into close-quarters
combat. Should've figured he was hiding something.

287
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:57,209
Can't let this drag out any longer.

288
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,379
Ah, ha, ha.

289
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,366
I feel I should tell you, Mr. Karasuma.

290
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:06,355
I might've overstated the tragic
circumstances of my childhood.

291
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:09,454
As a matter of fact I might've made the entire thing up.

292
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:11,466
You bastard.

293
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:15,507
When I was just a boy, an assassin killed my father.

294
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,811
I wasn't particularly torn up about it.

295
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:23,546
However, seeing the way his
killer moved, so swift, so sure,

296
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:26,097
it did give me something to think about.

297
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:31,112
I said to myself: What a beautiful skill!

298
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:33,852
I was captivated.

299
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:38,619
In that moment I knew: Assassination is high art!

300
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:41,933
And the culmination of that art?

301
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:45,389
Let me show you.

302
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,994
The Reaper's hidden scythe.

303
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:58,076
A simple ten-caliber. Nothing fancy,

304
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:03,105
but its miniscule bullets pass easily
through muscle and bone to pierce the aorta.

305
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:09,255
Every heartbeat widens the hole
just a tiny, little bit, until.

306
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:12,433
Well, I'm sure you get the idea.

307
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:16,556
A fine composite art, you'll agree.

308
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,915
That's the province of a Reaper.

309
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:21,331
What?

310
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:23,254
This is...

311
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:31,253
Thought there'd be a good opening

312
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:36,292
if I timed it just right. Nice to see the
Reaper has the same weak spots as everybody else.

313
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:39,096
His tentacle?! Seriously?!

314
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,145
I can slip at least one

315
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,927
through without injury if I'm careful.

316
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,160
You faked me out with tomato juice?

317
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:50,767
Sorry, friend. You screwed up.

318
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:54,763
Messing with my students and my colleague was a bad idea.

319
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:56,384
Wait!

320
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:59,770
Who else could conceivably kill him if not me?

321
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:03,669
You'd be surprised what a classroom
full of motivated kids can accomplish.

322
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:13,836
I think it's about time for you to quit the
killing game. But hey, with all those skills,

323
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:15,952
they'll love you at the unemployment office.

324
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:26,630
The man had skills, make no mistake.

325
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,783
But he just put too much stock in 'em.

326
00:18:29,012 --> 00:18:32,145
The man who set him on this path was a first-rate fool.

327
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,955
His talents might've served him just
as well on the straight and narrow.

328
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,262
I suppose it all boils down to the world we know.

329
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,455
How it shapes the value we put on life.

330
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,823
Yes. Well said.

331
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,711
Wouldn't you agree, Miss Irina?

332
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,843
Uh... H-Ha...

333
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,280
Uh...

334
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,253
Where you think you're goin'?

335
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:56,961
Go on and do your worst!

336
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:58,109
Think I'm not ready?

337
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:00,603
You li'l punk bastards are one rung below animals anyway!

338
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:02,953
The boys pent-up, the girls all insanely jealous!

339
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:06,640
Now's your chance to set all those
emotions off like sexual fireworks!

340
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,556
Do you ever listen to what you're saying?

341
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:11,579
Just shut up and come back to school tomorrow like always.

342
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:13,894
No more takin' off for days at a time.

343
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:16,728
And besides, you never finished that story.

344
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,728
Conning Arabian royalty, remember?

345
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:20,648
You had the region on the brink of war.

346
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,370
If you don't come back, you can kiss your
copy of that French manga you lent me goodbye.

347
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:25,629
"Boys Over Flowers?"

348
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,770
Okay, just to be clear: You do realize

349
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,246
I was going to kill you all?

350
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,700
I don't see the problem.

351
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:35,155
A fair amount of treachery is to be expected.

352
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:37,547
These things come with the territory, do they not?

353
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:38,810
Ah...

354
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:42,253
I mean, c'mon, if we can't handle
a foul-tempered, backstabbing bitch,

355
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:46,008
we really wouldn't have a lot of room
to say we're cut out to be assassins.

356
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,557
They're right, y'know.

357
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:49,266
Huh?

358
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:52,840
Ah-ha!

359
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,715
For you.

360
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,925
And before you ask, nobody put me up to this.

361
00:19:57,163 --> 00:20:00,110
Consider it taken from a vanquished enemy in your honor.

362
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:01,699
Happy Birthday.

363
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:03,145
Sorry if I'm a little late.

364
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:06,854
He just shoves it in my face like a barbarian!

365
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,961
And it's not even a proper bouquet!

366
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,836
Un-friggin'-believable!

367
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:12,742
I should give the man a piece of my mind!

368
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,974
Yeah, I'll tell him off!

369
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:18,351
It's lovely.

370
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,038
I do believe we have some potential, guys.

371
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:24,603
No fair, I already called dibs on him.

372
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:25,542
Oh, sweetheart.

373
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:26,818
Mr. Karasuma?

374
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,903
A word before this situation takes a turn for the racy?

375
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,016
Trust me, it won't. What do you want?

376
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:35,084
Today was almost tragic.

377
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,365
I don't want the children embroiled
in something like this again.

378
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,887
I must insist on an environment where they can kill
safely, immune to the intrigues of madmen like the Reaper.

379
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:46,906
Right there with ya.

380
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:52,046
"Should any student become collateral
damage in the course of an assassination plot,

381
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:53,811
the bounty will be null and void."

382
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,350
Uh. Uh...

383
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,211
Safe to say you've taken a liking to these children,

384
00:20:58,295 --> 00:20:59,291
Mr. Karasuma?

385
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,455
They have the right to a reasonable
expectation of safety, don't you think, sir?

386
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,600
Fine. Condition accepted.

387
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:08,738
In any event, we, uh...

388
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,609
We're no longer seeking out
freelance help in these matters.

389
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,576
Too dangerous.

390
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:15,276
The time's come for us to move forward

391
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,105
with the final assassination project.

392
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:27,917
When you get right down to it,

393
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,983
I have no clue where this class is headed.

394
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:42,378
How's your arm?

395
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:43,553
It's all right.

396
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:45,499
Either way,

397
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:49,360
this world of ours... is a good place to be.
