1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,182
Yes!

2
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:07,518
Consider this the Assassination Classroom's
out-of-season research project!

3
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:12,259
Ground control to Major Tom: The ISS has been hijacked!

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,489
With those words, one of E-Class's
most daring escapades was, well, launched.

5
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:23,009
"The reentry capsule carrying the research
data will plunge into the Pacific Ocean.

6
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:28,387
As a precaution against potential theft by the
super-creature to which the said data pertains,

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,295
"the capsule will remain
unopened while en route to the lab."

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,648
An insightful provision on their part.

9
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:37,657
I'm not equipped to handle heavy objects, you see.

10
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:42,378
A five-ton capsule might as well be a reinforced
bank safe for all I'd be able to carry it.

11
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:46,199
Which is why we'll get them
to show us the goods before reentry.

12
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:50,971
Still, though, does Japan really have the tech
to launch an unmanned rocket into space?

13
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:53,831
It's hard to believe, but as it so happens, yes.

14
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:57,884
Of course, I might've had a little something
to do with that, but it's whatever.

15
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,674
There were a lot of unknowns.

16
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,634
A lot to be terrified of.

17
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,773
But when there's a problem to tackle, we come together.

18
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:09,721
And when we come together, blast off.

19
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,544
Okay. We have a plan.

20
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,992
Time to put that plan into action.

21
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,388
First off, the rocket only holds two people.

22
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:53,441
Who's going?

23
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:54,201
Me!

24
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:57,799
Huh. 'Kay.

25
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:00,613
Ah. Wonderful. Boys'll be boys.

26
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:02,567
This is an experimental vessel

27
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:04,681
with as yet no successful flights.

28
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,143
Who's goin' now?

29
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:09,161
I thought so.

30
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,680
I want to go anyway.

31
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,530
Huh?

32
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:14,976
I love technology. The whole idea makes my mouth water.

33
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,958
It's just... It's clear to me who should go.

34
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:20,340
Nagisa. Karma.

35
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,333
What?

36
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:25,693
Look, I'm not that fond of taking big
risks, especially with my life on the line.

37
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:28,151
Why don't you send Terasaka and a dummy instead?

38
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,218
They're both expendable.

39
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:31,427
Asshole!

40
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,593
Karma the Fighter in case there's a scuffle,

41
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:35,968
and Nagisa the Assassin just to be safe.

42
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:39,043
That seems like a pretty ideal hijacking team to me.

43
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:39,963
Great.

44
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,181
Everyone save up some money so we can cover the costs.

45
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,459
Don't even think of skippin' out on this, man!

46
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,823
You nearly killed each other
tryin' to get us all on the same page!

47
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,436
Be responsible for once in your life and take charge!

48
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:52,286
Karma?

49
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:54,749
I say we give it a shot.

50
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:58,070
What's better than a trip to
outer space with your best friend?

51
00:03:58,427 --> 00:03:59,562
Eh? Come on!

52
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:02,635
Sure. Fine.

53
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,942
I did promise to hear you out, didn't I?

54
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,163
Excellent! Then it's settled.

55
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,052
Whoa! Check it out!

56
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,790
Cool! This where they do the count down?

57
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:50,223
Sorry, ladies. This area's restricted.

58
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:52,135
Where're their visitor ID cards?

59
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:54,427
We're here for a field trip, but we got kinda lost.

60
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,799
We followed some random science guy and
wound up in here. Oops, I guess! Sorry!

61
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,135
Hey, you know...

62
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,093
'Kay, Ritsu, I'm in the control room now.

63
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,537
You said any of these computers
should do the trick, right?

64
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,635
Affirmative.

65
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:06,316
Okay.

66
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:09,017
I'm plugging you in and getting out of here, stat.

67
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:10,907
Hey! Stop tickling me!

68
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,190
Security analysis complete. All clear.

69
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:19,885
Installation of remote control virus
onto the control room mainframe.

70
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,023
Successful.

71
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:25,501
Both the on board flight systems and the
ground control network now operate on my command.

72
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:26,558
We're good to go.

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,387
The first hurdle has been cleared. Nice.

74
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,309
Hey, Ritsu?

75
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:33,042
Looks like a big chunk of our entry root is above ground.

76
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,933
There anything you can do about that?

77
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:35,855
Roger.

78
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,490
And I'm confirming your current position now.

79
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:41,463
There you are.

80
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:45,302
How 'bout I shut down the security camera
in that sector for ten seconds?

81
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:46,343
Sounds good.

82
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:50,370
In three, two, one, go!

83
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:05,411
Security guard passing through.

84
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:08,232
Next patrol in approximately ten minutes.

85
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:10,989
More cameras. Let me adjust their angle.

86
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,126
There, that should take care of it.

87
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:14,552
Please be careful.

88
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:15,326
Will do.

89
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,302
The staircase to the rocket hatch is 15 meters,

90
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:29,390
we'll have to be quick.

91
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,178
Koro-sensei?

92
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,506
Inspection perfection!

93
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:38,468
Anyone else smell a liability suit?

94
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,089
Please don't say things like that!

95
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,130
All clear.

96
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:44,563
I'm relaying the pre-recorded footage
of the dummy pilots in the cockpit.

97
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,487
You can swap them out now. No one will notice.

98
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:50,109
All right, Karma. Let's go!

99
00:06:52,806 --> 00:07:01,264
100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95,94,

100
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:05,966
93, 92, 91, 90...

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,741
Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen
systems are functioning normally.

102
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,220
Do you think they'll be okay?

103
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,757
25, 24...

104
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,127
Flight mode, on.

105
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:19,760
22, 21, 20, 19.

106
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:22,610
You know something? This takes me back.

107
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:24,876
We've felt this kind of nervousness before.

108
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:27,427
Yeah. Definitely.

109
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,362
Except, uh...

110
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:31,550
something tells me we've changed a little since then.

111
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,394
All systems go.

112
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:36,007
Main engine ignition.

113
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:40,680
SRB ignition.

114
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:48,337
That's liftoff.

115
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,135
Ugh! Oh my! It's so fast!

116
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:12,552
I didn't realize you were tagging along!

117
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:15,255
Well, you know me. I'm a worrier.

118
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:18,968
Try not to be overly concerned
with getting the research data, agreed?

119
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:20,627
You're soaring through space!

120
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:23,167
Sit back and relish the experience!

121
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:28,047
Koro-sensei.

122
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:30,096
There's something I'd like to say.

123
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,427
You never waste an opportunity to teach us something,

124
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,593
even if you have to put yourself in danger.

125
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:39,112
We're very grateful for that, but...

126
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:42,331
your life means more to us than what it can teach.

127
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,293
It's what this whole mission is about.

128
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:46,557
Just wanted you to know that.

129
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:50,569
Thank you. I do. And I appreciate it.

130
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,672
So fast.

131
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,537
The escape velocity required
to reach outer space is Mach 23.

132
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:09,479
Today, for the first time ever,
we were faster than Koro-sensei.

133
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:41,728
Rendezvous complete. Commence HTV catch.

134
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:42,737
Roger.

135
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,350
Mechanical arm operation verified.

136
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:51,666
Three more meters. Two meters. One meter.

137
00:09:57,802 --> 00:09:59,722
HTV catch, complete.

138
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:01,510
Commence gripping.

139
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,120
Demonstration ship,

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,653
grip complete.

141
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:16,930
Docking complete.

142
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:21,125
Shield interface, all green. Air pressure, normal.

143
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,010
Permission granted to open hatch.

144
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:24,486
Welcome to the space station.

145
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:27,218
Your homeland sent you a new toy to play with.

146
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:30,833
Why don't'cha get on out there and
welcome it aboard with a big ol' hug, eh?

147
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:32,096
Roger that.

148
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:38,819
Hm?

149
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:40,645
Where's the dummy?

150
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:44,626
What? Communications are down.

151
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:46,136
What's going on?

152
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,128
Huh?

153
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,067
Oh. Hi there!

154
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:50,711
Hey! You're Mizui, right?

155
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:52,657
I've seen you on TV.

156
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,836
What the...? They didn't say
anything about kids being on board!

157
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:56,830
Somethin' wrong?

158
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,818
Heh, the comm link with Earth has been cut.

159
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,429
Excellent job. Thanks.

160
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,343
So we have a bomb.

161
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:06,784
We wanna keep things nice and peaceful-like.

162
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:09,383
Back away please. Let's talk this out.

163
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:12,402
It's gettin' a little cramped in here for my taste, boys.

164
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:15,100
I vote we move this inside where there's more elbowroom.

165
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:17,104
Yeah, that's right. Let's go.

166
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,599
Okay, so, all we're after is a copy of
the American team's research data. That's it.

167
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,658
You have my word we won't be making any other demands.

168
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,667
You probably already know this,

169
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:33,927
but our teacher is the monster you're studying.

170
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,380
No telling what he'll do to the planet
if you refuse what we're asking for.

171
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:39,191
He's capable of anything.

172
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,891
Okay. These fellas got calm in a hurry.

173
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:47,878
I guess that's a career astronaut for ya.

174
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:54,766
Well, first of all let me give you kids a big
round of applause for the balls it took to get this far.

175
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:56,498
Uh, thank you, I guess?

176
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:57,905
But, really,

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,757
you can't seriously think we're that easy to take out.

178
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:03,617
We're not gonna drop to our knees over a bomb.

179
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:06,953
Think about it. We're astronauts.

180
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,901
We came up here knowing full well
that death is an occupational hazard.

181
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:14,747
Hm.

182
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,988
What'd'ya say we put down the weapons?

183
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,760
We're willing to talk this out like civilized people.

184
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:23,208
But first, you kids let our crew mate go.

185
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:30,090
This is nuts.

186
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:33,251
Even if you do steal the data,
how do you plan on getting home?

187
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,302
You gonna ask the guys you
just threatened to give ya a lift?

188
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:37,804
We can manage on our own.

189
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:42,027
Our classmate worked out the return-orbit
calculations to the last decimal point.

190
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:42,634
Yep!

191
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:47,318
So there's that. And of course our teacher can do
whatever fine-tuning we need from midair.

192
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:48,928
That's incredibly reckless!

193
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:50,460
Is this fun for you?

194
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:53,455
We all think we're invincible when we're young, but damn.

195
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:57,109
Look, pal, I'm not here 'cause I wanna be.

196
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,614
Uh-uh. I'm here 'cause my friend asked me.

197
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:02,807
Seriously?

198
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:04,888
We know we're not invincible.

199
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:08,287
We've actually given it a lot
of thought the last few months.

200
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,536
Look at us.

201
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,968
We're a bunch of kids prepared to assassinate our teacher.

202
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,867
That puts us in a unique position.

203
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:18,807
We understand how fragile life is.

204
00:13:19,718 --> 00:13:21,318
Just like you, am I right?

205
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:26,164
You put a lotta stock in the harebrained
schemes your target cooks up, huh?

206
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:29,795
Well, boy,

207
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,194
guess I'll take it upon myself to accept your demands.

208
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:34,927
We'll let them see the files.

209
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,563
Huh?

210
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:37,097
In exchange,

211
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:40,488
you can earn those files by
helping us unload our supplies.

212
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:43,850
Let's put these kids to work
so they can get what they need and go.

213
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,269
In the end, more than anything else,

214
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,084
I think the crew just wanted to give a couple
of junior high kids the experience of a lifetime.

215
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:59,260
This might actually save his butt.

216
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:00,344
Maybe, yeah.

217
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:03,195
That'd be enough for you, wouldn't it?

218
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,539
What's that s'posed to mean?

219
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:09,846
Eh, I'm not goin' against the class's
decision to save him or anything.

220
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,705
Your side won, fair and square.

221
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,699
I'm just curious if that's what he wants.

222
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:20,699
There you go.

223
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,914
Every last file.

224
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:24,115
If there's a way to defuse him, it's in there.

225
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:26,193
No signs of falsification.

226
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:29,009
Relevant experimental data's veracity confirmed.

227
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:30,789
I'll download a copy.

228
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:33,127
That should just about do it.

229
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:35,343
Now to get back and run some tests of our own.

230
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:38,510
Yeah. We wouldn't want to overstay our welcome.

231
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,593
Hey, pops!

232
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:40,107
Hm?

233
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:42,014
Heads up. Present for ya!

234
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,838
It's filled with sweet-bean jelly,
so knock yourselves out.

235
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,260
Oh no.

236
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,899
Aw, don't sweat it. Just tell the
brass you erred on the side of caution.

237
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,343
We're very, very sorry if we cause you any trouble!

238
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,441
At least you got to kill some time, right?

239
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:00,193
Look at 'em.

240
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:02,941
Swimming in zero gravity like they're at a friend's place.

241
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:06,715
Stealing classified Intel like
they're trading in video games.

242
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:11,245
Piercing the atmosphere like they're just
heading home from a normal day at school.

243
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:14,483
Junior High sure isn't what
it used to be when I was a kid.

244
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,177
We just met the next generation of heroes.

245
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:20,167
Come back soon. Legally next time, though.

246
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,677
I'm an earthbound boy. No offense, guys.

247
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,707
But rest assured, the second I'm in power, the space
exploration program's gettin' a big-time budget increase.

248
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,757
Ha! I'll hold you to that.

249
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,275
Is it me, or does time move faster in outer space?

250
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,843
Mm.

251
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:42,134
Let's hope the odds are in our favor
for making it back home in one piece.

252
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:44,374
Ritsu? Ritsu?

253
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,607
Don't worry. I'm on it.

254
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,927
I've been crunching the numbers like a boss.

255
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,557
Safety is virtually a mathematical guarantee.

256
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:56,156
For all intents and purposes,
this ship is my physical body.

257
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:58,364
Sit back and relax.

258
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:01,105
I've got sensors scanning all data parameters.

259
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:03,544
More than ever processed before, in fact.

260
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,177
External temperature. Air pressure.

261
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,263
Velocity. Even the scenery!

262
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,623
Pretty nifty, huh?

263
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,302
I also have a clear read on your respiratory rate,

264
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,597
blood pressure, body temperature, small talk.

265
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,180
To be so connected. To be in motion.

266
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,627
It feels so...

267
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:23,552
so wonderful!

268
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:25,299
This mission has been great.

269
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,072
We have the data we came for,
and my intelligence has evolved!

270
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:31,503
Hey. Do you wanna know something?

271
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:33,172
It may be hard to believe,

272
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,952
but I've just processed my very first emotion.

273
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:38,264
There's no other word for it.

274
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:42,594
Being a part of this class has made me... happy.

275
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,649
Right on schedule!

276
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:13,177
I imagine it must've been quite a grueling trip!

277
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:15,535
Are you all right, sir?

278
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:21,068
It appears I didn't need to intercede
in the negotiations after all.

279
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:24,777
I bet those daring cosmonauts
were enormously impressed with you!

280
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,894
Probably, yeah.

281
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:28,262
Hold tight, I'm gonna give you a little shove!

282
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:29,927
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

283
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,877
Onward, to...! Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

284
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,864
Yeah! They made it! They're back home!

285
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:42,753
Woo-hoo!

286
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,902
Keep going! Almost there!

287
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:46,194
We doubted each other.

288
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:48,799
Worried. Rattled sabers.

289
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,952
But when all was said and done,

290
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,304
at the end of that crazy-long month,

291
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,377
we went into space!

292
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:58,270
Hooray! They did it!

293
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:00,471
Phew.

294
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,425
What in the name of God did you do?

295
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:06,493
I can't begin to conceive how much damage.

296
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,438
Uh, this won't reflect on you.

297
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:10,361
I coerced the students into going.

298
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,885
No one else knew of my plan.

299
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:13,945
You two have plausible deniability,

300
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,717
At any rate, we have a lovely bonus to show for it.

301
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:20,482
Human pilots yield much better data than test dummies.

302
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:23,657
This will push the space program
forward by at least a decade!

303
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,276
Oh! And did I mention Ritsu discovered
a more efficient trajectory than previously known?

304
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:31,177
I give this to you in good faith.

305
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:32,300
No hard feelings?

306
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:35,367
You're unbelievable.

307
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:43,503
It's good to be home.

308
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,839
Whoa! You gotta be kidding me!

309
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:34,048
I'm glad you got it and all, but, I mean,
for real. This stuff might as well be in Greek.

310
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:37,114
Let me have a look. I speak science, so...

311
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,677
Okay, in laymen's terms,

312
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,510
the things they were doing on the Space Station

313
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,843
found that the risk of explosion
for a creature with tentacles

314
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,135
is inversely proportional to its size.

315
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,093
Uh, that means the bigger it is, the more stable.

316
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:50,319
The smallest ones carry the greatest risk.

317
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:52,933
So a mouse would be likely to explode,

318
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:56,302
whereas the probability of a human with
tentacles going berserk and blowing up

319
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:58,192
is way lower than originally thought.

320
00:19:58,478 --> 00:19:59,644
Does that make sense?

321
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,838
Uh! So in other words...

322
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,135
Wait. Hang on, it says, "The drug indicated below

323
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:09,315
is administered and a silicon compound
used to stimulate the flow of blood."

324
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:10,555
Oh, I get it.

325
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:12,501
By relieving muscular tension,

326
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,718
you decrease the chance of the creature going critical.

327
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:15,870
Of course!

328
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:17,197
Tension?

329
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:19,885
"When the following conditions are satisfied,

330
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,593
the possibility of explosion, even if initially high,

331
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,385
drops to less than one percent."

332
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:25,555
One percent?

333
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,052
"Likely, the organism's cells will degenerate

334
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:30,552
before an explosion can occur,

335
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:34,049
evaporating over the course of, on average, 90 years."

336
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:38,377
So this drug they're talkin'
about, can we make it or what?

337
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:39,959
Yes, it's very simple.

338
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,218
As a matter of fact, the compound I made a
while ago is almost identical in structure.

339
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:46,427
Seriously?

340
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:48,357
Wow!

341
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:52,068
So, the key to solving this
has been front of us all along?

342
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:53,171
But are we sure?

343
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:55,475
I mean, it just seems a little too easy is all.

344
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:56,350
Easy?

345
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:59,611
I don't think I'd call the road we've been on an easy.

346
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,448
Kayano.

347
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,222
My sister gave her life to help Koro-sensei.

348
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,383
To keep him from going rogue.

349
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:09,260
And he chose to follow in her footsteps,

350
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:12,485
risking his neck just to give us a chance in the world.

351
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:15,661
If we hadn't put our own lives on the line,

352
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:16,968
how far could we go?

353
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:18,682
Would we have found the drug?

354
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:23,624
Even more importantly, would we have grown into a class
that could travel into space?

355
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:25,547
Look at it this way.

356
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:27,968
Less than one percent is practically zero!

357
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:31,426
Even if we don't kill him, we could
still keep the earth from blowing up!

358
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,718
Uh. Wait a minute. What about the assassination?

359
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:38,442
Uh?

360
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,785
We've been working on it as a class since first term.

361
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,202
Are we calling it off? Is that what we've decided?

362
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:48,579
Uh... I guess this means it kind of is, yeah.

363
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:50,144
Maybe...

364
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,600
Should we talk it out more?

365
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:57,803
Nagisa, this was your idea. What do you wanna do?

366
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:01,052
However minute the possibility may be,

367
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,539
the government's not going to cancel its plans.

368
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:06,470
Not as long a creature like him is running loose.

369
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,569
I wanna be respectful of the whole class,
particularly since we've made it this far.

370
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,611
We talked it out and we decided.

371
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:29,885
If we couldn't kill Koro-sensei by the March deadline,

372
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:35,017
we'd stop being assassins-in-training
and opt for a more traditional student-teacher dynamic.

373
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:39,554
But until then, we'd brandish our blades
with the strength of our convictions.

374
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:41,865
After all, in this classroom,

375
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,242
assassination isn't just the
bond we share with Koro-sensei,

376
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:47,760
it's the bond we share with each other.

377
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:51,549
That was our decision.

378
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:52,829
Here we go.
