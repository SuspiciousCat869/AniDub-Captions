throw these

even thinner.

( Isabella gasps )

330
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,541
Ray: Hey, Don, what’s happening?

331
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:23,444
do they all know
about the house’s secret

332
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,045
and the escape
we’ve been planning?

333
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,646
- Don: Yeah.
- Ray: But how?

334
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,050
Don: Everybody
found out from Emma.

335
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,786
Emma: Let’s tell them
about the escape, okay?

336
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,387
( Norman gasps )

337
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,157
Emma: It’s just I have a feeling

338
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,626
that the rest of our siblings

339
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,295
really aren’t as immature
as we think they are.

340
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,130
since we’ll be
running from monsters,

341
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,465
it’s better they know
what dangers lie ahead.

342
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,601
that way,
they can join us willingly.

343
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,202
( Norman grunts )

344
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,572
Emma: And, besides,
mom doesn’t suspect

345
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,540
anyone but the older kids.

346
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:55,876
Is it reckless?

347
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,477
Norman: Afraid so.

348
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,114
Emma: But we can catch mom
off guard with this plan!

349
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,783
It’s the only way to actually
escape with everyone.

350
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,588
don: We started
by telling four others.

351
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,592
Krone: We’re allies now,
so ask me anything.

352
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,494
Norman: Whatever we want?

353
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:17,498
Krone: Yes. It can be about
the farm or even headquarters.

354
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:20,501
Don: Nat, Anna...

355
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,703
Lannion, thoma...

356
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,706
We let them all hear
what sister krone said.

357
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,108
Ray: Since that far back?

358
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,476
Don: It took us two months,

359
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,113
but we managed to bring in
the rest of the kids.

360
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:35,515
Emma was only pretending
to have given up,

361
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,518
but, the whole time,
she was actually

362
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,553
giving instructions
to everyone.

363
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,655
Mom never even noticed.

364
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,723
emma:
They’re training the others

365
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:44,891
and making preparations.

366
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,260
Ray: How far along are you?

367
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,561
Emma: It’s all ready.

368
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,664
There’s warm clothing,
supplies, and food.

369
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,865
We can leave whenever.

370
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,801
( Children panting )

371
00:18:58,705 --> 00:18:59,806
Ray: You guys...

372
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,718
( Emma gasps )

373
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,788
Norman.

374
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,364
Hmm.

375
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:26,267
Nat and I will climb up first.

376
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,369
We’ll help you guys
once we’re at the top.

377
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:31,772
Don: Hear that? Just do it like
we trained, and you’ll be fine!

378
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:34,174
Emma: We’re all
gonna escape safely!

379
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,177
- ( Children yell )
- Thoma: All right!

380
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,912
Ray: Hey, wait a sec.

381
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,327
Isabella: Everything is burning,

382
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,561
all of it.

383
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:56,563
But...

384
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,202
( Laughing )

385
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,745
Ray and Emma,
they’re still alive!

386
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:16,249
My darlings, I will never
let you escape from here!

387
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,252
( Feet shuffling )

388
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,388
Ray: Is this everyone?

389
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,659
( Isabella gasps )

390
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,661
Phil: Hey, mom...

391
