but if you got hurt like me,

166
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,894
you wouldn’t
get shipped out right away.

167
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,964
( Ray laughs )

168
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,031
Good thinking, Emma!

169
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,867
- Let’s do it.
- Emma: Yeah?

170
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,069
ray: How about
we break my arm instead?

171
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,071
Emma: Great idea. Arm, it is!

172
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,006
Norman: Wait a second, guys.
There’s no proof

173
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,175
you won’t get shipped out
if you get hurt like that.

174
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,178
emma: Then,
we’ll make him catch a cold!

175
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,181
Ray: You think the demons won’t
wanna eat me if i’m sick, huh?

176
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:41,782
Norman: Uh...

177
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,984
emma: So you’ll
break your arm and get sick.

178
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,719
You sure you’re okay
with all that?

179
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,987
Ray: Yeah.

180
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,555
Emma: Why don’t we
make string telephones

181
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,257
so we can discuss plans
through them? ( Giggles )

182
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,625
Ray: Sure sounds fun.

183
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,293
Also, that way,
mom won’t hear us.

184
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,663
- Norman: Y-you guys--
- Emma: If that doesn’t work,

185
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,198
then i’ll think
of another plan!

186
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,699
I’ll do anything!

187
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,701
Norman: But why?

188
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,804
This plan’s just crazy,
isn’t it?

189
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,706
emma: Well,
I like it much better

190
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,307
than letting you die.

191
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,009
Remember what you said once?

192
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,211
"We’ll all flee
from here together."

193
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:15,716
so, if you’re not part
of all this, I won’t accept it!

194
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,752
Let’s live together, okay?

195
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,825
( Norman shuddering )

196
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,293
Yeah.

197
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:31,899
Ray: Catch.

198
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,967
( Norman gasps )

199
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,871
Ray: Use this thing
to disable your tracker.

200
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,672
Go hide in the forest.

201
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,006
Then you’ll climb the wall.

202
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,710
norman: And scout
before they increase security.

203
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,113
Ray: We’ve got
a new rope coming,

204
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,948
thanks to Don and gilda.

205
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,350
They’re using spare sheets
from the linen room.

206
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:51,719
Emma: So it’s done, then.

207
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,887
ray: Press it
against your left ear,

208
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,122
and hit the button.

209
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,791
That’ll disable
the tracking device.

210
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,327
If we use this thing,
mom won’t know.

211
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,029
Emma: Is it made
from camera parts?

212
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,165
Ray: It’s more than just that.

213
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,768
i used parts
from the rewards I got from mom

214
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,670
and disassembled them.

215
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:10,971
From the camera,

216
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,139
all I really wanted
was the strobe.

217
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,644
Norman: You’ve collected
these parts for six years,

218
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,647
just so mom
wouldn’t figure it out.

219
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,048
Emma: Amazing.

220
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,717
Ray: There’s no need
to be impressed about it.

221
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,919
I realized the houses’s secret

222
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,655
and had to do it,

223
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,190
and that’s that.

224
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,359
- Norman: Ray.
- Ray: Eh?

225
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,028
Norman: Something’s
been bothering me.

226
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,697
How’d you find out?

227
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,068
I know I asked you this before.

228
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:45,005
a normal kid
wouldn’t have realized it.

229
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,078
Ray: I’ve always known.

230
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,679
( Norman gasps )

231
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,882
Ray: I’ve just always known.

232
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,283
( Emma and Norman sigh )

233
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,652
ray: You know
what infantile amnesia is?

234
00:11:58,685 --> 00:11:59,886
Emma: Uh-uh.

235
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,790
Ray: When most people
reach a certain age,

236
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,726
they don’t have any memories
from being a baby.

237
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,728
That’s infantile amnesia.

238
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,030
- ( Norman gasps )
- Ray: But, in some cases,

239
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,832
there are humans
who don’t forget everything.

240
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,101
Emma: Wait. You mean...

241
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,369
Ray: I still have...

242
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,971
memories
from inside of the womb.

243
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,708
- ( Both gasp )
- Ray: Some of my memories

244
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,010
didn’t match
with what i’d been told.

245
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,711
That’s how I knew.

246
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:29,850
my first memory
is being in a dark liquid.

247
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,686
I could hear a lullaby
from somewhere.

248
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,723
Emma: Do you remember a lot,

249
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,924
or is it hazy?

250
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,992
Ray: All of it’s in fragments,

251
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,895
but in high detail...

252
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,931
Demons’s faces

253
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,834
and how there were
other babies there.

254
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,036
They implanted the trackers,

255
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,873
and then we were divided
into batches of five.

256
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,241
Norman: Five?

257
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,742
Ray: After that,

258
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,979
I went through a tunnel
and was here.

259
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,914
Norman: The tunnel
being the gate?

260
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,316
- Ray: Yeah.
- Norman: Wait.

261
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,852
So past the gate
isn’t outside, but...

262
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:05,953
Ray: Headquarters.

263
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,354
( Norman gasps )

264
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,857
Ray: The headquarters and
the adjacent five plants.

265
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,993
those are
what make up this house.

266
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,295
emma: Then,
what krone said was true,

267
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,997
every last detail.

268
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,965
ray: The gate
can’t be an escape route.

269
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,067
( Emma sighs )

270
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,436
Ray: Beyond it,
things get rough.

271
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,805
there’s not
just a few guards out there.

272
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,073
It’s swarming with demons.

273
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,475
Emma: Isn’t that bad, though?

274
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,513
Ray: Not quite. Because of that,
the security is pretty thin.

275
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,815
Their main focus
will be on the gate,

276
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,483
so we won’t have to worry much.

277
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,987
Once emma’s leg is healed,
we’ll run.

278
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,989
Emma: Oh, I see.

279
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,992
Ray: We’ve got everything
worked out, Norman,

280
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,327
so tomorrow you’ll disappear.

281
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,935
( Sighs )

282
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,240
Norman: Understood.

283
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,478
( Insects chirping )

284
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,946
Isabella: Attention.

285
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,280
I have good news.

286
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,350
A foster family chose Norman.

287
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:13,020
I know it’s sudden, but he’ll
be leaving tomorrow night.

288
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,290
( Girl wails )

289
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,925
( Children murmuring )

290
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,493
- Boy: That soon?
- Boy 2: Congrats!

291
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,194
Girl 2: This is great, Norman!

292
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,197
Phil: Is this goodbye?

293
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,033
Boy 3: But why so sudden?

294
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,168
Boy 4: We’re gonna miss him,
aren’t we?

295
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,304
( Boy 3 stammers ) Uh-huh.

296
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,139
- Girl 3: Congwats!
- ( Norman laughs )

297
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,508
Girl 2: Let’s play a bunch
before you go.

298
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,511
( Overlapping chatter )

299
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,112

300

Girl 4: I’m gonna miss you.

301

girl 5:
I’m gonna miss you.

302

- ( Girl 1 sniffling )
- ( Norman gasps )

303
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,054
Girl 1: I’m happy for you.

304
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,124
Girl 6: Don’t cry.

305
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:54,528
Girl 1: Congratulations, Norman.

306
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,196
( Crying )

307
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,331
( Norman chuckles )

308
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,136
I’m gonna miss you all so much.

309
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,140
( Chatter and crying continue )

310

( Gilda whimpers )

before it gets cold.
