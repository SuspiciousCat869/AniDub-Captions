they probably use radio waves
and need batteries.

then figure out how to break it.

we may as well give up.

don’t escape before shipment.

she’ll owe me big time,

for my hard work

to call my own!

Oh, my. What’s wrong, sweetie?

Why are you crying so much,
my precious one?

Come on now. Don’t cry.

You’d be happy,
too, wouldn’t you,

00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,906
if I was promoted to a mom?

122
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,975
If that happens,
i’ll be much busier,

00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:45,412
but you’ll always be here to
support me, won’t you, my dear?

124
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,948
Just try not to get jealous
and act selfishly

00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,484
because i’m paying attention
to the other children.

126
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,054
Wait a minute.
You really think so?

127
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,888
this could be
my chance to move up?

128
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,292
then I can
finally become a mom!

161
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,835
krone: I heard
you get perfect test scores.

162
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,838
- Norman: Yes.
- Krone: That’s amazing.

163
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,342
Nice to meet you.
I know we’ll get along.

164
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,443
( Chuckles )

165
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,880
Norman: Uh...

166
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,450
( Krone chuckles )

167
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:33,987
Ray: Did she hear us?

168
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,589
Norman: No. We’re okay.

169
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,458
That woman...

170
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,494
I don’t think she came here
simply to watch children.

171
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,595
Ray: What are you saying?

172
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,864
Norman: The way
she looked at us,

173
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,401
she suspects us,
since we’re the oldest.

174
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,403
ray: Wait a sec.
How’d she find that out?

175
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,973
Norman: Isn’t it obvious?
mom told her.

176
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,743
- ( Ray grunts )
- Norman: Mom is on our trail,

177
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,744
and she’s closing in on us.

178
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,313
- ( Carol cooing )
- Norman: Let’s hurry.

179
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,481
( Clock ticking )

180
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,250
( Carol laughing )

181
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,653
( Girl grunts )

182
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,591
( Carol giggles )

183
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,260
Emma: Shift perspective.

184
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,795
Try to think like them.

185
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,698
Demons won’t eat
the tracking device,

186
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,466
which means...

187
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,634
It’s somewhere easy to remove.

188
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,603
Girl: Emma, I, uh...

189
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,703
Emma: But where?

190
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,672
girl: Wanted
to ask you something.

191
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:26,673
The other night...

192
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,912
( Carol coos )

193
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:37,284
Girl: What’s that?
Is it a bug bite?

194
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,353
Emma: No, it’s--it’s a Mark

195
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,388
from when they
took our blood for testing.

196
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,357
At least, that’s what mom said.

197
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,592
- ( Carol coos )
- ( Emma gasps )

198
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,327
Naila had it when she came!

199
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,563
So did Mark, Phil, and conny!

200
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,031
On everybody’s ear.

201
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,032
Girl: Mine, too?

202
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,536
Emma: No, it’s already gone.

203
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,839
Girl: That makes sense,
though, right?

204
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,909
I’m 10, and you’re 11,
so it’s been years now.

205
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:05,679
Emma: Yeah. It was way smaller
than I expected it to be.

206
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,680
Girl: What was?

207
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:07,781
Emma: Huh?

208
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,350
Oh! I was talking
about the scar

209
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,718
and how tiny it was.
It disappeared already!

210
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,986
Girl: Yeah.

211
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,888
( Carol fussing )

212
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,759
( Cooing )

213
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,635
I’ve gotta protect them,
every last one.

214
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,508
Isabella: Regular check-in.
Regular check-in.

215
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:38,012
This is 73584 at plant three.

216
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,814
October 17th, situation normal.

217
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,649
Ending transmission.

218
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,817
Woman: Isabella?

219
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,352
Isabella: Grandma?

220
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,955
Grandma: I have a message
for you from the boss.

221
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,656
"those three
can still be shipped out

222
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,525
as scheduled, correct?"

223
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,893
( Isabella sighs )

224
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,395
Grandma: Listen, Isabella.

225
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,763
The other plants

226
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,732
had a disappointing harvest
this year,

227
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,002
and only your plant can deliver
the highest quality goods

228
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,673
that are going to be offered
during tifari.

229
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,375
Isabella: Yes, I understood that
from the start.

230
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,878
Please tell the boss,
"everything is going fine.

231
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,647
You may have any child
whenever you wish."

232
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,584
demon: I see.
So they can be shipped?

233
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,287
The one will most certainly
be pleased by this news.

234
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,823
don’t fail us.
Only the most special meal

235
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,827
can be presented to the one,
unlike our fare.

236
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:30,865
Now let us celebrate
the coming harvest

237
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:34,668
and offer prayers to the one.

238
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,204
Atter )

239
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:40,807
( Girl sighs )

240
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:41,808
( Emma grunts )

241
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,543
Aww!

242
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,314
( Child giggles )

243
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,959
Ray: Yeah, they’re in a place
no one would notice.

244
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,761
Norman: I never knew
about a Mark

245
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,295
from when they took our blood,

246
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,764
and it disappears that quickly?

247
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,500
Emma: Yeah. I knew,

248
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,236
but I never even considered
that would be it.

249
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:10,437
Sorry.

250
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,239
Norman: Oh, no.
You did great, Emma.

251
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:16,310
We now know the location
and the size of the device.

252
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,978
On to the next step.

253
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,414
Emma: The next step is...

254
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,648
All: How to break it.

255
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:22,849
Norman: Let’s see.

256
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,252
If we tried to make
an incision...

257
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,521
Emma: Mom might lift our hair
and see it.

258
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,756
Norman: She’d catch on.

259
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,324
Ray: You’re right.

260
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,659
well, whether or not
we can break the transmitters,

261
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,661
the tracking devices
implanted in us

262
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,264
aren’t that useful
in the grand scheme of things.

263
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,466
emma: What?
How do you figure that?

264
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,369
Ray: The signal’s so crude,
it can’t specify an individual.

265
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,638
without checking,
she can’t tell where we are.

266
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,774
Even if we get close
to the gate or walls,

267
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,408
it doesn’t notify her.

268
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,977
Emma: But we still have them.

269
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,612
Ray: Yes, but why?

270
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,981
They must be confident
they can come after us

271
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,384
as long as
the tracking device is intact.

272
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,719
Norman: Hold on.

273
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,521
so that means if it
were to send a notification,

274
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,523
it’d only be
after it’s been destroyed?

275
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,325
ray: That’s
a definite possibility.

276
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,827
Emma: What do you guys mean?

277
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,496
Ray: Weren’t you listening?

278
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,232
An alarm probably goes off
once the trackers are broken.

279
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,501
emma: So mom
would find out instantly?

280
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,938
Ray: If a notification function
really exists.

281
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,474
Norman: But knowing
that mom purposefully

282
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,543
clued us in
on the existence of the devices,

283
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,744
we can’t ignore the risk.

284
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,746
Ray: It’s dangerous
to even touch it.

285
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,616
Norman: So we can only
destroy it when we escape.

286
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,319
emma: What?
But how do we deal with it?

287
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:33,554
We have to know!

288
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,455
Ray: Actually,
i’ve been thinking.

289
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:39,559
The shape and size of it
brings something else to mind.

290
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,762
leave it to me.
I’ll figure out a work-around.

291
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:43,763
Norman: You sure?

292
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,965
Ray: Uh-huh.

293
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:48,569
Emma: If you say so.
It’s all yours.

294
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,371
Norman: Now the issue of taking
the other children with us.

295
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,609
the problem is
they all completely trust mom,

296
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,411
and they probably
won’t be able to handle

297
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,845
the truth of our situation.

298
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,281
Emma: If we want
to take them, too,

299
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,749
we’re gonna have to lie to them?

300
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,752
Ray: There’s another issue,
insufficient abilities.

301
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,788
To put it bluntly,
they’re a hindrance.

302
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:08,823
Emma: Ray!

303
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,624
Ray: You know it’s the truth.

304
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,626
Some of them aren’t good
at physical activity,

305
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,629
not to mention the babies
who can hardly walk.

306
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:19,700
Emma: I actually have an idea
for how to deal with that.

307
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:20,834
Norman: Which is?

308
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,503
Emma: By playing tag.

309
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,503
Boys: Huh?

310
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,941
Emma: Norman is it,
and everybody else runs.

311
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:31,345
Norman: We pretend it’s play
when we’re actually training.

312
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,346
Norman: Then mom won’t find out!

313
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,715
Emma: I’ll teach them how to
push their bodies to the limit.

314
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,350
As for sharpening their minds...

315
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,718
Boys: Leave it to us.

316
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,758
( Children yell )

317
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,360
Ray: Don’t rush.

318
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,028
- boy: Eh?
- Ray: Concentrate.

319
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,764
- What can you do to escape?
