you’ve realized, right?

i told Don
it was behind my bed,

it was in the second floor

that’s what I told you,

we could make it in time,

103

we wouldn’t have gone.

104
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,142
You laid out the bread crumbs

for us to find out the truth
about this house for ourselves.

106
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:17,584
You set this up for the three
of us to escape, didn’t you?

107
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,054
why did you

completely on mom’s side,

then it wouldn’t make sense
to reveal the truth to us.

You’ve been controlling
our actions,

112
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,601
about the trackers,
the timing of our escape,

113
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,404
and how quickly
the plan moved forward.

114
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,407
That’s why you didn’t want us
leaving ten days from now.

115
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:45,913
But, at the same time, you were
also keeping mom under control.

116
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,149
you’re actually
not our enemy, are you?

117
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,418

Ray: I guess it’s more like
I sold myself, really.

120
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,060
And all of it was to prepare

121
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,362
for the escape
we’re planning!

122

( Norman gasps )

123
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,066
Ray: If you’re going to learn
more about the enemy,

124
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,469
it’s best to do so
from the inside,

125
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,105
which is why I ended up
offering a deal to mom.

126
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,306
Norman: That’s risky.

127
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,975
Ray: Not really.

128
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,645
I’m one of the finest products
she’s raised here.

129
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,446
She cared a lot for me.

130
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,981
She wouldn’t throw me away.

131
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,183
That’s how I saw it.

132
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,386
She’s someone who cares more
about profit than rules.

133
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,989
i made sure
to ask for two things.

134
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:33,160
First was not to be shipped out
if I cooperated.

135
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,397
The second was rewards
in exchange for results.

136
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,898
Norman: What kind of rewards?

137
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,301
Ray: Various junk.

138
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,470
If it isn’t in the house,
she secures it for me.

139
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,539
- Norman: Huh?
- ( Ray grunts )

140
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,408
My reason for doing it

141
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,010
was to check what I
could and couldn’t get,

142
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,313
but also to research
the outside.

143
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,182
turns out,
as long as it was safe,

144
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,418
she could get me lots of things,

145
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:00,053
but everything
she brings back is dated.

146
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,889
norman: So, then,
when you said you had an idea

147
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,157
for breaking the trackers...

148
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,427
Ray: I’ve seen the real device.

149
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,929
I did testing.

150
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,565
It took me a few years,
but I figured it out.

151
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,568
it is possible
to break the tracking devices.

152
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,171
- ( Norman gasps )
- Ray: You get it?

153
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,240
Norman, i’m the strongest card
you’ll ever have.

154
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,075
No one else compares.

155
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,646
And I don’t just have info about
the tracking devices and mom.

156
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,647
You can’t even begin to imagine

157
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,050
how much i’ve learned
over the years.

158
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,556
from the moment
that I discovered the truth,

159
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,591
I started preparing.

160
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,026
Norman: Ray...

161
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,227
Ray: I had you and Emma
go to the gate

162
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,397

You’re not alone.

You’ve got us now, so...

328
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:09,844
( Ray sighs )

329
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,912
All right, fine.

330
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,247
I give you my word.

331
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,316
Let’s all escape
from here together.

332
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,553
Gilda: The three of them

333
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,256
are talking privately
in the forest again.

334
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,990
( Don growls )
How long are we

335
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,092
just gonna stand around
and plan?!

336
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,829
We gotta save conny
as soon as possible.

337
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,898
gilda: What if
something’s preventing us?

338
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,098
Don: What do you mean?

339
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,501
Gilda: I don’t really know.

340
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,269
- Phil: Ready, set, go!
- Gilda: Something tells me

341
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,104
this isn’t dangerous
just because of bad people.

342
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,941
It’s more than that, much more.

343
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,315
Ray: She was pretty mad,
i guess.

344
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:51,485
norman: By the way,
I wanted to ask you something.

345
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:52,920
Ray: Yeah? What’s up?

346
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,021
Norman: You said before
that you did this

347
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,290
so Emma and I wouldn’t die.

348
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,625
You’re not planning to...

349
00:15:58,692 --> 00:15:59,960
Emma: Oh, yeah!

350
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,530
There was something
I had to report.

351
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:04,531
Boys: Hmm?

352
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,568
Emma: Gilda and I decided
to observe mom again,

353
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,570
and we noticed
something strange.

354
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,573
she disappears
right before 8:00 every night.

355
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,142
Norman: She does?

356
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:19,080
Emma: Yeah. There are
no traces of her anywhere...

357
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,215
Meaning there’s a secret room
in this house.

358
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,582
Don: Whoa. Really?

359
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,951
Emma: Yeah, located here.

360
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,822
It’s right next
to mom’s bedroom.

361
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,092
Mom’s room is connected to both
the bathroom and washroom,

362
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,094
and then, past that,
behind the wall,

363
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,295
is where her office is,

364
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,297
but from what i’ve gathered,

365
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,900
this probably isn’t a wall.

366
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,869
Gilda: Mm. As for me,

367
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,337
what I noticed
was that she disappears

368
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,940
into either the office
or the washroom.

369
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,076
Emma: That said,
I measured the distance

370
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,577
of the inside of the room,

371
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,613
along with the hallway
outside of it.

372
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,514
norman: Oh!
That’s what you were doing.

373
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,283
- Don: Huh?
- Emma: Yeah.

374
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,551
Don: Okay. And?

375
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,520
Emma: They didn’t match.

376
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:03,056
There’s about ten steps
worth of space here.

377
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,059
one side’s a wall,
the other has bookshelves,

378
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,329
but i’m guessing there are
hidden doors on both sides.

379
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,832
Gilda: And beyond those doors
is mom’s secret room.

380
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,467
don: Why does
something like that even exist?

381
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,835
Emma: It’s probably for--

382
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,237
ray: Standard check-ins.

383
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,805
I bet that’s where she goes

384
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,473
to check in
with the headquarters every day.

385
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,475
- Makes the most sense.
- ( Girls gasp )

386
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,810
Don: Headquarters?

387
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,244
Norman: The base
that supplies babies

388
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,079
and sisters like krone
to this house.

389
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,381
( Don gasps )

390
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,082
Emma: I’m curious, ray.

391
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,484
Did you know about the room?

392
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,054
ray: No, but I
had a feeling it existed.

393
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,388
Don: Let’s try to get in!

394
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,456
’cause what if
there’s a way to, like,

395
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,091
talk to the outside in there?

396
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,894
or some clues
about conny and the others?

397
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,197
Gilda: But don’t you think
it’ll be hard to get in?

398
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,098
Don: Who cares?
We still have to try!

399
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,266
Ray: Hold it.

400
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,101
There’s no advantage
in doing that.

401
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,836
I’ve got a strong feeling

402
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,906
that the transmission device
only connects with hq.

403
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:56,310
As for where our siblings were
sent to, mom wouldn’t know,

404
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,012
so I don’t think
we’d find any clues.

405
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,149
And don’t forget the trackers
could show her we’re snooping.

406
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,052
That is if the security
in the room doesn’t first.

407
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,953
- It’s too risky.
- Don: Yeah, but--

408
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,355
ray: I’m trying to tell you

409
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,958
that the risks
greatly outweigh the benefits.

( Don gasps )

Norman: I agree,

412
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,462
and we still
have to worry about krone,

413
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,032
so it’s not really wise
to make foolish moves.

414
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,166
Ray: Exactly.

415
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,435
I’ve still got mom
under control,

416
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,571
but we’re done for
if krone finds out.
