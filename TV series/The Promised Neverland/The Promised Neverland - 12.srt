68

sister said stuff
about a "harvest,"

69
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,323
and I wondered what she meant.

70

One time, I saw her
looking under ray’s bed.

And, when Norman left the house,

72

I could tell you were
really scared of mom, Emma.

The others don’t know
about the house or fire,

All right. Hear me out.

i should go with.

Do I take everyone,
including the babies,

90
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,015
or should I leave
the kids under five?

Both: Huh?!

92

Emma: We only get harvested
when we turn six,

93
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,722
and even though marnya’s
birthday is the earliest,

94
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,025
she’ll still have
a year and a half.

95

15 of the older kids’ll
be gone.

96
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,864
Since this house
focuses on quality,

97
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,566
the pace of harvesting
should start going down.

98
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,938
if they want to raise
high-quality kids here again,

99
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,574
they can’t kill
ones with potential.

100
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,810
that said,
you and the other five

101

who are four years old
all have good scores,

102

so it’s best to let you develop.

i’d say we have about two years.
