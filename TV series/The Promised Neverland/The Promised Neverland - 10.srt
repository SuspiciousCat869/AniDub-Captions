the best way for you
to end all of your suffering

I’ve been thinking about it,

342
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,628
and I would like
to recommend you

343
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,097
as the next mom candidate
for this farm.

344

345

Isabella: That’s right.

346
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,237
If you become an adult
and give birth,

347
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,406
then prove your abilities,
you can return to this house

348
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,075
and watch over it
as a mom or sister.

349
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,711
You have the right
to that option.

350

can you do to stop this?
