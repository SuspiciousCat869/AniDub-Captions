00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,856
Ray: Question.

167
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,192
What’s Norman good at
that you’re not?

168
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,193
Emma: Hmm.

169
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,095
Uh, planning ahead

170
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,863
and staying calm?

171
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,299
I guess he’s also good
at being smart.

172

Ray: It’s strategy.

173
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,137
Just think. If it’s about
simple physical ability,

174
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,641
then you have the upper hand,
but it’s more than that.

175
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,210
Norman has brains like no other,

176
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,146
and tag is a game
where you compete with strategy.

177

Emma: In a game of tag?

178
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,950
Ray: Way I see it,
tag’s like chess,

179
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,651
but using your whole body.

180
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,120
Don’t you think so, Norman?

181
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,955
Norman: Yeah, sure. But i’d say

182
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,224
that you’re more of a tactician
than I am, ray.

the enemy’s moves.

185
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,063
Norman: But still,
we can’t compare

to mom’s ability
to read a situation.
