the demons said,

56
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,681
our ages determine
their grades of meat,

57
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,416
and if I remember correctly,

58
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,584
the siblings
who were shipped out before

59
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,453
were all between 6 and 12,

60
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,755
and if six years old
is ranked as normal,

61
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,758
then the highest quality
must be...

62
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,992
Emma: Twelve years old!

63
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,660
But what about our scores?

64
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,129
Meat won’t start tasting better

65
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,498
because of how well it did
on some test, will it?

norman: True.
The results weren’t announced

67

( Emma gasps )
The shipping order?!

69
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
Norman: Yeah. When we turn six,

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,210
we’re harvested in order
from lowest test scores up,

71
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,112
and once we’ve reached
the age of 12,

72
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,179
it seems we get shipped out,
no matter what.

73
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,148
Emma: So we were exempt from it

74
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,985
because we got
perfect scores on our test?

75
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,887
Norman: But I
still don’t get it.

76
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,489
Why do our scores
dictate the order?

77
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:44,958
Emma: And why do you think

78
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,261
being between 6 and 12
is what matters?

79
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,497
Is it the size of our bodies?

80
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,000
can’t be, or else
weight would be a factor.

( Gasps )

83

It’s our brains.

00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,539
( Emma gasps ) That means...

85
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,608
Norman: That the brain
must taste the best,

86
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,779
and the more developed it is,
the better.

87

88
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,583
Norman: Seems so,

89
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,585
and they’ll
spend a lot for them,

90
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,787
which makes us
valuable merchandise.

91
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,889
Remember the order?

92
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,625
Conny was shipped most recently.

93
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,095
Before her was hao
and Sadie before him.

94
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,297
Following the cycle
they’ve used so far,

95
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,567
the next shipment should be
at least two months from now,

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,002
which means you and I
need to come up with a way

97
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,171
for all of us to escape
from here before then.

98
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,973

( Thunder rumbling )

100
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,715
Norman: We’ll start by making
a rudimentary map of the site.

101
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,084
The house is in the middle,
lined up with the gate,

102
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,753
and the forest encircles
the rest of the property.

103
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,390
so which exit
do we choose for our escape,

104
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,026
the gate or the forest?

105
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,928
Emma: I’d say the forest.

106
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,196
The gate’s always closed,

107
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,797
except for when
they’re shipping,

108
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,964
and when it’s open...

109
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,867
Norman: Those demons are there.

110
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,969
So when do we try to escape?

111
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,337
During the day at playtime

112
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,806
when we’re able to get
out of the house freely,

113
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,174
or during shipping, when mom’s--

114
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,242
Emma: We can’t wait
to do it during shipping!

115
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,411
That plan means
someone we love dies!

116
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,647
Norman: You’re right.
And i’m also worried

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,383
the younger ones won’t be able
to stay awake during the night.

118
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,318
It’s decided.

119
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,955
We’ll escape during the day
through the forest,

120
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,389
if that’s possible.

121
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,157
Emma: That depends
on what things are like

122
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,292
beyond the forest.

Emma: Nothing.

138
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,302
the wall looks
about two or three meters thick.

139
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,071
The top of it
is pretty high up.

140
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,039
Norman: But there are no guards.

141
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,275
It’s quiet.

142
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,846
Emma, what do you think?

143
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,116
Emma: It was built sturdy.

144
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,886
i don’t see
any rough edges or seams,

145
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,954
and the surface is smooth.

146
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,057
there’s no way
someone could climb this.

147
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,959
norman: Then,
should we just give up?

148
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,161
That’s what it’s meant
to make us think,

149
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,996
but if it was you or me,

150
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,865
climbing this wouldn’t be
a problem with a rope.

151
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,901
Norman: I don’t sense
any demons.

152
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,602
Only mom’s watching us.

153
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,938
So there’s no need
to be scared.

326
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,425
you’re ready to believe this
so easily.

327
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,528
ray: Huh?
Of course I believe it.

328
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:30,564
Norman would never make up
such an unbelievably dumb lie.

329
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,466
He’s not you, Emma.

330
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,434
( Emma gasps, groans )

331
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,304
Ray: So, if we’re really
going to make a break for it,

332
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,339
we need to address
a couple things.

333
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,242
First is the number of kids.

334
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,410
We should narrow it down
to those who can make it.

335
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,211
- Emma: Wait!
- Ray: Hmm?

336
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,516
Emma: We’re leaving here
and taking everyone,

337
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,651
and, to make that happen,
we need you.

338
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:51,618
( Ray gasps )

339
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,323
Everyone? You’re kidding, right?

340
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,959
There are 37 kids here,

341
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,127
and most of them
aren’t even six years old yet.

342
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,131
There’s mom, demons,
homing beacons.

343
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,966
Those factors
take a bad situation

344
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,101
and make it worse.
You want the impossible.

345
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,937
Emma: I know it’ll be tough,

346
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,505
but I don’t think
it’s impossible!

347
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,473
Ray: It can’t be done.

348
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,275
Emma, you don’t get it, do you?

349
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,211
- Emma: Huh?
- Norman: Ray, hang on.

350
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,546
Ray: Ah, I see.

351
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,316
That’s why you said
you’d talk to me.

352
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,252
But you have to be upfront
about something this grave.

353
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,087
- Emma...
- Emma: Yeah, what?

354
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,589
ray: We can’t just worry
about escaping. It’s not enough.

355
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,425
Emma: What do you mean by that?

356
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,660
Ray: We don’t know
what’s waiting outside

357
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,296
beyond this wall,

358
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,665
but there’s a place
we’re getting shipped to.

359
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:40,167
The fact that there’s
a farm and a buyer

360
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,035
should give you an idea.

361
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,538
What waits outside
is a demon’s world.

362
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,606
There is no place
for humans to live.

363
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,175
It was never meant for our kind.

364
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,177
( Emma gasps )

365
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,212
Ray: So it’s impossible.

366
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:55,015
if we take everyone,
then we’ll all die out there.

367
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,484
We leave them behind.

368
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,020
That’s the best option.

369
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,088
Emma: No way.

370
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,723
( Ray gasps )

371
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,459
Emma: Even if it’s impossible,
they’re all coming!

372
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,627
- We can figure it out!
- ray: What?!

373
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,429
Emma: I don’t know
what’s on the outside,

374
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,032
but leaving part of our family
behind isn’t an option!

375
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,635
I want conny to be
the last one they take.

376
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,140
Never again. I won’t
lose anyone else like that.

377
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:22,643
If there isn’t a place
out there for humans to live,

378
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,578
we’ll carve one out
for ourselves!

379
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,546
together,
we’ll change the world!

380
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,415
- ( Ray gasps )
- Emma: Thank you, ray,

381
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,083
for helping me to understand.

382
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,353
We’re planning an escape
where we get everyone out.

383
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,855
I’m not bending on this.

384
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,790
- I’ve decided.
- ( Ray gasps )

385
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,392
Emma: You have to come to grips
with my plan, ray,

386
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,795
so stop jabbering, and help us!

387
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,730
- ( Ray grunts )
- ( Norman laughing )

388
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,602
Ray: How can you just laugh?
Her plan is suicide!

389
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,604
emma: We’re escaping
with everyone, and that’s it!

390
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,806
I won’t agree to anything else!
I won’t! I won’t! I won’t!

391
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,608
Ray: Someone should
knock some sense into her!

392
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,143
She’s unreasonable!

393
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,444
Norman: Yeah, totally!

394
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,579
i’m glad she’s
her old cheerful self.

395
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,381
Ray: You’re missing
my point, Norman!

396
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,883
Stop her, or you’ll both die!

397
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,885
Of course, you knew all that

398
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,754
from the very start,
didn’t you?

399
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:09,923
Norman: You didn’t see
the way she cried.

400
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,926
- ( Ray gasps )
- Norman: That night,

401
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,929
I thought she was crying
because she was terrified.

402
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,832
I know now that I was wrong.

403
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,735
what I saw there
made me afraid of dying.

404
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,736
Emma was scared,
but it was the thought

405
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,538
of her family dying
that horrified her.

406
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,476
She’s so amazing,
to be in that situation

407
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,245
and worried
about protecting others.

408
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,913
Ray: But it’s a lost cause!

409
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,749
The three of us could make it,
but trying to take everyone,

410
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,218
it’s like making
a boat out of mud!

411
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,253
( Norman sighs )

412
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,821
Ray: You should be scared.

413
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,689
There’s nothing
to be ashamed of.

414
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,559
don’t let feelings
cloud your vision! We’ll die!

415
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,427
Norman: I do see clearly.

416
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,596
i want to build
a boat out of mud as well!

417
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,299
Ray: Huh? Don’t be a fool!

418

to be different!

420
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,505

Norman: And how i’d do anything

424
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,312
to always put a smile
on her face.

425
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,548
Ray: You’ve gone crazy.

426
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,717
And what if Emma dies
because of it?

427
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:13,721
Norman: That won’t happen.

428
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:18,459
I will make sure of it,
and i’ll do whatever it takes.

429
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,428
Look on the bright side.
I’ve always been able

430
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,930
to accomplish
whatever I set out to do.

431
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:26,800
If you bake mud,
you can make a vessel,

432
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:30,338
so a boat that’s made out of mud
wouldn’t necessarily sink.

Perhaps Emma and I
are both insane.

We’ve completely lost it,
