One, we ascend the wall.

Two, we safely get
as far away as we can.

28

Three, we learn how to survive

we should run as far as we can,

a confusing mythology book.

actually had been,

this wouldn’t be here.

just little bunny, either.

all of these toys from them

of meaning in these two,

communicating with?

ray was talking about?

had mom under control
