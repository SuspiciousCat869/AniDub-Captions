[NARRATOR] M4A1 was relieved
after successfully

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
contacting M16,
a fellow AR Team member.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
However, immediately
following their brief reunion,

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:24.816 position:50% align:center
M16 was confronted by
another Griffin doll.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Yeah, the enemy's
not that strong,

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.487 position:50% align:center
but they just keep on coming.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.324 position:50% align:center
Like searching around for
clues to their whereabouts.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
This is the best
chance I'll get.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
I don't like to waste my time.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
Someone's coming, but I'm
pretty sure it's not to help.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
But I don't get it--
if you're part of Griffin

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
and still killing
Dolls that aren't Sangvis,

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
can you at least tell me why?

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
What gives, 416?

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
[416] Squad 404
has special privileges.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
[M16]
You're wrong.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
Someone does care,
and they're waiting for me.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
I gotta go.
But don't be stupid.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
You're leaving?
Not sure I believe that.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.939 position:50% align:center
You still have a weapon
on your back.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
It hasn't been used yet.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:39.057 position:50% align:center

[INTRUDER]
Hunter...

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.995 position:50% align:center
They're all gone.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.124 position:50% align:center
But the show must go on!

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
[AR15] There are three
on the observation deck.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
I can see six at the gate.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
We've got 18 in the building.

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
Not a lot overall.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
If all the data is correct,
then we are sitting at the top

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
of their home base.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
[M4]
If that's all there is,

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
then we should be
able to bust in.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
Please share that with everyone
as our mission plan.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
[PPSH-41]
I'm already on it.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
[M4] Skorpion, PPSh,
Get your grenades ready.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
[PPSH-41]
Copy.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Do your best to distract them.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
And then, we'll go in
when they detonate.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Now!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
[M4 sighs]

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:57.630 position:50% align:center
Commander, we've just finished
destroying the target.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Roger that.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
And upon scanning
every comms channel,

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
I feel confident that
the Sangvis in the area

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
have all been taken care of.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.266 position:50% align:center
Kalina, how's the drone
resupply coming?

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Mm. Let me check on that.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
Oh, pretty soon. Materials
should be restocked in 5.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
[comms crackling,
music playing]

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
The hell is that noise?

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
That's strange.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
Kinda sounds like we might
have picked something up.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER] It always disgusts me
how unrefined Griffin can be.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Of course you're
using another public channel,

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
and with background music
this time-- How festive.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50% align:center
Ringleaders have quite
a flair for the dramatic.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER] How kind of
you little rust stains

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
to pay me a visit. Allow me to
give you a proper welcome.

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.884 position:50% align:center
And look at you, mastering the
art of uncovering my soldiers!

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Isn't this fun?

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
But that's just one of
my many supply bases.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
It means nothing to me.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
That was obvious in the useless
counterattack you launched.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.231 position:50% align:center
I gotta say, your cockiness
is unwarranted.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
You're not as strong
as you think.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
Oh, do I detect
a hint of jealousy?

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
Don't let all this skill
and excellence keep you

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
from saying hello. I've so
been looking forward to it.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.328 position:50% align:center
At least try to
make it entertaining.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
[music playing,
comms crackle]

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
Why are they all such bitches?

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
I'd love to meet whoever
designed their personalities.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
Clearly, this individual needs
to be slapped around a bit.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
Honestly, they all seem
pretty human to me.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] I have a hard time
believing she's commanding

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
that huge area on her own.
We found that base so easily.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
That doesn't happen.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
She's gotta be
planning something.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Units 1 and 2,
follow, but be careful!

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Roger!

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
Unit 1 has already reached
the mission point.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50% align:center
Heading in now.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
[SOPII gasps]
It's totally empty in here.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
Then what was it that
we thought we saw?

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
This is all fake data!

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
Commander, copy!

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
It can't be true.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER]
This is so fun.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
You finally found me out!

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:24.652 position:50% align:center
It is quite unfortunate
that it took you so long.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
And now you'll never escape!

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
Crap! This whole
thing's a set-up!

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:34.829 position:50% align:center
Stop! We gotta retreat!

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
Fall back!

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
[M14] We need to get
somewhere that we can hide!

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:39.584 position:50% align:center
And quickly!

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:45.799 position:50% align:center
[FNC]
We can fight them from here!

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
Just be sure to keep
an eye on your ammo!

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.220 position:50% align:center
--[FN49] Roger!

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
Unit 2! Give me a sitrep!

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center
[FN49] We're currently
inside the building!

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
No damage received!

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hurry up and clear it!

00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
Copy!

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
Analyze the data from Unit 2!

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
On it!

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
I'm only seeing one entrance.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
FNC and Ingram, take
your dummies and head for

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
the main gate.

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
[FNC]
Roger!

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Ingram, do not waste your ammo.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] As soon as they
rush in, fire a smoke grenade!

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
You got it! Consider it handled!

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] FN49 and M14,
snipe the enemy from the roof.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
That might be rough.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
We're finding it hard
to see clearly out there.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
That's all right.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis can't see that
far in this weather, either.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
No need to worry.
You have the advantage.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
As long as you stay
on high ground.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
[FN49]
Right. Understood.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Don't expect the
enemy to charge in immediately.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
But we can't run away, either.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.992 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Unit 1,
when you're out of there,

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
hurry and join Unit 2.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
Damn it. They're already
aiming for our weakest unit.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
They must know our forces
are limited in number.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
Every unit has
to back up the other.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
And this can't be the only
fake base they have.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
They're buying a whole lot
of time for some reason.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
Now, now.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50% align:center

I'm not sleeping tonight.

[HELIAN] Commander,
I have an urgent update.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.354 position:50% align:center
The special team
has found the location

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
--of the Sangvis Ringleader.
--[GENTIANE gasps]

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Therefore, your mission
has changed from distracting

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
the enemy to taking down this
Ringleader known as Intruder--

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
effective immediately.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:36.076 position:50% align:center
I've put her location
and a passable route on the map.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
Take her down as soon as
possible and recapture S09.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] A-Ah... That's what
I'm talkin' about, special team!

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] If we can
take her down quickly,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
there'll be no overtime!
Unit 3, change of orders!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
I need you to head full speed
to your new destination!

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Roger!

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
So, um, just curious...

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
Isn't it considered dangerous
to send out only one unit?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.185 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Don't be ridiculous.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
Who said anything
about just one unit?

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50% align:center
[PPSH-41]
Something doesn't feel right.

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
Isn't it risky to
ignore other bases?

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
You thought that ending,
all that chaos, was fun?

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER]
It's all about perspective.

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
Like you, I was just
an actor on the stage--

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
living in the limelight,
playing my part.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
And in the end, curtain
call comes for us all.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.000 position:50% align:center
So now, after the drama
and the pain,

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
I've taken my final bow.

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
How could it not be fun?

00:20:55.213 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
Besides... this prelude was
enough, because the real show

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:02.470 position:50% align:center
is about to begin.

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
[M4]
The real show?

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Isn't it funny?

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
Leaving a little mystery makes
it all a bit more entertaining.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
Intruder is offline.

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Understood, mission complete.

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Roger.

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
It's finally done, huh?

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
--M16...
--Huh?

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Wait a second,
this is M16?!

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
Hello there!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
This is her, slacking off
and hiding from us. Again.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly. I'm the one
who tracked down

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
the Sangvis Ringleader
after all,

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
and I definitely
wasn't slacking off.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.853 position:50% align:center
Okay, so why didn't you
link up with us before?

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:55.231 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's just... she was pretty
cagey about her plans

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
and safeguarding herself.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
Plus, I knew it wouldn't take
you long to figure it out.

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
M16!

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
Glad you're finally back!

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:07.327 position:50% align:center
Same here.
Everybody's together again.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.662 position:50% align:center
It's nice being back to normal.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
[M16]
M4.

00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:18.546 position:50% align:center
[M4 growls]

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.132 position:50% align:center
You jerk! What was that for?!

00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:22.842 position:50% align:center
I'm already super banged up--

00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:25.720 position:50% align:center
what if that
knocked my head off?!

00:22:25.804 --> 00:22:27.430 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Then you can just die!

00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:30.600 position:50% align:center
I won't even reinstall your
freakin' backup data.

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:34.896 position:50% align:center
I'll melt you down and reset
your memory myself!

00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:39.109 position:50% align:center
[sobbing] Don't you know how
much I worried about you?!

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:43.238 position:50% align:center
Come on, knock it off.
I'm home and I'm safe now.

00:22:43.321 --> 00:22:47.534 position:50% align:center
You could, I dunno,
at least be a little bit happy.

00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:49.703 position:50% align:center
[M4 sobbing]

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:55.166 position:50% align:center
[M16] Mm... There, there.
I'm gonna need your comms code.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.586 position:50% align:center
I have to deliver a message
directly to your commander.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.673 position:50% align:center
M4...

00:23:01.756 --> 00:23:04.801 position:50% align:center
I wanna say that it's official.

00:23:06.261 --> 00:23:09.514 position:50% align:center
[M16]
I'm back now, for good.

00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:11.683 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Welcome back...

00:24:42.899 --> 00:24:46.194 position:50% align:center
