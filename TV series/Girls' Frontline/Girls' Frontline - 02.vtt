[NARRATOR] In the year 2045,
at the dawn of World War 3,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
Tactical Dolls were deployed

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
by military organizations around
the world in lieu of humans.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.319 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The T-Dolls
were created by every

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:32.991 position:50% align:center
major military manufacturer,
but it was the Sangvis Ferri

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
who rebelled against humanity
once the war ended.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
Griffin, a private
military company,

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
sent its elite AR Team out to
find the cause of the rebellion

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
and bring it to an end.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Incoming Sangvis Reinforcements!

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50% align:center
Estimated arrival time,
15 seconds!

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
There are too many of them!

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
Try to save ammo!

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
[M4] They can barely
even protect themselves!

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
What makes you think they have
the strength to come here?

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
[AGENT 1A]
Say farewell.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center
And prepare to take
your last breath.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.031 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Good afternoon, Commander!

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:16.076 position:50% align:center
I'm from Griffin.
Forward command post logistics.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.952 position:50% align:center
My name is Officer Kalina!

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure to meet you as
well, Officer Kalina.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.208 position:50% align:center
I'm Gentiane.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.338 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] You must be tired
from your long journey.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.257 position:50% align:center
Did you have any
problems on your way?

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.468 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I'd
call it a problem,

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
but it wasn't exactly easy.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center
Yeah. The level of violence out
here is somewhat high.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.602 position:50% align:center
Our vehicles get
banged up real fast.

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.437 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.065 position:50% align:center
Sure makes sleeping impossible.

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:49.484 position:50% align:center
I know I just got here,
but I need a nap.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:53.196 position:50% align:center
Did you already receive
a rundown on your mission?

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.615 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Basically...
the Sangvis are going rogue,

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
and I'm gonna lead the Griffin
Dolls to take them down, yes?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.454 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] There's a little
more to it than that.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.081 position:50% align:center
Hope this room is okay for you.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
I'm in Heaven!

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
So what's next on my schedule?

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, your first
mission starts in one hour.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.302 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50% align:center
I arrived an hour ago and
I'm already on a mission?

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.817 position:50% align:center
I might've applied
for the wrong job.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
I'm sorry.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
Sangvis has been way
more aggressive lately.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
You got any info on the enemy?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Yep.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Mm.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Those aren't Dolls.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they use these
little guys a lot like scouts.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Huh?

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Um. What kind of
combat experience do you have?

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
I've mastered the simulator.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
Today's my first "real" fight.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
Oh, can you show me
the data on each Doll?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] About that,
there's another operation

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
running parallel to yours.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
Some of the Dolls
are recovering.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can pick
your team from this list?

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Hmm... I don't know--
can I talk to them first?

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
Huh? You want to talk to them?

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
Mm...

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
[beep]

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
MP5? My name's Gentiane.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
A new commander
who just arrived today.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay. Hello, Commander.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] I'd like to
ask you some questions

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
before the mission.
Is that all right with you?

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
Yeah! You can ask me anything!

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Okay, thanks.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
Let's say you're a sniper
out on a mission.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
But you notice that there's
a problem with your weapon.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
There's a chance it
will explode when fired.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
Mm.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
It's just a 50-50 chance,

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
but your only
backup is a handgun.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
What's more, you know you'll
make the hit with your rifle.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what will you do?

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
I couldn't pick either one!
I'd simply abandon the mission!

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Why's that?

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
If I'm feeling uncertain,
it's best to try again when all

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
the elements needed
are in place.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be able to
concentrate otherwise.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'd buy that.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
How many dummies can you make?

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
Three, four...

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
I can make four!

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
That's all for now MP5.
You're dismissed.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
Okay! Thank you, Commander!

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.071 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
So was that helpful at all?

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
Sure. She's quite childlike,

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
but less than her
appearance suggests.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
It would be good to have her.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
Fewer mistakes and oversights.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] All I really needed
to know was whether or not

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
she was capable of making
decisions beyond the options

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
I gave her.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
The battlefield is constantly
moving and fluctuating,

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.175 position:50% align:center
and there are any number
of patterns that could arise.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
An independent mind
is essential.

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
She has that. I can use her.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
Uh... My stomach is in knots...

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
--[beep]
--Ah!

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
Hello there.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
[FN49]
Hi, I'm... I'm FN49!

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
It's, um, so nice to meet you!

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
Wah!

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] To improve accuracy,
let's set the submachine guns

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
to the front, and One
Assault Rifle to the rear.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.334 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm. Looks good.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
All right, everyone, listen up.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
Our objective is to remove
enemies along the route.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
I.E, eliminate them.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] We're looking for two
types of enemies known to be

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
in the area:
Prowlers and Daynergates.

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
The operation doesn't end
until you're all home safe.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
So for your own sake,
be careful.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.005 position:50% align:center
Let's begin. Go.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
MP5, up front.
The rest, support from the rear.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
Okay!

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
[G36]
As you wish!

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
[P7]
This way?

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50% align:center
[FNC]
Where're the snacks?

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:30.010 position:50% align:center
You just finished eating, FNC!

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
Besides, you're all
tactical Dolls, right?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
Since when do you get hungry?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
Why are you asking me?

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
It's not like Dolls
create themselves.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
Commander, I have eyes
on the enemy.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.488 position:50% align:center
Sending to monitor!

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
[P7] We're lucky they
haven't found us yet!

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.286 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
It's most certainly not luck.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
You were all built to navigate
uneven ground much easier

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
than robots on wheels
or with four legs.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center
You have the ability to climb
and hide in better positions.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
[MP5] So is that why you had
all of us dropped so far away?

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but I also
had you run there.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
[MP5] The leader is
currently within range.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
Would you like me to blast it?

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.766 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Not yet.
Wait and withdraw behind cover.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] MP5,
lay down automatic gun fire

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
from the front. Delay the unit.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
FNC, G36, provide backup.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Heading out!

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
[FNC]
Me, too!

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] P7, get up high
and aim for the enemy cameras.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.659 position:50% align:center
Why is my assignment
so much harder

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
than everyone else's here?

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] No complaining.
You've got an S in accuracy.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm counting on you.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
Commander, we are in position!

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Stay put until further orders.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
Roger.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.716 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna open fire?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
If we can draw them a little
closer, we can hit all of them

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
with one attack.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
If we fire now,
the enemies at the front

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center
would shield the
ones in the back.

--[GENTIANE] Open fire!

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
All right, cease fire!

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
MP5, I need you
to give me a sitrep.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
Enemy units down! All of them.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
What's the damage on our side?

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
[P7]
This is P7!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
Not even moderate
damage over here!

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
There's no total damage! None!

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
Nor moderate!
We're fully operational!

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:58.825 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggle]

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.661 position:50% align:center
Okay. Now, head to
the extraction point.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
Recovery's on the way.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
Roger that!

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Mission complete.
Excellent work.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well, I'm glad
that nobody was injured.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Oh, right.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm?

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
I didn't explain this earlier,
but the Doll's memories--

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
they're all backed up
along with their experiences.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
If they're destroyed,
they can be recovered.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
I'm aware.

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
Are you saying
you're not bothered if

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
the Dolls are destroyed?

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Mm.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What's next?

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
I'm not seeing anything else
except your meeting

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
with Helian in six hours.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
Nap time, then.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
From the looks of it, seems
your first mission went well.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
Sure. But then,
it was just the tutorial.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.891 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
Mm-hmm. You're very observant.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
With the low-priority
objectives,

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
enemies with simple
attack patterns, and terrain

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
with easily-determined
advantageous points.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
It was obvious.
That was a test for a commander

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
with no real combat
experience, right?

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
Is that all you see?

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
Don't be so upset.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
It's been 11 years
since the war ended

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
and one since Elisa went rogue.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
Both allies and
enemies are Dolls.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
The ongoing conflict here
is like none humanity

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
has ever witnessed before.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center
The rules are different
from what we knew.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
And that means we need
a special type of commander.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
We aren't gonna find them
just by sifting through

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.141 position:50% align:center
the military roster.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
We recruit directly from
the military schools.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
Only a private company
can utilize that method.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
I appreciate that.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
There were a few things
we needed to know

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
before committing.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
Like how you would select your
autonomous Dolls, obviously.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
Then, how would
you fight and lead.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
In other words, how capable
you'd be in battle.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
And? What did you find?

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
You've become a little
more emotionally attached

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
to the Dolls than we would like.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.046 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE grunts]

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.047 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
But you're usable.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[HELIAN] Congrats.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
You're a Griffin commander now.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Welcome.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE sighs]

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
There she is!

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Huh?

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
--[giggling]
--[G36] It's our new master!

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
I mean, Commander!

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
We're so thankful for your
orders today on our mission!

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
Because of you, none of us
were damaged at all!

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
Hard to do!

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
[MP5] I'm so impressed!
And unbelievably grateful!

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout this.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
They all insisted on
thanking you for

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
your leadership out there.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
This is for you.

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:13:58.672 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
[FN49]
Um, Commander?

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
Will you please
use me next time?

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me, too!

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.471 position:50% align:center
I'm also dying to get out there
and feel the rush of battle!

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Making requests
and we haven't even

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center

Congratulations, Commander.
Welcome to Griffin!

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
Thank you. At ease.

[MG3 gasps]
Ingram!

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
[INGRAM]
I won't accept it...

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
I won't accept it!

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
What won't you accept?

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
[INGRAM]
The command... er...

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
Attention, all commanders.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
We have received an update.

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
This one comes to us from
the frontlines and was

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
delivered by Ingram.

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
Her combat team encountered
a Sangvis unit

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
during their operational action.

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
This particular enemy was being
led by a High-End Model,

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:17.292 position:50% align:center
Scarecrow.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
Ingram's unit was almost
completely annihilated.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
Ingram dutifully left the
battlefield to bring back

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.509 position:50% align:center
this information
and the combat data.

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
She succeeded in escaping, but
one of the Skorpions did not,

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
and was imprisoned.

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
From several of the conversation
patterns exchanged

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
during the battle,
we can assume that Scarecrow

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
has more knowledge than we knew,
including the reason for

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
the Sangvis attacks in the area.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we are executing
an emergency operation.

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
The mission is to make contact
with and destroy Scarecrow,

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
and ultimately recover
her memory module.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
At the same time, we will need
to rescue and recover Skorpion.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
Data will be sent soon
to participating units.

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
You are dismissed.

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What's a High-End Model?

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Forgive me for
not explaining that earlier.

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
They're Sangvis T-Dolls with
exceptional combat skills.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
They're incredibly strong
and use special equipment,

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
so it's hard to take them down.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm...

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:40.125 position:50% align:center
Everyone, cease fire!

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
Confirmed hit!
No enemies remaining!

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
Confirming that we now
control the enemy area.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
--[SCARECROW giggles]
--[gasping]

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
[SCARECROW] Such confidence.
But how can you be certain?

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
When did she get here?!

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:10.030 position:50% align:center
No idea! I heard nothing!

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
[SCARECROW]
Oh, hello there.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
Question:

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to die?

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
Is this Scarecrow?

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
[SCARECROW]
The one and only.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Good to know.
You're being captured.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.419 position:50% align:center
I suggest surrendering quietly.

00:17:24.502 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
[SCARECROW]
Is this a joke?

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
Me, surrender to
Griffin's paper Dolls?

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
You've got a sick
sense of humor.

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Far from it.
There's nowhere for you to run.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
This area is under our control.

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.223 position:50% align:center
We need you.

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
Well, your module, really,
to answer a few questions.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
Surrender, Scarecrow.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
We'll give you
three seconds to comply.

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:48.276 position:50% align:center

Why would you fight when
you can't possibly win?

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
So that's a High-End Model...

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
It's time. Are you ready?

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
Scarecrow is about to re-engage.

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
Carry out the mission
as planned.

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center

Using your primary force as
a diversion is quite clever.

But what I don't understand
is how you thought you could

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
defeat me with such
limited firepower?

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center

[HELIAN] You should also know
that we rescued Skorpion.

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
Any information she
passed on to you was false.

Is that supposed
to be a surprise?

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
Of course it's false.

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
You say that as if we don't know
exactly how the Dolls' AIs work.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
When those ridiculous
puppets attempt

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
to lie, they actually just
mix random false information

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
in with the truth.

So let's say, for instance, she
gives us three false statements.

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
All we have to do
is analyze them,

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
and find the commonalities.

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
That's what determines
the real information.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] The details of how
the AI program operates

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
are highly classified!
How did you access this data?

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center

What are you?

I am just a low-ranking T-Doll.

I was sent on this
