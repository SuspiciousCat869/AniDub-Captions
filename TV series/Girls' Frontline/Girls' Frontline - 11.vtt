[NARRATOR] AR Team
retreats after being caught

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.973 position:50% align:center
in Dreamer's artillery trap.

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, AR15 realizes
her proclivities are due

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.688 position:50% align:center
to a Sangvis virus and is
more determined than ever

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.691 position:50% align:center
to fight on her own.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Negative.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.194 position:50% align:center
Why would she
advertise her location?

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.030 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make any sense.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.740 position:50% align:center
We can't go any further.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.242 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] She's not just
using a new weapon.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
That's the artillery
that attacked our base!

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
And now it's aimed right at you!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Maybe you're not as
much of a nutjob as Destroyer

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
seems to think you are.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.794 position:50% align:center
Thank you. And you're
not quite as stony

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
as the data reports you to be.

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it took courage
to come here on your own

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
instead of running
away with the others.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
I can still make
good use of you.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
Good news, AR15.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
You've been chosen.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.893 position:50% align:center
[AR15 growls]

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
[AR15] I can't forget the
first people to accept me,

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
and I will never betray them.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.625 position:50% align:center
[AR15] The way she still
looks at me makes me wonder...

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:30.799 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Does she have any idea...
how much I hated her?

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
--Tell me something.
--[KALINA] Hmm?

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.109 position:50% align:center
Exactly how long are we
expected to keep waiting here?

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
Um. How long?
I haven't thought about it.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea what could
be bothering Master Gentiane?

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
Nothing's bothering me.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
It's just, having backup
isn't a free pass.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.416 position:50% align:center
We should still be careful
with how we operate our Dolls.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.918 position:50% align:center
Oh, "Operate"?

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
'Least you're finally using
the correct terminology.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
By the way,
I understand you have help.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
So, Helian sent a whole team
to help locate AR15.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
Where'd you hear that?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN] Hmph! My sweet honey
angel revealed your secret.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.392 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.561 position:50% align:center
What's this team called?

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Squad Negev.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tavor, got an update?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I do not.
AR15 has turned off her radar

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
to prevent us from locating
her exact position.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
Then how the heck are we
supposed to stop her

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
from escaping? We were lucky
to find these footprints!

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50% align:center
Not that we can't handle
any number of Sangvis.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
I am a combat
specialist, after all!

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
Hey, Galil, do you
know what that is?

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
[GALIL] Hmm? It kinda
looks like a planetarium.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
[UZI] Ohh... You mean
for looking at stars?

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
What are you two doing?

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
No one should be
standing around.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
Keep moving!

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
Victory is within our grasp--

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
all we have to do is
reach out and take it!

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
I've never known a team captain
to be quite as cheerful as ours.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
I'm the latest model,
and her relentless optimism

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
--still impresses me.
--[UZI chuckling]

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
March on! March on!

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
[M16]
What's the matter?

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
Cheer up, M4.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
I heard footprints
were found nearby.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'll be
seeing her soon.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.975 position:50% align:center
[M4] If so, what are
we planning to do?

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Hmm?

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
What if we tell her were
taking her home?

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.314 position:50% align:center
Would she want to at this point?

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
If so, would everything
be the way it was?

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.526 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't it?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
[M16 sighs] I don't think her
disappearance runs that deep.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
I'm betting there's a bad
connection in one of her parts.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
Just give her
a few good thwacks,

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
and she'll be good as new.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps]

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
What? Is that
really how it works?

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
Listen. If you heard it
from me, you can believe it.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps]

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:40.423 position:50% align:center
Stop staring at the ground.
Try to keep your head up.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
We're gonna find her.
Together.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
[UZI]
Is this it?

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
This isn't a base,
it's more like a campground!

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
Hey, no complaining.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
Galil, go and stand
watch at the rear.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50% align:center
[GALIL]
I'm on it.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center

'Kay!

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
Oh. Remember:
We're here to look for AR15.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
We won't leave without her.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
However, her team should be
the ones to bring her in.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
I assumed so.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
Let's request
reinforcements first.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
We can't go any
further on our own.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
Right.

[NEGEV]
What's going on, Tavor?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
That's so strange.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center
This transmitter's
giving me an error.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center

Whoa! The heck was that?

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
Was it Parapluie?
Or something else?

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center
No clue.

Just three more seconds and
I could've been close enough

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
to caress that pretty
throat of yours.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
You poor thing. You must be
the one jamming all our comms.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
What the hell do you want?

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
I don't want anything.

smell of delicious unripe fruit.

Hello, my name is Alchemist.
That's all you need to know.

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
You can ask questions
if you're able to speak

Oh-kay...?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
That's it. We're
leaving this base!

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
There are too many enemies here!
Let's head to the planetarium.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
We'll wait for backup.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
Hey. Galil, we'll
distract the Sangvis.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
You look for another route
outside the jamming radius!

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
Report to our commander
when you're clear! Got it?

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
Yup! Roger that!

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
[M4] Commander, Squad Negev went
radio silent 20 minutes ago.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
Till just now, we
picked up a distress signal

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
one of their members
was transmitting.

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
I'd like to suggest
a change of plans.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
Let's meet up with them.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
We can ask them directly
what's been going on.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
From there,
we can offer our support

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
if it still feels necessary.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center
How bad's the jamming
in that area?

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
[M4] There are several spots
where communication is possible.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
But Sangvis seems to have
most of the zone blocked.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Got it. After you
find out what's going on,

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
be sure to report back to me.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50% align:center

decisions on your own.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
I'll get reinforcements ready.
You just relax.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center

This is where we
picked up the SOS signal.

should be nearby.

That's right! So you
can all come out now!

swarming here a moment ago.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center
Before stopping to call
for help, look around.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
Is it really safe?
Or is it crawling with enemies?

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
It's hard to survey an area
that's jammed with interference,

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.794 position:50% align:center
ya know! I had to rely
on my own instinct

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
to find the safest place
I could just to contact you.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
Can you explain
what's going on out here?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
[rapid gunfire]

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
[UZI grunts]

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.407 position:50% align:center
Now that was a sweet attack!

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
Save your ammunition!

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
We don't know
when help will arrive.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
We're very lucky this place
is sturdier than we thought!

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
I agree. But there are
more of them than us.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.586 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure how long
we can hold out.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV] At this point,
it's up to you, Galil.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
There are a shit-ton
of enemies out there.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
With our comms jammed,
we can't really plan.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.682 position:50% align:center
And I have no idea what's
going on at the planetarium.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
Alchemist, huh?

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
There's no way we could handle
a Ringleader on our own.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
But if we go back and report
to the commander,

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
we might not make it in time.

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
What?! No, you can't do that!
Everybody's waiting for you!

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking we should split up.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
M16, you go find an area where
you can contact the base.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
Have Commander Gentiane
deploy us some reinforcements.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
SOPII and I will
continue forward.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
And, Galil, will you lead us?

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.875 position:50% align:center
I'd be glad to!

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
I see, you want me to face
the commander's wrath?

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
It's not like that.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.841 position:50% align:center
It's just more important to
attack and distract the Sangvis

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
from Squad Negev.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
I'm messing with you.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Good luck, M4.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
Let's move.

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST]
I admit, I'm impressed.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
They've certainly got stamina.
But for how long?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center
I thought this mission
would be easier.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
But they keep multiplying
after they're shot!

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
Don't you jerks
know when to give up?!

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
This is ridiculous!

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
[TAVOR] Speaking of ridiculous
and questionable...

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
Be honest: What is your
opinion of the AR15 Doll?

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
The one who vanished?

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
You know, I actually feel
bad for that one.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50% align:center
It really wasn't her fault.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
She didn't choose to
leak the information--

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
that was Parapluie's doing.

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
I think she just ran away
because of guilt,

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
and it would take a stronger
T-Doll to stay and face it.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.603 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
Why do you ask?

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
If it was just an information
leak, then it shouldn't be

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
as dangerous as the rumors say.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.861 position:50% align:center
But still, for a military T-Doll
to make such a grave mistake,

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
would it be wise
to bring her in alive?

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV sighs]

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
AR Team was developed by 16LAB.
And because of that,

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
they can't do anything
to make 16LAB look bad.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.334 position:50% align:center
Also, their neural clouds
are a little different

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
from the average Doll's.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
When they die,
it's truly is over for them.

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center
Okay, but... Does Helian realize
what she's sacrificing?

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
She's utilizing so much
of their personnel just to

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
search for a single traitor.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
Mm...

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.350 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV gasps]

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
[snarls]

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
They're already on top of us...

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.985 position:50% align:center
Prepare to seal the corridors.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
We'll hide in
the planetarium hall.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
You're about to see how
a combat specialist fights!

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
We made live contact with
Squad Negev, but M4 and SOPII

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
went ahead to assist them.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
They should've called first.

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
[M16]
I'm sorry about that.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
Galil shared some data.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you
could look at it.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] What the--?
Where did they all come from?

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Not sure, but It's too many.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
Even with Alchemist
there as Ringleader,

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
there's no way one Sangvis
could control them all.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
So then, at least some are
being controlled remotely.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Yes.

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:58.778 position:50% align:center
And I'm looking at what
I think might be the base.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
Communication's not
being jammed right now,

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
so if you sent reinforcements,
we could probably take it.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
If nothing else, it would cause
chaos, which would make things

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.373 position:50% align:center
easier for Negev and M4.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine.
I'll send them your way.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:18.381 position:50% align:center
[M16] I appreciate it.
I'll be waiting.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Kalina, send
G36's team out there.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
My pleasure, Commander!

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center
There are too many.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.314 position:50% align:center
[UZI growling]

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.857 position:50% align:center
[clicking]

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
[UZI gasps]

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
I'm out! Does anyone
have extra ammo?!

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
That's not good.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Galil made
contact with the base yet.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
[TAVOR] I'm worried that no one
has heard from us by now.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
Do they think we've
already been wiped out?

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.458 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV grunts]

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
[M4] All we see from this
point is Sangvis firing.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:02.717 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
coming from Negev.

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?
Did we not make it here in time?

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
Don't say that! I'm sure
they're still holding out!

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
I don't think it matters.
There are so many of them.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center
I'm not certain we could help.

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.564 position:50% align:center
[GALIL groans]

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
[M16]
M4, this is M16.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
Do you read me?

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
Uh-- I'm here, M16!
But how are you contacting me?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
I was able to take out
a Sangvis base.

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
Notice any changes in
the Dolls around you?

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Uh...

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
[M4] It looks like more
than half are having

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
functionality problems.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
I can see that there are others
that have shut down entirely.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Sounds like I was right.

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:40.213 position:50% align:center
How's ol' Squad Negev doing?

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
As of right now, we don't know.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
[GALIL groans]

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.886 position:50% align:center
--[GENTIANE] Just sit tight, M4.
--[gasps] Commander!

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
I'm sending reinforcements.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.849 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't be too long.
Stay there.

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
I don't know if we can.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
And if Squad Negev
is still inside fighting,

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
then we might not have time.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
Alchemist remains
unharmed at the moment.

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center
Just trust me.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
You mustn't fight her
without strong support.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Please keep in mind--
you have no replacements.

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
[SOPII, M4 groan]

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.201 position:50% align:center
[GALIL]
Hmm. Okay, fine, we can wait.

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
Will you let us move
when they get here?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Yes, I promise.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
Then that should be enough!
We'll be fine once they show up!

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
Our captain's a combat
specialist, after all.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
Tavor and Uzi
are also very strong!

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Tch...

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
Galil...

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
[GALIL]
Hmm?

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
[M16]
What's going on, M4?

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
I don't know. I'm seeing
a light source coming from

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
the planetarium where
Squad Negev is.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
And look! It's flashing.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.230 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Flashing?

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
That's weird, can you
send me your visual data?

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Oh. Sure.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.116 position:50% align:center
[M16]
It might be morse code.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
An encoded signal?

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
[M16] It looks like Negev
Team's sending a message.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
Traditionally, soldiers
are required to learn it.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
They use it to communicate
when there are no other means.

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
"S-q-u-a-d u-n-h-u-r-t."

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
"Squad unhurt," sounds like.

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
Squad unhurt!
They're still alive!

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:13.139 position:50% align:center
[M16] Commander, over half of
the Sangvis are inoperative.

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
And Squad Negev survived.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
We can launch a pincer attack
with them and M4's team.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
This is our one chance.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm.

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Commander!

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.612 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
All right, AR Team,

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
you are permitted to link
up with Squad Negev.

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Copy!

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] However, you may
only distract the enemy.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
Maintain your distance
from Alchemist.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Roger that loud and clear!

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
G36, move to M4's
coordinates immediately.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Understood, Master. Right away.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Thank you, Commander!

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Yeah, thanks!

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
[GALIL]
I owe you for this, Commander!

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE growls]

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
What a pain...
They're all such selfish girls.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
But they are yours,
for better or worse.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.567 position:50% align:center
Do you think they saw it?

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
I have no idea.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:09.779 position:50% align:center
But we made the attempt,
and that's what counts.

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:12.407 position:50% align:center
You guys, something
happened to the Sangvis!

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
At least half of them
stopped moving!

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.161 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
[UZI] And it looks like support
fire is coming from the rear.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
Do you think those are
our reinforcements?

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:24.794 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV] I'm in charge,
so of course it all worked out.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
I hope you're grateful!

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.758 position:50% align:center
[TAVOR] Hmm! I refuse to show
any mercy today!

00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
The enemy's obsolete!

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
[GALIL grunts]

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
[SOPII grunts]

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST chuckles]

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
[GALIL]
Captain Negev!

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
I was not expecting the Sangvis
Ringleader to run scared

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
into the night that easily.

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
We should still be careful.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
You never know what
they could be planning.

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
I'm not worried about it!
M16 will be here soon enough!

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.677 position:50% align:center
Of course, with AR15 back,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
everything would
be perfect again.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
[M4 sighs]

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. I don't get it.

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50% align:center
Where could she be?
It feels like she's avoiding us!

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Because I am.

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
Do you blame me?

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
I work better alone.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
You always make
a mess of everything.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Is it really you...?

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
I don't know how many times
M16 has tried to warn you.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
If you're not careful,
you'll be ambushed.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
You never change.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:44.582 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to do?
Tell me.

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:46.418 position:50% align:center
You really don't know?

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to have
a tearful reunion.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:55.343 position:50% align:center
[M16] Commander Gentiane, M4 and
SOPII are currently missing.

00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What do you mean?

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
Did they ever make
contact with Negev?

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
[M16] No, the two of them split
off from Galil just before

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
they were reached.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
Hello? M16? Commander?

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
Can you hear me?

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
I wanted to let you know
I found SOPII.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
[M16]
That's great news.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
Were you able to contact them?

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV] No, unfortunately,
all I found was SOPII's signal.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
And I don't have anything on M4!

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
Anyway. I'll send
the coordinates now!

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
[M16]
That's close...

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
Commander, do I have
permission to head there?

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
Be careful!

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
A surge of Sangvis appeared
unexpectedly in that area!

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE sighs]
So then, Alchemist is back?

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV] Not even Alchemist
has the authority to command

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
the amount of Sangvis out here.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
[M16]
That's strange...

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
There aren't any other
enemy bases in the area.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
Their actions are so chaotic.

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:44.851 position:50% align:center
I have no idea who or what
they could possibly be after.

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
[M16] As long as they're not
after us, we should be okay,

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
and that's all that matters.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
Commander, I'm heading
toward SOPII after all.

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
G36 and team
can meet with Negev.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.321 position:50% align:center
Sound like a plan to you?

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm... I suppose.

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
Granted. Just get me
information on M4 and SOPII.

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Obviously. I will.

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] I'll search
the database for Ringleaders

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
other than Alchemist who
could be in command there.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Thank you.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.547 position:50% align:center
My goodness, things sure
have gotten complicated.

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
Yes. But... there's more.

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
More?

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Something's not right.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
It feels like...

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
Someone's hiding on
the other side of this map.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
[M4 groans]
Ah...

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Oh, good. You're awake.

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Yeah, but... who are you?

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
The one who's
come here to get you.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Get me for what?

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
Good grief. We don't
have time for this.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
I'm going to bring you
to meet the others.

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
You have friends
waiting for you.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Friends?

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
There are no candidates in my
memory module who align with

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
the definition of that word.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
I suppose that means...
I still don't have any friends.

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:04.389 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine. I guess
I'll be your first friend.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
Lucky you. Now let's go.

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
So are you... AR15?

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
What? How do you know me?

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
[M4]
I don't really.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.652 position:50% align:center
But the weapon you're
carrying matches the one

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
in my memory module.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.908 position:50% align:center
[M4] You don't appear to be
too happy about that.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:26.369 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Your observation is incorrect.

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
Being your friend
was my first order,

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.582 position:50% align:center
and part of being friendly
is demonstrating

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
a positive attitude.
Therefore, I am happy.

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center
But... if you're happy,
shouldn't you smile?

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
Then order me to do it.

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
I will follow
all orders as given.

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
So you... want me
to order you to smile?

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:50.810 position:50% align:center
If that's what you'd like me to
do, then exercise your power.

00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center
You have the authority
to command me.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center
Everything has been prepared
for your arrival here.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:58.109 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:01.071 position:50% align:center

It's time to wake up...

00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:03.281 position:50% align:center
...M4A1.

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:11.873 position:50% align:center
[M16 (fuzzy)]
SOPII! Come on, wake up!

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.166 position:50% align:center
SOPII!

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:14.584 position:50% align:center
[SOPII groans]

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
Huh? M16?

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:20.048 position:50% align:center
Wait... where'd M4 go?

00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:22.592 position:50% align:center
You're the only one
I found out here.

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:24.552 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me what happened?

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:28.264 position:50% align:center
[SOPII grunts] It feels like
we were together a moment ago.

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:30.934 position:50% align:center
Then we found AR15,
and suddenly...

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:31.935 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:32.018 --> 00:22:33.728 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, you were attacked?

00:22:33.812 --> 00:22:36.022 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what
these attackers were like?

00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:39.734 position:50% align:center
Of course I do!
But it doesn't make sense.

00:22:39.818 --> 00:22:41.319 position:50% align:center
None of it--None!

00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:44.072 position:50% align:center
And I can't understand why!

00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:46.157 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
M16, are you still with me?

00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:49.285 position:50% align:center
I am. I just linked
up with SOPII.

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:52.247 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Listen. I received
a new order from Helian.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.832 position:50% align:center
[M16 grunts]
What's the order?

00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:56.418 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
To call off the search for AR15.

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:59.129 position:50% align:center
The situation is
extremely dangerous.

00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:01.673 position:50% align:center
All Griffin T-Dolls
within the S09 area

00:23:01.756 --> 00:23:04.134 position:50% align:center
are to evacuate immediately!
