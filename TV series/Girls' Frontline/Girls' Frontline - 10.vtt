[NARRATOR] AR15 was arrested
on suspicion of leaking

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:13.763 position:50% align:center
classified information.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.808 position:50% align:center
The remaining members of
AR Team refused to believe

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
the accusations,
continuing forward

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
on their mission
to defeat Destroyer.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] These errors seemed
most prominent during

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.111 position:50% align:center
your data uploads.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can imagine
our shock at this discovery.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
There's no way that's right!

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
It has to be a mistake!

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Shut up, SOPII.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
This isn't your problem to fix.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Thanks, I know I'm a doll.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't care about it,
but I can't help but think that

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
we're all just tools.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.129 position:50% align:center
We're made to complete
missions, right?

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
This is emergency transmission.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
Calling all Griffin Dolls
and commanders.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
We've just learned that AR
Team's T-Doll, AR15,

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
escaped the interrogation
room five minutes ago.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center
If you should find her, report
to command immediately

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.937 position:50% align:center
and detain her using
whatever force necessary.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center
If needed, you have permission
to attack and destroy her.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.363 position:50% align:center
You're serious? No--

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.615 position:50% align:center
You don't think you'll
get away with this, do you?

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.867 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER]
Mm. I do, though.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.370 position:50% align:center
You can revive
as soon as you're killed.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, but you'll lose all
memory of what's happening now.

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:23.333 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER gasps]

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.668 position:50% align:center

And once that happens,

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.795 position:50% align:center
you'll be just like
my new little puppy

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:29.005 position:50% align:center
that does whatever
I tell her to!

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:33.301 position:50% align:center
What?! That's so stupid!
You're lying, you bitch!

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.552 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER]
Am I?

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.388 position:50% align:center
Surely you don't think
this is the first time

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.972 position:50% align:center
I've done this, do you?

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center
You poor, precious,
pathetic moron.

No! What's that look?!

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.944 position:50% align:center
Liar! You're supposed to help!

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center

I don't deserve this!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.578 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER] Mm. There's no reason
to cry, you little girl.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:02.539 position:50% align:center
I was just having fun.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
What? What do you mean?

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.293 position:50% align:center
Its quite simple.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center
Agent equipped you with the data
reception key, so no tears.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.632 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER]
Ah? Really? She did that?

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:15.552 position:50% align:center
Yes, she did. Which means
I can help you, too.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.554 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER]
Ah...

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER]
But if you want to get away,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.683 position:50% align:center
you need to do exactly
what I tell you to.

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.476 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER]
Um. Okay.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.061 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
SOPII, I need
Destroyer's location.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
She's still in tracking range.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
We'll catch up
to her in no time.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
Hold on. She stopped moving.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
Some kind of beacon?
Or... a flare?

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
She's under it!

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
That's exactly where
I was picking up her signal!

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
We'll need three minutes.
She's very close.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Negative.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
Why would she
advertise her location?

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make any sense.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
This is a trap.
We can't go any further.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
We can. And we will,
because it's our mission.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
Destroyer's right there!
We have to keep going.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
You're the one who said
we need to see this through.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
[explosion booms]

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
Self-destruct?

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that was
the sound of a shell exploding.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
However, the tone of
the impact wasn't familiar.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
So it probably wasn't Destroyer.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
Seems like she's desperate
to throw us off.

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
Let's just keep moving forward.

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
M4, AR Team! Do you read?

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
What's your situation?

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.184 position:50% align:center
[M4]
We read you, Commander.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
We're doing fine so far.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.688 position:50% align:center
AR Team is currently
tracking Destroyer.

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
It's possible that she may
be using a different weapon.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
But we can handle it.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
Changing weapons? I don't
have any reports about that.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why are you so
far ahead of everyone?

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER] Hmm... Come in,
Commander Gentiane.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
You need to call back
AR Team immediately!

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
I think he's overreacting.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.382 position:50% align:center
They're capable of fighting
a lone Sangvis Ringleader.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.302 position:50% align:center
But this terrain...

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
He's right!

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
AR Team, Cease your pursuit
and escape as fast as you can!

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50% align:center
We can't now!
Not when Destroyer is so close!

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
She's not just
using a new weapon.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
That's the artillery
that attacked our base!

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
And now it's aimed right at you!

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER gasps]

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
Hey! Dreamer! Do you even
know how to use that thing?!

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
It landed right next to me!

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
That was a test round.

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
Minimal payload,
so you weren't in any danger.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
Calculations are complete.
Adjustments complete, too.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
We're all good to go.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.468 position:50% align:center
Now, let's see... AR Team
should be right around here.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
That's my best guess, anyway.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50% align:center
I'll launch everything I've got
and watch the fireworks

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center
go "boom"!

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center

Are you completely insane?!

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
Agent straight up said
we're not to kill M4!

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
Oh, please. They're giving me
the chance to play with Jupiter.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna enjoy myself.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
And besides, It's going
to take a lot more than

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.973 position:50% align:center
a few artillery blasts
to kill AR Team.

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
If nothing else, it'll be easier
for us to bring them back

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
if they're missing
a few limbs, right?

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
AR Team, listen.
Destroyer is a decoy.

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
It's a trap. The Sangvis
have lured you to

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
their artillery range.
You must get out of there now!

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
Uh. Copy that!

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
Detecting an active
Sangvis scan!

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
If it picks up AR Team,
there's no way they'll escape!

[KRYUGER]
Attention all Doll commanders!

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
I'm changing your
mission objectives!

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
Get AR Team out of there.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
And do so by
any means necessary!

that might be our allies

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50% align:center
heading toward us!

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
Don't lose focus now!
You gotta keep moving!

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center

Come in, Harpoon Team.

to coordinates M32Y8.

Roger.

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
Longsword, we need you
to head to M36Y7.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
We didn't discuss the prospect
of Sangvis directing

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
all firepower toward AR Team.
Any clue what's going on?

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.973 position:50% align:center
None here. But we have orders
not to let them be found.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
Commander Shi Jun,
what are you waiting for?

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
Move your units towards AR Team.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN] Mm. If we're trying
to blur the Sangvis scanning,

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
make sure their
routes intersect.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
[G36] Fishing Net is
approaching the coordinates.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.613 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:55.869 position:50% align:center

to position M36Y9, open fire!

Roger!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
Oh, gross, s'that Griffin?

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
Guess what?
The greasy Griffins are here.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
Ah? Yeah, pretty sure
that's not AR Team.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
I can't be bothered
with that trash right now.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.514 position:50% align:center
I won't be able to handle it
if they get any closer!

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER sighs]
Why are you such a pain?

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll have to
take them all out.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER] Can you at least get
yourself to a safe distance?

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Like I have a choice!

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:44.459 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps] Commander!
They just hit another unit!

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.753 position:50% align:center
They must be targeting
a different direction!

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
Move out! And don't stop!

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Run as fast as
you can into that valley!

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
Ah. Well, that was fun.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
I like having new toys
to play with.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50% align:center
I wonder if I let AR Team escape
while I was distracted.

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER]
Doesn't matter.

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
Now move, Destroyer.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.713 position:50% align:center
You've got about ten minutes
to get out of there safely.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER]
Uh. Okay.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
But this won't happen again.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
I should have let you die after
you let your comms get hacked.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER grunts] Wait a sec.
My friggin' comms got hacked?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
--For real?
--[DREAMER sighs]

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
At what point did you find me?

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.773 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER] She who rules the sky
rules everything beneath it.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
You're wandering around
without thermal camo.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
Don't you think that'd
make you stand out a little?

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Tch. Then clearly
disguising my signal

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
wasn't enough.

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER] This has been your
goal the entire time, hasn't it?

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
While I was focusing
on obliterating

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
your little friends,
you took that opportunity

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
to sneak closer to her.

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Maybe you're not as
much of a nutjob as Destroyer

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
seems to think you are.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
And you're not quite as stony
as the data reports you to be.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it took courage
to come here on your own

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
instead of running
away with the others.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Hmph. And now
that you've found me,

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
I suppose the artillery
shell will be arriving

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
in the next ten seconds.

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
That'd be boring! I can
still make good use of you.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
Good news, AR15.
You've been chosen.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER] What did you think
of the power we gave you?

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center
Did you enjoy it?

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
How do you have the authority
to command Sangvis?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
I should've known.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
You were behind it
the entire time!

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.751 position:50% align:center
Aw, is that a frown I see?

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
What I don't understand
is why you didn't

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.171 position:50% align:center
tell your team earlier.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
You don't think
they should've known

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
you were leaking information?

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
Of course if you had, then that
mouthy idiot wouldn't have been

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
able to find the
Griffin base for us.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
Wait. So this whole time
you were just using me?!

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
I'm fascinated.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
Tell me something, AR15.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
You're a Doll,
yet you're here disobeying

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
your commander's orders.
I'd love to know why.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
You used me to leak information.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
And that put every one
of my friends in danger.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
You're gonna pay...

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
Painfully and very slow.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
Have you not been programmed
to answer questions right?

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
Well, congratulations on all
the knowledge you've gained.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
Would you like one last futile
attempt to change the plan?

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps your final
pathetic struggle can make

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
everything all better.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
Anything's possible.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Trust me, Dreamer. I'm aware.

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
And I won't leave here
without a solution.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
I'll gladly suffer for them!

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER chuckles]

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
[AR15] I can't wait
to bring my boot down

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
on your contemptuous face
and reveal every single one

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
of your plans!

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
I'm done playing games.
It's over, Sangvis!

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Got an update?

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.673 position:50% align:center
Looks like the Neural Cloud
backups have all been installed.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] They're using the same
bodies they were before,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center
so they'll be easy to identify.

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
But they're all gonna need
individual adjustments.

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.693 position:50% align:center
Finally. I understand
why the boss named

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
the T-Dolls after guns--
after tools that kill.

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Because if he used human names,

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
you'd feel guilty every time
one was hurt and destroyed.

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] But they're machines.
And what's worse is...

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Helian!

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
Be honest. If AR Team
had withdrawn quickly...

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
...would things have
been different?

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
Would they have escaped
Sangvis artillery range?

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
Why was it so easy for Kryuger
to use the other units

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
as decoys? What's the point
of sacrificing them?

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
How does that help?

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
Be honest, Commander.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
Because I've read
your mission logs.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
You care rather deeply
for the T-Dolls, don't you?

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
If you're not satisfied with
how the mission turned out,

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
I understand that.

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
But there's one thing
I advise you to keep in mind:

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
AR Team is an experiment created
by IOP's research unit, 16LAB.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
The structure of their minds
is completely different

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
from that of other T-Dolls.
They have emotions.

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.261 position:50% align:center
They have thoughts.

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
That's what makes their mental
efficiency several times

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
greater than other models.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
I know you've been told
at least that much, right?

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
With that, they can't make
backups of their Neural Clouds.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
Once they're destroyed,
they start from scratch.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE whimpers]

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
They're phenomenal,
and the most highly advanced

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
T-Dolls Griffin has.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
For a PMC that uses dolls
as its main fighting force,

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
they're considered to be
our most valuable asset.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:18.710 position:50% align:center
That's why they must
be kept operational,

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
even if it means others must
be sacrificed to protect them.

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
Does that answer your question?

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.968 position:50% align:center
You're relatively
new to this post,

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:30.096 position:50% align:center
but you're a talented
Doll commander.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.264 position:50% align:center
And it's obvious
that you've built

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
a solid working
relationship with AR Team.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
For those reasons,
I don't see why you wouldn't get

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
the opportunity to
command them again,

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
but I would suggest that
you be very careful next time.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
AR Team...

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
I wonder what
they're doing right now.

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
Where is all this
firepower coming from?

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
The mission report said Sangvis
retreated, but now I don't know.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
Helian said all we had to do
was patrol the area

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
from our last fight--
there wasn't anything more.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
And on top of that,
when it was over,

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:17.018 position:50% align:center
we'd be allowed to return
to Gentiane's base.

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
You really do like that
commander, don't you?

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
[SOPII snarls]
Damn it!

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
Is that a new Sangvis?

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what they are!
I've never seen them before!

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
[M16]
They're not moving like Sangvis.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
Maybe they're human?

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.960 position:50% align:center
But this is a yellow area!

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
I don't think humans could move
that well in that equipment.

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
But--

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
We've got permission
to fire if we need to.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
That's gonna be quite
a mess if we end up

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
killing a person, though.

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center

Griffin-controlled territory.

and bandits is part of our job.

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
We're helping.

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
[M4] I've shared 14 plans
with you that will not

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
result in their deaths.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center

and then stay flexible.

on territory held by

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
a private military contractor.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
This is your final warning!
Hands up, now!

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
We have permission to fire!

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
[MAN 10B]
Gah!

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER] They weren't even
using their full strength.

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
But overall, not a bad job.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
I was impressed with
the innovative way

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
you got us to disarm.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
The warning needs work, though.
It was a little soft.

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
I'm serious! I will open fire!

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:55.909 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER]
I wouldn't advise it.

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
You don't have
the right to fire at me.

00:17:58.912 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps]

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center
Commander Kryuger! Forgive me!

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here, sir?

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
And why aren't you
using your IFF?

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
Especially when you know
how extremely dangerous

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
our territory is.

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps] Are they all
human contractors...?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
We have our own mission
to complete here.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, your mission is over.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
Standby and guard
the transport crew.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
We're a special operations team,
not security guards, thank you!

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
Take a breath. They all get it.

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
What the hell is going on?

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
I thought refusing our request
to search for AR15

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center
was bad enough,

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:40.328 position:50% align:center
but now you've got
us doin' grunt work?

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
SOPII, I have an answer for you.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
You wanted to know why
we had emotion modules

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
when we're just tools used
to complete missions.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
Emotions are a deficiency.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
Humans wanted us to have
the same defect that they have.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
So I wouldn't expect any
kind of sympathy from them.

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
Especially right now.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you mean well,

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
but none of that
makes any sense to me.

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:07.230 position:50% align:center
I was thinking the same thing,
and I'm the one who said it!

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess that's
AI humor for you.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
[M4] However... we could take
this as a positive sign.

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
If Kryuger's here, then Griffin
hasn't given up on AR15.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
And we're not going to either.

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
If we focus and
believe in each other,

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
I know we'll meet again someday.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
[SOPII growls]

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
And that concludes the
situation report from AR Team.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
As for the technology you and
the troops recovered during

00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
your personal mission, it turns
out, some of those materials

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
matched ones made in
Sangvis Ferri facilities.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
Specifically, they correspond
to the Armored T-Doll Aegis

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
and Tactical Mechanized
Infantry Nemeum.

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
It's been determined that
the remainder don't match

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
any known models.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER sighs]
Unknown weapons.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER] And does that
also go for the artillery

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
that attacked our base?

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
I believe so, unfortunately.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
Kryuger, do you know
what this means?

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
It means the Sangvis
are evolving.

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
They sure know how to exceed
expectations, don't they?

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER]
Let's consider our intel.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
Parapluie is a virus meant
to target the T-Dolls,

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
and if the Sangvis are
determined to break the chain,

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
the most plausible way
to do that

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
would be by
infecting our Dolls.

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
Right now, it looks like they
intend to do everything they can

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
to wipe out Griffin.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
Also... the Dolls
Aegis and Nemeum...

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
They were both manufactured
in the same Sangvis factory

00:20:57.632 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
that became our target
during that mission.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER]
We have to find AR15.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
She's the key that
connects all these clues.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
She knows about Parapluie.

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
We have to get it
out of her mind.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter what
kind of state she's in.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:17.318 position:50% align:center
We need to locate her
before the Sangvis!

00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
You haven't quite
thought this through.

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
If we were to do that, we could
in no way ensure her safety.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER sighs]

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
You should know, I don't exactly
enjoy endangering the Dolls.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.207 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful to them for
bearing the responsibility

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
of this mess in
humanity's place.

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
It seems so genuine.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
I can understand why some
commanders treat them

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
like humans.

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.347 position:50% align:center
But whether they're our
weapons or our friends,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.849 position:50% align:center
once they've fallen
into enemy hands,

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
we still have
a hard decision to make.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
Do we take them out ourselves,
or watch helplessly

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.983 position:50% align:center
as they drag us all
into the pits of Hell?

00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:58.485 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:21:58.568 --> 00:22:02.238 position:50% align:center
I'll arrange for an inventory
check and purchase orders.

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:03.865 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
Please excuse me.

[KRYUGER sighs]

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:22.676 position:50% align:center
[AR15] This is it,
my highest-priority order.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:27.097 position:50% align:center
Both as a member of AR Team,
and as a Tactical Doll.

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:31.267 position:50% align:center
Even if my home has
been taken away forever,

00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:34.104 position:50% align:center
I can't forget the first
people to accept me,

00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:36.815 position:50% align:center
and I will never betray them.

00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:40.443 position:50% align:center
After all, that is
the entire reason I exist.

00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:42.779 position:50% align:center
The one fate I was given.

00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:57.585 position:50% align:center
