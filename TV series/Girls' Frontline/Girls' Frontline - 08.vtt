00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:13.054 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Ringleader Intruder
attempted to lay a careful trap

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:16.057 position:50% align:center
to buy the Sangvis more time.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
Gentiane, with help from M16,
who'd been working alone,

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
was able to put a stop
to Intruder's efforts.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER] I've so been
looking forward to it.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.319 position:50% align:center
At least try to
make it entertaining.

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
This is all fake data!

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
Commander, copy?

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.324 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Therefore,
your mission has changed from

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
distracting the enemy
to taking down this

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
Ringleader known as Intruder--
effective immediately.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER]
Isn't this splendid?

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.249 position:50% align:center
I didn't think
I'd see you so soon,

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:43.752 position:50% align:center
but what a lovely surprise.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
[M16] It is, and I'm
the one bringing the house down.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.049 position:50% align:center
You're okay!

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
Everybody's together again.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center
It's nice being back to normal.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
[M4] Don't you know how
much I worried about you...?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
You could, I dunno,
at least be a little bit happy.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center
I'm back now for good.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.023 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Welcome back...

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
This is the spot.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.119 position:50% align:center
M4, can you confirm
the coordinates?

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
M4!

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.747 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Right! I'm here!

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
Confirming now.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, since M16 came back,
you seem pretty off.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.546 position:50% align:center
No! I'm totally fine!

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
You can't afford to be this
spacey when we're on a mission.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center
Now, what's going on?

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's complicated.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.473 position:50% align:center
Being back here and
seeing this place again.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.600 position:50% align:center
[M16]
You talking about Safehouse 3?

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.561 position:50% align:center
Probably the most trouble
we've ever gotten into.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.189 position:50% align:center
They nearly got every one of us.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
I think that must be what's
been weighing me down.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.027 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't forget, you were
the one who noticed that

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.988 position:50% align:center
the coordinates in the mission
log had been changed.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.658 position:50% align:center
And you're the one who
wanted to investigate it.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
You really need to own that.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.495 position:50% align:center
I understand that now.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.289 position:50% align:center
I just never thought
we would be back.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:04.791 position:50% align:center
Don't dwell on it.

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:08.211 position:50% align:center
The commander's forces will
push ahead and clear a path.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
Even if we do run
into Agent again,

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.966 position:50% align:center
we're more prepared
that we were last time.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.636 position:50% align:center
It's been months, and we've
had no sign of her anywhere.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.555 position:50% align:center
What could she be planning?

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.974 position:50% align:center
Where has she been
hiding all this time?

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.810 position:50% align:center
And now... I keep
thinking about Intruder

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.770 position:50% align:center
and what she meant
about the "real show."

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Quit worrying about that stuff!

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.649 position:50% align:center
As soon as were given the word,
I'm locked and loaded

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50% align:center
and ready to kick
some Sangvis butt!

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
That's enough talking.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
We can't take any chances.
Time to get a move on.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.591 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Huh...

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
There, in the rubble!

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
Storage, like we thought?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
It is. An old model, though.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
Use an external device
to check it.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
You can never be too careful--
It could be rigged.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Mm.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:53.585 position:50% align:center
[RECORDING 8A]
They are in your house.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:56.838 position:50% align:center
They are in your car.

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
They are in the skies.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
Now, they are coming for you.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.222 position:50% align:center
It's just that eerie voice?
The same as before.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.266 position:50% align:center
[SOPII] Sounds like
a buncha gibberish to me.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.226 position:50% align:center
They're in your house
and in your car.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
In the skies, coming for you.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.897 position:50% align:center
It sounds creepy as heck,
I'll give them that much,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
but what's it mean?
I don't get it at all.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
[M16]
You're not supposed to.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
It's just a code, you dummy.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
The question is,
what intel can we get from

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
analyzing the audio file?

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
A video file?

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Yep.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
After a week of deciphering and
headaches, this is all I got.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
What's on it?

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Footage of AR15 at Safehouse 3,

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
which I hadn't seen because
it wasn't accessible

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
with my clearance.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
And the thing is, this is a
full recording of everything

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
AR Team did, and some of these
angles were shot with drones.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
Which doesn't match the info
we were given about them

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
being out there alone.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
But still, if the mission they
were on was that important,

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
it makes no sense that there
wasn't a commander present.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
Unless there was a commander
and they were hiding themselves

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
for some reason.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
Whoever it was would have known
that M4 would discover

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
the altered coordinates, and,
in the end, find this old drive

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
containing the recording.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
This whole entire plan was
built on the assumption that AR

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.378 position:50% align:center
would be able to break
through the encirclement.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
Whoever this person is,
knows the AR Team intimately.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
They know their strengths
and trust their capabilities.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.303 position:50% align:center
And if that's the case,
why would this memory be erased

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
from their minds?

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
Why would their mystery
commander abandon them?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.731 position:50% align:center
Dolls... Humans...

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
None of it makes any sense.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Hmm...

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
Agh! Kalina! What the hell?!

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
You needed a pick-me-up, and
my hand has a mind of its own!

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that!

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
Who knows. I'm not sure what
AR Team is thinking, either,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
but consider their actions.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
Why are they behaving
the way they are?

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm. Good point.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
This isn't the way AIs are
supposed to behave.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
I feel it's important
to point out:

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
they're the ones who made it
possible for you to see this.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty clear sign
of their trust in you,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.430 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] That seems to have been
our mystery friend's intention.

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
They wanted the footage
in trusted hands.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.273 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Trust?

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
I've heard that word.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
Everything good
has left this world,

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
and I thought trust had
gone out the door with it, too.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
[groans]
Just remembered.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
I've got another business trip.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
You talking about that
command summons?

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
You know that AR Team
will be there too, right?

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
They're actually being
sent out ahead of you.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.796 position:50% align:center
What? Why was I not informed?

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
You can thank Persica for that.
You remember her?

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
That cheery bundle of joy?

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Stop it!
Never say that name!

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
Every time I get involved with
her, my work multiplies!

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.527 position:50% align:center
She was not fun then.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.406 position:50% align:center
Before you came back to us, M4
was a big ol' stick in the mud.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.282 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's not true!

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
I think...

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
I see. You weren't even
a little bit worried.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
I could cry.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no, no!
That's not what I meant!

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Notice any difference in me?

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.171 position:50% align:center
Nope! Same old, same old!

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Really.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
Oh no! Do I detect the
"tone of hurt feelings"?

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, thank you.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Huh?

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Huh?

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 8A] You have reached
the reception bay.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
Well, hey! Commander Gentiane!

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry?

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
I am commander of Base 737!

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50% align:center
Feodor Kamolov!

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
It was a pleasure to fight
alongside you the other day.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
You were brave beyond measure!

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
I'm honored. Your team was brave
as well, Comrade Kamolov.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
I'm Shi Jun.

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
It's great to finally
meet you in the flesh.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
And might I just add that you
are a very attractive woman.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]
Okay...

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
So, why where the two
of you summoned here?

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
Well, we don't have many
details, to be honest.

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
All we were told was to
arrive with limited personnel

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
to this base, for
a conference, I guess.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
Checks out, same
as me, I guess.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:51.883 position:50% align:center
Huh?! What are you
guys doing here?

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
We couldn't have completed
that mission without you!

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your service!

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
[PPK]
Hmm. My, what a surprise.

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
I'm simply delighted that you
remember me, commander dearest.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.854 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Huh? Of course I remember, PPK!

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
And you as well, Super SASS!

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
You were the heroes
of the mission.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
I could never forget you!

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
Most commanders like to complain
about how limited we are,

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
or that we're incompetent
and need to learn

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
some new abilities.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
Perhaps your palate is slightly
more refined than theirs.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I think you
lost me on that last part.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
[elevator dings]

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
Welcome to Griffin's
Top Secret base.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
Thank you all
for being so punctual.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
Your timely presence
is appreciated.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
Kryuger is still occupied
with another matter.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50% align:center
In his stead, I would
like to discuss why

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
you've been summoned.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
Though we don't have
much intel on the subject,

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
we do know that the Sangvis
have started an operation

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
codenamed Parapluie.

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
Based on the frequency
of recent Sangvis activity,

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
we can't say for sure how
or when this operation

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
will affect us, but we
are considering this

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
a serious threat.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
Which is why we've selected
a few commanders to come here

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.870 position:50% align:center
to the Top Secret
Base and discuss

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.164 position:50% align:center
our plan of action.

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
You chose us.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
So does that mean we're
basically the cream of the crop?

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
You're free to
interpret it that way.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
While Kryuger finishes
official business,

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
I encourage you to use
the command room to practice.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
We have state-of-the-art
next-gen Dolls at your disposal.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
Feel free to use them to test
your might as a commander,

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
which will also help us keep
our database up to date.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
If you find a Doll you like,
you may request them.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.273 position:50% align:center
That's all. Dismissed.

such a prospect?!

[If I wanted to deal
with this kinda crap,

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have walked
away from the army.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
And if it weren't for
an error in the information,

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
I would've just pretended I
never saw the Parapluie intel.

you're the genius who sent

how many hours of my life

you in action!

to talk to them a bit

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center

[KAWASAKI]
"Talk to them"?

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Like, I found
out that one Doll

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
used to be an actress.

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.031 position:50% align:center
So I knew she would
be skilled and versatile.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
And this Doll used
to be a security guard.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
Seemed like a good idea
to put her in

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
an active defense formation.
It worked out great.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center

ear using similar principles.

you a little bit about it.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
into the upper levels!

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] How did the warning
system miss an entire army?

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
When they deployed their
jammers, it destabilized

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
all communications,
including our scanners!

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
Luckily, our internal comms
channels are operational.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:22.107 position:50% align:center
This could have been a whole
lot worse if those went down.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.317 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Didn't know it
could get worse than this.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Um... Commander Kawasaki?

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
You've advanced too far!

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
I didn't exactly have
a choice in the matter!

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
Their frontline has
progressed rapidly!

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Copy.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
[KAWASAKI]
We're getting steamrolled.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
There's no way we're gonna last!
There are too many of them.

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
These Sangvis are relentless!

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
What's more, they're using
heavy weapons that can

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
destroy the resin!

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
I repeat, the plan to use
the phenolic resin won't work!

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.561 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Continue using
it on the building.

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
It'll at least slow 'em down
and buy us some time!

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
We're gonna make it work!

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
All units, fall back
to the training grounds!

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
Loading complete.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
Resin is now
available for active use.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
Copy that--falling back now.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
Make sure we have cover.

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
Retreat!

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
Fall back! Hurry!

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.167 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] We can buy some time,
but there's not a lot we can do

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
to reduce their numbers.

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
Are there any other teams we can
call on for help at this point?

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Commander Gentiane!

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
Commander, do you read me?!

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
Huh? M4!

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
Excellent! We finally
got through!

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What's AR Team's status?

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
[M4] There're still enemies
everywhere outside!

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
We're trying to figure out
how evade detection

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
and drop into the base.

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
Outside? Hold on--
stay right there.

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
Do not come back to this base!

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
Commander?

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Kryuger, Listen to me.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
I need permission to send
all the Dolls outside to find

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
and destroy the Sangvis base!

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER] Hmm. We're in
a lockdown and don't have

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
the spare manpower to
command those Dolls.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
But AR Team is equipped
to use command modules.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
Are you suggesting
we let them lead?

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
Yes, I am.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER] You're aware that the
Sangvis have greatly diminished

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
our communications capabilities.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
We will have no means of
controlling or issuing commands

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
to AR Team when they get far
enough away from the base.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
Do you fully understand the risk
you're asking me to take?

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] The gravity
is not lost on me, sir,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
but what other choices
do we have here?

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
Asking them to come back
will only delay our deaths,

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
and you know that these enemies
are never going to relent.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
And you think they possess
the ability to carry this out?

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
I've seen what AR Team
is capable of.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
I believe they can do this.
I trust them with my life!

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER]
Hmm. Out on the battlefield,

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
relying too much on trust and
raw emotion can get you killed.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
And then sometimes, you've gotta
listen to that gut instinct.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
You have my permission
to make the call, rookie.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
Now do it!

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
AR Team, your new
orders are as follows.

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
Devote every ounce of energy
to destroying the Sangvis base!

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
Do you copy?

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
But Commander--

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
M4!

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:19.075 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
You've got it.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Looks like
it's just us and them.

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
If the enemy wants to fight
on the training grounds,

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:32.130 position:50% align:center
let's train!

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Hmm!

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
Our fates are now in the
hands of pseudo-sentient Dolls?

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
Are you insane?

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Oh, now you decide to chime in.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center
Hey, if you have a better plan,
you need to start talking.

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN sighs]

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
I...

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
No, I don't.

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
Shit...

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
[VECTOR] AR Team has just
been given command priority.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
We're ready to leave
at a moments notice,

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
so tell us the plan.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
[M4] We need to cover
as much ground as possible.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
We'll split into
three teams and fan out.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
Try to avoid engaging
the enemy.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
[VECTOR]
Are we gonna find it?

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
There's too much
ground to cover.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Over there.

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Vector EX3V25.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
I performed a
reconnaissance scan earlier.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
Ninety percent of the Sangvis
army came from that direction.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
I bet if we travel toward there,

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
we'll find what
we're looking for.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.394 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] No wonder
they call you all "elite."

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
You guys are freakin' quick.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
We should probably hurry, then.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
AR Team, you guys lead the way.
We'll follow right behind ya.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
[AR15 grunts]

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
Thank you for that.
Great thinking.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
You honed in on the
possible location so fast.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
Can we finish this?

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
I'd like to be done
as soon as possible.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:49.666 position:50% align:center
No time for small talk.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] New Sangvis
approaching from heading 3-0-0.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
Take care of them, AUG!

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
You got it, boss.

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.598 position:50% align:center
[KAWASAKI]
What's taking AR Team so long?!

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] I would find out if
ranged comms weren't jammed!

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.855 position:50% align:center
We'll know they succeeded
when the Sangvis stop moving!

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
Got a plan in case they don't?

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to rush you,
but we're dyin' here--

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
backed against a wall!

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.072 position:50% align:center
[KAMOLOV] My comrades,
it will be an honor

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
to die alongside you,
for Griffin team!

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Please shut up!

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Target location reached.

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
Check it out.
Down there, by the building!

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:33.001 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Whoa, so many of'em!

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this is most definitely
their headquarters!

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
[M4]
The commander was right.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
If we had gone back instead
of destroying this base,

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
they would have sent all these
Sangvis until we were destroyed.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
Now what? There's so many,
but we have to fight.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha! You guys hang back--
I'll take'em all out!

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis were so
focused on attacking us

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:59.652 position:50% align:center
that they got sloppy--
left several security holes.

00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:02.781 position:50% align:center
I shared the locations
of all remaining enemies.

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Look, there's our opening!

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:07.410 position:50% align:center
[SOPII] Huh. When you're
right, you're right!

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:09.245 position:50% align:center
[M4]
AR Team, with me!

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:12.916 position:50% align:center
Everyone else,
cover this entrance.

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:14.709 position:50% align:center
If we're not back
in five minutes,

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:17.545 position:50% align:center
then blow up
the entire building.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.177 position:50% align:center
[M4] Look at that
concentration of comms...

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.471 position:50% align:center
[giggles]
This is going so well!

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:28.640 position:50% align:center
Where do you find
the time to do all this?

00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:30.725 position:50% align:center
You have plenty of time for
recon when you're not being

00:22:30.809 --> 00:22:34.062 position:50% align:center
a silly blabbermouth.

00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:35.647 position:50% align:center
We're going in.

00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:47.450 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, it's just
like last time!

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:48.618 position:50% align:center
Be quiet!

00:22:48.702 --> 00:22:51.287 position:50% align:center
Keep your head on a swivel!

00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:52.789 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Nothing unusual.

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:54.499 position:50% align:center
All clear.

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:56.418 position:50% align:center
Look at these footsteps.

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:59.671 position:50% align:center
I bet the Ringleader escaped
before we could fight her.

00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:03.383 position:50% align:center
[GIRL] I did leave--
three minutes ago, to be exact.

00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:10.557 position:50% align:center
Hello there, ladies.
You can call me Destroyer.

00:24:42.982 --> 00:24:46.319 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Episode 9:
