00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.636 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Though she had
to proceed on her own,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
M4A1 was determined to
complete her mission.

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
After defeating
a Sangvis High-End Model,

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
she was taken in
by Griffin forces.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] This is M4A1.
She's a Doll with 16LAB.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What's that?

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] An organization that
provides technology to Griffin.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
I'm here for a specific Doll.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
Answer my questions,
and I'll let you go.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
Knock, knock...

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.918 position:50% align:center
...M4A1.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
Sure, you're safe with Griffin,
but I wonder what's happening

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
to your little friends
right now?

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
[M4 snarls]

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
Talking about my friends like
that was a huge mistake.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's go, M4A1.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
The commander's waiting.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.851 position:50% align:center
The commander...

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
M16... AR15, SOPII.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center
I did it.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.913 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Ah. It's good to see
you're feeling better.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.539 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Who are you?

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:24.542 position:50% align:center
My name is Kalina.
I'm the logistics officer.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center
[M4]
So then, not the commander...

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.760 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Seems like you took
some pretty hard hits out there.

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:38.264 position:50% align:center
Good thing you're one of those
fancy 16LAB Elite Dolls, huh?

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.017 position:50% align:center
You girls have
an impressive recovery rate.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.607 position:50% align:center
Um, would it be possible to talk
to your commander for a minute?

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.109 position:50% align:center
Figures you would ask now.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:50.735 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. She's out
on a mission

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.153 position:50% align:center
to intercept the Sangvis.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.948 position:50% align:center
They've been spotted
in the area.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.408 position:50% align:center
[M4]
I thought so.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.411 position:50% align:center
Sangvis are still
searching for AR Team.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:00.745 position:50% align:center
I need to go save them.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.415 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Uh... But I doubt
she'll be gone too long.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
I'll have her find you
when she arrives.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.128 position:50% align:center
[M4] No, uh, just let me
know when she's back.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.462 position:50% align:center
I'll go find her.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:10.797 position:50% align:center
That works, too.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.091 position:50% align:center
Well, I hope I'll be in touch
sooner than later.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:14.801 position:50% align:center
Rest up, 'kay?

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.637 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] If you
need anything before then,

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.514 position:50% align:center
feel free to give me a call!

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
[M4]
AR Team, this is M4A1.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
Can anyone hear me?
Please come in.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
AR Team, this is M4A1.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
Can anyone hear me?
Please come in.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
AR Team, this is M4A1.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
Can anyone hear me?
Please come in.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.998 position:50% align:center
AR Team, this is M4A1.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
Can anyone hear me?
Please come in.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
AR Team, this is M4A1.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
Can anyone hear me?
Please come in.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
[M4] I've been sending
that message out

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
for almost two hours now...

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
...but no one responds...

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
[M16]
M4A1.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps]
M16, is that you?

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
[M16] Excellent timing.
I'm in a good location.

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
I actually have connection here.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
[M4 sighs]
Great to hear your voice.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me your status?

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
[M16]
I'm looking right at Sangvis.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
They can't detect me, though,
gonna switch to silent mode

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
and blindside them.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'll make this fast.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell you
I've been rescued.

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
I'm currently recovering
at a forward base.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
I'm waiting on the commander,

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
but I think she's putting
together a new rescue operation.

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
Are you on your own?

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
[M16] I got separated from
the others while holding off

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
the enemies to the rear.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
The last time I talked to them,
they were safe, but...

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm fine. Trust me.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
I need your help finding
AR15 and SOPII.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
Please take care of yourself.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
[M16] Stop worrying.
We'll see each other again.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
--[receiver clicks]
--Ah.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
That's just like her.
Always gotta be tough as nails.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.
I'm glad she's safe.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.788 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
M4, do you read?

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps]

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
This is AR15. Come in.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
I'm picking up
a signal from you.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
Its strength looks like you've
arrived at a base somewhere.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
[M4] Yes, I'm fine.
Please tell me you're safe.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
She's fine, M4!
Don't you care about me?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
[M4]
SOPII! Of course!

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
You're with her?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.935 position:50% align:center
Yep! We found each other
and we're perfectly perfect-y!

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
Such a relief.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
M16 is still on the move.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
So I'll come
to get you two first.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
We'll be waiting!

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.488 position:50% align:center
[M4] I received the coordinates
you just sent.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
Is this your current location?

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
[AR15 gasps]
Yes, it is.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center
Come quick as you can. Over.

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
I wasn't done talking to her!

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[receiver clicks]

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]
What was that?

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
[M4] At least
we finally made contact.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
Now all I have left to do is
wait for the rescue operation.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
[M4]
It seems massive.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
Guess I never thought about
what it was like inside.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
[MP5 panting]

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Huh...?
[gasps]

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, whoops. I'm so sorry!
I didn't see you there.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. I wasn't
paying attention.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
Wow! I can't believe it!

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
Are you the famous
Elite Doll, M4?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
Guess what they said about
your recovery time was true!

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.460 position:50% align:center
Uh, what?

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.671 position:50% align:center
[MG3] I can explain.
This is T-Doll MP5.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.798 position:50% align:center
She may look young,
but she found the disk

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.508 position:50% align:center
that led us to you.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
Hi. I'm MG3.
It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
Your recovery time
is impressive.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
You had us fooled!

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
When we first found you,
we were thinking we'd have

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
to back you up from
your mental model.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
Um, do you think you could help
me find the commander here?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
Sure. Funny you
should say that--

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
we're just on our
way to see her now.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Eh...?!

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
[MG3] Well then, I say we
make it a party--let's go!

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
[DOLLS]
Commander! We're here!

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
[G36] Time to wake up, Master.
The meeting's about to start.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
That means getting out of bed.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Come on, G36!
I was up all night on a mission

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
and I'm too tired to
command you right now!

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
Give me back my blanket!

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
Not happening.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.518 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm? A visitor?

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Hello, I'm Gentiane,
the current commander here.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
The one behind
Operation Sugar Cube.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
[M4] I feel like...
I've seen her before.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Wait a minute,
you're M4, aren't you?

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center
I told you to stay
in the repair room.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:28.383 position:50% align:center
Yes. I know. But I really
need to talk to you.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
You realize I can read
your logs, don't you?

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.180 position:50% align:center
There are three others on your
team, and they're not back yet.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
You desperately need
our help to rescue them.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
Am I getting warm?

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
Yes, you are.

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
I impress myself sometimes.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
Helian and Persica
told me about you.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
So if this is as urgent
as you profess,

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need you to tell me
everything you know.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
And that includes the
coordinates you received

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
by secretly hacking
the base's comms system.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
Smart move, by the way.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Listen up, team.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
Our mission here is
to wipe out the Sangvis

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
in this particular area so
that we can safely rescue

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50% align:center
the nearby members
of AR Team.

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
Once we land,
activate your dummies.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
Then immediately
split into your units.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Unit 1 will
follow heading 330.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.151 position:50% align:center
Unit 2, heading 270.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
Unit 3, heading 300.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
Be sure to always maintain
visual distance on each other.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
[G36] Commander, Sangvis have
been spotted 1,000 meters ahead.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
Heading 328. Altitude 20.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
So that's where they are.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.974 position:50% align:center
That's how they were able
to hide from our scans.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
Head to the river and follow it.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
They won't be able to see you.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
You can determine their
positions from there.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
Roger that!

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
Commander, this should be easy.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
Our firepower
is more than enough.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be better
if we attacked directly?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.576 position:50% align:center
We need to hurry if we--

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
--[GENTIANE] M4!
--[gasps]

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.206 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
I've given my orders.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Unit 2,
you'll need to change direction

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.546 position:50% align:center
and head toward 225.
Be sure to avoid urban areas.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
Pay close attention
to your surroundings

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
while hunting Sangvis.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.968 position:50% align:center
--'Kay!
--Roger!

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] M1919,
I need you to leave Unit 3

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
and join up with Unit 2.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
Copy!

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] As for the new Unit 3
and the rest of you...

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
...go out there
and kick some ass!

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
Make those Sangvis come to you!

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
They're currently in the
building at 320.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
Remember to head to the bridge
over the river, understood?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
--[MP-446] Yep!
--[P7, C96] Roger!

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
[MP-446]
Greetings, enemies!

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center
Catch us if you can,
you filthy animals!

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
[P7]
Missed me! Missed me!

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
Hey, over here!

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
[C96 giggles]

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
[MP-446 giggles]
Hey! Dummies!

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.065 position:50% align:center
[MP-446 chuckles]

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
Nice work! Keep going!
You're almost to the bridge!

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Fire!

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] We can't let them
get back into the building.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
AR and SMG squads,
that's your cue!

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Open fire and finish them off.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] I realize that
was probably hard on you.

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
Elite Dolls aren't used to
fighting this way, I know.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well...

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] The thing is...
most of Griffin's weapons

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
are antiques and the T-Dolls
were formerly civilian models.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50% align:center
So we have to keep
their limitations in mind

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
on the battlefield.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
Even though we use Fire Control
Cores and the Imprint System

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
to enhance their strength,

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
it doesn't make them
physically tougher.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
Please understand that there
is no way I could order them

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
to go head-on
against Sangvis,

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:20.258 position:50% align:center
not when they're fully armed
with the latest weaponry.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
It's not fair and
I don't want to lose them.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
I know it's silly, Dolls
don't die as easily as humans.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
But I still want you
to come back safe anyway.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
Especially you, M4. Copy?

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Let's not waste time.

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
Try to contact your
friends while you've got

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
the chance, okay?

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
Oh, right!

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
[M4] AR15, SOPII.
I'm at the target point!

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:51.915 position:50% align:center
Where are you?

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
[SOPII panting]
M4!

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.461 position:50% align:center
Hey, SOPII!

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad to see you're okay!

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.840 position:50% align:center
[SOPII whimpering]

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Are you here alone?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.471 position:50% align:center
Where's AR15?

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Ah...

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
Is there something wrong?

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
She's, um, not here.

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
AR15 left.

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Huh?

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
She thought it would help.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis intercepted
our last transmission.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
So AR15 decided
to go off by herself,

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
you know, to try and buy time.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.
Buy time for what?

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
[SOPII] Sangvis found
the base's location.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
They're heading there
to launch an attack.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
What did you say?
They're after the base?

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
She needs us!

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
We have to get out there
and save AR15!

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
Please, SOPII, try to calm down.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
Listen. We need to
report to the commander.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.155 position:50% align:center
[laughs] It's so satisfying
throwing every bit of ammo

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
we've got at those Sangvis scum!

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] You idiot!
We should be saving ammo!

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
We're surrounded by the enemy!

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
I'm in hell right now.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
With the exception of
the landing strip crew,

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:19.419 position:50% align:center
everyone left on base
is a problematic child.

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.093 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Please trust me.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
I know you're
worried about AR15.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
I am, too, but getting back
to the base is our priority.

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
But why?

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
She'll be fine. As soon
as we destroy the Sangvis,

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.691 position:50% align:center
we'll head back into
the field and rescue her.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
[G36] I'm afraid the base
is already under attack.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.405 position:50% align:center
[M4] How much longer
till we get there?

00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
Twenty minutes.

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
That won't be soon enough.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Just because
I'm human doesn't mean

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
I'm useless, ya know.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure I can
last 20 minutes!

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
[SOPII] Commander!
I'm sorry, but there's no time!

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center
You have to get out
of there right away!

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center
Huh? I don't know what
you heard, but I don't run.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
There are too many of the enemy!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.596 position:50% align:center
M4 and I can't handle
them all by ourselves!

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
So you're SOPII?

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center
They said you were an odd one.
Guess they were right.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
You're used to fighting alone.

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
Relying on your team
and no one else.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
[SOPII grunts]

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] But... you don't have
to do this on your own anymore.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Hmm?!

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.992 position:50% align:center
You heard her. The commander
and the other T-Dolls at HQ--

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
they'll be right there
fighting alongside us.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Huh?

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
It won't be like it was before.
We'll have them to help.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Ah...

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
[MG3]
Mm.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Hmm.

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
[MP5 giggles]

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
So... does that mean that
these dolls fight with us now?

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
So what do you say?
Want to do this together?

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Mm! I'm ready if you are!

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
[SOPII] Contract complete!
We're connected and ready to go.

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
Awaiting your orders, Commander!
Whatcha got?

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Calm down there, kiddo.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
[G36] We're not far out now.
What's the situation?

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
[SKS] Things are lit up
like a summer festival here.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:26.504 position:50% align:center
They just keep coming.
Waves of 'em, firing nonstop.

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
What's your ETA?

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
[G36]
We're one minute out.

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] We can't handle this
much excitement for long.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
Rescue teams, pick up
the pace if you can manage it.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Roger!

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
Rescue teams, this is M3, copy?

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
If you land at the heliport,
they'll just shoot you down.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
Make for the front
of warehouse 4 instead.

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
[SOPII] This looks like
a good spot to me!

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.785 position:50% align:center
Now, where are those jerks?

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] SOPII, they're about
to break through the main gate!

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
Hurry!

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
[SOPII] You got it,
Commander. I'm on my way!

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
I'm moving in!

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
Get back here! You're going
to make it harder

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.700 position:50% align:center
for the rest of us
to get a clean shot.

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
It's called
a defensive formation!

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
I got tired of waiting!

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
Stick to defense
and we'll be here all night.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
[SOPII grunts]

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
[INGRAM] I can't let you
have all the fun when there's

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:06.813 position:50% align:center
plenty to go around.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
A force shield! That's handy.

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
Okay, SOPII, get ready to fire!

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
I'm on it!

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
Ah! Nice job, you guys!

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
I'm loving this! Turns out
fighting's a lot more fun

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
when you've got
comrades to play with!

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?
I'm glad you think so.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
[SOPII] I did good, Commander!
The Sangvis made a full retreat.

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
Hooray!
[giggles]

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
[M4] Easy, SOPII, you weren't
the only one fighting out there.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
We all won
this victory together.

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I contributed
to it, didn't I?

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
Say it, Commander.
I did good, right?

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
--Tell me, tell me, tell me!
--Uh, yeah. You're great, SOPII.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
--Say it! Say it! Say it!
--Uh, yeah. You're great, SOPII.

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
Good job.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
We've got a real commander now,
so keep doing your best

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
and follow her orders.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
I'll be on my best behavior.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
Just as long as I can
take down that Hunter.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
Hunter?

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:36.945 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Model SP721, Hunter.

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
According to some
intel AR15 gathered,

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
that's the name of
this area's ringleader.

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
[M4] So after the two
of you split up,

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
do you know where she went?

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:50.667 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
She just took off.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.461 position:50% align:center
Acted as a decoy
so I could get away.

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:56.381 position:50% align:center
Hunter is dangerous,
and clever, too.

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
We need to hurry.

00:20:57.507 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
AR15 could be
in serious trouble.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
Commander, now that
things are settled here,

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:05.432 position:50% align:center
we can go save her!

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
They just launched an all-out
assault on our base.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
We can't start
a new mission now.

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Huh?

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] I can't move
units without permission.

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
I'm still too new for that.
So I'm sorry, but...

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
No.

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
[SOPII gasps]

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Rescuing her will have to wait.

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
[M4 sighs]

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
[SOPII growls]

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.628 position:50% align:center
That's it?

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
But M4 said you would help us...

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
All of you.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:51.561 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER]
Aw, giving up already, AR15?

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Everyone is in danger,
and it's because of me.

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
If this can atone for that...

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER chuckles]
Very noble.

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
Griffin does allow the AR Team
to act without the direction

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:06.493 position:50% align:center
of human commanders, I guess.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.414 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER]
And you're part of that unit.

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:17.337 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] You seemed
almost cruelly logical.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.715 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
you would act on emotion.

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:26.262 position:50% align:center
Your information
is awfully one-sided.

00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:29.432 position:50% align:center
You should really consider
updating your database.

00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:34.604 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] Someday, all of our
problems will be solved

00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:37.482 position:50% align:center
once we can get
our hands on the target.

00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:43.988 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
M4A1... Tell me.

00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:46.324 position:50% align:center
Why do you want her so badly?

00:22:48.952 --> 00:22:51.788 position:50% align:center
Our motives really
aren't your concern.

00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:55.083 position:50% align:center
You're just here as bait.
A worm wriggling on a hook.

00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:58.920 position:50% align:center
Once she knows that I have you,
M4 will come running.

00:22:59.004 --> 00:23:02.215 position:50% align:center
That's what you get for letting
your emotions take over.

00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:08.179 position:50% align:center
A real hunter is patient,
waiting silently for her prey.
