[NARRATOR] The Sangvis
army's massive artillery

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:14.597 position:50% align:center
and overwhelming numbers
put Griffin's secret base

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.307 position:50% align:center
in grave danger.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.519 position:50% align:center
Rather than call AR Team
back to a doomed fight,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
Commander Gentiane sends them
to attack the enemy base.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Trust?

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
I've heard that word.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN]
Well, hey, Commander Gentiane!

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Welcome to Griffin's
Top Secret base.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
[M4 (garbled)]
This is M4A1!

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
Commander, do you copy?!

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
Get down, now!

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
--[yelling]
--[grunting]

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN]
Commander Gentiane!

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER] You must stop the
offensive and secure the base.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Listen to me.

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
I need permission to send
all the Dolls outside

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
to find and destroy
the Sangvis base!

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.219 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER] You have permission
to make the call, rookie.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:54.596 position:50% align:center
Now do it.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.307 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] AR Team,
your new orders are as follows.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
Devote every ounce of energy
to destroying the Sangvis base!

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.103 position:50% align:center
--Do you copy?
--[M4] But Commander--

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
M4!

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.774 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.154 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, it's just
like last time!

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.322 position:50% align:center
Be quiet!

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.908 position:50% align:center
Keep your head on a swivel!

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.451 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Nothing unusual.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.203 position:50% align:center
All clear.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:20.205 position:50% align:center
Look at these footsteps.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:23.375 position:50% align:center
I bet the Ringleader escaped
before we could fight her.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.626 position:50% align:center
[GIRL]
I did leave.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.420 position:50% align:center
Three minutes ago, to be exact.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
Hello there, ladies.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.677 position:50% align:center
You can call me Destroyer.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.970 position:50% align:center
What an honor it is to meet you.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.223 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're
waiting for me to say?

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.266 position:50% align:center
Ya know, this is
a long-range transmission

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
we're talkin' through.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:42.477 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.895 position:50% align:center
Gotta hand it to you, girlies.

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:46.898 position:50% align:center
You got here much
faster than I'd anticipated!

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.484 position:50% align:center
I was planning on using
the chaos to my advantage

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.069 position:50% align:center
to make my next move!

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:54.614 position:50% align:center
But look at you--figuring out
my coordinates in record time!

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.158 position:50% align:center
I couldn't believe this was
the same pathetic Griffin gang

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.327 position:50% align:center
we all know and despise.

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.705 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What the hell are you doing?!

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.040 position:50% align:center
I'm talking over here!

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.584 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]
Sorry about that.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.253 position:50% align:center
Please. Continue.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.797 position:50% align:center
Whatever. That was a small base.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.675 position:50% align:center
What do I care if I lose it?
You just did me a favor.

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.428 position:50% align:center
Tch. As long as we're chatting,

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
why don't you tell us
what you've got planned?

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:22.142 position:50% align:center
Nothing you rusty bucket heads
could ever begin to figure out!

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50% align:center
Poor, stupid Griffin
robo-skanks.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.063 position:50% align:center
How about you just
sit this one out?

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
As if you could do
anything about it anyway.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess
we're done talking.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
Got her?

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.406 position:50% align:center
She's still close.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
Of course she's
not even considering

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
that she's being tracked.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.663 position:50% align:center
She hasn't been gone long.
We can still catch her.

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.165 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
No, don't.

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
I think we should fall back.
They're monitoring us, too.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50% align:center
She could call for help.
And that would be it for us.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.673 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't survive that attack.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
What's going on with you today?

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.511 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I trust this
unusually calm side of you.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:02:59.637 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
I'm not calm.

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
I'm being realistic
just like always.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Hmm?

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.768 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Is that a problem?

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.354 position:50% align:center
We need to hurry.
There's not much time left.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
Ah! The Commander!

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
Hooray! We're back
together again!

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
Hey, whoa!
Personal space, remember?

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
Heh. Welcome back.
The mission go as planned?

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
Yes. We managed to destroy
their forward base

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
and are currently tracking
their Ringleader.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
Give us the order,
and we'll move.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
--[SOPII] Mm...
--Excellent.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
Good work.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
[M4 chuckles]

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER] Well, well,
I see you've established

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
a good relationship with M4A1.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50% align:center
Kudos, Commander.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
A healthy rapport
is always beneficial.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
But you and I need to have
a little chat at the moment.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
We won't be far.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50% align:center
AR Team will remain
on standby if needed.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER]
That's not necessary.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
This one doesn't need
to rush off just yet.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.382 position:50% align:center
She's one of
the special T-Dolls.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:44.177 position:50% align:center
Continue to take care of her
and she'll reveal her worth.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.513 position:50% align:center
Special Dolls like her have
an exceptional influence

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
on those around them.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
However, it's impossible to
say whether that influence

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
will ultimately bring
luck or disaster.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
Our meeting here was top secret.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
As was the location
of this base.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
Yet, somehow we were found.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis were able to launch
a devastating pinpoint attack

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
against us. Most likely
because they were given

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
our coordinates.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center
I have some vital
information to share.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
During investigations, we
discovered a Doll that was

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
generating serious errors while
transmitting and receiving data.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center
It turned out to be
a member of the AR Team.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
AR15!

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
[AR15 grunts]

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] These errors
seemed most prominent during

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
your data uploads.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can imagine
our shock at this discovery.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
As a result, we must shut down
your communication module.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
You will need to
disarm and proceed

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
to the interrogation room.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
Please raise your hands.
The guards will escort you.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
There's no way that's right!
It has to be a mistake!

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Shut up, SOPII.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
This isn't your problem to fix.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
There's no point
in whining about it.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
Orders are orders,
and we have to obey.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.832 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
AR15!

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
I expect you to
complete the mission.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter
if I'm there or not.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
Well, what's the deal,
Commander?

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.898 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
Huh? What happened?

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN]
Seriously? One of your Dolls

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
turned traitor and revealed
the base's location?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Of course not!

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
No one on our team would
ever leak information!

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
[KAMOLOV] Commander Shi Jun,
if that Doll's mind was really

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
taken over by the
Sangvis as you're suggesting,

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
there's no way we would even be
alive right now to discuss it.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know that.
I didn't mean it.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50% align:center
Well, regardless, the fact is
they know the location now.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.434 position:50% align:center
Poor intel teams.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
They won't be
sleeping anytime soon.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
Commander, when we
attacked the Sangvis base,

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.943 position:50% align:center
we made contact
with the Ringleader.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
SOPII remembered
to capture her signal.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
She'll send it soon.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.200 position:50% align:center
Job well done!

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
Give Helian the information,
and top brass.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.915 position:50% align:center
They should be able
to analyze the movements.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
There'll be another mission
before we know it.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
So go get some rest
while you can.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center
[AR TEAM]
Copy!

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
A suspicion is all they have.
Nothing is affirmed as of yet.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
What's with the mopey face?

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
M4, worrying won't
solve anything.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
And you know how she is.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
She would want us to focus
on work, not stress about her.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
But why...?

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
Why did this happen?

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Good news.
We've discovered the identity

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
of the Sangvis Ringleader
that attacked this base.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.336 position:50% align:center
Her name is Destroyer.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
She's a new type that has
long-range artillery capability.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
Command has recently declared
her a high-priority target.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.304 position:50% align:center
Now, Commander Franklin,
would you please share

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
our recent discoveries
with the rest of the team?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
Wait. You're still alive?

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
I take it you weren't here
when the Sangvis attacked us,

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
were you?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
I was under the impression
you were dead.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50% align:center
You are such a coward.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.071 position:50% align:center
Who do you think made the resin
you used to patch the walls?!

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
I am an engineer and that's it!

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
It's not my job to fight
on the front lines!

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
--[HELIAN] Ahem.
--Ah.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center
Anyway, if I may draw
your attention to the map.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
What you are seeing
is the Sangvis base.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
The same one AR Team
took out an hour ago.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
According to our tracking data,

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
Destroyer should still be
somewhere within this area.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN]
Hmm. Not much help.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
[FRANKLIN] Right. We'll try
to narrow it down further.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:02.185 position:50% align:center
How's this? We'll split the
Dolls up across this location.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
They'll gather all the
Sangvis comms signatures.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
That should tell us exactly
where the Ringleader is hiding.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center
High-altitude drones
can't do it?

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.530 position:50% align:center
[FRANKLIN] The Sangvis in this
area are well-defended.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
We've already tried drones.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
They shot them all down.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.666 position:50% align:center
Can we pull up the geographic
data for the zone?

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Now, take out
any areas with an incline

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
of 70 degrees or more.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
[FRANKLIN]
All right.

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
That's 60%.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:42.017 position:50% align:center
Great. And now the location
we see before us can be

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
our Luxembourg.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
[footsteps thudding]

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] There's something
you should know.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
Sangvis planted
an intrusion program in AR15

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
before she returned to base.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
Her Zener Protocol's been cut.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
Which means she can't
exchange data with the outside.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
Also, we're looking
over her feature code,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
as well as attempting
a thorough virus removal.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
Given her value, we're not
going to be disarming her.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.685 position:50% align:center
But we need to find out
where the virus came from

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
and how to stop it
from coming back.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50% align:center
Regardless, you don't
need to worry about that.

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
Just focus on your mission
until she returns.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
This mission's going to be an
extremely dangerous one.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I suggest
everyone backup your minds.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
[AR TEAM]
Roger!

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER groans]

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.673 position:50% align:center
Yo! Yo, Dreamer!

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
How long do you plan on
holding me captive out here?

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
Well, let me think...

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
I would recommend
staying until nightfall.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
There's no way you'd be
able to hide your dumb ass

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.643 position:50% align:center
during the day.
You're quite loud.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
Any average Doll would nab you.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
Fine. I'll be ready
for them, then.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
Hey! Did you just
call me a "dumbass"?!

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
The only survivors you have
left are standard

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
defense troops--
clear incompetence.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
No one with a shred of
intelligence would have wasted

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
extra forces at their
disposal so soon.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't ordered you
to move when I did,

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center
you'd be full of bullet holes
right about now.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER] Hmph! As if those
Griffin trash could even manage.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.799 position:50% align:center
I wonder if that's true.
I guess we'll find out.

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER]
Huh?

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER] Griffin is approaching
from the northeast.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER gasps]

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.728 position:50% align:center
[SASS] This is Javelin
Team! Do you copy?

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
We've just wiped out
a Sangvis patrol.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
We're still out here gathering
comms signatures!

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
[FRANKLIN]
Well done!

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
There are multiple pieces
of useful data here!

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
I'll send those codes to be
cross-validated immediately!

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
Continue to gather
as much data as you can!

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
Javelin Team, move forward!

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.579 position:50% align:center
[SASS]
Roger!

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
[PPK]
This is Harpoon Team.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
Sangvis has appeared
in our front view.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
We are currently
engaging the enemy.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
Longsword has entered
combat as well.

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
[KAWASAKI] Hmm. We appear to be
encountering more enemies.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
Seems the Ringleader
on their side is preparing

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
her troops for battle.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
There's nowhere for her to run.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.474 position:50% align:center
She's bound to show up
sooner or later, believe me.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
That's easy enough to handle.

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
We just need the chicken to
keep watch and make sure

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
she doesn't get away.

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
Are you blind?!
I've got the eyes of a hawk!

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
So take note--I will not
tolerate being called a chicken!

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.070 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:43.990 position:50% align:center
Even if Franklin happens to miss
her, we'll catch her on our end.

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
Fishing Net, are you linked up?

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
Unit 794 will be there soon.

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Yes. You can count on us.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
We've already reached
the target point.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center

waiting for them.

--Aw, cheer up, SOPII.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
Don't forget you're a Doll.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I know I'm a Doll.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't care about it, but I
can't help but think that...

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
...we're all just tools.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
We're made to
complete missions, right?

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
So what's the point of these
annoying pseudo-emotion modules?

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
I mean, our only purpose is
to aim for the enemy's head

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
and pull the trigger, isn't it?

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
Maybe it isn't supposed
to be as simple as that.

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
What if our creator envisioned
us to be more than just weapons?

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center

Hey, SOPII, are you okay?

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center

Not really. It isn't fair.

together again, you know?

Oh, right.

Are you napping in there?!

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
Griffin's dumb Dollies are
getting closer by the minute!

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you do something?

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
She left? Shit!

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
I lost all my Jaegers.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
And I only have
a few Rippers left.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
I can't take this anymore!
You hear me?!

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
I'm outta here, jerks.

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
[SOPII gasps] I've got
a strong Sangvis signal.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
I know it's her!

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
Just like the commander said,
she came out when it got dark!

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
Vector M33X7.

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
Looks like she's
hiding near the river.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
Hurry and prep the flares.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
Roger that!

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
Is that from the Griffin Dolls?!

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
What are they doing here?!

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.326 position:50% align:center
It's nothing you rusty bucket
heads could ever figure out!

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
You poor, stupid, robo-skank.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.457 position:50% align:center
Urgh! You need that many
Dolls just to fight one?

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.916 position:50% align:center
How pathetic!

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Scatter!

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
Make sure to watch
for her shells!

Calling all Griffin Dolls
and commanders.

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
We've just learned that
AR Team's T-Doll, AR15,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
escaped the interrogation
room five minutes ago.

--[M4 gasps]
--Huh?!

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] This particular
T-Doll may be infected

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.450 position:50% align:center
with a Sangvis virus.

00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
Consider her to
be extremely dangerous.

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Huh...?

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center
Why are you just standing
there staring at me?!

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Also, her Zener
Protocol has been turned off,

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.836 position:50% align:center
so we have no way to track her.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
What do you think you're doing?!

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
Hah!

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
[MP5 gasps]
Get down!

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
[SOPII yells]

[MP5]
Are you okay?

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] If you should find her,
report to command immediately

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
and detain her using
whatever force necessary.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
If needed, you have permission
to attack and destroy her.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
[DESTROYER giggles] If you're
spacing out during a fight,

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
then you're stupider
than I thought!

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
You're such a pain!

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER]
Go now. Escape.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.626 position:50% align:center
That you, Dreamer?

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
I lost Destroyer!

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
She escaped the encirclement!

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
[M4]
That's not good.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
Did you hear? What was that?

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
But that attack
messed things up.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
It cut off all our communication
with the outside.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What for?!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
Why at a time like this?!

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
[KAMOLOV]
Don't tell me...

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
You lost your
command system, too?

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
Pretty interesting timing.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
This happening right when that
Doll made a run for it, too.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
M4, what are we gonna do now?

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
I would like to go looking
for AR15, but we can't.

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
We're needed here.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
Destroyer may have
escaped our grip,

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
but there are still
loads of Sangvis.

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
[M16] That's why I'm
saying we should start

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
by following Destroyer.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.221 position:50% align:center
What good would that do us now?!

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
Calm down, M4.
This is AR15, remember?

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly think
she's being controlled?

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps]

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
[M16] For the sake of argument,
let's say she fled

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
of her own free will,
not controlled by Sangvis.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you think
she had a plan?

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
[M4] Are you suggesting AR15
knew what was going on?

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
Realized the Sangvis objective?

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
If so, why wouldn't
she report what she found?

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
Or at least tell us about it?
It doesn't make any sense!

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.461 position:50% align:center
It does. Trust me.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
I know more about
AR15 than you do.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's not just
her that I know better,

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
but the whole team.

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
If that was her decision,
then I believe there must be

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.098 position:50% align:center
a very good reason.

00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
I know it's hard, but we
have to have faith in her.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
And having faith means
carrying out our own mission.

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
[G43]
M16 has the right idea here.

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
Okay, but we can't contact
our commander right now.

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
With no one to give us orders.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
I may have lost the memories of
when we fought together last,

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
but come on M4, you know
what we're capable of

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
without a commander.

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
We can handle the Sangvis here.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:52.460 position:50% align:center
I've got no doubt
we can win against them.

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
So let's do it.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
Go, AR Team.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
Your teammate believes
in you, too.

00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
I'm certain of it.

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
Thanks for saying that.
It means a lot.

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
And you're right--
if AR15 were here,

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:11.855 position:50% align:center
she would tell us to fight.

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hmm.

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
AR Team.
Let's follow Destroyer!

[DREAMER]
I wish. What's wrong now?

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
Griffin moved much
faster than we thought

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
and they're on their way to us!

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
Can you use your firepower
to slow them down?

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center
Huh? And why exactly
would I do that?

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
Because you promised!

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
You said when
the mission's complete,

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center
you'd do whatever you could
to help me out of here!

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:48.183 position:50% align:center
Ah. So, is the mission complete?

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.435 position:50% align:center
I failed to assassinate Kryuger.

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:51.936 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center

Come on!

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:58.443 position:50% align:center
The program I loaded
into AR15 worked just fine!

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
I also found the data
on Safehouse 3

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
inside her neural cloud!
That counts, right?

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
Please help me! We have the data
that we need for Parapluie!

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:10.038 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you!

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:12.374 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:16.378 position:50% align:center
So if the mission's completed,
then there's no need for you.

00:22:16.461 --> 00:22:17.504 position:50% align:center
At all.

00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:19.297 position:50% align:center

00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:22.175 position:50% align:center
We're just Dolls,
or have you forgotten?

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:24.219 position:50% align:center
And the thing about
being a Doll is that means

00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.388 position:50% align:center
you're eminently expendable.

00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:29.099 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to waste
valuable resources just to

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:32.435 position:50% align:center
pick up a small pile
of garbage, is there?

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.270 position:50% align:center
You're serious? No...

00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:36.773 position:50% align:center
You don't think you'll
get away with this, do you?!

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:38.858 position:50% align:center
[DREAMER]
Mm. I do, though.

00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:41.236 position:50% align:center
You can revive
as soon as you're killed.

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:45.865 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, but you'll lose all
memory of what's happening now.

00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:49.369 position:50% align:center
And once that happens, you'll
be just like my new little puppy

00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:51.830 position:50% align:center
that does whatever
I tell her to!

00:22:51.913 --> 00:22:53.957 position:50% align:center
What?! That's so stupid!

You're lying, you bitch!

00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:58.503 position:50% align:center

think this is the first time
