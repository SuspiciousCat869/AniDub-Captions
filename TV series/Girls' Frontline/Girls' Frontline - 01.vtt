[NARRATOR] In the year 2045,
at the dawn of World War 3,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
Tactical Dolls were deployed

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
by military organizations around
the world in lieu of humans.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The T-Dolls
were created by every

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:34.367 position:50% align:center
major military manufacturer,
but it was the Sangvis Ferri

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
who rebelled against humanity
once the war ended.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
Griffin, a private
military company,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
sent its elite AR Team out to
find the cause of the rebellion

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
and bring it to an end.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Incoming Sangvis Reinforcements!

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
Estimated arrival time,
15 seconds!

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
[M16] There are too many of
them! Try to save ammo!

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
[AR15] They can barely
even protect themselves!

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
What makes you think they have
the strength to come here?

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.643 position:50% align:center
[AGENT 1A]
Say farewell.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
And prepare to take
your last breath.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Are those Griffin T-Dolls?

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:40.016 position:50% align:center
And if so, why are they here?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.936 position:50% align:center
Easy. Griffin sent them on a
mission out here to wipe out

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.230 position:50% align:center
any Sangvis still in the area.

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:47.524 position:50% align:center
They were probably
separated from the main unit

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.067 position:50% align:center
and then abandoned.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.862 position:50% align:center
[M4]
How unfortunate...

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.865 position:50% align:center
So then, what's the plan, M4?
Take them with us?

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.450 position:50% align:center
Well, um...

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.202 position:50% align:center
[M16] It would be impossible to
keep them from drawing attention

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.162 position:50% align:center
to themselves or us.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:03.456 position:50% align:center
They don't move silently.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
But no need to worry.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.794 position:50% align:center
If they're in offline mode,
the Sangvis can't detect them.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
Let's go. We should
continue our mission.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.257 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right.

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.428 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:22.392 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
[M4] Confirming coordinates.
V-6-J-6-9 H-J-Y-R-V.

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:30.025 position:50% align:center
Clear weather. No wind.
Good visibility.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
Persica, this is the AR Team.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
--Come in.
--[PERSICA] Heyo.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
We're reporting in.
We're at the Sangvis HQ.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.908 position:50% align:center
We found a file labeled Lyco,

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.786 position:50% align:center
as well as the precise location
of the research data.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.289 position:50% align:center
It was me! I found all the data!

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA]
That's fun. And?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.251 position:50% align:center
It's stored inside a mainframe.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.462 position:50% align:center
Somewhere in
Safehouse 3, I believe.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.547 position:50% align:center
We'll head there now
to retrieve it.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.591 position:50% align:center
Once found,
we'll be sending it off.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
To 16LAB, correct?

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.137 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA]
Yep. Love it.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
Let's get moving!

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.685 position:50% align:center
We don't want to keep
the Sangvis waiting, right?

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.855 position:50% align:center
Calm down SOPII.
We're not here to have fun.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Captain.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Mm. Go, AR Team, Let's move out!

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
[AR15] M16, do you understand
what our objective is

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.509 position:50% align:center
for this mission?

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
[M16]
That question worries me, AR15.

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
[AR15] I ask because
Persica originally told us

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
to recover experiment data.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
And now, we're in Sangvis
territory looking for

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
documents left by the dead.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
[M4] As T-Dolls, we must
adjust as the parameters

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
of our mission evolve.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Understood.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
[AR15] I was just curious
what you thought.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
We have managed
to reach the target point.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA]
Sick.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
But did you find the data?

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
[M4] The OS is too old for
us to hack the login system.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
We'll need a password
to boot it up.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA]
Uh...

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
90...

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
W-I-S-H.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.018 position:50% align:center
R-O-C-K.

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
Uh... X.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
Make sure to use all caps.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
Password accepted.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
I'm looking through
the database right now.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.778 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA] Cool. Copy everything
you find to your memory

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.488 position:50% align:center
and bring it home with you.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
We're not sending it wirelessly?

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA] Not when there's
a chance the Sangvis

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
could take it.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
It's very important
we keep it away from them.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
In fact, blow up the mainframe
before you leave.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Roger.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.296 position:50% align:center
Wait. We're here invading
Sangvis territory,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
hacking into their database,
all to steal data

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
they don't even know they have?

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha! Just like
a treasure hunt!

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
[AGENT 1A] Yes, it is.
And we're very grateful.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
You've found quite
a treasure for us.

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
--[gasping]
--It sounds like somebody

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
broke into the comms line!

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
I am Agent
of the Sangvis Ferri.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
I have been awaiting
your arrival.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
Seems to be a High-End Model.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
A High-End Model, huh?

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. Our master requested
information from that base.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the system
turned out to be too old

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
for us to decipher.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. So you used us
to get it for you!

00:06:58.335 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
That mission is complete.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
Our master will have
the answer at last.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
Well, once I've destroyed your
parts and deleted your memory.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Sangvis detected!

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
They're getting close!
It's party time!

[beeping]

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
We can't move out until I've
finished copying all of this!

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
Prepare for combat!

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
Get ready to
intercept the enemy!

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
There are too many of them!
Try to save ammo!

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
You copy, SOPII?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know! AR15,
you cover from behind, okay?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
Right, I'm on it.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center

tracking enemy movements!

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
Sure thing. I got you!

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.582 position:50% align:center
Listen up. Everyone,
stay strong.

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
We're heading home
once it's over!

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center

Mm!

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
These stupid things
just keep on coming!

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
Don't you think someone
should contact Persica?

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
[M16] We can't. The module
automatically cut

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
the transmission to keep
any information

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
on the lab from leaking.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center

more than half the data.

Can you hang in there?

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
We're seriously
outnumbered here.

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center

and we're done for.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
There is a better way.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
If we can contact the dolls
in the Support Units,

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.976 position:50% align:center
they'll come out to help.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
They can barely even
protect themselves!

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.063 position:50% align:center
What makes you think they have
the strength to come here?

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:45.817 position:50% align:center
Copy. You might have
a point there, AR15.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
M4! I need you to
change our signal!

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
Tell those dolls to back us up!

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
Roger that. But... someone
will have to bring them here.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
They won't come on their own.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
Hey, AR15, SOPII!

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
Launch a forcible
access attempt!

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
I'll rewrite your
privileges when close!

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
Okay, you got it!

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.926 position:50% align:center
[SOPII grunts] Just hang
in there until we get back!

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
[M16]
We can handle this.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
You and me.
It's gonna be rough, though.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
M16...

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
I'm... I'm sorry I couldn't
make that call before.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
I realize I'm always
asking you for help...

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
You're doing a great job.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
And you haven't
screwed up anything.

all the signals that
give orders to their team.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.575 position:50% align:center
If you can bring down
that command post,

you'll be neutralizing the

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
Most of the Sangvis

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
So by destroying and
occupying the location itself,

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
we will be able to neutralize
the enemy and withdraw

What kind of warped illicit
coding are they using?!

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
Can they predict
our movements somehow?

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I bet they're hacking
our Zener Protocol.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
Which means they'll know
exactly what our plans are

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
as soon as we do.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center

then how'd you beat

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
that one back there, M16?

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
Well... They beat me so bad,
I could only move my left hand.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
And then, they blasted me,

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:20.433 position:50% align:center

point-blank range.

Yeah, of course.

I guess those hackers
do too now, but who cares?

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
[AGENT 1A]
So they found our weakness?

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
By aiming our firepower
to the front,

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
we make ourselves vulnerable
to attacks from the side.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
When firing, we become
immobile due to the need

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
to resist the recoil.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center

stays quite limited.

Such a waste!

At this distance, and with

is meaningless.

were just decoys?

looking up while they

doesn't do much if you're

to go to Griffin HQ
