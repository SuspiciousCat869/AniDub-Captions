[NARRATOR] M4A1's team set off
to survey an enemy base

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.265 position:50% align:center
and locate AR15.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.018 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis Dolls suddenly
lost control and began

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:22.981 position:50% align:center
firing on each other, handing
victory to the Griffin forces.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
Heh. How 'bout that?
M4A1 showed up.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know. She's here.
Your sweet little friend AR15.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
I do. The human
commander is in charge

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
of giving all her orders now.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
It's not like she can
make that decision herself.

The Sangvis Dolls have started

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
shooting each other.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50% align:center
We don't know what prompted it,
but it's a perfect opportunity.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.968 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] We're counting on
you to destroy the enemy,

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.428 position:50% align:center
Commander Gentiane.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.929 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Because I broke your legs?

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
It's true. I could
see that your speed

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center
was the biggest threat to us.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.436 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] How do you have the
authority to command Sangvis?!

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.562 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Hmph.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
Pretty impressive,
don't you think...

Three hundred meters away.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center
[M4] You'll need to encircle
them to wipe them out.

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:32.300 position:50% align:center
Be sure to maintain a distance
of at least 30 meters.

00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:33.635 position:50% align:center

[PPSH-41] Have you noticed how
much more efficient we are

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.741 position:50% align:center
in combat this time around?

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.661 position:50% align:center
[It's thanks to
M4's leadership!

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:02.038 position:50% align:center
Stop. It's not about me.

[AR15 grunts]

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] A few days ago,
Griffin dispatched

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center
an investigation
team into S09.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
Which comes with
harsh challenges.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
Their route takes them
through Sangvis territory.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
And that means it's very
likely they'll be attacked.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, the brass has
ordered us to provide support.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
I'm almost certain that
the other commanders

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
don't know this,

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
but we've already made
several strikes on S09.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
Even so, the number of
Sangvis hasn't decreased.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
It's getting worse.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
Judging from our past combat
data, the Sangvis are likely

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
to ambush us in this area.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.967 position:50% align:center
Here, here, and here.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
Don't lose sight of those marks,
but watch other areas as well.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
Wait. Isn't that where M4 was
during "Operation Sugar Cube?"

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
Yup! Good!

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
That's outside
the primary mission area,

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
but it could come in handy
that you remember it.

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'd rather not
remember it at all.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] The only thing HQ
sent us was the predicted route.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
It's probably a special team.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
Which means our job will be to
draw the enemy away from them.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
Give them the time they need
to do what they came to do.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
That's all.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
Does anyone have any questions?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.630 position:50% align:center
In that case, make sure you
all get a good night's rest.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
We'll meet up at 0445.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
We leave at 0500.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.262 position:50% align:center
Dismissed!

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
[AR15] You heard what
the commander said before.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
Go get some rest.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.902 position:50% align:center
This won't help us.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.904 position:50% align:center
No one wants to start
a mission with a tired

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
and ineffective leader.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
It doesn't look like
you're resting, either.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
Unlike a certain somebody
who can't be torn away

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
from target practice
for two minutes,

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
I actually try
to prioritize my sleep.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I guess... I still
get nervous before missions.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
It's different this time.
The nervousness, I mean.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
As for the place the
commander was talking about

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
this afternoon...

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
We had a similar discussion
before, didn't we?

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
We did?

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50% align:center
I don't remember.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
We're human-like warriors
that are also weapons.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
Our purpose for
existence is victory.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
That's all we need
to focus on now.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center

to find her, M4.

Was I just worried over nothing?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.429 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] If so, then why
did the Sangvis suddenly

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
spiral out of control?

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
And how did AR15
escape from her bonds?

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
Well, if it's even got a new
commander like me wondering,

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
I would hope the top
brass have an answer.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
[rapid gunfire,

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center

I don't get it.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
What's the matter?

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
It's going well, right?

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.125 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Yeah, the
enemy's not that strong,

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
but... they just keep on coming.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
It's been four hours.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
Since the mission
started, I mean.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50% align:center
But still. There are more
enemies hanging on

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
than I'd expect.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
It's so bizarre that there's not
been any breaks in the fight.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
Kalina, prepare a level three
satellite scan at V6J8A.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Really?
You're using a recon satellite?

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
That's fine, of course,

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
but it'll take 22 minutes to get
the nearest one ready for you.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
All 794 units, halt now.

Wait a minute, does
that mean... you knew?

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
Yes. But there was
nothing I could do.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center

highly classified.

course of action for the body?

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
Should we bring it back with us?

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
Or would it be better to leave a
marker for one of the base's

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
drones to recover it later?

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
No, I think we should
let her rest here.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
She's already ordered a new
Doll of the exact same type.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
I made sure to save
her affiliation code.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.644 position:50% align:center
That'll bring her
back no problem.

just in a different body.

[416]
I don't need your advice.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
I follow orders. End of story.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.557 position:50% align:center
What do you read?
Is this the right spot or not?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
[UMP45]
You don't know? Of course it is.

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
[UMP45]
So sad. Poor AR Team.

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
Got their asses kicked
by two Agents here.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.734 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
Do we have time to celebrate
on this holy ground?

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.114 position:50% align:center
Do I have time
to reduce you to scraps?

00:10:56.197 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
Data restoration complete.
Agents' coordinates confirmed.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
[UMP45] Okay then,
that means our mission's done.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:10.754 position:50% align:center
So can we talk about
what you're really up to?

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
Like, searching around for
clues to their whereabouts.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
This is the best
chance I'll get.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
I don't like to waste my time.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
I hear that.
I won't stand in your way.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
I'll go look at
the data 9 found first.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center
I can be efficient, too.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
[UMP45]
Oh, by the way.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.651 position:50% align:center
Try not to get
too carried away out here.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.363 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know how
dangerous the Elite can be.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
Any misstep could be fatal.

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
[416 growls]

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] That's all the
information I have presently.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.832 position:50% align:center
All data from Scarecrow,
Executioner, and myself

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
has been successfully uploaded.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER] So M4A1 still has
the Safehouse 3 data, I see.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
It's strange, they don't seem
to have done much with it.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
Then again, this is Griffin
we're talking about.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
I doubt they have
any idea what it's worth.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
The information
about Plan Parapluie

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
or the information
about the "remains."

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] Either way,
my mission has ended.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
I'm going back to my hunting.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER]
Why am I not surprised?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50% align:center
How is it that all of
my soldiers are like this?

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
Such barbarians!

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] Unlike you, I refuse
to sit here and wait for death

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
in my best outfit.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER] And that's why you'll
never amount to anything more

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
than a lowly pawn.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
Tell me the truth, do you
regret coming to work for me?

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] Heh. You're asking
as if I ever had a choice.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
Look, if I can die and be rid
of you, that's enough for me.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
[INTRUDER]
Such animosity.

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
But don't you worry--

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
I've carefully saved
all of your data.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
I'll be ready when
the time comes.

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
My job here is to prepare
for your last great goodbye.

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
What is this exactly?

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
It's a recording of a report
of the Sangvis Ringleaders.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
We had to fight a Sangvis
enhanced defense team for it.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
It took us a seven-hour
long battle to acquire.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
But... our commander told us not
to worry since there weren't

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
any powerful enemies
out there, though.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
Well, we all make
mistakes sometimes.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis are something.
They sure can talk, huh?

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
That was probably set up
intentionally, I would think.

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
From what I can tell,
all Sangvis Dolls

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
have flawed
personalities, right?

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.050 position:50% align:center
Just like our beloved commander.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN grunts] Sounds
like your personality's

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
a little off, too.

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
Hmm... This is some tricky
intel we've gathered.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
[SASS]
Yes, I agree.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
You think destroying it
is our best bet?

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:35.398 position:50% align:center
No, This mission is
a critical one for Griffin.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
We can't get rid of it. Not now.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
[SHI JUN]
Gah! How could I ever forget?

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
I know somebody who can help us.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center
My angel knows everything about
the S09 and will do anything

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
if there's a reward.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
I forgot to tell you!

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
Guess who asked me on a date!
Commander Shi Jun! Weird, huh?

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
[KALINA giggles]
That was my reaction, too!

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.842 position:50% align:center
So, what did you say?
You gonna go?

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Hmm.... That's
the question, isn't it?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
--[beeping]
--Uh?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Recon satellite...
seems to be in position.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
The data's here.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
Put it on the monitor.

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Roger!

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE gasps]

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.607 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?
We've already defeated so many.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
How are there still
more than ever?

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
Sangvis...
What are they, anyway?

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
A virus or something?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
Helian, do you know
what's happening?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
I'll keep it brief, Commander.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
But I've got some
answers for you.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.372 position:50% align:center
We've recently received
information from the team

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
that we deployed.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
It turns out that,
unlike during our recon,

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
things aren't looking
good for them.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
Yes. I found the same thing
via satellite scan.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
The reason is... a new Sangvis
Ringleader has taken the field.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
Her name is "Intruder."

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Intruder, huh?

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Yes. She appears
to be a new type,

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
and I haven't been able
to find any information on her

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
in our existing
product catalogs.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
There is one thing
we can deduce, at least.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
Unlike previous Ringleaders,
she specializes

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
in commanding troops.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
So it seems.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] However, your
mission remains the same.

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
Continue to draw the Sangvis's
attention and keep them

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
from sending in their troops.

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
Do not let them
onto the battlefield.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Roger.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Problem is,

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.546 position:50% align:center
we don't have
nearly the ammo we'd need

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center
to fight this many
Sangvis as it is.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.384 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Do you think we should
use helicopters and drones

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
to set up a supply point?

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
Go for it. This picnic has
turned into a game of tag.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
Let's start with the bases that
are under Sangvis control.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.438 position:50% align:center
Show me the comm
traffic heatmap.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
There ya go.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.779 position:50% align:center
One thing is certain--
they're not trying to hide.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.324 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
N94 command post to all units.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
We're changing the plan.

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.828 position:50% align:center
Attention. Unit 1, join 2.

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
3, head out. FB1CX.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
Those are the coordinates.
I'll give you details later.

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.711 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Roger that.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Come in. AR Team. Anyone there?

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
Is that M16?
I can hear you, come in!

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Did I just hear M16's voice?

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What was that?

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
[G36] It appears that word has
come in from the missing member

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center
of the AR Team, Commander.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
[M16]
M4, you there?

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:21.690 position:50% align:center
About time.
Is anyone else with you?

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
[M4] Yes, everyone's here!
You're the last one left! 

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
That's so good
to hear. I'm glad.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
I'm okay, too.
I found a place to resupply,

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
but... I've still got
some work to do.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center
What kind of work?

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
How long were you
planning to stay out here?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
I dunno.
Could be a while, though.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
I'll try you again later.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Hello? Come in?

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
Did you hang up on me?!

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
Why is she like this?

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Calm down.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
At least we know
that she's safe now, right?

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
And she may even be nearby.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
After this mission's complete,
we'll go looking for her.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Commander.
That means a lot.

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
[M16 sighs] Sometimes, I wish
I wasn't so convincing.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
It might be nice to have
some help on this one.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
Look at that.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:17.245 position:50% align:center
Someone's coming, but I'm
pretty sure... it's not to help.

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.621 position:50% align:center
[M16 grunts]

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center
So predictable.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
[416] Disappointed? Would you
have preferred Sangvis?

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
No, thanks. I like being
prepared for these situations.

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
But I don't get it,
if you're part of Griffin

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
and still killing Dolls
that aren't Sangvis,

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
can you at least tell me why?
What gives, 416?

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
[416] Squad 404
has special privileges.

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
We're allowed to launch
preemptive attacks on anybody

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:43.980 position:50% align:center
who gets in our way--
enemy or ally.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Heh. That's convenient.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
Gotta admit, I'm jealous.

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
[416]
Shut up!

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
Don't play stupid with me!

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
You know exactly
what that means!

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
I know you understand
the price of it, too!

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
Of what? I mean,
clearly, I'm in your way.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.542 position:50% align:center
[416] To be perfectly honest,
I was never that thrilled

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
about being given
a privilege like this.

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
Except today!

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
[M16] Is it confession time?
I'll play along.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
Ya know, when I was at
the Bureau of State Security,

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
I kinda liked you.

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
Are you mocking me, M16?!

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Found you.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.898 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
Or not.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
[416]
Game over, M16.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
You lose.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
Right. That sucks.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Or does it?

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
[416 gasps]

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
[416 gasps]

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
[416 grunts]

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
[M16 groans]

00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
[416 whimpers]

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
[M16]
You're quite good at hiding.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
But you shouldn't rely
on it as a primary skill.

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
Or else.

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
You won't know how
to fight once you're found.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.812 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
[416 gasps]

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
[416 grunts]

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
[416]
I lost.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
What are you waiting for?
Just kill me.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
I'm the superior Doll here!

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
[M16] Are you?
Superior in experience?

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.710 position:50% align:center
Responses? Training?

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
You seem to be
lacking in all three.

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
[416]
You've got issues with me.

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
You always have.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what am I to you?

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
[M16] Do you really
want me to answer that?

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
If so, then listen up.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
You, 416...

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
You've always meant
absolutely nothing to me.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
Your existence holds no value.

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
You represent a waste of
technology and energy to me.

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
[growls]
That's why I hate you, M16!

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
Everyone does!

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
You're a bully! You think you
know everything, but you don't!

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
You're just an empty killing
machine without emotions

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
that no one would care for!

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
Every doll has emotions,
at least on some level.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:14.839 position:50% align:center
That's what
makes us so difficult.

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
You're wrong. Someone does care,
and they're waiting for me.

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
I gotta go.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
I'm done wasting time on you.
So get lost.

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
[416 growls]

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Well, go!

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
I know you don't actually want
to fight me, so get outta here.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.231 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
There it is. I can see
your true weakness now.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Oh, shut up.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
[416 gasps]

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
[M16] But you better not forget
what happened here, you got it?

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
Or I'll end you.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.704 position:50% align:center
The only answer your AI
will ever be capable

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
of generating is "suicide."

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
Hey, UMP45. You can come out.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
416 took off.

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:04.514 position:50% align:center
[UMP45] Aw, jeez.
Can't hide from you, huh?

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
[UMP45] I thought I did
a good job of concealing myself.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
Lesson learned.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
[M16] Look, I'm in
a hurry to get gone.

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
Please don't tell me you came
here just to clean up

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
416's stupid mess?

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
You're leaving?
Not sure I believe that.

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
You still have a weapon
on your back.

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
It hasn't been used yet.

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
You're smart. Well, rest
assured, this isn't for you.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
[UMP45] Okay, great.
I'm glad to hear it!

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
I mean, I didn't come
here to fight, either.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
I was just heading home from
a job and needed to pick up

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
416 on the way.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
She's been working super hard,
so I gave her some time off.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
[M16]
And she used it to mess with me?

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
Doesn't she have
better things to do?

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
Heh. You know, you two are
the only ones like this.

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
Always so extreme.

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
Oh, you don't have to worry.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
416 never had any intention
of killing you today.

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
She was just feeling upset.

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
And I guess needed
to vent a little.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:01.279 position:50% align:center
And that's why I
let her leave here alive.

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center
I figured as much.

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:06.242 position:50% align:center
And that's why I'm
letting you leave here alive.

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Hmph.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.999 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
That's good to hear.

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
We have a deal, then.

00:22:14.876 --> 00:22:16.294 position:50% align:center
I suppose.

00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:18.588 position:50% align:center
That's not gonna matter much
if you head back now, is it?

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:20.048 position:50% align:center
You'll just get killed.

00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:24.094 position:50% align:center
[M16] Hmm? Don't underestimate
16LAB's technology.

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:26.763 position:50% align:center
I'm not going
to die that easily.

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:30.809 position:50% align:center
Anyway, did this mission
of yours turn up anything?

00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:32.602 position:50% align:center
[UMP45]
Just that the rain fell.

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.062 position:50% align:center
On the plains.

00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:36.064 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Rain? Plains?

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:37.482 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:39.901 position:50% align:center
Your creator might know
the answer to that.

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.736 position:50% align:center
You ought to ask.

00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:49.452 position:50% align:center
[UMP45] Okie-doke.
I really should be going now.

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:52.163 position:50% align:center
Oh, if you happen
to see your friends...

00:22:52.247 --> 00:22:54.833 position:50% align:center
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll tell them you're dead.

00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:57.544 position:50% align:center
Sounds good. I'm off, then.

00:22:57.627 --> 00:23:00.213 position:50% align:center
Bye. See you next time.

00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:11.224 position:50% align:center
Will there even be a next time?
Hope not...

00:24:43.066 --> 00:24:46.736 position:50% align:center
