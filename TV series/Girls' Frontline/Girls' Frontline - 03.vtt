00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.096 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] As the AR Team
dispersed to protect

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.098 position:50% align:center
the data they'd recovered,

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
Griffin's new
commander, Gentiane,

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:20.770 position:50% align:center
encountered her first
Sangvis High-End Model.

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure to meet you
as well Officer Kalina.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
I'm Gentiane.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
From the looks of it, seems
your first mission went well.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
Sure. But then,
it was the tutorial.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
Therefore, we are executing

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
an emergency operation.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center
The mission is to make contact
with and destroy Scarecrow,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.544 position:50% align:center
and ultimately recover
her memory module.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
I was able to calculate it,
just before the very end.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.843 position:50% align:center
M4A1's coordinates that is...

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.553 position:50% align:center
She's about to self-destruct!

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
Move out! Everyone! Now!

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.725 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Scarecrow,
I'll take over from here.

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
You rest in peace.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
I will find you, M4A1.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.924 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Yes. It's just me.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.679 position:50% align:center
[M4] No, not yet.
The rest are still on their way.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.639 position:50% align:center
We've set a rendezvous point.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
The goal is to
all retreat together, but.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
Hope this means
you've got the data?

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.439 position:50% align:center
[M4, garbled] Yes. It's
currently within my possession.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.358 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA, garbled] Griffin's
launched a little rescue mission

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.986 position:50% align:center
for you ladies. You'll need
to make contact somehow.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50% align:center
[M4 sighs] All right. Sangvis
is close, so I can't stay long.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.035 position:50% align:center
I need to get going.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.873 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA garbled] Be careful,
code name... Sugar Cube...

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.291 position:50% align:center
Persica, wait!

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.005 position:50% align:center
[M4 sighs]
"Sugar Cube"...?

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] Come in, Kryuger.
You and I need to make a plan.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis managed
to pull ahead again.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?
Is this about M4A1?

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
Are you saying they've
discovered her location

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
before we did?
That's troublesome.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
Yes. We believe they utilized
a Doll that excels at hacking.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.157 position:50% align:center
[KRYUGER]
That's possible.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
Or the information could have
been leaked from inside.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
I disagree, sir.
The Dolls' security system

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
has been tested
and proven infallible.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.002 position:50% align:center
Everyone who works
for us can be trusted,

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
so it can't be one of ours.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
Perfection doesn't exist.
Especially during combat.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
No one is completely
trusted, Helian.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.888 position:50% align:center
We have no idea what
they have up their sleeves.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN grunts]

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
I'm going to call off your
mission temporarily to be safe.

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
All right.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
What about the mission
to rescue AR Team?

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
We'll continue it, of course,
but with a different approach.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
Oh, that reminds me.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to know if
your new commander likes cats?

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
I... haven't had
any reason to ask.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
But I doubt she dislikes them.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
Wait, Kryuger,
are you saying...?

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
I am. If we've come
to a dead end...

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
...then we need
to get back to basics.

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
[FN49] So far, so good.
No sign of the enemy.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
That's kinda weird, though.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center
I could've sworn
we had a legit warning.

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
We better not be
wasting our time again.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
Are you complaining
about no enemies?!

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
Whatever--let's go home.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
Commander, this is FNC.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
We haven't found anything
at the signal's origin point.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
Can we, like, go?

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Copy that.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
Do a final sweep of the area
first and then head home.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
Just keep your eyes out
for the enemy and be careful.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
[FNC]
Roger-Dodger.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
We'll report back
if something pops up.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
[FN49 gasps, screams]

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What's that?

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
Dramatics. FN49 freaking out.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
Per ush.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
[FN49]
Help me, FNC! There's a spider!

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
"Watch out for the enemy
and be careful"?

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
Are you their commander
or their mother?

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.727 position:50% align:center
I'm right.
They need to stay alert.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
I think there's more
to it than that.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.440 position:50% align:center
I mean, you still seem pretty
on-edge after what happened

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
with Scarecrow.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
All the repairs have
been completed--

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
there's nothing to worry about.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
I really do.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
[KALINA sighs]

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
--[KALINA] Ah.
--[GENTIANE] Mm?

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.628 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] It seems you're doing
a good job with your missions.

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
Not like the tasks are
especially challenging.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
Getting bored, are we?

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
I didn't say that.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
Well, then, perhaps
you're ready for a mission

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
with much higher stakes.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
If you fail this one,
then Griffin will be destroyed.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
And humanity won't last
for very long after that.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
And why would you want to place
me under that kind of pressure?

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:43.862 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] This is M4A1.
She's a Doll with 16LAB.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What's that?

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN] An organization that
provides technology to Griffin.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.579 position:50% align:center
M4A1. Scarecrow mentioned her.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
So you remember. She ran
into trouble with the Sangvis

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
during a mission somewhere
in the S-0-9 area,

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
and now it appears
she's gone missing.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
I need you to go
find her before they do.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
We're analyzing the coordinates

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Scarecrow recently provided.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
We'll contact you as soon
as they're available.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, our main forces
won't be able to help you fight

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
Sangvis this time around.
It's up to you.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
You can ask the client
for more details.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
What client?

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
That would be the lead
researcher over at 16LAB.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
All right, Commander, I'd like
you to meet Persica from 16LAB.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA]
Hi there, ho there.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Uh, hello?

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
What's with the cat ears...?

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
Ask her anything
about the Dolls.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
She developed the technology
they're known for!

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.213 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Huh?

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50% align:center
--[timer dings]
--Hold up.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
I need to get something.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.762 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hopefully her shoes...

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] So, uh,
why did Kalina refer to you

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
as "the client"?

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
Cannot believe I forgot
the sugar cube...

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA] Anyway, a friend of
mine left some data behind.

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
I deployed the AR Team
to recover it for me.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
But the Sangvis attacked them,
and they were separated.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
That wasn't part of the deal.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Has anything
been reported since then?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
Yeah, just yesterday, actually.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Yesterday?

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
[PERSICA] I got a message that
I could barely understand.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
It was short
and it was from M4A1.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
She's alone but safe,
for now, at least.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
I told her to chill 'cause
Griffin is working on

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
a rescue type beat.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
Can you give us the coordinates
from where she contacted you?

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.485 position:50% align:center
Of course it's cold.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Okay. Now, this is interesting.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
Here is the location where
FNC told us she had detected

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
a strange signal.
And this is where the message

00:08:57.245 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
Persica was talking
about came from.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
It's in the same spot.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
Which means, she was
there when they were.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
But why wouldn't
she want them to know?

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
Persica can be kinda vague.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
Maybe she withholding
intel for a reason?

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's possible.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
Kalina.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
Gentiane?

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need more data.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
Way more. On M4A1
and the entire AR Team.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
Think you can do that?
Everything you can find.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
You need all that info?
Well, okay, I guess.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
But just so you know,

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.323 position:50% align:center
that's not really part of
my job description.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
Luckily, I like you.
So, ya know, you're welcome!

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
Pardon me!

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hi, MP5. What's wrong?

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:44.042 position:50% align:center
[MP5] Nothing. It's just
that Kalina said that

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
you'd been feeling
a little down lately.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
Did she, now?

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
Others have said the same thing.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Like who?

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
Um... FNC and P7.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Well... that's
not true and I'm fine.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
--I think.
--I hope so.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
And I hope
you know we're fine, too!

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm?

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
We're T-Dolls--this is
what we're made for.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
Kalina, Helian,
and the entire Griffin corp

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
is working hard to assist us.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.110 position:50% align:center
If we draw out
our full strength,

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
I know we can do it together!

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
So, please, use us however
you need to in order

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
to complete your mission.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
worry about us!

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
We all backup
our memories constantly!

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.666 position:50% align:center
I'm still me! I'm MP5!

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE chuckles]

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--Thanks so much.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
Uh...

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Sorry, I did my best,
but I couldn't get much.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
There were locks on
the AR Team's data.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
I could only get permission for
this specific training footage.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
That'll be plenty.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
So I'm looking at the AR Team?

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Yep.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
SOPII.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
AR15.

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
M16.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
And there she is. That's M4A1.
She's their leader.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
No heat signatures.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
Nothing on infrared.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
I say we just go in.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
Nobody's in there.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
No, don't. Just because
no one is there

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean
nothing will happen.

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
Ugh, fine.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
Well, the boss lady has spoken.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
Boo.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
[AR15] There's no change
in air density.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
Roger that. Deploying map.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
[M4] Lobby in the middle...
Hallway on the right...

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
Vault dead ahead.

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.153 position:50% align:center
Okay. We're heading in.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
All clear!

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:54.673 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Okay!

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Hmm...

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
Cle--

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50% align:center
There ya go. Now we're clear.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Oh, oops, sorry about that!

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center
This is from
after their training.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
I'll stop it.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50% align:center
No, let me see it.

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
[SOPII slurps]
Ugh-- Gross!

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
There's no milk or sugar
in here! It's so bitter!

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Maybe it's a sign that
you should lay off the sweets.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
I mean, you almost failed
today's training exercise.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
I apologized for that!
No need to rub it in!

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
Both of you need to calm down.

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
That's right. M4 doesn't need
trouble from you two.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
--That is bitter. Oh, wow.
--Told you!

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
[AR15] You can always use a
little gun oil instead of milk.

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
I can't drink oil, duh!

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
Why would you
even suggest that?!

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center
--Like, would you drink oil?!
--[AR15] Why are you so loud?

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
I knew girls like them
back at school.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.981 position:50% align:center
Even while everybody
else is having fun,

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
she's staying focused.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
Still watching--
even the small stuff.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
And she's not easily swayed
by others' complaints.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
She's stubborn, in a way,
and won't give in

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
when it really counts, but she
always puts the others first

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
and herself last.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
M4A1... I can see her now.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] M4A1 didn't contact
FNC's team because she didn't

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
want to involve them.
In her mind,

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
that's what was best for all.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
She knew that Sangvis was
after her, and what's more,

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
she knew they were close.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
I bet it's the one Scarecrow
contacted in her last message--

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
the High-End Model.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.565 position:50% align:center
If she joins up with other
Griffin Dolls in this area,

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
she'll stand out, and
the High-End Model will be

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
more likely to catch her.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center
She'd think things
through and realize that.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
She has to know she can't
avoid contacting them forever.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
She wants to safely
meet with allies.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
And, at the same time,
be on alert for enemies.

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
Commander, Helian says
she's finished calculating

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
the coordinates you need.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.883 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Great timing. Could
you put it on the map for me?

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Hmm. Thought you'd never ask!

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
I found you, M4A1!

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:18.108 position:50% align:center
[MG3] And there we go!
That's the last of them, right?

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
I think we should check again.

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
We need to be
extra careful out here.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
I promise everything is fine
unless another Sangvis pops up.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
Wait! I hear something.

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
That's a powerful
Sangvis signal!

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
They're close by!

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?! But how?!

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
Where are they?!

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER]
I'm over here!

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Griffin turdlettes!

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
[MG3]
Frikkin Sangvis shitboss!

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
Damn it! You're not
leaving here intact!

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
MG3, please!
You need to calm down!

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
Like I'd play with a pair
of defective Dolls.

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:50.807 position:50% align:center
Talk about a waste of my time.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
I'm here for
a very specific Doll.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
Answer my questions,
and I'll let you go.

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
She's got black hair,
a stupid-looking face,

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
and carries an M4A1 carbine.
Do you know where she is?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
"Black hair"?

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.821 position:50% align:center
"Stupid face"?

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
Never seen her.

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
So even with all the Griffin
trash littering the area,

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
she's still running away?

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.704 position:50% align:center
She must be incredibly
afraid of me.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see how much
longer you can run, M4!

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
She just left?!

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
What was she doing here
in the first place?

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
Given the timing and the
questions she was asking...

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.221 position:50% align:center
[MG3]
Yeah?

00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
[MP5] ...I have a feeling the
Doll that she's looking for

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
is the same one the commander
has us out here trying to find.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
[MG3] Sure, that would make
sense, but all we've run into

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
is a Sangvis recon team. You
think we're in the wrong spot?

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But even if
she's not hiding here,

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
we might be able to find a clue.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER]
Looks like she ran this way.

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:10.553 position:50% align:center
Dumb bitch just won't stay put.

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
Hmm?

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
Don't move.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIONER] How cute,
she put up booby traps.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
Hah!

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
Find an alternate route.

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
Did she honestly
think I'd fall for such

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
a half-assed novice tactic?

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
How can she manage
that kind of accuracy

[EXECUTIONER] Hmph!
Those traps must've been bait

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
to lure us here.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.668 position:50% align:center
Get back! Leave the area!

Hey, Jaegers!

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
Back me up!

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
You were able to utilize the
terrain as part of your plan.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
So... that means you have
a command module.

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
That explains how you
managed to run for weeks,

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
like a starved sewer rat.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I was crafted
with a very short fuse.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
I don't have time to play
your dolly-girl games.

are far more superior!

[EXECUTIONER] That idiot went
and sacrificed herself.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
All for the feeble hope
of catching you.

So, please, don't disappoint me!

Don't you have a plan,
Commander?

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
Quit wasting my time!

I knew you civilian Dolls
were weak,

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
but at least put up a fight!

[EXECUTIONER] Silly me.
I shouldn't tear you apart.

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
I still need some
answers from you,

Hey, come and prop her up.

[MP5 panting]
Are you okay?!

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
You got the message.
That's great.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
[MP5]
We did. The commander helped.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
What the--?!

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
Those damn, rusty Griffin
tincans, how did they find us?

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
[M4]
I told them, obviously.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
I left a message saying that
I was going to lure you

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
to this location.
And they received it.

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
Their commander
ordered them here.

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
When did you contact them?!
I didn't see any message!

I know, that was the point.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
[M4] I took a gamble and hid
a data disk then moved on.

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
[M4] You were so focused
on finding me,

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
that you didn't bother thinking
about what I was doing

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
during that time.

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
You never thought about why.

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
Never looked for clues to piece
together my motivation.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
And you certainly never
thought that obsolete Dolls

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
would discover the clues--

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
that they'd notice every
detail you chose to ignore.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
You didn't think that their
commander would piece it

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
all together and give them
the perfect orders, did you?

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
That's the difference
between you and us.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
Between you and Griffin!

[EXECUTIONER growls]

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.948 position:50% align:center
[M4] So tell me, what would be
the ideal way to finish you off?

00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? You think that's
all it takes to end this?

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
Finish me and jump into
a pile of Griffin trash?

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
Like they'll protect
you from us?

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
Meaning?

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
What about the other three?

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
They're still out there,
aren't they?

[M4 grunts]

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
Sure, you're safe with Griffin,

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center

Heh. Whatever you say.

You should know...
you won't prevail.

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:08.912 position:50% align:center
Shoot all you like...

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:12.999 position:50% align:center
...but it... will...
never work...

Come on. Let's go, M4A1.

00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:22.634 position:50% align:center

00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:24.260 position:50% align:center

AR15, SOPII...

00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:38.066 position:50% align:center
I did it. Wait for me.

[sighs]

00:22:44.698 --> 00:22:46.324 position:50% align:center
[M4]
I won't abandon you.

00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:49.994 position:50% align:center

No one will be left behind.
