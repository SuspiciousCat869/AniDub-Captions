[NARRATOR] M4A1 successfully
reunited with SOPII

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:17.517 position:50% align:center
under the command of Gentiane.
a new Griffin Commander.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.647 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, AR15 was still
nowhere to be found.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] You desperately
need our help to rescue them.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.485 position:50% align:center
Am I getting warm?

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.198 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] I realize that
was probably hard on you.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
Elite Dolls aren't used to
fighting this way, I know.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well...

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] It's not fair,
and I don't want to lose them.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
After you left,
where did she go?

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
She just took off.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
Acted as a decoy
so I could get away.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50% align:center
Hunter is dangerous,
and clever, too.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.843 position:50% align:center
We need to hurry.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
AR15 could be
in serious trouble.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
Now that things are settled
here, we can go save her!

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Rescuing her will have to wait.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.104 position:50% align:center
A real hunter is patient,
waiting silently for her prey.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.820 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Based on our information,

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.655 position:50% align:center
we believe that Sangvis
is manufacturing their

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50% align:center
reinforcements here.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
Useful intel.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center
Command will be both eager
and pleased to hear this.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
Hmm.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.792 position:50% align:center
[SOPII growls]

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:29.089 position:50% align:center
M4 said that all of you
would want to help us.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
--[HELIAN] Commander Gentiane?
--Huh?

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:32.842 position:50% align:center
If there's nothing else
you need from me,

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.219 position:50% align:center
I'd like to end the call now.

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:37.597 position:50% align:center
--[GENTIANE] Hmm.
--[HELIAN] Hmm?

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:38.890 position:50% align:center
Is there a problem?

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:42.519 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE sighs]
Actually, there is something

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.270 position:50% align:center
that has me concerned.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:47.148 position:50% align:center
Please excuse me.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.275 position:50% align:center
[SOPII sobbing]

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Goodness, what is going on?

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.072 position:50% align:center
Too much to get into right now.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.699 position:50% align:center
I'll make this quick, then.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.451 position:50% align:center
I've been told there's a new
mission about to begin.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.413 position:50% align:center
The commander says if
you want to save AR15,

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:04.499 position:50% align:center
then please come to the briefing
room within 15 minutes.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
[SOPII gasps]
Okay! I'm going!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
She said there wouldn't
be any more missions.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.216 position:50% align:center
She's human.
Sometimes, the things they say

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.635 position:50% align:center
and the things they do
are contradictory.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.139 position:50% align:center
Hmph. Thankfully, as dolls,
we don't have that problem.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
[SOPII]
Huh?

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't I know you?

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Yes, we met on a mission.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
I'm PPSh-41!
You're M4A1, right?

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting for the
opportunity to say thank you!

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
That's kind of you,
and I'm glad you're safe.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
[SKORPION chuckles] I gotta say,
you did cut it pretty close.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
If the commander's team
had gotten there any later,

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
who knows where we would be?

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
I truly am sorry.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
My orders put you all in danger.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
[FNC]
Oh, please.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should've thought of
that before you and your group

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
manipulated them all.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
We tried to...

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
FNC! If it weren't for M4,

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
the Sangvis would've slaughtered
every single one of us.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
That means we would've had to
be fully restored from backups

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
and given entirely new bodies.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
They saved me, too,
just so you know.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
I was able to escap the Agents
thanks to those tactics.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
I know I'm grateful.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
Fine. Whatever.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
But I'd really like to know what
kind of commander thinks

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
leaving their Dolls behind
is a good idea?

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
[SKORPION growls]

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.474 position:50% align:center
Don't listen to her.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
We're so grateful
for your heroic efforts.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
It's now time for the briefing.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
Let's all head to
the secondary level.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] We've identified
the ringleader of S09.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
SP-721, or Hunter,

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
a dangerous Sangvis
High-End Model.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] This is the area
currently under her control.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.755 position:50% align:center
She also has a very large base.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
It's safe to assume that
the forces she leads

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
are quite strong, and we
should proceed with caution.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
We'll be executing a
reconnaissance mission

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
on their base of operations,

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
and providing all
relevant data to HQ.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
Your infiltration
route is shown here.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
Now, other Griffin units
will be there on-scene

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
to offer support
for this mission.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
Find them when you arrive.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Huh?

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Double check the list
of participants and make sure

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.366 position:50% align:center
that you all get
the equipment you'll need.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
Dismissed!

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50% align:center
[M4]
I'm coming, AR15. Hold on.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
What's it looking like?

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.309 position:50% align:center
Large amounts
of Sangvis signals.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
Everyone, prepare for combat.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
This is a recon assignment.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
Keep that in mind.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center
[SOPII groans]

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
The first unit has arrived
at their destination point.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
Launching the drone.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
--Ah.
--Huh?

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
The commander wasn't kidding.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
There are a ton
of 'em down there.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
That's Sangvis for you.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
One ringleader's all it takes.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
She can create
an entire army on her own.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
You're far more limited in terms
of the dummies you can make.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
Sangvis Dolls are inferior
to you on a one-to-one basis.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
So they make up
for it in numbers.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
[gasps] G36, move
the drone into area 3B!

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Roger that.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
Secret transport line?

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
It looks like there's no point
trying to wait them out.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.889 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis AI is too advanced
for a tactic like that to work.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kalina?

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.685 position:50% align:center
I need to know the status
of all of our Dolls

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
and an inventory
of our materials.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
This looks like
it'll be a big one.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] I just looked up M4's
data and it's a little odd.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
I wonder if maintenance
wasn't fully completed?

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
If it won't interfere with
the mission, then leave it.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
Let's just focus
on the job ahead.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.290 position:50% align:center
[KALINA]
Copy!

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
With that many on the outside,
you know there's gotta be

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
a ton of them waiting
for us on the inside, too.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50% align:center
[M4 grunts]

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] G36, scan the base's
internals with a drone.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50% align:center
Then stand by.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
Roger.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
That's all?

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] M4, have
you forgotten the purpose

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
of this mission?

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
No, ma'am.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
We're here as the recon team.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
So we are only
expected to gather info.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.984 position:50% align:center
[M4 growls]

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50% align:center
If that's the case, then,
why do we need our equipment?

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER]
Heh. Well, how 'bout that?

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
M4A1 showed up.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
--[M4 gasps]
--[MP5, FNC gasp]

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
I can hear somebody on
the open channel!

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
--[HUNTER laughs]
--Hold on, is that her?

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
It's Hunter!

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
How cute.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
They brought
the little one with them.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
So this is the ringleader?

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] Did you honestly
think I wouldn't catch you?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
You made it so easy.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center

I'm sorry.

It's all my fault.

Oh, how moving!

she's still alive,

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you realize
what you should do next.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center
When you surrender, M4A1,
I'll happily return AR15.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] I'd decide
quickly if I were you.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
I have a number of ways to deal
with Griffin's hapless forces.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
You'll never be good enough
to take this base.

but it's extremely faint.

I know what you're thinking, M4.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
But please consider
the enemy base!

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
You make one reckless move and
your entire squad's in danger.

what do you think they'll do?

[AR15 growls]

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
Aw, what's this face?
Did I hurt you too much?

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:42.142 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised, actually.
You don't look weak.

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just
kill me instead?

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
All in good time.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
You honestly believe
M4A1 will save you?

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
I do. The human
commander is in charge

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
of giving all her orders now.

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
It's not like she can make
that decision herself.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER] I'm fairly certain that
AR Team can make their own

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.665 position:50% align:center
personal decisions, right?

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center

having to choose between you

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
or her mission.
Can't wait to see!

Hmph!

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
[HUNTER]
Hmm?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
What was it you said about
a hunter waiting silently

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
for her prey? Might want
to work on that one a bit.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
You never stop talking.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
[growls]
You shut up!

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
What are you thinking?

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking you were right.

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
We can't abandon our friends.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.151 position:50% align:center
I believe AR15
would make the same call

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
if she were in my place.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center

Mm.

Hey, SOPII.

I wanted to remind you that
you're in charge of AR Team!

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
It's your job to lead us
all into victory!

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
So don't forget!

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center

I see smoke rising from
the Sangvis base.

Looks like there was
some kind of explosion.

So, um... What do we do?

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center

[GENTIANE] Helian, please
tell me you're seeing this.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis Dolls have
started shooting each other.

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
We don't know what prompted it,
but it's a perfect opportunity--

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
we should attack while
they're distracted.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
I agree.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center
If we take this base, future
missions will be much easier.

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
Your new objective is to wipe
out all the Sangvis there.

You are now authorized
to command the mission.

request that your units

join us for this.

Where would you like
to have us stationed?

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
This is a Sangvis transport hub.

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
There are large amounts of
enemies and supplies onsite.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center
The area is surrounded
by walls with gun turrets.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
There's also
a platform for the trains.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
Moments ago, the Sangvis
Dolls suddenly began

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
attacking each other for
some unknown reason.

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
Since their platform has been
damaged, they won't be able

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
to resupply for a while.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
This is our only chance
to take down that base.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
That makes sense to me.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
I completely agree with
Commander Gentiane's assessment.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center
I don't think we have enough
firepower between us.

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
Even if the Sangvis
are fighting each other,

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
breaking through those
defenses will be tricky.

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'll help
if I explain my plan.

is actually pretty simple.

It'll take much more
than that to keep me out.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
This'll be easy.

It's true. I could
see that your speed

the route you'd take.
