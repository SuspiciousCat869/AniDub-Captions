00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.346 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] While pursuing
the escaped AR15,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
Squad Negev was surrounded
by a huge army of Sangvis

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
and cut off from their backup.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center
M4A1 was able to rescue them
before going missing herself.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center
[M4]
There are so many of them.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.235 position:50% align:center
I'm not certain we could help.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
There are too many enemies here!

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
Let's head to the planetarium.
We'll wait for backup.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST]
They've certainly got stamina.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
But for how long?

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
[TAVOR] Be honest. What is your
opinion of the AR15 Doll?

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
The one who vanished?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] All right, AR Team,
you're permitted to link up

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
with Squad Negev.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV] You're about to see
how a combat specialist fights!

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
[M4] If so, what are
we planning to do?

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50% align:center
[M4] What if we tell her
we we're taking her home?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
Would she want to at this point?

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:01.895 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
It's time to wake up...

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
...M4A1.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
[AR15] I need an answer
to my question, M4A1.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:24.292 position:50% align:center
You were dreaming, weren't you?
It was about memories you have.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.046 position:50% align:center
[M4]
Yes, you're right.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
Though, they're
fragmented memories,

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.593 position:50% align:center
I could see and hear.

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.595 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Tell me what you saw.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.182 position:50% align:center
I had gone back to the first
time I'd awakened, and...

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.768 position:50% align:center
...I heard you telling
me to wake up.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.770 position:50% align:center
I'm certain it was you.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:48.692 position:50% align:center
All right, I'll ask
one final question.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.735 position:50% align:center
Do you remember who you are?

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.446 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What do you mean?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.031 position:50% align:center
Answer the question.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
I'm giving everyone a chance to
survive here, so don't blow it.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:03.623 position:50% align:center
Tell me, M4A1.
Do you remember who are you?

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.294 position:50% align:center
I need an answer.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:14.050 position:50% align:center
[M4] Tell me who you are.
And what this is about.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.261 position:50% align:center
It's about finding the answer.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:19.389 position:50% align:center
To the question
of who you are exactly.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.727 position:50% align:center
[M4] I am a Doll currently
employed by Griffin.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.397 position:50% align:center
I'm also a member of AR Team.
Does that work?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
I don't know what else to say.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.734 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
No, it does not.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.194 position:50% align:center
I'm looking for
a specific answer.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
Who are you, M4A1?

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:39.034 position:50% align:center
[M4]
I told you everything I know.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.660 position:50% align:center
You've told me
how you are identified,

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center
but not why you were created!

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.123 position:50% align:center
[MASTERMIND] Hurry up! Give me
the answer immediately!

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
[M4 gasps]

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
I don't know! I don't understand
what kind of answer you want!

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.129 position:50% align:center
Just leave me alone,
you evil bitch!

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
What's this about?!
I don't know who you are!

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
None of this makes sense!
Just go! Leave me alone!

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
[MASTERMIND]
Why are you so mean?

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why you
can't you be as nice to me

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
as you always are to
the others, but it's not fair.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Because she really
doesn't know the answer.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:14.944 position:50% align:center
[AR15] The neural clouds used
by AR Team are encrypted.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50% align:center
We don't have the right
to view them ourselves.

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
I suppose even Parapluie
can't access them.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.703 position:50% align:center
[MASTERMIND] So you're going
to break your promise?

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're saying?

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
[AR15] I told you from the start
that it would be a long shot.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
[MASTERMIND] I don't like people
who break promises.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
Go ahead, Alchemist.
I'll give you the authority.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
Bring M4A1 here to me.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
I don't need to waste
my time with the others.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.764 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST]
Did you hear that, AR15?

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
Good things come
to those who wait!

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.769 position:50% align:center
Meaning, I'll get
to crush you myself!

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Too bad I'm not going
to let you win that easily.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Good news, Master.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
We've succeeded in
linking up with Squad Negev.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
[UZI]
Aw, yeah, it's ammo time!

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
[G36] It appears that
the Sangvis are still

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
growing in number. They're
gathering in this area, too.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
You're not wrong. I'm hearing
the same thing from HQ.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center
Work together
to get out of there.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
The enemy is blocking our
routes, so standby.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE] Head for
the urban area at X88CQ.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.935 position:50% align:center
We're not detecting
any Sangvis there yet.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
[G36]
Roger that, Commander.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.648 position:50% align:center
Kalina, can we put
together a rescue team?

00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
[KALINA] Unfortunately, only
handguns are available now.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
And if we're hoping for
reinforcements from the rear,

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
it's gonna take some time.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
Just get it done soon.
Thank you.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST]
And so the hunt begins!

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
Good luck, Griffin brats.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
I am so looking forward
to seeing you, Negev.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
Oh, what fun.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
Don't even start with me.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center
I'm not in the best
mood right now.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
For your own good, you'd best
pray we don't meet, Alchemist.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
And when we inevitably do,
I can't wait to see you

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
writhe in wonderous agony!

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50% align:center
Are we under
the Parapluie umbrella again?

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
What do we do now?

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV] We'll head for
the city area as planned.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
We can't stall as the enemies
are quickly gaining on us.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
Once we arrive, we can link up
with the reinforcements

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
your commander sent.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
Personally, I find there's
nothing more exciting

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
than bathing in the blood of
a much-hated enemy.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST grunts]
AR15!

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
[AR15 grunts]

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
You can stay here if you want.

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
Just know that your friends
in the back won't make it out.

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Why? What did you do?

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST] Simply taunted 'em
into going where I wanted 'em.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
It won't be long now.
They'll be completely isolated.

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.491 position:50% align:center
[NEGEV]
How are there so many of them?!

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
Our intel didn't
prepare us for this!

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
[TAVOR] I never detected
any of their signals.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
It's as though they
came out of nowhere.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.625 position:50% align:center
It's a trap. I hate
to think we fell for it,

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
but seems like Alchemist
was bait to lure us out.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
[ALCHEMIST] Your choice.
Tell me where M4A1 is hidden,

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
or watch your little Doll
friends be ripped apart

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
piece by piece!

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center
I've been given orders
to protect M4,

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center
and I have no intention
of compromising them.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
What an honorable existence
you have chosen to lead.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
I hope it's worth seeing the
slow death of the Griffin Dolls.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
You don't intimidate me,
Alchemist!

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
You want to play these sick
games, then do your worst!

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
No matter what,
one thing is certain.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
Someone is going to die today.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.620 position:50% align:center
And it's gonna be
either you or me!

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
[HELIAN]
Do you read me M16?

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
I believe you've been
given a retreat order.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.045 position:50% align:center
Can you explain why there
are still so many Dolls here?

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center
Their signals
must've been cut off.

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
This town is swarming
with Sangvis right now.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:32.095 position:50% align:center
[GENTIANE]
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
That Alchemist...

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
She was a decoy to draw
our forces to the city.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
In fact, a Ringleader
isn't commanding them.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
These orders
are originating from

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
an entirely different source.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
I take full responsibility for
failing to anticipate her plan.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
[M16]
Commander, where's backup?

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
Are they coming?

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
It's far too dangerous
to send any to that area now.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
There's no way to put together
a unit with enough firepower

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
to stand up against the enemy.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
We'd need more Dolls.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.336 position:50% align:center
But there's no time bring in
new ones from a rear base.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
[M16]
But without reinforcements,

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
they'll all be wiped out!

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
Can you at least send
a rescue helicopter?

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center

What have you been
doing all this time?

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
Recently, I was examining
Sangvis databases

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
and accidentally activated
a jamming device.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
It caused all the communication

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
[M16] And you think it
interfered with Parapluie, too?

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.716 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Exactly. I was so afraid
that it would negatively affect

I went back to Area S08.

she can to kill us.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
Well, not all of us.
She'll protect M4.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
And that's why
you're going to find her?

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center
What do you think will happen
when she captures you?

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
She's not going
to capture me alive.

in the building.

it was my last wish

Can you hear me?!

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
Hey, SOPII...

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
[MASTERMIND] I don't
understand why you're here.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
I want to see M4A1.
Where is she?

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
She's being protected
by the Griffin T-Dolls.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
Which means that she's
out of your grasp forever.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
[MASTERMIND]
Then you bring M4A1 to me.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting up this time.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
I know.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
And that's why
I came to stop you.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
Because you're the most
dangerous enemy of them all.

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
You're the Sangvis Mastermind!

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
[MASTERMIND]
How foolish of me to believe

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
you'd keep your promise.

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
I'll not make that
same mistake again.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
[AR15] Not even Parapluie can
give you the type of control

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
you want over me.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
I'll be whatever I have to be!

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
As long as I can
finally get my revenge!

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:56.743 position:50% align:center
This is what war looks like.
Do you think you can handle it?

Hurry it up!

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.881 position:50% align:center
The Sangvis are
almost right on top of us!

--[SOPII] Ah?
--Is that M16?

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
No, wait. What's going on?

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
Where is she?
Where is AR15?

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:26.898 position:50% align:center
She's not here. She decided
to choose her own path.

[M4 gasps]

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
[MASTERMIND]
Threaten all you want,

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
it will have no effect on me.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.699 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I'm going
to say my piece anyway.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
You can go to Hell.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center

No... No!

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
Talk to me.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
It's wrong.
All of this is wrong.

--Hey!
--What the--?

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?!

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.978 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
How would you understand, M4?

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
[AR15] When I first
arrived in this world,

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
I was flooded with
excitement and curiosity.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
I wasn't a mass-produced model.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
I was an elite,
created by 16LAB!

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
My strongest desire was
to complete a glorious mission.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
I also wanted to become comrades
with tough and powerful Dolls.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
Back then, I thought all it
would take was hard work,

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
and eventually,
I would become a star.

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
[AR15] But it wasn't long
before the illusion faded.

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
I was made to obey your orders.

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
I was suddenly
tied down to AR Team.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
That loud, stupid idiot, SOPII.

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
The tactless boor, M16.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
And you, who couldn't make
a decision to save your life.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
In that moment,
every possibility

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
I'd imagined was stolen.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
Because of all this and more,
I hated you,

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.786 position:50% align:center
and there was nothing
I could do about it.

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
But soon enough...
I realized you needed me.

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
And it didn't matter
who you were anymore,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.128 position:50% align:center
as long as you
continued to need me!

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to be
worth something again.

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
That was all it was.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
I stopped caring
about everything.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
I took advantage
of your naïveite

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
and did all kinds
of awful things.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
But... I apologize.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
It's only as I'm about
to say goodbye to you

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
that I understand.
My wish already came true.

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
It happened a long time ago.
I just didn't see it.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
All the people we met,
and all the things we've done.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
I feel satisfied
with these memories

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
from the bottom of my heart.

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I have to
pay you all back somehow.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
Whether that's buying each one
of you even a second of time,

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
or maybe just saving one of you
from a devastating situation.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
That is my last wish.

00:20:57.632 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
Now I will no longer
owe this world anything.

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
And then I think about how
pathetic and ugly you'll look

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
when you find me lifeless
and start crying.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.351 position:50% align:center
[M4 panting]

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
So dramatic...

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
I've always had a crybaby for
a commander, haven't I?

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
Seriously... How many
times have you slowed me down

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.360 position:50% align:center
when we've needed to move?

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
With everything inside me...

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
...I truly do hate you!

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
[AR15] There's no getting
out of it this time.

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center
This is goodbye, M4.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
if you're sad or angry.

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:40.675 position:50% align:center
Whether you remember me fondly

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
or choose to forget
me instantly. It's done.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
I hope this memory
has a lasting effect.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
I hope it gives you power
and makes you stronger!

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
[AR15]
Now... it's over.

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:57.692 position:50% align:center
Goodbye... my friend.

00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:14.876 position:50% align:center
No. AR15...

[M16] This is M16,

We've all left the combat area.

[GENTIANE]
Roger that.

00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:43.238 position:50% align:center
When you return,
this mission will be completed.

00:24:12.744 --> 00:24:14.412 position:50% align:center
And the plan's going well?

00:24:14.496 --> 00:24:16.164 position:50% align:center
I hope?

00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:19.834 position:50% align:center
It is. I found
a replacement for AR15.

a little longer.

At least until
