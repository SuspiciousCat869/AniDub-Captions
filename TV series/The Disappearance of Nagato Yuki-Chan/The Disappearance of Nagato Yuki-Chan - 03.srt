1
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,541
[KYON, NAGATO]
Huh?

2
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,541
[KYON, NAGATO yell]

3
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,125
[KYON]
Quick! Call an ambulance!

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,541
[NAGATO]
Right. On it!

5
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,041
[KYON grunts]

6
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,041
[HARUHI] Get a grip on yourself!
I don't need an ambulance!

7
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,416
What I need is a warm room
with a good heater, now,

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
find me one!

9
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,958
Do it right now!

10
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,791
[HARUHI sighs]
I feel human again!

11
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,500
[panting]

12
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,625
So who are you people, anyway?

13
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,791
Us?!

14
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,041
[HARUHI] I mean, I'm not
trying to be rude,

15
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,166
but that panting's kinda creepy.

16
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,416
You were laying in the street,

17
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,875
shivering like you
were about to die

18
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,791
and demanded to be taken
someplace warm immediately.

19
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,541
I carried you.

20
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,083
You actually carried me?

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,333
Don't you think that's
overdoing it a little?

22
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,916
[KYON] You didn't really
give me much choice.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,291
What's it like
to go through life

24
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,041
without a sense of humor?

25
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,000
What?

26
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't get me
wrong or anything.

27
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,041
I do appreciate your help.

28
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,791
It's gotta be
hard on you, though:

29
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,458
having a boyfriend with
no sense of humor.

30
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,583
[NAGATO]
Hm?

31
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,750
Huh?

32
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,166
Hey!

33
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,750
Hello? I'm talking to you!
You are his girlfriend, right?

34
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:16,625
I am not!

35
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,416
[gasps]

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,875
Uh-- You've got it wrong!

37
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,750
We're just, well, you know,
we're not, things aren't,

38
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,958
it isn't-- It's kind
of complicated.

39
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,916
Wait, no, I didn't mean that!
We're in the same club!

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,125
Two people who happen
to be in a club together,

41
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,166
nothing more. We're
practically strangers!

42
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,583
[KYON coughs]

43
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,500
Wow! You don't
sugarcoat much, do ya?

44
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,916
[NAGATO]
Huh?

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
"Practically strangers"?
Is knowing him really that bad?

46
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,000
[gasps]

47
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,208
Geez, Nagato.

48
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,958
We haven't known
each other that long,

49
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,041
but I thought I'd
at least earned

50
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,708
the rank of "friend" by now.

51
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,166
[NAGATO]
Oh. When did that happen?

52
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,125
It's okay to call him my friend?

53
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,750
He wants me to
call him my friend?

54
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,916
[giggles] Well, of
course we're friends.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,916
[HARUHI, HARUHI]
Yeah, great save.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,750
[HARUHI]
Well. I'll be honest with you.

57
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,500
If you guys aren't dating,
I think we're going

58
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,708
to get along a lot better.

59
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,958
I don't get people who waste
their time in relationships.

60
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,375
Yeah...

61
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,125
So, you know.

62
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,458
It's not because I had my
heart broken or anything.

63
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,250
[KYON, NAGATO]
What?

64
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,666
Don't act surprised!

65
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,875
I could tell that's
what you were thinkin'.

66
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,416
Well, we can't have that.

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,791
I think it's important to
set the record straight.

68
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,125
So, here we go.

69
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,166
There are some things
you need to know about me.

70
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,958
First of all, I'm not
interested in ordinary people,

71
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,958
and I'm certainly not
interested in relationships.

72
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,750
What I am interested
in is aliens!

73
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,125
[phone rings]

74
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,750
[NAGATO]
Sorry, excuse me.

75
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,041
Oh, looks like I got
a text from Asakura.

76
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,708
"Hey Kyon. Nagato.

77
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,500
You should be at
the clubroom. Now."

78
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,583
That's right!

79
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,958
We're supposed to
help her clean up!

80
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,541
[HARUHI]
I think we're done here.

81
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,000
The feeling has returned
to my arms and legs,

82
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,000
and it sounds like there's
someplace you need to be,

83
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,375
so let's go.

84
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,625
[WAITRESS A] Thanks for
coming. Have a great day!

85
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,583
Oh, you're headed
to North High?

86
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,000
We can go part of
the way together.

87
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,666
Yeah, sure. That sounds great.

88
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,333
I'm Haruhi Suzumiya.

89
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,375
We never did get around
to introductions before.

90
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,041
I find conversations
less awkward

91
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,916
if I know who I'm talking to.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,541
[KYON]
Well, in that case, my name's--

93
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,416
[HARUHI] Kyon, isn't it?
I heard it earlier.

94
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,291
And I'm Yuki Nagato.

95
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,500
Okay, great.

96
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,125
So, do you wanna tell
us how you ended up

97
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,625
collapsed in the
street like that?

98
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,833
[HARUHI]
That's simple.

99
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,625
I was standing in the
park all night long.

100
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,208
[KYON]
Uh, why?

101
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,291
So I could capture Santa.

102
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,416
Oh.

103
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,416
Huh?

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,833
[shrieks]

105
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,708
--[NAGATO, KYON gasp]
--My bag and wallet!

106
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,333
I left them both
back in the park!

107
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,541
[NAGATO, KYON]
What?

108
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,958
Since you insisted on
picking up the tab,

109
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,541
I didn't notice till now!

110
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,083
[KYON]
Insisted?

111
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,333
That's not good!

112
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,291
We have to get back to
the park and find them,

113
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,833
before somebody takes them.

114
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,750
She's right about that.
We should hurry.

115
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,625
Huh? You said "we."
You'd come with me?

116
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,625
Aren't you guys busy?

117
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,166
You can't even ride a train,

118
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,125
not if you don't
have your wallet.

119
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,458
It wouldn't be
very cool of us

120
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,000
to just abandon you
here like this.

121
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,291
Fine. But I move fast.
You better keep up.

122
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,583
That shouldn't be a problem.

123
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,416
It's not like
you're gonna r--

124
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,083
[HARUHI]
Come on! Follow me!

125
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,916
[NAGATO]
Come back.

126
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,958
[gasps]

127
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
Ah!

128
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,250
I found it! Look, here
it is. Nobody took it!

129
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,458
[NAGATO, KYON panting]

130
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,166
[KYON] Good, that
would've been a nightm--

131
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,958
I figured that it would be gone.

132
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,458
It's not like it was
hidden or anything.

133
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:47,041
[KYON] People were probably
too scared to take it.

134
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,541
Ugh. You weren't kidding.

135
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,041
You-- You were really trying
to capture Santa, weren't you?

136
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,333
Well, I told you
I was, didn't I?

137
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,541
[KYON] Unbelievable.
That's the word for you.

138
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,208
You're just realizing it?

139
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,041
You wouldn't believe how
unbelievable I can be!

140
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,500
--[NAGATO] Uh. Excuse me.
--[KYON] Uh, you know that

141
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,583
--Excuse me!
--wasn't a compliment, right?

142
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,958
[KYON, HARUHI]
Huh?

143
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,291
Under the snow, this paint?

144
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,708
It's supposed to be a
message to Santa, right?

145
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,708
How'd you figure that out?

146
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,958
I already knew!

147
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,250
Huh?

148
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,250
I met you before.
When you were "rehearsing."

149
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,208
[HARUHI]
Uh-- Huh?

150
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,458
[NAGATO]
Hm?

151
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,208
You guys've met before,
but you don't remember?

152
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,125
Well. I remember someone,
but it was dark,

153
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,916
so I couldn't make out the face.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,416
Besides, based on the body type,

155
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,208
I assumed it was a
junior high school boy.

156
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,875
You don't remember?
That's awkward.

157
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,333
[HARUHI] No,.. Uh...
I totally remember you!

158
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:47,458
In fact, I was actually testing
to see if you remembered!

159
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,916
Well,

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,041
it's funny, but I've been
hoping I would run into you.

161
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,166
I actually wanted the
chance to thank you.

162
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,250
[HARUHI]
Thank me?

163
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,333
That's right.

164
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,666
I was sort of having
an inner crisis,

165
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,791
but you helped me get past it.

166
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,583
Meeting you gave me
the strength I needed.

167
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,083
So, uh... So, thank--

168
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,833
[HARUHI]
Stop right there!

169
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,500
I didn't do anything for you.

170
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,625
Wha--?

171
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,083
[HARUHI]
I can't think of a single thing

172
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,125
I did that night to help you.

173
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,708
In fact, I'm pretty sure
it was the other way around.

174
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,750
If you found some sort
of inner strength,

175
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,375
that's exactly what it was:

176
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,250
strength from inside you.

177
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,291
Give yourself credit, not me!

178
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,416
[gasps]

179
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,000
That's pretty interesting.

180
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,291
She basically said the same
thing you told me yesterday.

181
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,541
Is that the same?

182
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,791
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm!

183
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,291
[HARUHI] Oooh, so your
mind works the same way

184
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,666
mine does, huh?
Very interesting.

185
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,833
Huh?

186
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,416
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

187
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,208
I only suspected it before,
but now I'm certain.

188
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,416
You are my nemesis.

189
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,916
I totally agree.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,291
There you go, thinking
just like me again!

191
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,291
How can you capture
a man who's not real?

192
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,208
How can you say that
Santa isn't real

193
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,041
when you haven't even
bothered to check?

194
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,458
I'm just being thorough.

195
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,291
You don't need to check
something like that!

196
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,875
Oh yeah? What's your
basis for that argument?

197
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,000
Think about it. You can't
prove a negative,

198
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,833
so there's always a
reason to keep checking.

199
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,791
And of course, that doesn't
only apply to Santa!

200
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,666
My goal is to find aliens,
time travelers, espers,

201
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,708
and people from
parallel universes

202
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,583
and make the world a
cooler place to live in!

203
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,333
[giggles]

204
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,750
[NAGATO, KYON]
Uh...

205
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,375
[NAGATO] She does kind of
rant like a crazy person,

206
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,833
but there's something
to what she says.

207
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:31,875
She's really--

208
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,708
[KYON]
You really are unbelievable.

209
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:38,583
That's right! I am unbelievable.

210
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,958
[NAGATO]
Unbelievable.

211
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,375
You guys are a
little late, huh?

212
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,583
[NAGATO, KYON]
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

213
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,833
Nagato.

214
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,166
Your mission is to
eliminate all decorations.

215
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,500
Yes, sir!

216
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,583
[KYON]
As for me:

217
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,583
I'll be tackling this
Christmas tree.

218
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,083
Now, let's hop to it! Move!

219
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,458
A good Christmas.
And a great party.

220
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,750
[NAGATO]
I'm glad that's done.

221
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,458
[KYON]
It took longer than I thought.

222
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,041
[ASAKURA]
It did take a while.

223
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,791
It would have been done
sooner if two of us

224
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,791
had been more punctual.

225
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,458
We are sorry.

226
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,000
When you say it like that...

227
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,583
How can I not forgive you?

228
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,458
[NAGATO]
All right, well.

229
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,875
Here we are.

230
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,083
Since I won't see you guys
till school starts again,

231
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,291
I guess I'd better wish you
a happy New Year now.

232
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,750
Yeah. Same to you.
See you guys next year.

233
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,291
Uh. Um, I.

234
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,041
[KYON]
Hm?

235
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,458
Just, thank you.

236
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,375
For everything, I'm really
glad you joined the club.

237
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,541
Happy New Year.

238
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm glad, too.
Well, see ya later.

239
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,500
[ASAKURA]
So, how'd it go at the party?

240
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,208
I want details!

241
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,125
Huh? What do you mean?

242
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,583
You know, did you
bare your soul

243
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,125
and tell him how you feel?

244
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:17,666
Oh, that. Well, uh, actually...

245
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,416
I did.

246
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,041
Really? What'd you say?

247
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,416
I told him I was grateful
for what he did.

248
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,416
That he saved the club.

249
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,416
That's better than nothing.

250
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,666
But you know what?
He said it wasn't true.

251
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,875
Huh?

252
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,875
He said I should be
proud of myself instead.

253
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,083
And it's crazy, but
there was actually

254
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,583
somebody else who
said the same thing.

255
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,833
[ASAKURA]
Wow.

256
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,750
You ran into the same
girl again this morning?

257
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,250
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm. Ah! Yummy!

258
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,291
That's right.
I hope you like it.

259
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,458
You know, she was
pretty incredible.

260
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,791
Wow! You're right! This
oden smells fantastic!

261
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,000
[ASAKURA]
Anyway, it must have been nice.

262
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,666
Seeing her again, I mean.

263
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,916
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm.

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,458
You know, though,
you should've asked

265
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,416
Kyon to visit a shrine
with you for the New Year.

266
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,833
[NAGATO]
Ow! It's hot!

267
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,000
Sometimes boys just need
a little bit of a nudge.

268
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,000
For ourselves and
those we love,

269
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,208
watch over us for another year.

270
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,250
Please watch over us.

271
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,291
[ASAKURA] You were praying
quite seriously.

272
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,416
Did you ask for
anything in particular?

273
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,041
Oh, you know.

274
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,208
You're right about
that. I bet I do.

275
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,041
[NAGATO]
Yeah...

276
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,041
[CAPTAIN A] First things
first. Happy New Year!

277
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,666
[TEAMMATES]
Happy New Year!

278
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,958
Enough of that. Listen up!

279
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,500
[KYON] And that means I'm
gonna take it easy again.

280
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,125
[KYON, TEAMMATES]
Yeah!

281
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,125
[yawns]

282
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,416
[KYON]
Huh?

283
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,125
Why're you doin' that?

284
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,958
[KYON]
She's locked on.

285
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,166
[NAGATO]
Huh. What's she doing?

286
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,750
This is it! The end is near!

287
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,041
[footsteps tapping]

288
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:23,875
[KYON]
She's fast!

289
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,541
Hi, there! It's been awhile.

290
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,041
I thought I'd say hi!

291
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,916
I made it to North High
and then I realized

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,708
I didn't know where
to start looking.

293
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,666
So I figured I'd
just trust my gut,

294
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,291
and it led me straight
here. Crazy, huh?

295
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,916
Good to see you again.

296
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,416
So, this is the
Literary Club, huh?

297
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,166
Kinda sad and empty, isn't it?

298
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,833
[KYON] So, did you come here
for any particular reason?

299
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,791
[HARUHI]
Not really.

300
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,541
Just, you know, trespassing.

301
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,666
[KYON]
She makes it sound like a hobby.

302
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,458
Given the uniform, I'm surprised
no one stopped you on the way.

303
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,708
[HARUHI] Yeah, I thought that
might be a problem, too,

304
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,541
and a few people did
look at me kinda funny.

305
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,250
But I guess they assumed
I was here on official business.

306
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,333
[KYON]
Fair enough.

307
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,791
Going by looks alone,
she could pass

308
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,583
for the president of
Kouyouen's student council.

309
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,916
I don't know if
I approve of that

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,083
look on your face at all.

311
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,791
Thanks for coming to visit us.

312
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,250
I'm sure you're really busy.

313
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,583
You can sit down here.

314
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,833
Ok, sure thing. Thanks a lot.

315
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,958
But first, I have
a favor to ask.

316
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,291
What's the favor?

317
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm not breaking
any laws for you.

318
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,291
Nothing like that.

319
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,541
At least, not until we
know each other better.

320
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,208
I need to borrow
your gym clothes.

321
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,291
Huh?

322
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,500
[HARUHI]
You can come in now!

323
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,750
[HARUHI]
Perfect! Now I can totally pass

324
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,208
for an after-school
North High student.

325
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,208
What's the point, though?
You're in already.

326
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,833
[HARUHI]
Hm. I did get in pretty easily.

327
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,291
But I left someone behind
at the school gate, so...

328
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:46,916
[KYON, NAGATO]
Huh?

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,500
He can wear this.

330
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,750
You brought a friend?

331
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,125
Or an enemy.

332
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,875
Who would make a friend wait
outside in this weather?

333
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,583
[HARUHI] Well, two of us would
have stood out even more!

334
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,916
So I told him I'd come
back after I found you

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,416
and got your gym clothes.

336
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,958
But you didn't even know
you'd be able to find us.

337
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,958
[HARUHI] Well, it still worked
out just as I planned.

338
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,208
Hey.

339
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,333
What is it?

340
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,083
Maybe you should put your
hair up in a ponytail.

341
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,208
Why, you have a
thing for ponytails?

342
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,208
[KYON] It was just a
thought, that's all.

343
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,333
[HARUHI]
Hm...

344
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,583
Well. Guess it is
more convincing.

345
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,500
Okay! I'll be right back!

346
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,708
What's wrong? Have you
got a headache?

347
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,875
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

348
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,000
[HARUHI] Here, Koizumi.
Change into this, quickly!

349
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,458
[KOIZUMI]
Er. You want me to change here?

350
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,708
[sighs] Sure, no problem.

351
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,458
I'll just clean this up.

352
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,541
I dunno.

353
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,708
Maybe I should grow my hair out.

354
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,458
[KYON]
What's that?

355
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,250
[NAGATO gasps]

356
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,208
Oh. Well. Um...

357
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,875
Her hair's so pretty,
all long and flowy.

358
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,541
I was just thinking I might
like to grow mine long, too.

359
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,541
Really?

360
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,291
I don't think there's
anything wrong with it now.

361
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,666
Ah...

362
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,583
[KYON] I mean, if you wanna
grow it out, go ahead.

363
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,875
It's your hair.

364
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,000
But I think you look good
with that hairstyle.

365
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,416
[gasps]

366
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,375
[KYON] If you do grow it out,
I recommend a ponytail.

367
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,708
[door slams]

368
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,500
[HARUHI] Whew! We nearly
froze to death out there!

369
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,166
It's obviously your fault
for being so slow!

370
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,833
Sorry about that.

371
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,500
I didn't mean to be slow,
I'm just not used

372
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,916
to changing my clothes
out in public, so.

373
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,291
Hello, by the way.

374
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,291
I'm Itsuki Koizumi. It's
very nice to meet you both.

375
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,291
M-M-Miss Suzumiya,
do you think I could

376
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,083
maybe change now?

377
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,333
Of course not!

378
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,333
A teacher could come in
any second, too risky!

379
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,458
Now listen up and
be amazed! You see.

380
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,166
Koizumi is a mysterious
transfer student!

381
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,666
Mysterious, yeah.
That sounds like me.

382
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,000
[HARUHI] He transferred
over to our school

383
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,416
after orientation day last year.

384
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,791
Pretty strange, huh?
Totally suspicious!

385
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,625
We like to hang out,
and I don't wanna

386
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,750
miss it when he reveals
his true identity.

387
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,750
[KYON] After this long,
he's neither mysterious

388
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,583
nor a transfer student.

389
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,083
What identity are you
expecting him to reveal?

390
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,666
Could be a bunch of things.

391
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,458
Maybe...

392
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,333
It's nice to meet
you, by the way.

393
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,541
Boy, you must have it rough.

394
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,750
Not really.

395
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,708
But I understand why
you would think that.

396
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,458
You're okay with this?

397
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,208
Yeah. Really.

398
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,958
People at our school
do treat Miss Suzumiya

399
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,083
a little differently
than everybody else.

400
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,333
[KYON]
I bet they do.

401
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,583
[KOIZUMI]
But...

402
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,208
Since I transferred
at such a weird time,

403
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:38,208
I wound up pretty
isolated. Until--

404
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,000
Hey, what's your name?

405
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,833
[gasps]

406
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,708
[KOIZUMI] When everyone else
thought I was strange,

407
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,791
she accepted me, just like that.

408
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,750
[KYON]
Oh, really?

409
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,416
Well, she mainly hangs
out with me because

410
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,791
she was intrigued by the
timing of my transfer,

411
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,625
and that can't last.
I think it's fading already,

412
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,458
so I am a little
concerned about that.

413
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,458
[KYON] Sounds like cause
for celebration to me.

414
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:07,250
[KOIZUMI] Not for me.
You see, the thing is,

415
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,041
I think there's a good chance
I'm falling in love with her.

416
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,583
You're crazy!

417
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,500
I happen to find her
utterly charming.

418
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,541
All right, you two,
enough talk!

419
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,916
This is very important,
so listen up!

420
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,708
[KOIZUMI]
Of course! We're listening!

421
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,875
[KYON]
Yeah. What is it now?

422
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,833
Koizumi and I are now
officially members

423
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,083
of the North High Literary
Club's mystery section!

424
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,833
And furthermore, I will be

425
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,666
the Lit. Club's
executive president.

426
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,458
You don't mind just being
a figurehead, now do you?

427
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,166
Uh, no.

428
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,083
[KYON]
A takeover?

429
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,416
Sounds great.

430
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,333
[KYON]
What is with this guy?

431
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,458
[HARUHI]
Now that that's decided,

432
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,375
it's time to make some changes!

433
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,125
This room needs a
serious makeover.

434
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,875
[NAGATO]
Oh, you think so?

435
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,375
Newcomers, huh?

436
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,875
[PLAYER A]
North High.

437
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,500
--[PLAYER A] Fight! Fight!
--[PLAYERS] Yeah! Yeah!

438
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,541
So, you're the Miss Suzumiya
I've heard about.

439
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,666
[HARUHI]
That's right!

440
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,750
[ASAKURA]
You know, we're not supposed

441
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,833
to have outside students
in the clubroom.

442
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,541
That could cause some
problems if people find out.

443
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,958
Yeah, I know.

444
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,666
[ASAKURA] And you're
okay with this, Nagato?

445
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,291
Huh? Yeah.

446
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,500
But, if you don't think
it'll work, then...

447
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,416
As long as you're
all right with it,

448
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,416
then it's fine by me.

449
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,000
Really? It is?

450
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,208
[ASAKURA] At first I thought
this girl was bullying Nagato,

451
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,791
but now I can tell
she's all right.

452
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,666
I can see it in her eyes.

453
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,500
Besides, if they know
they're breaking the rules,

454
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,041
they'll probably behave
themselves well enough.

455
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,625
They're from a
prestigious school,

456
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,625
I doubt they'd wanna jeopardize
their records by being reckless.

457
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,666
--[cackling]
--[KYON] You may wanna

458
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,916
--[cackling]
--rethink that.

459
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,291
She's not just reckless,
she's downright crazy.

460
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,750
[HARUHI, ASAKURA]
Nice to meet you!

461
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,208
[KYON sighs]

462
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,208
[KYON]
The following day.

463
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,125
Hello!

464
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,333
I brought a bunch of
cool stuff for the clubroom!

465
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,083
[KYON]
And the day after that.

466
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,083
Hi, everyone!

467
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,916
More stuff?

468
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,291
[KYON]
Her occupation of our clubroom

469
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,416
was progressing steadily.

470
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,583
Hey! Look what I found!
Isn't she adorable?

471
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,875
I-I don't understand
what's happening.

472
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,208
Will somebody please tell me
why I was brought here?

473
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,333
Miss Asahina, please accept
my sincere apologies.

474
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,083
You already know her? Darn it!

475
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,541
A girl like that?
Everyone knows her.

476
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,875
[HARUHI]
Don't fight it!

477
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,291
[ASAKURA] I'm surprised
you were able to get past

478
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,541
Miss Tsuruya to bring her here.

479
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,625
Oh, the rabid
guard dog, you mean?

480
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,541
We did sustain some losses,
but the danger was neutralized.

481
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,291
Losses?

482
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,833
It might have something
to do with the fact

483
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,666
that the guys haven't made it
back to the clubroom yet.

484
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,416
[gasps]

485
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,875
Sacrifices were made.

486
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,625
But if you had come with us,
we might have been able to

487
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,291
skip the random
encounter battle.

488
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,541
We knew that was a possibility.
That's why we let you have Kyon.

489
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:52,541
Oh. A lot of good that did.
He was basically useless.

490
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,250
[screaming]

491
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,833
I don't think so!

492
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,625
[cackles]

493
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,833

00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,625
[groans]

495
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,583
[KYON gasps]

496
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,041
--[KYON gasps]
--[HARUHI] Hm.

497
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,458
[yelps]

498
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,166
[growls]

499
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,708
[KYON]
Wha--? Uh--

500
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,250
[KYON yells]

501
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,458
[grunts]

502
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,791
N-N-N-N-N-No!

503
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,250
Prepare yourself!

504
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,625
[MORI]
That's enough.

505
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,500
[gasps]

506
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,916
[MORI]
Come on!

507
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,250
You're gonna flash people
jumping around like that.

508
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,333
Is that what you want?

509
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,250
--[HARUHI laughs]
--[MIKURU screams]

510
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,041
[MORI]
You're in trouble now.

511
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,541
[ASAKURA]
So, it all worked out, then.

512
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,208
[HARUHI]
Anyway, this guy, Kyon.

513
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,833
What's the deal with him?

514
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,708
He gets more snarky
with me every day,

515
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,291
and I'm getting tired of it!

516
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,125
And he treats me totally
different than he treats Yuki!

517
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,041
Huh?

518
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,083
[ASAKURA]
How awful for you.

519
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,583
I mean, I'm the
executive president

520
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,916
of this club!

521
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,375
As a regular member,
he should show some respect!

522
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,541
I don't know.

523
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,958
I would think it would
be kind of awkward

524
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,375
if he was groveling
to you all the time.

525
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,583
Huh. You might
have a point there.

526
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,458
It's kind of nice to
have somebody talk to me

527
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,291
--like I'm a regular person.
--[phone vibrates]

528
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,833
Most people treat me like
I'm some kind of weirdo

529
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,541
who might end up flying off
the handle at any moment

530
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,916
if they say something
I don't like.

531
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,541
You say that like
it's no big deal.

532
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,250
[door slams]

533
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,500
[NAGATO, HARUHI]
Huh?

534
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,041
[TSURUYA] Did you think
you could hide forever?

535
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,500
I'm not leaving until
I get Mikuru back.

536
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,958
Eh?

537
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,708
[HARUHI] Well, we're not giving
her up without a fight!

538
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,583
You better get ready!

539
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,833
[KYON groans]

540
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,291
[gasps]

541
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,541
[MIKURU yelps]
Oh, no! Kyon! Are you okay?

542
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,458
[KYON groans]
Huh?

543
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,541
Oh, good. You're all right.
I'm so relieved!

544
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,958
[TSURUYA] Whoa! That's a
cool frog! I want it!

545
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,208
Um...

546
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,666
[HARUHI] Hey, watch it!
Wait 256 million years

547
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,791
and maybe then you can
look at her underwear.

548
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,000
[MIKURU]
What? Noooo!

549
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,125
[KYON] Wait! I swear
I didn't see anything!

550
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,750
[NAGATO] Things used to be
very quiet in this club.

551
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,875
[TSURUYA cackles]

552
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,833
[NAGATO] But something tells
me those days are over now.

553
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,250
[NAGATO] Next episode:
"Be My Valentine."
