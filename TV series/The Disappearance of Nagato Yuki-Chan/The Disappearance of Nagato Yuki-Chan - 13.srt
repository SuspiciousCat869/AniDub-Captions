1
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,000
[NAGATO]
I can't tell.

2
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,958
What is this?

3
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,916
Is this a dream?

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,125
Or are these her memories?

5
00:00:53,208 --> 00:01:05,125
[NAGATO, KYON chattering]

6
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:11,291
[NAGATO] It's like the
world is disappearing.

7
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:15,000
And soon, I'll disappear, too.

8
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,708
[NAGATO]
No! I don't want to!

9
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,666
[KYON]
Nagato.

10
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,666
Nagato!

11
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,875
Okay, there we go! Man,
you're a heavy sleeper.

12
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,416
Here.

13
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:46,666
[KYON]
Hm?

14
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,583
--[NAGATO gasps]
--Whoa!

15
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,583
What?

16
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,500
[KYON]
You're still half-asleep.

17
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,041
Exams are finally over.

18
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,666
Come on. There's no
reason to stick around.

19
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,166
[NAGATO] I remember
the feel of his hand.

20
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,083
Every time I go to sleep,

21
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,791
my memories get more
and more mixed up.

22
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,958
At this rate, it won't
be long before--

23
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,208
[KYON]
Come on, sleepy-head.

24
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,125
[NAGATO]
Okay.

25
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,333
[KYON sighs]
Done and done!

26
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,000
[ASAKURA]
You look awfully relaxed.

27
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,916
I guess the exams
went all right?

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,041
[KYON]
Yeah.

29
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,041
All in all, I think
I did pretty well.

30
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,791
And I've got Nagato
to thank for it.

31
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,208
Oh, that's right.

32
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,791
You guys logged a lot of hours
studying at the library.

33
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,041
[KYON]
Yeah we did.

34
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,791
And since she was
such a big help,

35
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:08,291
I'm sure you'll find a good way
to show her your appreciation.

36
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,583
What sounds fun?

37
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,875
You could take her
to an amusement park.

38
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,166
What do you say, Nagato?

39
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,708
[KYON] Is there someplace
you'd like to go?

40
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,708
An amusement park, right?

41
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,166
[KYON] How about we see
what Nagato thinks?

42
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,666
[NAGATO] Well, if it's someplace
we're all going to go together.

43
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,875
[KYON] You sure this is where
you really wanted to go?

44
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,375
[NAGATO]
Uh-huh.

45
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,916
[ASAKURA] It's your call,
but I still think

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,166
an amusement park
would've been better.

47
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,666
[NAGATO gasps]

48
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,625
Huh.

49
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,500
[ASAKURA] I don't think I've
ever been to a used book fair.

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,500
[KYON]
Yeah. It's my first time, too.

51
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,083
How does it work?

52
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,666
[ASAKURA]
It looks like different stalls

53
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,791
carry different kinds of books.

54
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,250
[NAGATO]
Yeah. It's well organized.

55
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,958
[KYON]
I just realized something.

56
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,958
For a Literary Club,
we sure don't read much.

57
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,083
[ASAKURA] It's like we're doing
real club activities today.

58
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,541
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,166
Wow, that's bright.

60
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,333
Phew! Summer is
definitely on its way.

61
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,500
[KYON] What'll we do with our
summer break, President?

62
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,083
Huh?

63
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,958
[KYON] Just wondering what the
Literary Club's big plans are

64
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,791
for summer vacation.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,750
[NAGATO] I haven't really
thought about it yet.

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,541
Oh, okay.

67
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,958
[ASAKURA] Well, we need
to make some kind of plan.

68
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm sure we can
think of something.

69
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,375
Any ideas, Kyon?

70
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,750
Well, let me think a sec.

71
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,333
Hm.

72
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,208
[ASAKURA, KYON]
Hm?

73
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,250
[KYON]
Oh! The summer festival!

74
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,708
That sounds good!

75
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,500
[ASAKURA]
Yeah! We can all go together!

76
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,291
[KYON]
I'm in. So, what do ya say?

77
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,791
[NAGATO]
Sure.

78
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,166
[KYON]
Whoa! Impressive spread!

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,000
Are they all homemade?

80
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,833
Absolutely! With the help of
my lovely assistant here.

81
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,000
Not much help.

82
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,916
I just dipped the
shrimp in some batter.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,208
That's more than I can do!

84
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,833
Here goes. I'll start
with the shrimp.

85
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,916
The batter's delicious.

86
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,666
[ASAKURA giggles]

87
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,958
Ah-- Thank you.

88
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,833
[KYON]
You're lookin' a little tired.

89
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,208
[ASAKURA] We have been
walking around a lot.

90
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,791
I'm okay.

91
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,333
I could probably keep this up
for a few more hours.

92
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,416
Uh... That makes one of us.

93
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,875
I'm kidding.

94
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,541
[KYON]
Okay, good.

95
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,750
Although, after seeing
you at the library,

96
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,750
I wouldn't have
been too surprised.

97
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,375
[NAGATO]
Really?

98
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,916
Saw you blink.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,583
I surprised you
just now, didn't I?

100
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,458
[NAGATO]
No. Definitely not.

101
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,833
How 'bout that! They look
like a happy couple.

102
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,708
Kyon deserves serious credit.

103
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,250
He's been great.

104
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,458
It hardly took any time
for him to start treating

105
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,500
this Nagato just
like the other one.

106
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,583
What d'you know?

107
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,875
[ASAKURA sighs]
Today was surprisingly fun.

108
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,250
[NAGATO]
Yes.

109
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,750
[ASAKURA] I'm excited about
the cookbook I found!

110
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,208
We should go again sometime,

111
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,250
and bring the other
club members along.

112
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,708
We can invite Miss Asahina
and Miss Tsuruya.

113
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,166
Make it a real party!

114
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,166
Sure.

115
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,541
Maybe not Miss Suzumiya.

116
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,583
She tends to get
bored very easily.

117
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,416
True.

118
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,083
And, of course,

119
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,625
you might prefer to have
some alone time with him.

120
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,541
Just you and Kyon.

121
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,666
Would you like that?

122
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,125
[NAGATO yelps]

123
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,083
[NAGATO]
Why would I?

124
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,041
[ASAKURA chuckles]

125
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,000
[NAGATO] I think you've
got the wrong idea.

126
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,833
Do I? About what?

127
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,708
It's the other Yuki that
likes him. It isn't me.

128
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,625
[ASAKURA chuckles]
Oh, please elaborate!

129
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,750
Miss Asakura wants to hear more.

130
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,916
Tell her all about
how you don't like him.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,916
Go on. She's listening.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,916
[NAGATO] I know her feelings,
and I even understand them.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,833
But the other Yuki and I
aren't the same person.

134
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,041
Her emotions aren't my emotions.

135
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,666
[ASAKURA chuckles]

136
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,916
[NAGATO]
What?

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,458
You seem to understand
her very well.

138
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,958
Are you so sure that she's
the only one who likes him?

139
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:18,166
[NAGATO] A dream. The
same one I always have.

140
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,250
In it, I'm an observer.

141
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:24,791
A fly on the wall,
peering into her memories.

142
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,083
It's a simple dream, really.

143
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,875
[KYON]
Nagato.

144
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,625
Come on. Let's go back.

145
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,875
[NAGATO] Today, I realized
that I'm in love.

146
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,416
[NAGATO]
How beautiful.

147
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,291
[KYON] Mind if I ask
what you're doing?

148
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,708
[NAGATO]
Oh, it's just...

149
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,583
They seem close enough to touch,

150
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:52,958
but then you try to
grab them, and, nothing.

151
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,041
[NAGATO]
No!

152
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,958
Come on. Let's go back.

153
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,416
[NAGATO]
No!

154
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,375
[KYON]
Let's go, then.

155
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,875
[NAGATO]
No!

156
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,458
[NAGATO] It's not mine!
This isn't my memory!

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,083
[NAGATO] Today, I realized
that I'm in love.

158
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,541
[NAGATO] And I also know
I'm about to disappear.

159
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,916
[NAGATO] When you sleep,
your body rests,

160
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,791
but your mind doesn't.

161
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,291
It uses the time to
organize your memories.

162
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:40,583
More and more of her memories
are starting to become clear.

163
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,708
[NAGATO]
I'm not sure how I know this,

164
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,958
but the next time I fall asleep,

165
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:51,250
when I wake up, everything will
return to the way it was.

166
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,083
She'll be back. And I
won't be me anymore.

167
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,791
I'm certain that's
what's going to happen.

168
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,625
[NAGATO]
Today is Sunday.

169
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,208
I don't have much time left,
so what I do have is precious.

170
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,875
I'm going to make
the most of it.

171
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,750
[ASAKURA sighs]
What a nice day!

172
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,875
This was a good idea.

173
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,041
So? Are you going to sit down?

174
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,375
[ASAKURA]
I have to say,

175
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,250
I was surprised that
you suggested this.

176
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,041
Dining al fresco isn't
really your thing.

177
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,125
Well, like you said,
it's a nice day.

178
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,083
So, are you becoming
an outdoorswoman on us?

179
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,333
I know what happened.

180
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,208
You got a taste of
sunshine at the book fair,

181
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,250
and now you're hooked!

182
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,666
[NAGATO]
Mm.

183
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,041
In honor of our first picnic,
I made a special lunch.

184
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,958
I thought the occasion deserved
a little something extra.

185
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,791
Right.

186
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,041
[NAGATO]
I think it's for the best

187
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,208
if I act like
everything is normal.

188
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,583
Wow, that's a lot.

189
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,458
It may be possible that
I got a little carried away.

190
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,291
[NAGATO]
Delicious.

191
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,666
Glad you like it.

192
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,875
In that case...

193
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,000
[NAGATO] Even if I did
decide to tell her,

194
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,750
what would it really change?

195
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,291
Would she care?

196
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,833
Probably.

197
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,250
I bet she'd be a
little sad, at least.

198
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,541
But, at the same time,
me going back to my old self...

199
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,250
That's something she wants.

200
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,791
So how could she not be happy?

201
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,625
Here! You should
try a bite of this.

202
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,541
[NAGATO] She'd be sad and
happy at the same time.

203
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,041
She'd be speechless.
It'd be awkward for both of us.

204
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,083
Oh, no. What's wrong,
do you not like it?

205
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,625
[NAGATO]
It's great.

206
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,041
Eating outside makes the food
you cook taste even better.

207
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,041
Stop that! You're going
to make me blush.

208
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,708
I'm just kidding!
Please tell me more!

209
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,750
[NAGATO] I want these
last moments together

210
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,375
to be happy ones.

211
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,583
[ASAKURA]
Is something the matter?

212
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,041
[NAGATO]
Mm-mm.

213
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,750
[NAGATO]
If I have to go,

214
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,708
I wanna leave
seeing my friend smile.

215
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,541
[chuckles]

216
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,166
Hey, sleepyhead.

217
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,125
You can barely
keep your eyes open.

218
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,791
Did you stay up
late reading again?

219
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,625
At first, I thought you were
a totally different person.

220
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,166
But it seems like you're
becoming more like

221
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,666
the old Nagato as time goes by.

222
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,083
The way you smile, when you
act startled, your shyness,

223
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,583
and the fact that
you're in love.

224
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,500
I know you're going to say
it's because the memories

225
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,958
are flooding back, and I do
think that's part of it.

226
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,291
[ASAKURA]
But not all.

227
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,208
I think there's more to it.

228
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,250
If you ask me, just
living is changing you.

229
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,916
Being with your
friends is making you

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,541
more like your old self.

231
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,208
Enough of that!

232
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,458
That's more introspection
than we need right now!

233
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,916
[NAGATO]
I get it.

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,625
It's not a straightforward
healing process.

235
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,458
I'm not just going back
to who I used to be.

236
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,625
Being with them is changing me.

237
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:20,041
It's helping me to become... me.

238
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,083
[ASAKURA]
Uh, what are you doing?

239
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,500
I'm gonna stop by
the library for a bit.

240
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,208
You go head home without me.

241
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,125
Then I can get
started on dinner.

242
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,666
See ya later!

243
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,666
[NAGATO]
Thanks for everything.

244
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,000
[NAGATO]
And good-bye.

245
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,875
[NAGATO sighs]

246
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,291
[NAGATO] At least I was
able to finish the book.

247
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,958
Now I just need to return it.

248
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,083
[NAGATO]
And that's that.

249
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,208
[NAGATO]
If I had a regret in all this,

250
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,250
it would be that
I never got the chance

251
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,083
to tell him how
I feel about him.

252
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,125
[NAGATO]
I can't.

253
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,458
[NAGATO gasps]

254
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,708
[NAGATO]
Hello?

255
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,083
Nagato! Hey, it's me.
Do you have a second?

256
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,083
Yeah. I've got some time.

257
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,583
[NAGATO]
It's nothing important really,

258
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,791
but I realized the book you
checked out from the library

259
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,708
is due back soon.
Did you ever finish it?

260
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,708
[NAGATO]
Yeah, just now.

261
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,083
[KYON]
Okay, good deal.

262
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,583
It was a science-fiction
book, right?

263
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,666
[NAGATO]
Yes.

264
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,541
[KYON]
So, what was the story about?

265
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,458
[NAGATO] That's a difficult
question to answer briefly.

266
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,000
Then I guess I'll have
to change my question.

267
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,291
Did you find it an enjoyable
read, Professor Nagato?

268
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,750
[NAGATO]
It was intriguing.

269
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,541
"It was intriguing," you say!

270
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,333
So you like it, then!

271
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,791
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

272
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,666
[NAGATO] This is beginning
to feel like a scene

273
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,625
from a bad romance novel.

274
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,375
[KYON] Honestly, I was
asking you about it

275
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,000
so I could pretend I'd read it,

276
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,916
but you make it sound
interesting enough that

277
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,208
maybe I actually will.

278
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,875
[NAGATO]
You'll be glad you did.

279
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,541
[NAGATO] Should I take this
as some kind of sign?

280
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,708
Him calling out of
the blue like this?

281
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,083
[KYON] If it has the Professor
Nagato seal of approval,

282
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,000
it must be good.

283
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,166
[NAGATO]
Yep.

284
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,791
[KYON] Anyway, don't
forget to return it.

285
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,750
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm.

286
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,166
[KYON]
And, ya know,

287
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,625
I could always go with you
to return it if you want.

288
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,625
Between going to the book fair
and our library trips,

289
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,875
it's like I'm always
surrounded by books lately.

290
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:12,958
It's starting to feel sort of
like my natural habitat.

291
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,000
Hm? Are you there?

292
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,666
Nagato?

293
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:28,000
[NAGATO]
I like you.

294
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,791
No, actually.
It's more than that.

295
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,041
I love you.

296
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:45,750
[KYON panting]

297
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,083
[KYON]
Err. What?

298
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,583
Are you messing
with me or something?

299
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,750
I mean, what are you saying?

300
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,875
[NAGATO] And, I won't actually
be able to return the book.

301
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,416
Would you mind doing it for me?

302
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,083
[KYON panting]

303
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,833
[KYON]
Sure, I can return it.

304
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,291
But why do you need me to?

305
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,083
You know what, never mind that.

306
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:14,041
Can we talk about what you
just said for a minute?

307
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,375
[NAGATO]
Don't worry about that.

308
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,291
You don't need to say anything.

309
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,166
Either response would
just leave me with regrets.

310
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,375
[KYON]
Where are you?

311
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,458
Are you home? Please tell me.

312
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,708
I'm gonna head your
way right now. Okay?

313
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,416
Don't talk like I'll
never see you again!

314
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,750
[NAGATO] You should know
the next time you see me,

315
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll be back to my old self.

316
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,541
[KYON]
What're you saying?

317
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,541
[NAGATO]
Anyway, I wanted to tell you

318
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,291
how I feel about you
before that happens.

319
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:45,166
I'm glad I got the chance.

320
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,916
[KYON panting]

321
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,666
[NAGATO] Oh, and, I have
another favor to ask.

322
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,333
I'm really tired, so by
the time you get here,

323
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,875
I'll probably be asleep.

324
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,333
I'm sure my other self will
be panicked and confused

325
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,666
when she wakes up.

326
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,416
I think it'd be best
if you took her home.

327
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,750
[KYON]
Hey... Hey!

328
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,666
[screams]

329
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,625
[NAGATO] I did it.
I told him how I felt.

330
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,583
It wasn't so
difficult after all.

331
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:36,416
And now, well, there's
nothing for me to regret.

332
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,583
Almost.

333
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,833
[NAGATO]
Ahh. Close enough to touch.

334
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,541
[KYON panting]

335
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,958
[KYON]
I shouldn't be surprised.

336
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,250
I knew this was gonna
happen someday.

337
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,958
But it was so hard
to talk to her,

338
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,541
compared to the other Nagato.

339
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,500
So I never asked her
what was going on--

340
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,833
if she felt herself changing,
returning to normal.

341
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,208
But still, this
doesn't seem fair.

342
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,000
[KYON gasps]

343
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,291
[KYON]
Nagato!

344
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,500
[KYON]
Nagato, I'm here, okay?

345
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,416
And we need to talk.
You can't just--

346
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,875
[NAGATO]
You should know.

347
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:09,541
The next time you see me,
I'll be back to my old self.

348
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,250
That's all.

349
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,750
She said everything
she wanted to say.

350
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,375
And then she just disappeared.

351
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,166
It's not fair.

352
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,000
You're an idiot for letting
things end this way,

353
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,875
you know that?

354
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,583
[KYON]
Goodbye then, Nagato.

355
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,000
Hey.

356
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,791
Wake up!

357
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,000
[NAGATO grunts]

358
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,291
[yawns]

359
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,083
[NAGATO]
Hm?! Ah--

360
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,166
Hey! How'd I get here?

361
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:45,333
And why am I alone in a park at
this time of night with you?

362
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,291
Now that's the Nagato I know.

363
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,541
[chuckles]

364
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,708
Good morning. It's been awhile.

365
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,750
Ah, yeah.

366
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,916
Wait! "Good morning"?

367
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,708
It's--It's been awhile?

368
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,791
Huh? What?

369
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:37,166
[NAGATO]
