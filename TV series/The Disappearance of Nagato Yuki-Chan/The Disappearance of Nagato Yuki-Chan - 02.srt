1
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:40,916
[NAGATO]
Huh? Whoa! I got a rare item!

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,333
What am I doing?
Tomorrow is important.

3
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,375
I shouldn't stay up late.

4
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,333
Time to get some sleep.

5
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,208
Christmas is already here.

6
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,791
Don't worry. The
party'll be great.

7
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,166
[gasps]

8
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,333
[doorbell rings]

9
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,708
[ASAKURA]
To review:

10
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,916
you laid down, but you were
so excited about today

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,125
that you couldn't fall asleep.

12
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,500
[NAGATO]
Yeah, that's right.

13
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,125
[ASAKURA] So you thought
you'd play a video game

14
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,500
to take your mind off of things,
and before you knew it,

15
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,208
it was morning, just like that.

16
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,458
[NAGATO]
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,541
[ASAKURA giggles]
You're like a child

18
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,875
the day before a field trip!

19
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,958
It's so freakin' cold!

20
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,208
Hey, Kyon. You're
earlier than usual.

21
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,375
Yeah.

22
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,083
[ASAKURA grunts]

23
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,208
[ASAKURA]
You guys wait here.

24
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,875
I'll just go get
the clubroom key.

25
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,125
Great, thank you.

26
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,875
[KYON sniffs]

27
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,750
[KYON] Is that cake
you've got in there?

28
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,958
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm. Sure is.

29
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,500
[KYON] So you really baked
a two-tiered one? Wow.

30
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,291
Yeah, I pulled it off somehow.

31
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,833
[KYON] That's cool.
I can't wait to try it.

32
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
[KYON]
Whew. Let's get the heater on.

33
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,166
[NAGATO, KYON sigh]

34
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,250
[ASAKURA]
Once you thaw out a bit,

35
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,791
can you get started in here?

36
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,041
I'll be in the home ec.
room working on the turkey.

37
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,708
It'll probably take
a little while.

38
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,541
So decorating's up to you guys.

39
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,666
[KYON, NAGATO]
Leave it to us.

40
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,625
Good luck with the turkey.

41
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,125
Somehow I'm not reassured.

42
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,041
[KYON, NAGATO sigh]

43
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,916
I'm actually starting
to get kinda hot.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,416
Yeah, I think I'm
sweating a little bit.

45
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Well. Let's get started, then.

46
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,041
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

47
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,916
Oh, hey. I've got a surprise.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,625
Here, take a look.

49
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,208
Hey! This looks like...

50
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,583
[KYON chuckles]

51
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,083
Asakura was against it until
the last minute, but...

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:27,958
[NAGATO]
It's snow!

53
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,541
[KYON]
The cotton kind.

54
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,541
With the heater, it's
probably a fire hazard

55
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,875
to spread it all over the floor,

56
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,250
but the corners
should be fair game.

57
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,250
Sounds good to me.

58
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,541
That's strange. Doesn't
look much like snow.

59
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,166
[gasps] We have
to pull it apart!

60
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,166
Oh, I get it!

61
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,166
[ASAKURA]
I didn't realize

62
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,708
turkeys were so
high maintenance.

63
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,958
[TSURUYA] Well, then,
let that be a lesson to you.

64
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,791
She who mocks the turkey
will be mocked by the turkey.

65
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,166
Right, Mikuru?

66
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,291
Oh, uh, sure, I guess.

67
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,916
We were able to get
the Christmas tree

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,291
as far as the
school gate via car.

69
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,708
[ASAKURA] Then I'd say
it's time to have Kyon

70
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,250
show off his muscles, right?

71
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,666
Knock, knock! How's it going?

72
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,958
Whoops! Missed me!

73
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,583
--Oh, yeah?
--[KYON] Take that!

74
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,541
[KYON, NAGATO laughing]

75
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,458
[KYON, NAGATO]
Oh, hi.

76
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,833
[KYON]
A-Asakura!

77
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,500
[KYON, NAGATO whimper]

78
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:23,000
Anger!

79
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,541
[KYON]
Aah!

80
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,333
[KYON, NAGATO]
We're very sorry.

81
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,833
[KYON]
Hey, get the door, will ya?

82
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,541
[ASAKURA]
Hold on a second, okay?

83
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,583
Come on, Nagato. Hurry up!

84
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,208
[KYON]
Not like this is heavy.

85
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,416
[TSURUYA]
This is no time to be shy.

86
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,958
You can show a little
more than that.

87
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,250
[MIKURU] I don't know!
This is really short.

88
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,416
[gasps]

89
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,000
Ta-dah!

90
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,041
[KYON]
Whoa! Santa cosplay!

91
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,041
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

92
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,791
[KYON]
Yeah. It's awesome!

93
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,041
You can thank Miss Tsuruya.
She brought them for us.

94
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,166
I've never been
one for half measures.

95
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,666
I really think
this is too short.

96
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,083
Great idea. You all
look wonderful.

97
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,708
[TSURUYA]
Aww, do we?

98
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,833
You can't hide behind me
like that all day, you know.

99
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:09,041
Just go up to him and say:
"So, how do I look?"

100
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,583
[TSURUYA]
You should know something, Kyon.

101
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,750
Members of Mikuru's fan club
haven't even gotten

102
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,583
to see her dressed in a
Santa costume like this.

103
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,083
You are one seriously lucky guy.

104
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,166
[KYON]
Yes. Yes, I am.

105
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,125
Please. Is this
really necessary?

106
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,083
I'm sorry about this, Kyon.

107
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:23,708
Huh?

108
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,875
Oh, I'm sorry.

109
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,083
Is it okay to call
you Kyon? Do you mind?

110
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,208
Yeah, I don't mind.
Go right ahead.

111
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,625
That really is a nice
outfit. You look great.

112
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,583
Well thank you.

113
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,958
She does look great.

114
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,833
Much better than me.
What did I expect?

115
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,041
It's not exactly
my normal style.

116
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,041
[ASAKURA]
Don't look so sad, Nagato.

117
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,875
You're cute in your own way.

118
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,500
You just have to
find the confidence

119
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,875
to let it shine through.

120
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,208
[ASAKURA]
Unless you have more members,

121
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,666
the Literary Club...
will be terminated?

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,833
Well, it does
sorta make sense.

123
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,458
One member isn't
really much of a club

124
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,000
when you think about it.

125
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,916
But, if you get the number up
to five, you're good, right?

126
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,333
[sighs] Are you even
listening to me?

127
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,000
Sulking's not going to
help anything, you know.

128
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,500
[NAGATO]
I'm not sulking.

129
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,958
Oh, you are listening.

130
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,416
[ASAKURA] So, it's time to
start recruiting more members.

131
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,083
[NAGATO]
That's definitely impossible.

132
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,416
[ASAKURA]
Oh. You've given up, then.

133
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,625
[NAGATO]
Yeah. Of course. It's hopeless.

134
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,875
[ASAKURA] Hopeless? You sound
so certain. All right.

135
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,208
Well, maybe I can figure
something out. You never know.

136
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,958
You just had a moment
of hope, didn't you?

137
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:56,208
I thought it was hopeless.
Isn't that what you said?

138
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,041
[gasps]

139
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,333
[ASAKURA]
Ah-ha!

140
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,083
It looks like you haven't
given up after all!

141
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,083
Considering how you jumped
at my offer to help.

142
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,541
It's impossible for
me to do anything.

143
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,791
But maybe you could.

144
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,166
Well, there's nothing
I can do that you can't.

145
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,000
You just don't wanna risk
putting yourself out there

146
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,000
because you're too afraid.

147
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,625
Am I afraid of asking
people to join?

148
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,708
Of course.

149
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,708
What reason am I
supposed to give them?

150
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,500
"Please join my club
because otherwise

151
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,125
I'll be the only
one in it. Thanks."

152
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,875
And besides...

153
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,166
"Besides" what?

154
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,083
[NAGATO]
Well, it's just...

155
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,708
I don't think I can
do it all by myself.

156
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,625
Actually, I take that
back. I know I can't.

157
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,625
[ASAKURA]
All right, then!

158
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,666
[gasps]

159
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,833
If you feel unsure,
ask me for help.

160
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,875
There's no reason you
have to do it alone.

161
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,041
I'm your friend.

162
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,625
I'm not your mother
or your big sister.

163
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,666
I can't tell you what to do.

164
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,333
I can't take your hand and lead
you in the right direction.

165
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,625
I can't protect you from these
fears that always haunt you.

166
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,250
I can work with you.

167
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,875
But I can't solve
your problems. I can't!

168
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,666
[ASAKURA] I won't do anything
until you make up your mind.

169
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,083
So think, and think hard
before you answer this.

170
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,625
What do you want?

171
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,083
What are you willing to fight
for, because you know what?

172
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,375
To save the club,
you'll have to fight.

173
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,208
[ASAKURA]
I wonder if that really sank in.

174
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,083
You have to fight for yourself.

175
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,875
--[pop]
--[KYON yelps]

176
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,625
[MIKURU] Ah! Oh, dear!
I'm really sorry!

177
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,375
[TSURUYA laughs]
You didn't lose an eye, did you?

178
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,250
[NAGATO]
Asakura. Here.

179
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,250
Thank you.

180
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,166
[ASAKURA sighs]
What will be will be, I guess.

181
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,958
What's wrong?

182
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,166
[KYON] All right!
Does everyone have a glass?

183
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,541
We're good over here!

184
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,666
Well, in that case. Cheers!

185
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,791
[ASAKURA, MIKURU,
NAGATO, TSURUYA] Cheers!

186
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,125
[ASAKURA]
Here you are, the wait is over.

187
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,625
--My turkey!
--[TSURUYA] Hey, Asa.

188
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,708
--[ASAKURA] Coming!
--I want some, too!

189
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,666
So, I bet you're excited, huh?

190
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,416
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm!

191
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,916
So good!

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,875
Looks like it's a hit, huh?

193
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,583
Well, I guess I'll
give it a try, then.

194
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,458
[KYON] How exactly are
you supposed to eat it?

195
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,041
A little on the chewy side, huh?

196
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,958
[KYON]
You could say that again!

197
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,958
But it's still delicious!

198
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,083
[TSURUYA] You see the beauty
of turkey now, don't you?

199
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,750
[TSURUYA] Ha, ha, ha!
That's a great look!

200
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,000
No, really! You should
grow a mustache, Kyon!

201
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,291
[ASAKURA] You'll have to beat
the girls away with a stick!

202
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,750
[MIKURU]
You guys...

203
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,083
I think it looks
really good on him!

204
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,625
You're the ones who
made me wear this get-up.

205
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,083
I don't think it's very
fair to make fun of me.

206
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,500
[KYON] Man, where's the
hard stuff when you need it?

207
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,250
Oh, Mr. Santa! Can I
have my present now?

208
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,375
You mock me and then ask
for presents? That's cruel.

209
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,125
Here ya go. That's all
I've got to offer.

210
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,333
Wow. Thanks so much!

211
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,416
[ASAKURA]
Hey, Kyon.

212
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,416
That's really all
I have, I'm sorry.

213
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,541
[BOTH]
You're such a good boy!

214
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,666
Thanks, Mister Santa!

215
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,250
[KYON]
Oh. Sure thing.

216
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,583
So... What do ya say?

217
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,041
Is it time to cut the cake?

218
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,333
[MIKURU]
It looks delicious!

219
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,583
[ASAKURA]
Impressive, huh?

220
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,125
The work of our very
own club president!

221
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,541
Way to go, Nagato!

222
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,125
Wait a sec. Where is she?

223
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,458
Strange. Where'd she go?

224
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,291
[TSURUYA]
The restroom, maybe?

225
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,875
Do me a favor, Kyon.

226
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,000
Will you go out and see
if you can find her?

227
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,208
Oh, sure.

228
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,750
I'll track her down,
wherever she ran off to.

229
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,958
[ASAKURA]
Out with it.

230
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,541
[TSURUYA giggles] You'll make
a good mother someday, Asa.

231
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,208
So nurturing!

232
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,166
She is, isn't she?

233
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,625
Hello! Nagato!

234
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,000
[KYON]
Miss Nagato!

235
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,208
President Nagato!

236
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,458
[yawns]

237
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,083
[NAGATO]
A good party.

238
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,041
I'm glad the club
is still around,

239
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,625
and it's all thanks to her.

240
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,958
I wonder if I'll see her again.

241
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,916
Time to find food.

242
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,958
[NAGATO]
Ah. Forgot my glasses.

243
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,041
Well, it's just my usual route.

244
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,875
[ASAKURA]
What do you want?

245
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,000
What are you willing to fight
for, because you know what?

246
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,375
To save the club,
you'll have to fight.

247
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,041
[NAGATO sighs]

248
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:56,875
[HARUHI]
Hey, you!

249
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:57,916
[NAGATO gasps]

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,541
Come over here
a second, will you?

251
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,416
[NAGATO]
Huh?

252
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,166
Come on! Hurry up!

253
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,875
Uh... I'm sorry,
are you talking to--

254
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,541
[HARUHI]
Do you see anyone else around?

255
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,875
Now, come on! Move those legs!

256
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,166
[NAGATO]
But I-I don't. Please.

257
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,958
Just tell me what we're doing.

258
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,416
First things first.
You hold onto this.

259
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,041
And what is this?

260
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,791
[HARUHI] I'm going write what
that note says. Right here.

261
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,083
[NAGATO]
Like, on the ground?

262
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,708
Yeah, obviously.

263
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,416
And I gotta do it real big.

264
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,333
So I need you to watch and
make sure I'm not screwin' up.

265
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,416
Okay. Wait! Do you
have permission?

266
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,125
[HARUHI] Of course
I don't have permission!

267
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,875
Hence the sneaky,
cloak-and-dagger type operation.

268
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,208
Don't worry.

269
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,083
This is just a rehearsal,
so there's no pressure.

270
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,750
I'll move fast, and we'll
be done before you know it!

271
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,875
I don't know...

272
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,458
Now, get your butt
up on that bench

273
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,291
and check out what I'm doing.

274
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,458
[HARUHI]
Okay! Here I go!

275
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,375
[NAGATO]
This is crazy.

276
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,833
Even without my glasses,
I'm pretty sure she's way off.

277
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,875
Should I tell the lunatic
she's doing it wrong?

278
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,750
I should tell her, shouldn't I?

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,166
What's our status?

280
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,250
Is this about halfway through?

281
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,000
[NAGATO]
Uh... Well... I don't know.

282
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,625
Pretty close, huh?

283
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,750
What do ya think of that?

284
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,833
You gotta be kidding!

285
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,083
Whoa, hold on!

286
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,625
You normally wear glasses?

287
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,125
[NAGATO]
Yes, yes, yes.

288
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,125
Then it's obvious.

289
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,916
We're switching
responsibilities.

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,375
Huh?

291
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,458
[HARUHI]
Walk five steps south

292
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,500
and then turn 135 degrees.

293
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,791
[HARUHI] From there,
eight steps northeast.

294
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,333
A little further! No, stop!

295
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,791
Head west exactly six steps!

296
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,166
Good. Now draw a
circle. A big one!

297
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,416
Keep up the good work,
you've got it!

298
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,000
[HARUHI]
Thanks for helping!

299
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,083
Is it done?

300
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,208
Ah, it's just a
rehearsal, so this'll do

301
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,000
well enough for now, I'd say.

302
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,708
Do ya have any idea what it is?

303
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,041
No.

304
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,000
[HARUHI]
This is a message to Santa.

305
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,000
[NAGATO]
What?

306
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,333
[HARUHI]
The idea is to lure him in

307
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,125
without making him suspicious.

308
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,958
When he appears, I'll grab him!

309
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,958
[NAGATO]
I'm sorry. Just to be clear.

310
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,416
You believe Santa Claus exists?

311
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,583
[HARUHI]
It's okay if he doesn't.

312
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,333
I won't be crushed or anything.

313
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,500
But that's not the point.

314
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,375
The way I figure it,
the worst situation

315
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,875
would be if he did exist
and I didn't know it.

316
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,916
So what else am I gonna do
but verify it personally?

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,958
[NAGATO] This girl's not afraid
to go after what she wants.

318
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,833
Seems she can't stand
not to know things.

319
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,166
She's perfectly fine asking
a total stranger for help.

320
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,208
That fearlessness.

321
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,958
That's the kind of thing
that I need right now.

322
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,833
[HARUHI]
I'm wiped. Time to head home.

323
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,208
See ya later.

324
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,375
[HARUHI]
Oh!

325
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,416
If you can, you should
stop by on Christmas day.

326
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,083
I'll show you Santa Claus
when I catch him. You'll see!

327
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,500
[NAGATO]
What do you say?

328
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,208
Will you join the Literary Club?

329
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,000
Of course!

330
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,791
So you've made up
your mind, I take it?

331
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,333
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm.

332
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,541
[ASAKURA] Then I'll help you
however I can, Club President!

333
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,041
Great, thank you.

334
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,041
But for now, at least,
I think joining the club

335
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,916
should be all I need you to do.

336
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,083
For now... I'll see what
I can do on my own.

337
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,791
[inaudible]

338
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,000
[NAGATO chuckles]

339
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,916
[KYON]
Hey. What's so funny?

340
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,166
Why're you out here?

341
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,875
[KYON] I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

342
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,666
You pulled a disappearing act,
so I've been looking for you.

343
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,333
Oh. Whoops. I'm really sorry.

344
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,625
[KYON] So what brought
you out here, anyway?

345
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,833
The view.

346
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,291
I wanted to see the
clubroom from down here.

347
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,416
[NAGATO]
It's a relief.

348
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,416
[KYON]
A relief?

349
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,041
[NAGATO]
Yeah. I'm relieved.

350
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,375
The clubroom.

351
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,875
It's become very precious to me,

352
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,750
so it's a relief to know
that it's not going anywhere.

353
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,416
It's just a really nice feeling.

354
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,208
So there you have it.
That's why I'm relieved,

355
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,208
and I have you guys
to thank for it.

356
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,666
I don't know what
you're talking about.

357
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,375
Sounds like you've
got it all wrong.

358
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,666
Huh?

359
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,208
[KYON] Who did what needed
to be done in order

360
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,791
to keep the Literary Club
from being shut down?

361
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,250
And who persuaded me and Asakura

362
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,375
to join the club
in the first place?

363
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,750
That would be you.

364
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,250
Don't thank me.

365
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,333
Be proud of yourself and the
work that you did, instead.

366
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,333
[NAGATO]
That's nice of you.

367
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,375
[NAGATO]
I'm so happy I could explode!

368
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,125
Seriously. Like, bang!

369
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,583
Uh-oh. I can't get my
face back to normal!

370
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,791
[KYON] Oh, hey. You're kinda
shaking. Are you cold?

371
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,333
[NAGATO]
No. I'm okay. I'm actually warm.

372
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,166
[KYON]
Um. Okay.

373
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,208
[NAGATO]
I need to calm down.

374
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,666
This is getting ridiculous.

375
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,041
[KYON]
Nagato.

376
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,166
[NAGATO]
What is it?

377
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,208
[KYON]
Look up.

378
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,875
[NAGATO]
Up?

379
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,250
[NAGATO]
It's snowing!

380
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,833
Ah--

381
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,708
Open your hand.

382
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,416
I've got a surprise for you.

383
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,166
No, not like that! Like this.

384
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,416
Here you go.

385
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,250
[gasps]

386
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,250
Merry Christmas!

387
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,125
U-Uh...

388
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,291
[inhales]

389
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,625
Merry Christmas to you!

390
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,250
Thanks.

391
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,875
[NAGATO gasps]

392
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,083
[NAGATO]
He gave me a Christmas present.

393
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,791
And we're alone out here.

394
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,916
There's pretty snow,
and I feel really good.

395
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,125
I think...

396
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,375
...I might be able to
tell him. I have to!

397
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,041
So, while we're here.

398
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,041
[KYON]
Hm?

399
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,375
I, uh, well, I wanted to...

400
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,500
I mean, there's something
I thought I would tell you.

401
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,250
[inhales]

402
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,625
Whoa! I can't believe
it! It's snowing!

403
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,916
Come here! You have to
take a look at this!

404
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,250
White Christmases are rare!
I don't know if I've ever--

405
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,708
[whimpers]

406
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,333
Ah...

407
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,791
[KYON]
What was that about? Weird.

408
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,000
Gah! What's wrong?

409
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,708
Are you doin'
all right down there?

410
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,500
You don't look so good.

411
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,833
[NAGATO]
Oh, I'm fine.

412
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,500
Just a little very
tired, that's all.

413
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,666
[KYON]
"A little very tired"?

414
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,500
So, how tired is that, exactly?

415
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,291
Well, tell me if
you need something.

416
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,708
[NAGATO]
Okay.

417
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,708
[KYON grunts]

418
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,750
We'll go back and join the party

419
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,458
after you rest up a little.

420
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,291
If we stay here too long,
we'll catch cold.

421
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,083
[NAGATO]
Um, don't you need your coat?

422
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,333
No, you can hang
onto it. I'll be fine.

423
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,666
I've got a strong
immu-- Ah-choo!

424
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,916
[shivers]

425
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,041
Maybe you should take it back.

426
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,250
It would be very
ungentlemanly of me,

427
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,625
I couldn't do that to you.

428
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,916
Well, okay then.

429
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,458
[KYON]
Uh, um. You know?

430
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,583
What is it?

431
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,166
Is it just me,
or does this feel

432
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,833
more than a little awkward?

433
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,833
Um, yeah. It's pretty awkward.

434
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,708
[NAGATO, KYON shiver]

435
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,125
[KYON]
Ah-choo!

436
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,916
[NAGATO] It is pretty
awkward. But, you know,

437
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,208
I've never been warmer.

438
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,083
[KYON] Cleaning up is the
worst part of the party.

439
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,958
Asakura says the
party's not over

440
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,708
till everything's tidy again.

441
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:56,083
[KYON] Oh, yeah?
And where is she, then?

442
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,416
She's already there.

443
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
[KYON]
Such a responsible young lady.

444
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:01,916
[NAGATO]
Got what I wanted.

445
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,625
The Literary Club
is still around,

446
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,666
and we had a Christmas party.

447
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,583
Things would've been different
if I hadn't met that girl.

448
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,875
She helped me find confidence
to fight for what I wanted.

449
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,125
Someday, I'll have to thank her.

450
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,250
[HARUHI] I'll show you
Santa Claus when I catch him!

451
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,791
You'll see!

452
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,916
[NAGATO] It's too bad I wasn't
able to make it back there.

453
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,041
[leaves rustling]

454
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,291
[KYON]
Hm?

455
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,958
[KYON, NAGATO gasp]

456
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,375
[BOTH]
Wha--?

457
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:37,958
[NAGATO] Next episode:
"Haruhi Suzumiya!"
