1
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,375
[KYON] This summer
just keeps dragging on.

2
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,291
It seems more stifling
than usual somehow.

3
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,000
But does everybody feel
so suffocated by the heat?

4
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,625
Like it gets harder
to breathe every day?

5
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,416
No, that may just be me.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,083
I've got a lot on my mind,

7
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,958
and the weather
really isn't helping.

8
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,041
It's sticky and unpleasant
and I wish it was over.

9
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,958
Let it be over soon.

10
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,458
[NAGATO]
I like you.

11
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,500
[KYON]
Uh.

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,416
[NAGATO] No, actually,
it's more than that.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,000
I love you.

14
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,041
[KYON] The other Nagato and I
hung out together for a while

15
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,708
before summer started.

16
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,333
The last day she was here...

17
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,125
...she said something
I wouldn't have seen coming

18
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,916
in a million years.

19
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,416
[KYON]
And then she disappeared...

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
...without even giving
me time to think about

21
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,666
what to say back to her.

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,416
She was just gone.

23
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,208
[KYON] And, of course, I can't
tell the current Nagato

24
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,583
that I've been thinking about
her other self's confession.

25
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,416
So, I've been acting
pretty awkward around her

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,916
since she came back.

27
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,083
[KYON]
Uh.

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,583
I... uh... wasn't-- Sorry.

29
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,875
That wasn't-- I didn't mean to.

30
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,500
[NAGATO gasps]

31
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:57,375
Oh, yeah, I know. We were both
distracted by the fireflies.

32
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,708
I'm an idiot. All I did
was make her feel bad.

33
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,458
This looks like an ordinary
futon beater, right?

34
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,000
But it's actually far...

35
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,208
[KYON] It was around midway
through the summer break.

36
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
Figuratively, it was like
being at the fifth station

37
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,958
on the way to the
top of Mt. Fuji.

38
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,875
See, you can get
to that point by car,

39
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,083
so it feels like you've
come a long way,

40
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,500
but then the real
mountain climbing starts.

41
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,791
In other words, I'd been
slogging through summer break

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,833
for a good long while but hadn't
gotten to the hard part yet.

43
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,041
[TV MC] You'll be done with this
boring chore before you know it!

44
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:06,916
[ASSISTANT]
Now that's what...

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,125
Hey, Kyon, your phone's ringing.

46
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,208
Yeah? Thanks,
I hadn't noticed that.

47
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,666
[KYON]
What does she want?

48
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,750
Kyon here.

49
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,083
[HARUHI]
You're not busy, are you?

50
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,458
What makes you think--?

51
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,750
[HARUHI] We're meeting
at the café at two o'clock.

52
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,041
See ya there!

53
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:28,708
[HARUHI humming]

54
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,041
There, crossed that off!

55
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,041
Yeah.

56
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,375
We did this one, too!

57
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,416
Yep.

58
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,000
I didn't realize
you were so serious

59
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,541
about this summer to-do list.

60
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,291
We have to get through
this entire list

61
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,125
before the end of summer.

62
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh! We have to do this
one next week too, Koizumi.

63
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,791
That sounds good to me.

64
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,250
That's not a short list.

65
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,041
It looks like we're going
to be pretty busy.

66
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,625
[HARUHI]
Hmm.

67
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,291
It's like we're still stuck at
the fifth station of Mt. Fuji.

68
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,541
[KYON] No way! My mind
works the same as hers?

69
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,083
In other words, the real
summer break starts right now!

70
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,208
This is the one and only 11th
grade grade summer vacation,

71
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,416
so we've got to
make this one count!

72
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,041
[KYON]
Haven't we done enough already?

73
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,083
No, of course we haven't!

74
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,208
[sighs]

75
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,291
[KYON] We need to make
this summer count, huh?

76
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,833
[KYON]
Ugh.

77
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,333
It's really raining.

78
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,583
[KOIZUMI]
We'll get soaked.

79
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,041
Do you have an umbrella
with you, Miss Suzumiya?

80
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,041
[HARUHI]
Of course I do.

81
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,541
[KOIZUMI] Like I had to ask.
You're always prepared.

82
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,000
[HARUHI]
See ya tomorrow!

83
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,708
We'll meet up in front of
the station. Don't be late.

84
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,916
[KYON]
Where's Asakura?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,250
[NAGATO] She said something
about a "rainy day sale"

86
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,625
and took off.

87
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,250
[KYON]
Oh, okay.

88
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,833
So, um, you didn't
bring an umbrella?

89
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,125
[NAGATO]
Um. No.

90
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,416
I see.

91
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,083
[KYON]
Wanna walk with me?

92
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,791
[KYON] I can't help it,
I'm still nervous.

93
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,875
[KYON] How am I
supposed to talk to her?

94
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,833
What am I supposed to say?

95
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,041
[KYON]
Huh?

96
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,000
What's the matter?

97
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,291
It stopped. It's not raining.

98
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,333
[KYON]
Um.

99
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,500
Yeah.

100
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,375
[NAGATO]
It's pretty.

101
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,083
[KYON]
Sure is.

102
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,916
[NAGATO] It's as pretty as those
fireflies we saw by the pond.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,958
[KYON]
Uh.

104
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,458
[KYON]
Things can't stay like this.

105
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,500
At least we've still got
half the break left.

106
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:09,208
I should be able to fix
things before it's over.

107
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,125
Go on, idiot, say something.

108
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,500
But we were busy all the time,

109
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,041
making our way through
Haruhi's endless list.

110
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,083
As soon as I thought
it was over,

111
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,000
she found more
stuff for us to do.

112
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,625
I really began to sympathize
with poor Sisyphus.

113
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,625
[KYON]
So, time was passing quickly

114
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,750
and I had nothing
to show for it.

115
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,458
[HARUHI]
Woohoo! All right!

116
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,291
[KYON]
That really was a big hit.

117
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,958
Not like that's surprising.

118
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,708
She can't do anything
on a small scale.

119
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,500
[KYON]
Hm?

120
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,583
[ASAKURA]
All right, next! Come on!

121
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,166
[KYON] She can't do
anything slowly, either.

122
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,416
[TSURUYA]
Ha, ha.

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,833
[KYON]
I believe in you, Miss Asahina.

124
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,000
[KYON]
Oh.

125
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,250
[KYON] Hey, Nagato,
you're swinging a little late.

126
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,916
You might try choking up on
the bat. Tell her that, Kyon.

127
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,125
[sighs]

128
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:15,583
[KYON]
Ah. Nothing. Never mind.

129
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,208
[KYON]
Dammit!

130
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,750
You had something to say!

131
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,166
You idiot!

132
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,916
Strike! Yes!

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,458
[HARUHI laughing]

134
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,041
An awesome roll.

135
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:34,416
I'm goin' for a perfect game,
of course. What did you expect?

136
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,250
[KYON]
It didn't get any better.

137
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,458
Time kept passing,

138
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,708
and I kept not being
able to talk to Nagato,

139
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,916
even when I thought
of stuff to say.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,041
[ASAKURA]
Don't worry about it!

141
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,708
You've got another
throw. Shake it off.

142
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,791
[KYON]
She's right.

143
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,416
This is just the
beginning of the game.

144
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,958
There's still plenty of time
to get your score up.

145
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,875
Tell her that, Kyon.

146
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,125
[ASAKURA]
Hey.

147
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,333
[KYON]
Huh?

148
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,958
Wake up and get out
there. It's your turn.

149
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,458
[KYON groans]

150
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,416
Are you even trying? Come on!

151
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,041
There's no way
you're ever gonna win

152
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,916
if you keep playing like that!

153
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,416
Maybe you should
cut him some slack.

154
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,625
A split like that

155
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,500
would be really hard
for anybody to clear.

156
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,791
[HARUHI]
Ha! I could do it in my sleep.

157
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,291
That wasn't a bad throw,
but, for what it's worth,

158
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,041
your game might
improve if you relaxed

159
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,833
and threw more naturally.

160
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,458
Thanks, I'll get right on that.

161
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,208
It's something I've noticed.

162
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:34,166
if I'm trying too hard,
things can seem more difficult.

163
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,250
And, you know,
it's not just bowling.

164
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,041
You can do it, Koizumi!

165
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,541
Crush North High
like little bugs!

166
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,666
[KOIZUMI]
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,916
[HARUHI chuckles]

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,500
[HARUHI] Yay! Another strike!
That's what I'm talking about!

169
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,875
[KOIZUMI]
Lucky shot.

170
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,958
[KYON]
Day after day came and went.

171
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,041
The break was quickly
coming to an end.

172
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,750
And so, miraculously,

173
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,500
was Haruhi's list
of summer activities.

174
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,208
[KOIZUMI]
This is a pretty good turnout,

175
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,125
considering it's just
a small, local festival.

176
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,958
[KYON] Well, you know
how Japanese people are

177
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,166
about their festivals.

178
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,916
[HARUHI]
Hey!

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,791
[KYON]
Huh?

180
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,291
You started eating without us?

181
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,541
[KYON]
And here

182
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,625
comes the biggest festival
lover of them all.

183
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,000
[HARUHI]
Well, are you ready or what?

184
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,958
[KYON]
Us? You're the ones who're late.

185
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,666
Hey, we couldn't help it.

186
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,875
It takes a lotta work
to put these on!

187
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:32,875
[HARUHI giggles]

188
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,625
So, you like?

189
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,875
[ASAKURA] Careful!
You're gonna wrinkle us!

190
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,916
[HARUHI]
Come on, it'll be fine!

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,875
[KOIZUMI] If I may say so, you
ladies look lovely in those.

192
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:42,958
[HARUHI]
Thank you!

193
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,000
[KYON]
Uh.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,625
[HARUHI] This is a totally
summery thing, too, right?

195
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,625
Yeah.

196
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,291
[KYON]
Oh, I remember now.

197
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,375
You said you were gonna borrow
those from Miss Tsuruya.

198
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,500
[HARUHI] Yeah, we were
totally blown away!

199
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,708
Aren't they beautiful?

200
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,083
She has an amazing
yukata collection.

201
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,416
She even told us we could
keep them if we wanted to,

202
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,833
but Ryoko said no.

203
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,583
Of course I said no!

204
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,000
These fabrics are so expensive,

205
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,625
you can't even get them
in regular stores.

206
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,208
I'm terrified
we'll get them dirty

207
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,000
before we can
return them to her.

208
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,625
Don't be so uptight.

209
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,916
[KYON] So, where are the others?
I thought they'd be with you.

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,666
Well... there was this booth.

211
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,541
[KYON]
A sales demonstration?

212
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,958
[HARUHI]
Exactly.

213
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,958
[KYON] I think I saw something
like that on the way in.

214
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,208
[HARUHI]
They were selling a mixer

215
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,708
that could even shred
a cell phone into bits.

216
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,916
[HARUHI] I bet she's a sucker
for infomercials, too.

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,916
Anyway, Miss Tsuruya
thought she should stay

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,375
and keep an eye on her.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,625
She told us to just go
on ahead without them.

220
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,458
[KYON] So, do we just start
checking out stalls?

221
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,208
I'm sure you've got
some kind of a plan.

222
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,875
Of course I do!

223
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,666
First of all! Goldfish!
Let's go fish scooping! Come on!

224
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,666
[ASAKURA]
That's a horrible idea!

225
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,625
What if some of the fish smell
gets into the yukata fabric?

226
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,458
[HARUHI]
How much?

227
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,708
[POPS]
Three hundred yen.

228
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,625
[HARUHI]
Here ya go.

229
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,500
I want a really strong scooper!

230
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,708
[POPS]
Sure thing.

231
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,458
[HARUHI] Oh, my hair's
gonna be in the way.

232
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,583
Ryoko, put it up for
me, ok? Go on, do it!

233
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,500
[ASAKURA] You had plenty of time
to do this when we got changed.

234
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,916
It seemed like too
much work at the time.

235
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,375
Fine. Try to stay
still for a second.

236
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,708
So... is that candy
apple any good?

237
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,583
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

238
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,708
Nice.

239
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,000
[HARUHI]
What're you doing Yuki?

240
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,791
Come on, you're playin', too.

241
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,541
[NAGATO]
Huh?

242
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,541
[HARUHI]
We've gotta find out

243
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,333
who can rescue
the most goldfish!

244
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,000
[KYON] Maybe I'll
figure it out... tonight.

245
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,333
Don't worry, little fishies,
I'm here to rescue you.

246
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,291
Just stay there nice
and still, okay?

247
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,000
Nice fish scooping.

248
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,250
I'm just gettin' started.

249
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,000
Uh, how did she?

250
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,500
You almost had it.

251
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,375
The key is to look
'em right in the eyes

252
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,666
before you take aim, like this.

253
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,916
Gotcha!

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,583
It's easy! I can
catch like 20 of 'em!

255
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,750
You're judging me.

256
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,041
What do you mean?

257
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,541
You know what I mean.

258
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,958
You think my inability to decide
what to do is hurting her.

259
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,583
[ASAKURA]
More or less.

260
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,666
Fine then, just
tell me what to do.

261
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,000
Why do you think I know?
It's confusing to me, too.

262
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,791
On the one hand,

263
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,541
the two Nagatos have to
be considered separately.

264
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,958
Because in many ways,
they are different people.

265
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,000
But even keeping that in mind,

266
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:13,041
it's hard to say where one of
them begins and the other ends.

267
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,791
I would guess, as far
as this Nagato goes,

268
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,291
she's probably feeling
pretty confused.

269
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,541
You've become so
distant all of a sudden,

270
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,583
and she doesn't know why.

271
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,875
[NAGATO]
Oh, yeah, I know.

272
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,375
We were both distracted
by the fireflies.

273
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,250
[KYON] I can't pretend
I didn't know that.

274
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,625
I'm not the only one feeling
awkward, and it's worse for her,

275
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,083
since she doesn't
know the whole story.

276
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,375
[KYON]
It's time to do it.

277
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,958
I need to tell her
what I would've said

278
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,125
when she told me how she felt.

279
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,458
If only she had
given me the chance.

280
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,916
[KYON]
I'll do it.

281
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,291
[KOIZUMI]
Fireworks have started.

282
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,166
[ASAKURA] All right!
It looks like a good show!

283
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,708
How pretty.

284
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,375
Hey, you got a minute?

285
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,125
[NAGATO]
Uh, sure.

286
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:39,875
[HARUHI]
Hey, Ryoko.

287
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,208
Yeah, what's up?

288
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,916
[HARUHI] Uh. Where to now?
The shooting game?

289
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah. Sounds good.
I'll play, too.

290
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,500
All right, so, here's the deal.

291
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,541
[NAGATO]
Huh?

292
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,666
[KYON] To be honest, when you
told me how you felt about me,

293
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,166
I was just sort of... confused.

294
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,708
We were... friends.

295
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,875
I'd never thought of you,
you know, like that before.

296
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,708
Sorry! Can you talk louder?
I can't hear you at all.

297
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,000
So, what did you even
like about me, anyway?

298
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,250
Did you ask something?
I don't know, I'm sorry.

299
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,125
Of course you don't know.
How could you?

300
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,125
[NAGATO]
Um, Kyon, I don't get it.

301
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,875
What's this all about?

302
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,041
[KYON]
This.

303
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,916
[KYON] I want you to
listen and listen good.

304
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,541
I'm going to tell you the
most important thing first.

305
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,458
Whatever else happens,
I'll never stop liking you.

306
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,041
Just know that.

307
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,083
[KYON]
As for the rest of it,

308
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,291
about you telling
me you love me.

309
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,250
All I can say... is
that... given time...

310
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,458
[KYON] ...I think I would've
fallen in love with you, too.

311
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,250
So, uh, did you hear
what I just said?

312
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,208
Not a thing.

313
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,041
Okay, that's good, then.

314
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:04,958
[NAGATO]
Huh?

315
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,000
Man, that's a real load off!

316
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,333
[NAGATO]
H-Huh?

317
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,583
[KYON chuckles]

318
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,250
[KYON]
Okay, enough of that.

319
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,333
You probably think I'm
crazy at this point.

320
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,000
Well, I just wanted to say...

321
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,791
...I'm sorry. I know I've
been acting distant lately.

322
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,000
[NAGATO]
Oh.

323
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,666
And now I'm acting strange,

324
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,291
but I finally said what I needed
to say, and I feel a lot better.

325
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,333
So, if it's okay, I'll
just go back to normal now.

326
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,791
[NAGATO]
Mh-hm.

327
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,708
Whoa!

328
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,583
[MIKURU]
Wow.

329
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,458
[KYON] Ugh, I'm hungry.
Wanna get some food?

330
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,375
[NAGATO] Yeah. I love the
food they have at festivals.

331
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,750
[KYON] Anything specific
you're craving? It's my treat.

332
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,416
[NAGATO]
Really? You don't have to.

333
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,791
[KYON]
I might as well.

334
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,500
You know Haruhi'll find some way

335
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,166
to make me treat
everybody, anyway.

336
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,250
[NAGATO giggles]

337
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,875
Okay. Takoyaki.

338
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,208
Done and done.

339
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,083
Oh, and by the way, you look
good in that yukata.

340
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:23,583
What? I-I-I-I-I. Thank you.

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,708
[KYON]
I finally said it.

342
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,250
That was a great shot.

343
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,958
Course it was. How're you doing?

344
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,583
Want me to win you
anything else?

345
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,583
I think this'll be
plenty, thank you.

346
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,125
[HARUHI]
Ah!

347
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,958
How dare you just wander off
like that without my permission!

348
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,458
I know, sorry.

349
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,000
Fine!

350
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:57,041
As your punishment for that,
you are treating us to takoyaki!

351
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,250
See?

352
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,416
[NAGATO chuckles]

353
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,375
What was that?

354
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,166
Oh, no, nothing at all.

355
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,250
Hope we didn't miss all the fun!

356
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sorry we're late.
It's my fault.

357
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,166
[KYON]
Wow. Miss Asahina, that's...

358
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,791
That's a really nice blender.

359
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,000
[KYON chuckles nervously]

360
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,291
[KYON]
Summer break is almost over.

361
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,583
It's never gone so quickly.

362
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,583
I did realize something
interesting, though.

363
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,875
For our summer activities,
we went swimming in the ocean,

364
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,375
we did a "test of courage"
in the mountains,

365
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,166
we swam in a public pool,

366
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,125
went stargazing, went bowling,
hit balls at the batting cages,

367
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,125
and saw fireworks at a festival.

368
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,791
But when you think about it,

369
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,416
we didn't do anything
a literary club would do.

370
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,916
Oh, I've got an idea.

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,625
Why don't we create a little
pamphlet about the festival.

372
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,000
Or, I don't know,

373
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,916
write a collaborative novel
or something like that.

374
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
You know, that almost
makes it sound like

375
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,750
we're a literary club.

376
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,000
[NAGATO]
Mh-hm.

377
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,541
[KYON] You guys, we
are a literary club.

378
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,416
[ASAKURA chuckles]
Calm down. We're just kidding.

379
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,083
[NAGATO]
Kidding.

380
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,916
Iff we mention writing
a novel to Miss Suzumiya,

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
she would be interested.

382
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,708
I can just imagine
her kind of novel.

383
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,208
Time travelers. Aliens. Espers.

384
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,833
And people from some
sort of parallel universe,

385
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,708
all wrapped up in one story.

386
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,375
That sounds like
it could be good.

387
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah? What do you say? Think we
should write a novel like that?

388
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,125
[NAGATO]
Mh-hm.

389
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,541
You wanna come for dinner? It's
at Nagato's place, as usual.

390
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,791
A free, home-cooked meal?
Yeah, count me in.

391
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,708
Something tasty
on the menu tonight?

392
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,041
Oden?

393
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,958
Huh? But it's still
summer, though.

394
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,750
And that's not exactly the
most seasonal dish, is it?

395
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,291
Uh-huh! You'd be surprised.

396
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,541
Oden can actually be
pretty tasty when it's hot.

397
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,583
[NAGATO]
Uhh.

398
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,625
[KYON]
Hmph.

399
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,541
Oh, the light's
changing. Let's go!

400
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,666
[NAGATO]
Whoops!

401
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,541
[NAGATO] This is the story of
a somewhat shy, bookish girl.

402
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,083
[ANNOUNCER] Oh, it looks like
Suzuki lost control of the ball

403
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,333
on that last pitch.

404
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,291
[OOBA] Remember, this
is the first time...

405
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,750
[KYON]
I don't know what it is,

406
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,916
but I feel like there's
something I'm forgetting.

407
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Ouch!

408
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,541
[KYON'S SISTER gasping]

409
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,208
Hey, Kyon, your
phone's ringing.

410
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,041
Yeah? Thanks, I
hadn't noticed that.

411
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,625
[KYON]
What does she want?

412
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:06,208
Kyon h--

413
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,291
[HARUHI]
Kyon!

414
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,791
You're not busy, are you?

415
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,958
We're meeting at the café
at two o'clock. See ya there!

416
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,416
[KYON]
Uh...

417
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,916
[KYON] Was I even a part
of that conversation?

418
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,541
[ASAKURA]
The break's just about over.

419
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,541
I got all my homework
done a while ago.

420
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,291
What about you, Kyon?

421
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,666
[KYON]
Uh...
