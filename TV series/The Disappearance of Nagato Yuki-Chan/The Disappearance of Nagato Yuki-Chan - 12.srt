1
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,583
[KYON] So, it sounds like
Taniguchi is going to be

2
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,250
applying for a job
at that minimart now.

3
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,166
The last time he had a job,
it was at some bar-b-que place.

4
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,666
He only worked there because
there was this girl he liked,

5
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,625
and when she quit, so did he.

6
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,375
I bet this'll be the same thing.

7
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,208
He's pretty predictable.

8
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,916
Well, predictably
idiotic, anyway.

9
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,166
[KYON]
Whoa.

10
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,125
Sure is quiet in here.

11
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,458
We should be able to
do a lot of studying.

12
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,875
So, where should we--

13
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,000
[KYON]
Hm?

14
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,666
Ah! Hey! Come back!

15
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,208
Think you could keep
your voice down?

16
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,291
This is a library.

17
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,541
Oh! Of course! I'm sorry.

18
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,666
[KYON] She likes this place
even more than I expected.

19
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,375
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato!

20
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,375
Miss Nagato!

21
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,416
Professor Nagato!

22
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,458
She can't hear me.

23
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,166
I might as well not even
exist at this point.

24
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,916
[chuckles]

25
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,583
[KYON] I've never known someone
who could concentrate like that!

26
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,791
I wish I'd known it would
make her this happy.

27
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,291
I woulda brought
her here sooner.

28
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,625
Except,

29
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,791
it's actually the current
Nagato who likes books.

30
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,375
Uh. Looks like she's
ready to get to work.

31
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,625
Or maybe not.

32
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,625
Hey, um, Nagato?

33
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,500
We came here to
study, didn't we?

34
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,166
[gasps]

35
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,375
[KYON]
Um, hello?

36
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,416
Just a few pages.

37
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,375
[KYON]
She means business!

38
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,666
[KYON]
Man. When she looks that happy,

39
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,125
it's hard not to feel like
a jerk for interrupting her.

40
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,083
[sighs]

41
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,583
[KYON]
I'll just go wait over there.

42
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,208
Grab me when you're done, okay?

43
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,458
[NAGATO] 
Ah. Right.

44
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,125
[KYON sighs]

45
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,916
All right, then.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,500
I'll just sit down
here for a minute.

47
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,166
[sighs]

48
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,791
[yawns]

49
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,583
[BOY A]
Found it, Mom!

50
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,833
Oh yeah? Good job, honey!

51
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,250
Hey, check this out!

52
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,625
Oh, whoa! What is that?

53
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,958
[GIRLS giggle]

54
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,041
See ya later!

55
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,750
--[BOY B] Bye-bye!
--[BOY C] See ya!

56
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,208
[phone vibrates]

57
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,625
[KYON]
Huh?

58
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,083
[KYON]
Hm? It's Asakura.

59
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:42,958
What does she want?

60
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,000
[LIBRARY EMPLOYEE A]
Eh-hem.

61
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,625
Uh...

62
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,291
I'll just step outside.

63
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,041
[KYON]
Hey. What's up?

64
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,541
[ASAKURA]
Good, you answered!

65
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,041
I was getting worried.

66
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,791
Where are you? With Nagato?

67
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,291
Yeah, we came to
the library together.

68
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,958
Okay, good. If you're
with her, that's fine.

69
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,333
She wasn't home,

70
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,666
so I was wondering where
she might have gone off to.

71
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,750
And she didn't
answer my call, so...

72
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,166
So, you immediately
started worrying, huh?

73
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,166
So, tell me something.
Is it hard being a mom?

74
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,208
[gasps] What?!

75
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,375
[ASAKURA]
Huh?

76
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,625
[KYON] Ugh. I accomplished
nothing today.

77
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,125
[ASAKURA]
Sorry? Is everything all right?

78
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,250
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

79
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,791
We're heading out soon.

80
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,125
I'll tell Nagato to
give you a call, 'kay?

81
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,833
[ASAKURA] Oh, yeah, thanks.
That sounds good.

82
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,166
[KYON] I didn't open a
textbook this entire time!

83
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,750
[gasps]

84
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,041
[KYON] Incredible.
She hasn't even moved.

85
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,958
Ahem. Earth to Nagato!

86
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,875
The library's closing.
We should go.

87
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,291
[KYON] Come on. Let's
put the book back--

88
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,875
Hm?

89
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,083
Let me get to a
good stopping place.

90
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,166
No can do.

91
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,291
Ten more minutes.

92
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,458
Won't work.

93
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,750
The library'll be
closing in ten minutes.

94
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,833
Well, in that case...
give me nine.

95
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,333
I think you're being
a little ridiculous.

96
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,750
[gasps]

97
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,791
Uh! Looking at me like that
won't change anything.

98
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,958
Okay, you win.

99
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,250
I give up.

100
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,791
We'll get a library card
and check that book out.

101
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,916
Will that work for you?

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,708
[NAGATO]
Uh...

103
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,166
[KYON]
Hm?

104
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,041
Like this? Got one.

105
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,916
Why didn't you tell me?

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,583
The way you were acting,
I thought you didn't have one.

107
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,166
[gasps]

108
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,083
I'm sorry. I just remembered.

109
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,291
[KYON]
Right, I understand.

110
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,125
Well, it's not a big deal.

111
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,041
Come on. We'll check
it out and then get going.

112
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,458
[NAGATO]
I didn't realize it

113
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,000
until I remembered
about the card.

114
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:07,541
But he and the other Yuki have
been at the library before.

115
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,458
It's where they met.

116
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,458
Hey.

117
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,916
[gasps]

118
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,125
Come on, what is
it you're doing?

119
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,250
Um... Uh...

120
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:02,541
Gimme that. You want
a library card, right?

121
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,333
Hey, um, what are you
looking around for?

122
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,791
Who else would I be talking to?

123
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,208
So, do you want a card, then?

124
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,375
Uh... Mm-hm.

125
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,208
[KYON]
Cool.

126
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,208
[NAGATO]
Huh?

127
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,875
I'll go take care
of it for you.

128
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,375
Huh? Hey! Hold on!

129
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,250
[KYON]
Well, here ya go.

130
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,291
[NAGATO]
Oh, great.

131
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,000
This is, uh...

132
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,708
I-- Thank you for--

133
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,916
[KYON]
No problem.

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,958
I mean--

135
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,083
I was probably
a little too pushy.

136
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,833
I'm kinda used to looking
out for somebody, so...

137
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,291
I couldn't just stand by
and do nothing when I saw you.

138
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,291
[KYON'S SISTER]
Hey! Kyon!

139
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,458
[KYON, NAGATO]
Huh?

140
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,666
It's too high up.
I can't reach the book!

141
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,750
Like I said, I'm used to
looking out for someone.

142
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,125
Well, see ya around.

143
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,166
[KYON] Don't go around
shouting out my nickname

144
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,416
like that, squirt!

145
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,208
--Meow-ow-ow-ow!
--[KYON] And no meowing!

146
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:19,166
Oh, no. I missed my
chance to thank him.

147
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,166
[sighs]

148
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,416
[gasps]

149
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,500
I guess that was... a dream.

150
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,375
Ah! You're awake. Good morning!

151
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,375
We've still got a little while
longer until breakfast is done.

152
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:59,291
So, go on. I'll finish
this up while you get ready.

153
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,625
[NAGATO] It's like I was
observing her memories

154
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,666
while they were happening.

155
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,208
They were so clear.

156
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,291
[NAGATO]
I can feel her personality,

157
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,333
sleeping in a corner
of my mind somewhere.

158
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,000
I think it's
starting to wake up.

159
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,791
[NAGATO] But, if she does
wake up completely, then what?

160
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:39,000
If she comes back, then
what's going to happen...

161
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,916
...to me?

162
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,916
There's another huge sale,
so you know what that means.

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,583
Nagato's in your care.

164
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,083
Have fun, gotta go!

165
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,083
[giggles]

166
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,208
Enjoy the sale!

167
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,916
It's just us, then.

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,541
Let's hurry up and
get to the library.

169
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,666
We've got some serious
studying to do today.

170
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,958
[NAGATO]
Hold on.

171
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,041
[KYON]
Hm?

172
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,958
I have something...
I need to do.

173
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:19,333
[KYON] Okay, well,
let's do it quickly, then.

174
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,083
[NAGATO] I'll be fine.
You go on to the library.

175
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,666
I'll meet you there later.

176
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,083
[KYON] I can't go to
the library by myself.

177
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,750
I'd fall asleep.

178
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,750
Seriously. I wouldn't
stand a chance.

179
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,708
[sighs]

180
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,750
He's such a liar.

181
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,333
Here. They're good as new.

182
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,291
How would you like them?
Do you wanna wear them now?

183
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,500
[STORE OWNER]
Not a problem.

184
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,333
Give me a minute and I'll
put them in a case for you.

185
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,333
[KYON]
How are they?

186
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,791
Your glasses.
Are they all fixed?

187
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,375
I look pretty good, huh?

188
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,666
[gasps] Yeah.

189
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,375
[KYON]
Round two! Let's go.

190
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,083
[CAT meows]

191
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,708
We're gonna study like
crazy today, right?

192
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,416
Of course.

193
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,750
I noticed that you paused
a little bit before answering.

194
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,000
Uh--

195
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,291
I know, you're right.

196
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,416
This is all for me, not for you.

197
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm the one who needs
to study so badly.

198
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,833
But if you could stay
and help me out, well,

199
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,125
I'd really appreciate it.

200
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,791
[NAGATO grunts]

201
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,291
Sure, no problem.

202
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,375
[KYON]
Thanks a lot.

203
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:17,875
[heart beating]

204
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,916
[NAGATO]
What's happening?

205
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,708
[KYON]
Hm?

206
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,416
Ah...

207
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,458
Okay, I'm stuck.
What do I do here?

208
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:52,958
Where?

209
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,166
[KYON]
This part.

210
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,416
[NAGATO]
Oh. If you substitute this--

211
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,625
[KYON]
Oh, I see. That makes sense now.

212
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,083
You're awesome. Thank you!

213
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:08,625
[KYON]
Hm?

214
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,833
Ah--

215
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,041
Um, something wrong?

216
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,916
[NAGATO] Oh, uh, there's a
question I can't figure out.

217
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,250
Whoa.

218
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,000
A question that
you can't answer?

219
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,208
I didn't think...
that was possible.

220
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,041
[KYON]
Now what?

221
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,208
I'll go see if there's a book
somewhere that can help.

222
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,958
Let me know if you have
any more questions.

223
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,916
I'll come back.

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,625
[KYON]
U-Uh...

225
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,041
[KYON sighs]

226
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,166
[NAGATO]
I wonder what's going on.

227
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,541
I'm not my usual
self today at all.

228
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,250
Why did I refuse
to wear her glasses?

229
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,666
There's nothing wrong
with them anymore.

230
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,625
Why do I feel nervous
around him all of a sudden?

231
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,708
There's no good reason for it.

232
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:37,166
Why... is my heart
beating so fast?

233
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,666
I don't understand.
I don't have enough data.

234
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,208
I'm sure that dreaming about her
memories is what triggered this.

235
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,625
That much seems fairly obvious.

236
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,000
It's also undeniable
that her personality

237
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,916
is starting to wake up.

238
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,541
So, all this
confusion inside me,

239
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,750
this strange feeling I'm having;

240
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,375
is it hers?

241
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,416
[NAGATO]
I don't think so.

242
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,916
I am me.

243
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,875
Her memories still
exist inside my head.

244
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,500
But the observations,
feelings, experiences

245
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,583
I'm currently registering
belong to me, not her.

246
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:19,083
There's no doubt
about that, either.

247
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,833
Then, why?

248
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,166
[gasps]

249
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,291
[NAGATO]
Is it possible...

250
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:31,125
That her consciousness and
mine are mixed up together?

251
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,541
So that the more
she continues to awaken,

252
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:41,500
the more her feelings, her
senses, and her consciousness

253
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,166
begin to exist alongside my own?

254
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,875
[NAGATO]
So, chances are good

255
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,291
that she will eventually
awaken completely.

256
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,791
There's probably
no changing that.

257
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,208
It's already begun.

258
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,583
[NAGATO] But when it
does happen-- What then?

259
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,750
[gasps]

260
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,666
[NAGATO]
Will she and I...?

261
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,375
Will we...?

262
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,875
[gasps]

263
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,208
Here, let me get that for you.

264
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,416
I'm sure I can't help you
with whatever question it is

265
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
you can't answer.

266
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,000
But I figured I could at least
make myself useful like this.

267
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,458
[gasps]

268
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,458
See? All yours.

269
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,416
You're a meddler,
you know that?

270
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,750
But, in a good way.

271
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,958
I'm glad it's in
a good way at least.

272
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,791
You're used to looking
out for somebody,

273
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,458
so you couldn't just stand by.

274
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,666
Well, yeah, that's it exactly.

275
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,625
Wait. Have I told you
that before or something?

276
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,166
Thanks for the help.

277
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,458
Uh...

278
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,541
It's really nice
to see you smile.

279
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,375
Feels like it's
been a long time.

280
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,625
Oh? Really?

281
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,458
Yeah, really.

282
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,583
[NAGATO]
Well, I'm extra grateful,

283
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,750
since I didn't get to
thank you for that other time.

284
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,875
What other time?
What do you mean?

285
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,125
[NAGATO]
It's a secret.

286
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,583
A secret, ah!

287
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,250
Ah...

288
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,250
But that time wasn't...

289
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,083
[KYON]
Hm? What's the matter?

290
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,708
[NAGATO]
Nothing. Forget about it.

291
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,833
[KYON]
I think I'll have one now.

292
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,583
You're gonna eat it right now?

293
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,750
You don't want me to?

294
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,500
No, I don't care!
It doesn't matter to me!

295
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,083
[KYON]
Okay.

296
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,375
Ah! But...

297
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,000
[NAGATO]
Go ahead.

298
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,375
[NAGATO]
Another dream.

299
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,458
[NAGATO]
Just a simple little dream.

300
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,916
And I'm just an idle observer.

301
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,083
Watching her memories.

302
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,625
Just a simple dream.

303
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,166
Mind if I ask
what you're doing?

304
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh. It's just...

305
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,000
They seem close
enough to touch,

306
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,750
but then when you try
to grab them, nothing.

307
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,958
[gasps]

308
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,625
[gasps]

309
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,791
[gasps]

310
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,750
[NAGATO]
Hold on. Was that me?

311
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,625
What will happen?

312
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:56,250
Is it possible that when the
other Yuki returns completely,

313
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:01,333
I'll just, just... disappear?

314
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,625
[NAGATO]

Nagato Yuki, Part Three."
