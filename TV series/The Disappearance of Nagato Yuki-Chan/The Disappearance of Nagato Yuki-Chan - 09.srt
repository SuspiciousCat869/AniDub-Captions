1
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,166
Here, I poured you a cup, too.

2
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,208
Oh. Great, thank you.

3
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,666
This has been so nice.

4
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,708
I haven't been to a
hot spring in a long time.

5
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,875
[KYON] Yeah, the baths were
awesome. So was dinner.

6
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,125
I guess we have
Miss Tsuruya to thank.

7
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,916
We do, don't we?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,958
I mean, the
accommodations alone.

9
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,666
This inn is run by one
of her relatives, right?

10
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,916
And that store we stopped
by on the way here.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Yeah.

12
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,791
She may not act it, but she's
from a pretty wealthy family.

13
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,458
[KOIZUMI]
I didn't know that.

14
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,916
[KYON] Nice to have some
peace and quiet, huh?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,291
Yeah, it is.

16
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,375
I like how tranquil the
whole world seems at night.

17
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,208
It's so relaxing, you know?

18
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,166
Absolutely. Being someplace

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,583
--calm like this is really--
--[door slams, footsteps]

20
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,333
Hey guys, I'm here!

21
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,000
Couldn't you have
maybe locked the door?

22
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,916
Now I know for next time.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,916
You ready? The night is
just getting started!

24
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,041
Hey, you guys! We're comin' in!

25
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,750
Um. Sorry about this.

26
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,875
No problem.

27
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,500
What about the other
two? They coming?

28
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,625
No. I think it's
just us for now.

29
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,625
Miss Asahina was tired, so she
decided to stay in her room.

30
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,500
Miss Tsuruya is
staying with her.

31
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,041
You can't blame her
for being worn out

32
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,166
after what those two
did in the bath!

33
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,833
Her exhaustion was well earned.

34
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,083
[HARUHI]
Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up!

35
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,333
Okay, I found it.

36
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,541
[laughs]

37
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,583
[KOIZUMI]
Here you go.

38
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,958
[HARUHI]
Yay! Koizumi to the rescue!

39
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,416
All right, guys!

40
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,416
Now that we've got a deck
'o cards, it's time to play!

41
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,208
I now hereby
declare the opening

42
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,708
of The Late-Night
Card Game Contest!

43
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,375
People are trying to sleep.

44
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,125
It's nighttime, you know?
Keep it down, 'kay?

45
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,416
[HARUHI]
Yeah, yeah, fine.

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,958
[ASAKURA]
Don't "yeah" me.

47
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,833
Okay, what do you think
we should play first?

48
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,541
[KOIZUMI]
Well, how 'bout we play a game

49
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,000
that we all know the rules to?
That could be fun.

50
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,416
[KYON]
Yeah, that sounds good.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Let's do it this way:

52
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,333
do you know how to
play crazy eights?

53
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,500
[ALL but ASAKURA]
Yeah!

54
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,708
All right: poker?

55
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,958
--[ASAKURA] Yep!
--[HARUHI] Yeah, yeah, yeah!

56
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,000
What about Go Fish?

57
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,750
Yep, yes, yes, yes!

58
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,541
Uh. Gin rummy?

59
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,625
[NAGATO grunts]

60
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,791
There's always solitaire.

61
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,416
Yes!

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,041
[KOIZUMI, HARUHI, ASAKURA]
Hm?

63
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:24,583
[gasps]

64
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,916
It was a joke.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,416
[KYON] I didn't think anyone
would raise a hand.

66
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,833
Let me see. How
about Concentration?

67
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,250
There we go.
Concentration it i--

68
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,041
[HARUHI] Great! So we're
playing old maid?

69
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, of course we are, Haruhi.

70
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,666
And I'll be the dealer!

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,833
[giggling]

72
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,166
[HARUHI]
Done!

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Your performance in
Old Maid is a reflection

74
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,625
of the way you live your life.

75
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,541
You're gonna have to
explain that one to me.

76
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,541
[KOIZUMI] If you start out with
the joker, that's just bad luck.

77
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,833
But if you still have it at
the end, then it's probably

78
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,541
because of something
you're doing.

79
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,750
Huh?

80
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,000
[HARUHI giggles]

81
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,208
[NAGATO]
Oh...

82
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,375
See, Kyon.

83
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,333
Card games are
microcosms of human life.

84
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,583
Oh, I hope that's
not really the case.

85
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,208
[NAGATO]
Huh...

86
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,500
[NAGATO gasps]

87
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,416
[ASAKURA, HARUHI cackle]

88
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,791
Um, don't. Please don't.

89
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,958
All right, Koizumi,
you're first.

90
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,166
Okay.

91
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,666
So, what's the
loser have to do?

92
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,458
Huh? Aw...

93
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,083
Jeez, you love your penalties.

94
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,500
No kidding.

95
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,250
Why don't we just skip the
penalty this time around?

96
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,208
[KOIZUMI] I don't know,
I think it sounds fun.

97
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,833
Yeah! What's the point
of playing a game

98
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,958
if you aren't gonna
risk anything?

99
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,708
What do you think, Yuki?

100
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,250
About doing a penalty? Hm...

101
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,208
I think it can be fun when
there are stakes to a game.

102
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,208
[yelps]

103
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,583
Within reason.

104
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,916
If the penalty's not crazy,
then I think it's fine.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,500
Oh? "Not Crazy," huh?

106
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,125
Well then, let me ask you,
what exactly would qualify

107
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,125
as "crazy" by your standards?

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,666
I'd like to hear
the answer to this.

109
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,500
I think it could be helpful.
For future reference, you know.

110
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,791
[gasps]

111
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,041
[KYON] Okay, both of
you. That's enough.

112
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:28,041
Lay off. Quit giving
her a hard time.

113
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,750
If we are gonna have a
penalty, let's make it easy.

114
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,291
The loser can go out
and buy some snacks

115
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,625
and drinks for everybody.

116
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,291
How boring! A snack
run's not a penalty!

117
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,208
I think it should be
something a lot tougher.

118
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,375
[NAGATO whimpers]

119
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,875
Uh... Actually,
on second thought,

120
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,833
I'll allow it as
a warm-up this time,

121
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,375
since it's only the first
round for us and all.

122
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,791
[sighs]

123
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,666
[KYON]
Hm...

124
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,166
[NAGATO]
Thanks for that.

125
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,541
[KYON]
Hm? Uh--

126
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,708
Oh-- Ah!

127
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,208
[ASAKURA] Hm... Things are
starting to get a little more

128
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,625
natural between them.

129
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,583
He casually helped her,
and she casually thanked him.

130
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,333
Oh my, it seems
they're growing

131
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,125
closer and closer by the minute.

132
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,583
They're so comfortable
in front of other people.

133
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,125
I wonder what would happen
if they were alone?

134
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,666
Things could get
out of hand, fast!

135
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,791
--[HARUHI] Yes!
--[gasps]

136
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,916
[HARUHI]
Game over!

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,916
[NAGATO]
Looks like I lose.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,291
You had the joker from
the beginning, didn't you?

139
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,791
Yeah, how did you know?

140
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,666
Your poker face is the worst.

141
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,916
[NAGATO]
Oh!

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,458
Looks like you're off
to buy us some snacks.

143
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,250
All right. I'll be
back in a bit.

144
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,791
[KYON]
Wait.

145
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,208
I'm going with you.

146
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,916
Really? You're coming?

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,541
Yep.

148
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,291
[growls]

149
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,625
[HARUHI]
Hold on a sec!

150
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,125
If you go, too, then it's
not much of a penalty.

151
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,625
Well, what do you
want me to do?

152
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,625
She can't go out in a strange
area by herself at night.

153
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,833
[gasps]

154
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,041
Okay, then I'll go with you.

155
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,291
No, that's all right.

156
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,875
If we all go, then
it really won't be

157
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,875
much of a penalty anymore.

158
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,625
I think the two of
us can handle it.

159
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,458
I mean, we're just
getting snacks.

160
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,833
Well, I don't care what
he says, I'm going.

00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,208
[gasps]

162
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,916
In other words--

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,458
[ASAKURA]
I'll tail them!

164
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,541
[yelps]

165
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,083
[KYON]
Are you okay?

166
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,625
I am. Thanks.
That was a good catch.

167
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,916
There aren't very many
streetlights around here.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,958
We should really watch
where we're going.

169
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,375
[NAGATO]
Yeah, probably.

170
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,375
Hey, I know. Here.

171
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,583
Oh--

172
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,208
This should help keep
us both from falling.

173
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,125
[ASAKURA, HARUHI gasping]

--[ASAKURA gasping]
--[HARUHI laughing]

176
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,958
Nooooo!

177
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,833
Ahhh! What's wrong?
You scared me!

178
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,208
Huh?

179
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,250
Uh. Oh. I'm really sorry.

180
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,833
I-- [pants]

181
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,375
Give me some water?

182
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,791
Here. Have it all.

183
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,458
[ASAKURA]
Great, thanks.

184
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,250
[ASAKURA]
Whoa! That was a shock!

185
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,958
What was? No one
here did anything.

186
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,458
Yeah, that's Ryoko.

187
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,208
She can make any
situation a tense one.

188
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,833
[ASAKURA]
I can't believe I scared myself

189
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,291
with my own daydream.
How embarrassing.

190
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,666
That's not the point, though!

191
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,458
If Nagato loses,
that's the kind of thing

192
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,583
that could actually happen!

193
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,750
Yeah!

194
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,041
[ASAKURA]
Get a hold of yourself, Ryoko.

195
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,916
[NAGATO]
That's it. I'm out of cards.

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,708
[ASAKURA] Any way you look
at it, I'm worrying too much.

197
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,375
[KYON]
Me, too. All done!

198
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,416
Huh?

199
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,083
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

200
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,250
[gasps]

201
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,541
[ASAKURA]
Ah...

202
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, guess we
know who's buyin'

203
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:24,166
our snacks, don't we?
Now, on to the next game!

204
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,583
[KYON]
Yeah! Let's do it. What's next?

205
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,333
Hello, hello!

206
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,625
Mikuru's all rested up now,
so we thought we'd drop by.

207
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,875
Better late than never.

208
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,750
Hey there. Glad you're
feeling better.

209
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,750
It's just the two
of you here, then?

210
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,916
[KYON] Koizumi lost a round
and had to do some squats

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,750
as a penalty, so he's
off taking another bath.

212
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,625
As for the other two,
see for yourself.

213
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,500
[whimpering]

214
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,875
[HARUHI snoring]

215
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,916
[KYON]
They're getting some shut-eye.

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
It's not surprising.

217
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,333
Asakura is a creature of habit.

218
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,125
She's usually already in
bed by this time of night.

219
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,708
And I'll bet just being
Haru must get exhausting.

220
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,875
So that's her excuse.

221
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,666
You two have just
been having a cozy

222
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,500
game of concentration, then?

223
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,458
[KYON]
Heh, It feels a bit more like

224
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,958
a boring game of not-real-cards.

225
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,458
Well, in that case,

226
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,666
I guess I'll just have to let
you in on a little secret.

227
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,375
You'll find it if you go a bit
further up on the mountain.

228
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,583
There's this little observatory
that's perfect for stargazing.

229
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,958
Why not check it out?

230
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,375
Stargazing?

231
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,500
That's part of the reason
I suggested this inn:

232
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,291
so we could all go up there.

233
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,541
But, someone's gotta keep
an eye on those two

234
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,416
sleeping beauties, eh?

235
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,375
But there's nothing to
stop you from going.

236
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:52,333
[KYON, NAGATO panting]

237
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,416
Ow.

238
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,625
How you doin'? Are you
holding up okay?

239
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,625
Yeah. I think so.

240
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,916
I'm getting really
sweaty, though.

241
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,916
But that's all right. I can
always take another bath.

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,333
Is your ankle hurt?

243
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,666
[NAGATO]
No, it's okay.

244
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,833
This is a steep hill, and
we've covered a lot more

245
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,875
ground than I thought
we were going to.

246
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,750
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

247
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,000
[KYON]
Well...

248
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,583
I guess that's what we
get for taking anything

249
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,041
Tsuruya says at face value.

250
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,083
[KYON] I can't say I'm
super comfortable wandering

251
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,041
around here in
the dead of night.

252
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,791
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

253
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,000
[KYON]
Maybe we should hold hands.

254
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,083
Just to keep from falling.

255
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,375
What?

256
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,541
[KYON] Or maybe it would be
a better idea to just give up

257
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,041
and go back to the inn.

258
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,750
No, it's all right.

259
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,166
I mean, it shouldn't be a
big deal if we try going

260
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,291
a little bit further on, right?

261
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,333
But if you wanna
go back, that's okay.

262
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,166
No, you're right.
Let's keep going.

263
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,000
We've come this far, haven't we?
So! Onward and upward, it is!

264
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,750
Take it.

265
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,708
[gasps]

266
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,208
Thank you, but,

267
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,666
I'm sleepy, so, my hands are
kind of sweaty and you know.

268
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,125
Don't worry. I'm not
afraid of a little sweat.

269
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,458
Hm? Since when does getting
sleepy make your hands sweat?

270
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,458
[NAGATO]
Uh-- Um...

271
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,166
How pathetic!

272
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,000
Are those two idiots
ever going to hold hands?

273
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,250
You just woke up, you
sure got a lot of energy!

274
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,875
Well, we're on an
important mission!

275
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,875
We are the only ones
standing between those two

276
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,375
and romantic disaster.

277
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,250
There's no time for
us to be sleepy!

278
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,916
I'm not just here to help
you with your crazy plan.

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,333
The reason I'm here
is for the stargazing.

280
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,125
I was also considering that
you might end up getting lonely

281
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,708
out here all by yourself.

282
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,750
So you should thank me, really.

283
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,541
Come on. They're on the move.

284
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,166
[groans]

285
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,208
Dinosaurs?

286
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,958
[HARUHI]
Wa-hoo!

287
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,041
[laughs]

288
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,500
Hey, quit messing
around, would you?

289
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,833
Stop being so grumpy.

290
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,333
We're here, so let's
have a little fun!

291
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,875
Go on, you slide, too!

292
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,041
[sighs]

293
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,041
[HARUHI]
Come on.

294
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,750
What's it gonna take to get
you to chill out a little?

295
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,083
Huh?

296
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,875
[HARUHI] You were waiting
for them to hold hands,

297
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,250
weren't you? So why wouldn't
them dating be okay?

298
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,750
But at the same time,
you don't want them

299
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,708
to end up crossing the line.

300
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,458
[ASAKURA]
Hm...

301
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,666
[ASAKURA]
Do I want them to start dating?

302
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, that would make me happy.

303
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,208
Except...

304
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,875
I feel like the closer
Nagato and Kyon get,

305
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,083
the more time she
spends with him,

306
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,500
the further she
and I drift apart.

307
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,958
It makes me sorta lonely.

308
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,791
Maybe I shouldn't feel
that way, but I do.

309
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,666
The truth is out now.

310
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,500
[ASAKURA]
It's not concern I'm feeling.

311
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm just jealous,
that's what it is.

312
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,166
[HARUHI]
Ryoko...

313
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,916
[ASAKURA]
Hm?

314
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,208
That's the stupidest
thing I ever heard.

315
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,916
[ASAKURA]
Stop it!

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,208
Would it kill you to be
nice to me, just this once?

317
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,458
I'm a little
fragile here, Haruhi!

318
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,708
Yeah.

319
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,750
[HARUHI]
I mean, come on.

320
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,291
It's just that you and
Yuki are so close,

321
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,333
I can't understand what you
have to be worried about.

322
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,708
What happens between those
two is beside the point.

323
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,000
That is not gonna change your
friendship with Yuki at all.

324
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,750
In fact, I'll even give you
my personal guarantee!

325
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,083
You guaranteeing it only
makes me more worried.

326
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,333
I don't see why.

327
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,583
Even so, I can tell
you were trying

328
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:51,166
to be nice to me for
a change. So, thanks.

329
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,083
[HARUHI]
I was mocking you, Ryoko.

330
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,708
I didn't do anything
to deserve your thanks.

331
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,291
Ahhh! That's Archaeopteryx!

332
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,500
It's, like, the coolest
dinosaur ever!

333
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,333
[ASAKURA]
Uh, can you hold on a second?

334
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,541
Huh?

335
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,791
[ASAKURA]
It's my butt. It got stuck.

336
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,458
Take a look at this guy.

337
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,250
He's got a hole right
through his middle.

338
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,041
No wonder he's extinct.

339
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,250
[HARUHI grunting]
Up!

340
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,041
[ASAKURA, HARUHI grunting]

341
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,083
[HARUHI]
Come on!

342
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,041
[ASAKURA]
Pull!

343
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,666
My finger.

344
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,708
Huh?

345
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,791
[KYON]
It's a girl!

346
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:45,500
[ASAKURA, HARUHI panting]

347
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,208
[BOTH scream]

348
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,458
Did ya have a nice nap?

349
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,916
[HARUHI]
People think Dilophosauruses

350
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,583
had big neck frills
and spewed venom,

351
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,625
but there's really no proof

352
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,458
that they were
actually like that.

353
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,166
Really? No! I won't
get distracted!

354
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,708
[TSURUYA] Oh, hey!
You guys takin' a break?

355
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,125
[ASAKURA, NAGATO, HARUHI]
Huh?

356
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,166
[TSURUYA] Mikuru got tired
again. Big surprise, huh?

357
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,708
[TSURUYA] Well, come on.
We're almost there.

358
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,208
[KYON]
She climbed that whole hill

359
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:20,625
with Miss Asahina on her back?
Scary. Amazing! But scary.

360
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,333
[ALL gasping]

361
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,333
[NAGATO]
Beautiful.

362
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,750
[KYON] This really is
an incredible view.

363
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,000
[ASAKURA]
Yeah, it is.

364
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,458
[HARUHI]
Good job, Miss Tsuruya!

365
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,625
[TSURUYA] I'm glad you all
like it. I do what I can.

366
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,875
By the way, I
stopped by the baths

367
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,916
and asked Koizumi to join us.

368
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,291
He said he'd come up
later with snacks.

369
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,708
He was in the bath, huh?

370
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,041
All right. No further
details needed.

371
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,791
Wow. You can see the
stars so clearly.

372
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:15,541
I wouldn't be surprised if
we saw a spaceship or a UFO!

373
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,333
Yeah, I know what you mean.

374
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,333
Are you interested
in aliens, too?

375
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,666
[NAGATO]
Huh?

376
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,416
[HARUHI] Let's make some
astronomical observations!

377
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,958
Oh, yeah, the message!

378
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,333
This might be a
good place for it.

379
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,666
A message?

380
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,500
[HARUHI] I gotta find
something to write with,

381
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,208
like a stick or something.

382
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,666
Uh...

383
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,791
[HARUHI]
anything will do,

384
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,333
I just need something
to write with!

385
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,833
[NAGATO]
Uh, I, uh.

386
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,250
Hey, you two!

387
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,083
Don't just stand there,
help us with our observations!

388
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,458
Is that an order?

389
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,458
Hey, you too, Mikuru
and Miss Tsuruy.

390
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,625
Huh?

391
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,333
[HARUHI]
On second thought, never mind.

392
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,958
You can just stay
there and rest.

393
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,333
[sighs]

394
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,333
[HARUHI]
Get ready to find something!

395
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,000
[KOIZUMI]
Hello, everybody.

396
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,000
Phew. Sorry if you
were waiting long.

397
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,250
Yay!

398
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:04,291
Snacks for everybody,
thanks Koizumi! Yummy!

399
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,166
Ooh, look!

400
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,833
[ASAKURA] Oh good, there
are drinks. I'm so thirsty!

401
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,250
That wasn't exactly
a leisurely stroll.

402
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, no kidding.
You're drenched in sweat.

403
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,625
[KOIZUMI]
Yeah. Guess I'll have to take

404
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,375
another bath when we
get back to the inn, huh?

405
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,500
Hey, man. Personal
space, remember?

406
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,666
Hey, look!

407
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,125
We're all up here,
just like I was hoping.

408
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,208
Yeah, it's nice, huh?

409
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,500
[HARUHI]
All right, guys.

410
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,208
Now that we're all here,
we can decide

411
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,375
what our next activity is
going to be for the night!

412
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,958
Anyone have any ideas?

413
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,000
[KYON]
We should conserve energy,

414
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
or we're gonna need
a rescue party.

415
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,916
Got it! Does anyone
wanna play tag with me?

416
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,416
Nope. Overruled.

417
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,041
How 'bout doing something calm,
like looking at the stars?

418
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,000
Overruled!

419
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,500
[KYON]
Oh, come on!

--[HARUHI] But it's boring!
--[TSURUYA] You guys!

[distant bickering]

422
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,125
You wanna play tag
with me, don't you?

423
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,708
[laughs] That does sound fun.

424
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,541
[HARUHI] All right,
Mikuru! Start running!

425
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,458
[TSURUYA]
Mikuru, go on!

426
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,916
[MIKURU]
Huh? Wha--? No!

427
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,791
[HARUHI]
Whoa! She's it!

428
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,083
Mind if I ask what you're doing?

429
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,541
Oh, it's just...

430
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,750
They seem close enough to touch,

431
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,625
but then you try to
grab them, and, nothing.

432
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,041
[KYON]
Hm.

433
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,291
[KYON] I'm kinda hungry.
Wanna go grab some snacks?

434
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,833
[NAGATO]
Sure.

435
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,500
Let's go, then.

436
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,583
'Kay.

[train horn blares]

438
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,583
[NAGATO]
It's time to head home.

439
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,000
[sighs] I really hate it
when it rains every day

440
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,791
like this, don't you?

441
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:25,916
[NAGATO]
Mm.

442
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,958
[ASAKURA]
And summer break will start

443
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,166
as soon as the rainy
season is over.

444
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,166
Have you come up
with a plan yet?

445
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,250
[NAGATO] What do you mean?
A plan for what?

446
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,250
[ASAKURA]
Well, summer means no school,

447
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,750
which means no Literary
Club meetings, right?

448
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,375
And that means you
won't have any excuse

449
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,791
to spend time with Kyon
like you usually do.

450
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,083
So, you may have to get creative

451
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,708
if you want the
chance to see him.

452
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,583
[NAGATO]
Oh, yeah? Hm. Like what?

453
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,333
[ASAKURA]
It could be anything, really.

go to a museum!"

[NAGATO]
I think I get it.

00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,791
You've only known him for what,

458
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:02,000
half a year now? I'm sure you
can think of lots of things

459
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,208
you haven't done together yet.

460
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,000
[ASAKURA]
I'll go get the shopping done.

461
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,791
Don't wanna miss
the good sales.

Okay. See ya later.
