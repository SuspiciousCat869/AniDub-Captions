[inhales, exhales]

2
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,708
I'm sorry it took
me so lo-- [gasps]

3
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,291
[ASAKURA] She went in!
Good luck! You can do it!

4
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,041
--[clatter]
--Huh?

5
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,041
Huh? Where are you going?

6
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,625
Wait, come back!

7
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,125
[KYON]
Hey. Nagato!

8
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,541
What's going on?
Why did she take off?

9
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,583
[gasps]

10
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,958
Yes. I will stay strong.

11
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,625
U-Uh--

12
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,958
Give that to me!

13
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,875
What do you think you're
doing? This isn't yours!

14
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,833
How dare you!

15
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,791
[KOIZUMI]
Hey there, everyone.

16
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,083
Things seem tense.
Is something wrong?

17
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,000
[HARUHI]
Not at all. Everything's fine.

18
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,166
[growls]

19
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,125
If there was something
wrong. It'd be...

20
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,291
...just a misunderstanding.

21
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:22,583
Oh, is this chocolate for me?
Thanks. That's very sweet.

22
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,166
[HARUHI] Finding her is what
matters most right now.

23
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,916
You can yell at me later.
Let's get looking.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,041
[sighs] Hold on, I'm coming!

25
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,000
Hey, wait a sec!

26
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,083
[KOIZUMI] I don't think
they're coming back.

27
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,083
I feel like I missed something.

28
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:45,625
Uh? You got some, too, huh?

29
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,333
Uh--

30
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,166
[HARUHI panting]

31
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,750
[HARUHI]
Hm.

32
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,250
[panting]

33
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,875
[ASAKURA] She could be anywhere.
How am I gonna find her?

34
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,125
[TENNIS PLAYER A]
Okay, let's see it!

35
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,166
[TENNIS PLAYER B]
All right, let's go!

36
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,083
[TENNIS PLAYER A]
And... go!

37
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,833
[TENNIS COACH A]
Good serve!

38
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,375
[ASAKURA]
Well, any luck?

39
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,958
[HARUHI]
Mm-mm.

40
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,500
[ASAKURA sighs]

41
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,958
[HARUHI]
I'm not going to apologize.

42
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,500
I gave him some chocolate,
what's the big deal?

43
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,958
It's Valentine's.
That's what people do.

44
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,000
[TENNIS PLAYER A]
Sorry 'bout that!

45
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,500
[TENNIS COACH A]
Focus! Focus!

46
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,291
[TENNIS PLAYER A]
Yes, sir!

47
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,375
[ASAKURA]
That's not true.

48
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,000
It's a lot more
complicated than that,

49
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,083
and you know it!

50
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,166
You know it's about more than

51
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,750
some stupid holiday
to her! Come on!

52
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,208
Even if it was just
a friendly gift.

53
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,833
why give it to him before her

54
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,125
when you know what
she had planned?

55
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,416
I really think
you're overreacting.

56
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,125
Mine was obviously platonic,

57
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,666
so why does the
timing even matter?

58
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,666
You really don't get it, do you?
But I guess you wouldn't, huh?!

59
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,041
When you want something,

60
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,250
you just make it happen,
regardless of other people.

61
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,208
How was I supposed to
know it was a big deal?

62
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,583
Pay attention for two seconds!

63
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,791
I do pay attention!

64
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,416
[gasps]

65
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,000
[ASAKURA]
I'm just so angry.

66
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,875
[ASAKURA] I don't know what
to do with all this anger.

67
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,083
[ASAKURA sobs]

68
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,541
I told her what to do and how,
like I was some expert.

69
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,958
And then when it fell apart,
I blamed somebody else.

70
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,583
I'm a real piece of work.

71
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,458
I'm so, so mad at myself.

72
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,041
[sighs]

73
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,333
Take it easy.

74
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,458
You're gonna cry
yourself to death. Okay?

75
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,291
Pull yourself together.
This isn't like you.

76
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,125
[HARUHI]
Hm?

77
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,791
[growls]

78
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,791
[BOTH scream]

79
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,666
Okay! No more wasting
time on regrets!

80
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,458
I just have to learn from
my mistakes, that's all!

81
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,958
Time to move on!

82
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:33,041
[giggles, laughs] You're
really somethin' else!

83
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,625
[KOIZUMI]
Sorry about this.

84
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,750
Guess I didn't exactly pick
the best time in the world

85
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,625
to show up then, huh?

86
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,500
[KYON] No. Don't worry.
It's not like that.

87
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,791
Well, obviously this is
just a courtesy gift then.

88
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,375
But that doesn't really matter.

89
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,666
Miss Suzumiya was the
one who gave it to me.

90
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,625
That alone is enough to
make it special in my book.

91
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,916
Anyhow, it's a holiday.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,250
In keeping with the
Valentine's Day spirit,

93
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,083
we should really be
considerate of each other.

94
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,041
Mmm, this is good.

95
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,125
Sorry, I've got
something to do.

96
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,875
See ya later.

97
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,583
[door clicks]

98
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,250
[ASAKURA] Now that I'm
thinking more clearly,

99
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,625
I realized something.

100
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,958
Yeah, what's that?

101
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,375
This whole situation is
partially Nagato's fault.

102
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,250
What?

103
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,708
Think about it like this:

104
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,125
The devil is getting ready
to make off with the heroine

105
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,000
and the hero just runs away?

106
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,583
The devil?

107
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,875
I know she's timid,
but she's gotta realize

108
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,416
there are times when you
can't just head for the hills!

109
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,875
I thought she got past this
when the club was in danger.

110
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,500
Guess I was wrong.

111
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,458
[ASAKURA] I wonder if
I'm forcing my own ideals

112
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,708
on her too much. That's
not very fair of me.

113
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,041
[HARUHI]
There she is!

114
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,625
Huh?

115
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,583
[gasps]

116
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,666
Where have you been?

117
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,750
Sorry!

118
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,250
[ASAKURA]
Don't you "sorry" me!

119
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,583
What are you doing here?
Explain yourself!

120
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,333
Oh, nothing.

121
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,416
It's because you saw her
giving him chocolate, right?

122
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,875
That's what made you
lose your nerve.

123
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,583
What? Well...

124
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,250
I don't see why it
should change anything.

125
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,458
Of course he's going to get
chocolate from other people!

126
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,166
I mean, it's Valentine's Day.

127
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,541
That's just kinda how it works!

128
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,375
You can't get discouraged
by every last little thing.

129
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,333
That's no way to live your life!

130
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,500
[gasps]

131
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,458
[ASAKURA]
Why are you so quick to give up?

132
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,041
Are your feelings
for him so trivial,

133
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,666
you can forget about
them that easily?

134
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,916
Answer me already!

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,666
Uh, sorry. You've
got it all wrong.

136
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,291
--[ASAKURA] Say what?
--Huh?

137
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,375
I'm just waiting. Don't worry.
I'll give them to him.

138
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,500
You will?

139
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,000
That's the plan.

140
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,458
Really? But I was so frantic.

141
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,750
I thought for sure
you'd run off for good.

142
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:30,125
[laughs] I'm not giving up,
if that's what you thought.

143
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,291
In that case,

144
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,333
why did you leave
the chocolates behind?

145
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,666
[NAGATO] Hm? The chocolates?
I have them right here.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,625
I can't find them!

147
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,250
[laughs]

148
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,416
What's so funny?

149
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Here. Your chocolates.

150
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,666
[gasps]

151
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,291
Hold it! There's still
somethin' I wanna know.

152
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,416
Huh?

153
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,166
If you really are
giving them to him,

154
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,666
then why'd you run
out of the clubroom

155
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,375
like it was on fire?

156
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,291
About that...

157
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,166
I thought that you would
wanna be alone with him.

158
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,208
Leaving seemed like
the polite thing to do,

159
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,083
so I left in a hurry.

160
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,791
Huh? Sounds kinda stupid.

161
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,291
If someone's trying to
interfere with your love life,

162
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,666
why should you give
a crap how they feel?

163
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,750
You're not interfering.
If I were in your shoes,

164
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,041
I wouldn't want somebody there
when I was giving my gift.

165
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,541
Know what I mean?

166
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,875
[HARUHI]
Yeah.

167
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,416
Hold on.

168
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:50,625
[NAGATO] So, just, you
know, out of curiosity.

169
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,416
Do you have...? Are you, um...

170
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:59,041
Are you in love
with him? Kyon, I mean?

171
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,833
[KYON]
I dunno. They could be real.

172
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,041
To be honest, I can't
say I dislike him.

173
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,958
[HARUHI]
So. There you have it.

174
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:26,250
You know how I feel now.
What'll you do? Well?

175
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,625
[NAGATO]
Nothing's really changed.

176
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,958
Huh?

177
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,833
I'm still planning to
give my chocolates to him.

178
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,375
Well then, good luck!

179
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,958
Ah! Are you sure?
Do you need any help?

180
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,416
Ryoko, stop!

181
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,083
--[HARUHI] Hmph.
--[ASAKURA whines]

182
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,125
Oh, no! It's got a dent in it!

183
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,458
Hey, this is really good tim--

184
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,375
What took so long?

185
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,333
--[yelps]
--You sure like to

186
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,916
make an entrance, don't you?

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,625
[KYON] Sorry. Uh, so,
did you find Nagato?

188
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,750
[gasps]

189
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,125
[HARUHI] We'll just get
out of your way now.

190
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,375
Uh...

191
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,750
[HARUHI] You made the
effort to come find her.

192
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,916
That's something.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,583
[KYON] Huh? What's that
supposed to mean?

194
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,916
Is she okay?

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,416
Stay with her, Kyon.
Do we understand each other?

196
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Uh, sure.

197
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,875
--Take care of my girl!
--You got it!

198
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,833
[KYON]
What was all that about?

199
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,875
Uh...

200
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,875
[KYON] Well, it's good
I found her, I guess,

201
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,166
but what should I do now?

202
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,875
So, uh...

203
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:46,583
Huh?

204
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,208
Before, in the clubroom.

205
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,291
I know I took off
pretty suddenly.

206
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,875
I'm, um, sorry about that.

207
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,500
Don't worry.
It's not a big deal.

208
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,708
Cold out here, huh?

209
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,875
[grunts]

210
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,875
So, uh... You wanna
go back, then?

211
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,458
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm.

212
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,708
[NAGATO]
Hold on!

213
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,083
Huh? What is it?

214
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:29,083
Well, um. Here's this.

215
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,708
Something for you.
Go ahead. Take it.

216
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:42,291
[KYON]
Uh... Okay.

217
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,666
Um, thank you very much!

218
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,125
Oh, you're very welcome!

219
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,541
[KYON]
Here.

220
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,291
It smells great.

221
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,041
[paper rustling]

222
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,666
You're gonna open it here?

223
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,875
You don't want me to?

224
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,041
No. I mean, it doesn't
really matter to me.

225
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,000
Go ahead.

226
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,666
[KYON]
Okay, cool.

227
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,875
[KYON] Whoa! They look
like they're homemade.

228
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,458
Are they?

229
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,708
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm.

230
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,458
Actually, Asakura helped
me put them together.

231
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,083
I didn't do much, really.

232
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,166
Just melted some chocolate,
poured it in cups,

233
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,625
and put sprinkles on top.

234
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:32,000
So I don't know how "homemade"
it is, to be honest.

235
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,041
Oh, but don't worry.
I used good ingredients.

236
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,625
So they should taste okay!

237
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,375
Uh--

238
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,875
Stupid, stupid!

239
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,666
I've gotta learn when
to shut my mouth.

240
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,000
[NAGATO]
Calm down. Calm down...

241
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,541
I'm sold. I think
I'll have one now.

242
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,083
You're gonna eat it right now?

243
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,333
You don't want me to?

244
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,833
No, no, I don't care!
It doesn't matter to me!

245
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,583
[KYON]
Okay.

246
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,541
Ah! But...

247
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,708
--[NAGATO] Go ahead.
--[KYON] Now I'm just gonna feel

248
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,958
kinda weird eating it.

249
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,166
What?

250
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,458
Why does the idea of me
eating it right now

251
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,166
bother you so much?

252
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,375
Oh! I get it!

253
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,875
It's like Russian
roulette or something.

254
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,458
I bet one of them
has hot sauce in it!

255
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,458
Why would I do that?

256
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,958
Okay, then what is it?

257
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,791
How can I explain it? Ah!

258
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,250
Okay, it's like, when you're
riding a bike at night,

259
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,958
and everything is
quiet and empty

260
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,250
so you start singing a love song
real loudly and then suddenly

261
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,375
a pedestrian turns the
corner and you're not alone!

262
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,416
[KYON]
Personal experience much?

263
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,750
Oh, or, like when
you draw a real

264
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,625
lovey-dovey comic
and then later...

265
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,125
...somebody asks to
borrow your notebook.

266
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,125
[KYON]
Nope. Still don't get it.

267
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,041
[NAGATO]
Then...

268
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,083
[KYON]
You know, tell ya what.

269
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,208
I'm just gonna eat one.

270
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,791
This one here.
I'll even count down.

271
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,833
If you wanna stop me,
now's the time. Ten!

272
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,208
Oh, no. What do
I do? What do I do?

273
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,250
Nine!

274
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,125
Ah. Maybe you should
take your time

275
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,291
--and savor it at home.
--[KYON] Eight!

276
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,625
Doesn't that sound nice?

277
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,458
[KYON]
Seven!

278
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,916
[NAGATO gasps]

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,958
Six, five, four,

280
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,000
--three, two, one... Zero!
--No!

281
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,625
[NAGATO]
That was completely unfair.

282
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,500
I did a standard countdown.

283
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,041
[NAGATO]
Well? How is it?

284
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,375
Let's see. It wasn't
spicy at all.

285
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,125
[NAGATO] That's not exactly
what I was asking.

286
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,958
[chuckles]

287
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,583
[KYON]
It was good.

288
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,666
[KYON] Thanks again. I'm glad
I've got a whole box.

289
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,666
[NAGATO]
Sure. I'm glad you like it.

290
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,625
[ASAKURA] Hmm. She gave
them to him, at least.

291
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,291
Though it'd be stretching
the truth to say

292
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,791
things are going smoothly.

293
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,416
Really? I thought it
looked all right.

294
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,750
Well, it's not like it's going

295
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,583
horribly wrong or anything.
But it's possible...

296
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,708
She focused so much
on the chocolates,

297
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,958
that she forgot the
whole part about

298
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,750
confessing her love for him.

299
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,958
[HARUHI]
Is a confession even necessary?

300
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,250
She's blushing so hard, I'm
starting to feel embarrassed

301
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,208
just watching
their conversation.

302
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,458
You think he really
needs it spelled out?

303
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,625
[ASAKURA]
True.

304
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,916
She's red enough that
even if she wasn't

305
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,291
in love with him, any guy
would think she was.

306
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,791
But, a certain someone had
already given him chocolates,

307
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,583
so he may be thrown
off the scent.

308
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,333
It was just a friendly gift!

309
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,208
But because he got those,

310
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,750
he might think
that her chocolates

311
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,958
are just a friendly gift, too.
Look at him. He's oblivious.

312
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,416
And it's all my fault.

313
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,291
[ASAKURA sighs]
Oh, I'm sorry.

314
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,708
It's just easy to say this
stuff to you, somehow.

315
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,750
Seriously.

316
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,875
I think you may be
as bad as Kyon.

317
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,458
Both of you are so mean.

318
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,083
[ASAKURA] You say that,
but it doesn't actually

319
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,875
seem to bother you.
Maybe you're a masochist.

320
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,291
What?!

321
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,208
[ASAKURA] If only she had
half your self-confidence

322
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,375
and optimism,
she'd be set for life.

323
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,916
[HARUHI]
Blah, blah, blah!

324
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,083
Even if the guy thinks
it is a courtesy gift.

325
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,916
It should be enough.
Just having given it to him.

326
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,041
Oh. Look! They're on the move.

327
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,291
[HARUHI] Probably headed
back to the clubroom.

328
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,875
[ASAKURA] Well, we don't
know that for sure yet.

329
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,500
[NAGATO]
Okay. I gave him the chocolates.

330
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,333
And he tried them
in front of me.

331
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,916
And miraculously, he
said they were good.

332
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,291
So now, the next step is...
t-t-t-t-to tell h-h-him.

333
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,500
Kyon!

334
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,625
[KYON]
Hm?

335
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,083
What is it?

336
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,208
Looks like she remembered
the love part, after all.

337
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,333
Well...

338
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,250
[KYON]
Hm?

339
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,208
I wanted to tell you...

340
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,000
--I--
--[TSURUYA] Hey, hey, hey!

341
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,333
--[HARUHI] Huh?
--[ASAKURA] Why now?

342
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,708
[TSURUYA] You managed to
give him chocolates, Naga!

343
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,791
I'm so proud of you!

344
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,458
Ah! I've got you!

345
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,250
[NAGATO]
Ah...

346
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,166
Uh, left hand isn't
strong enough...

347
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,333
Oh... Well, that hurt.

348
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,541
[gasps]

349
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,833
[KYON]
Uh...

350
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,833
He's on my...

351
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,708
[screams]

352
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,791
[ASAKURA]
I am going to kill him!

353
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,291
[HARUHI] What a good
chaperone! See ya later!

354
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,083
Sorry, Naga. I can be
kind of intense sometimes.

355
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,208
--How about you, Kyon?
--[NAGATO] My chest...

356
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,708
Okay down there?

357
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,083
[KOIZUMI]
Hey there, everyone.

358
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,750
--[NAGATO] My chest.
--Oh, finally. There you are.

359
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,583
I've been looking everywhere.

360
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,750
What happened here?

361
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,916
You had something to do
with this, didn't you?

362
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,083
It wasn't me. You know
how handsy Kyon gets.

363
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,666
[ASAKURA]
I'm here, Nagato!

364
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,416
[yelps]

365
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,833
[ASAKURA]
And as for you...

366
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,833
[KYON screams]

367
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,625
Huh. Buncha loons.
What are they doing?

368
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,500
[HARUHI] What am I doing,
for that matter?

369
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,791
[HARUHI] So, do you think
aliens are real or not?

370
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,166
[KYON]
I dunno.

371
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,000
[KYON]
They could be real.

372
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,708
[HARUHI]
Hm?

373
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,750
Well, I'm done,

374
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,666
so I'm goin' home now. See ya!

375
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,666
[KYON]
Hey!

376
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,208
[KYON] John Smith wishes
you the best of luck

377
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,000
in making the world
more exciting!

378
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,666
[HARUHI]
I guess I better join 'em.

379
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,916
Wow.

380
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,250
[KYON] I thought I would
return the favor.

381
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,250
That's what White Day
is all about, isn't it?

382
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,625
Yeah! This is wonderful!
Thank you so much!

383
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,416
Sure thing. It's no big deal.

384
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,166
I'm really glad
you like it though.

385
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,791
That's very thoughtful
of him, don't you think?

386
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,291
[HARUHI]
Hm...

387
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,208
Hey, can I see that a sec?

388
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,875
Huh? Sure, here you go.

389
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,875
Yep. They're exactly the same.

390
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,000
Here, thanks.

391
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,458
What was that about?
Oh, I see.

392
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,083
You were hoping that yours
was bigger, weren't you?

393
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,541
Sorry, you guys got
exactly the same one.

394
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,791
Measure any way you want.

395
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,375
You'll find they're
the same size.

396
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,583
One for you, and one for me!

397
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,875
[KYON]
Uh-- What is it now?

398
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,416
Oh nothing.

399
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,166
I guess he doesn't understand
girls very well, does he?

400
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,375
Oh really?

401
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,041
Well, you gave me a game
only an 80-year-old

402
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,583
would like, Koizumi.

403
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,541
[KOIZUMI]
I guess you have a point.

404
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,291
Do you mind if I open it now?

405
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,416
[KYON]
No. Just don't expect too much.

406
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,416
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm. Anything's great.

407
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,916
I never thought I would get a
present in the first place, so.

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,708
[NAGATO giggles]

409
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,875
[KOIZUMI, HARUHI, ASAKURA]
This is so sad.

410
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,083
[HARUHI] Why the heck did
that idiot give us the same

411
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,500
thank-you present when
my chocolate was obviously

412
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,250
a courtesy gift and
hers were homemade?

413
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,916
[ASAKURA sighs]
Looks like I was right earlier.

414
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,666
He must have thought that hers
were just a courtesy gift, too.

415
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,291
I'm surprised you
didn't say anything

416
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,833
when he gave them to us.

417
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,375
Your face when we found out
they were the same...

418
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,333
I thought your head
was gonna explode.

419
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,958
Yeah, I know.

420
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,958
but I saw how happy Nagato was,
so I decided to leave it.

421
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,666
Don't eat 'em!

422
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,875
[ASAKURA]
Huh. You seem kind of upset.

423
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:00,958
Is Kyon's White Day gift
really that important to you?

424
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,208
[HARUHI]
It's not that.

425
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,333
I just like to be
appropriately thankful

426
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,500
when someone gives me something.

427
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:10,833
What is it?

428
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,000
Oh, nothing.

429
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,250
[HARUHI]
Hmph.

430
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,333
[NAGATO] Next episode:
"Over the Obento."
