00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,375
Are you hurt anywhere?
Oh my gosh are you okay?

3
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,041
Can you say something? Miss?

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,500
[TAXI DRIVER]
Uh...

5
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,250
Oh, neat, a fireworks show!

6
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,208
That sounds like a good excuse
to get everyone together.

00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:13,916
[sighs] The rain still shows
no sign of stopping.

[TAXI DRIVER]
Miss. Hey. Miss!

00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,375
[TAXI DRIVER]
Are you okay?

10
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,166
[TAXI DRIVER]
There's a hospital nearby.

11
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,041
Get in my cab.
I'll take you to--

12
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,916
I'm fine, thanks.
The fall wasn't bad.

13
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,333
It probably looked a lot
worse than it felt.

14
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,166
[TAXI DRIVER]
But, I can see you're hurt.

15
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,625
We should at least have you
checked at the hospital.

16
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,500
A few scratches. Nothing more.

17
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,000
[TAXI DRIVER]
Even so.

18
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,541
[NAGATO]
It was my fault.

19
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,708
[TAXI DRIVER]
I don't know.

20
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,541
Are you really sure you're fine?

21
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,208
[NAGATO]
I'm sure. I promise I'm fine.

22
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,416
[TAXI DRIVER] At least let
me pay for your glasses.

23
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,375
And if there's anything else,
get in touch, all right?

[ASAKURA] What? You almost

26
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,250
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

27
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,166
"Yeah"? Just "yeah"?

28
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,166
Huh?

00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,083
[gasps] You're hurt!

30
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,333
I'm okay.

31
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,166
No! I can see your injuries.

32
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,375
You should undress.
Are there more?

33
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,208
Hurry, get out
of those clothes.

34
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,125
Let me check.

35
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,625
We have to be sure you're okay!

36
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,125
Let me help you.

37
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,458
[sighs] Well, you were right,

38
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,666
luckily it's nothing
but scratches.

39
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,375
Wait, why aren't you
wearing your glasses?

40
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,208
[NAGATO]
They got broken.

41
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,208
[gasps] I didn't see that!

42
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,083
You've got some on
your forehead, too.

43
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,708
Aren't you worried about
ending up with scars?

44
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:26,250
Let's get out the first-aid kit.
You have one, right?

45
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,791
You're overreacting.

46
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,208
Huh?

47
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:35,208
"Overreacting"? I am
not overreacting!

48
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,833
Yeah, okay, the car
didn't actually hit you,

49
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,625
and you're just a
little banged up.

50
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,375
But it could easily
have been so much worse!

51
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,916
[ASAKURA]
We're talking about a car, here.

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,333
If things had gone differently,
you could have died, Nagato.

53
00:05:52,416 --> 00:06:02,750
[ASAKURA cries]

54
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,083
You're right. I'm sorry.

55
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,583
[ASAKURA] I just wanted
you to take it seriously.

56
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,250
Anyway, it's fine. Let's clean
those cuts and get some

57
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,125
bandages on them, okay?

58
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,166
All right.

59
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,125
That should take
care of it for now.

60
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,291
It might be kind of annoying,
but it'll help you heal faster,

61
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,791
so try to put up
with it, if you can.

62
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,666
And just to be
on the safe side,

63
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,375
I think we should go to
the hospital tomorrow.

Okay. If you say so.

Good morning!
How are you feeling?

71
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,833
You're ready a lot
earlier than usual.

72
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,000
And your glasses...

73
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,458
It's a back-up pair.

74
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,375
Since the ones I
normally wear got broken.

75
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,416
Yeah, that's right.

76
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,750
Good thing you have
a spare pair.

77
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,125
So, you're fine?

78
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,708
Those scratches didn't bother
you too much last night?

79
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,875
I could sleep at
your place tonight,

80
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,833
just to help out if
you need anything.

81
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,208
You don't need to.

82
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,166
Really, don't be shy.
We're good friends.

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,666
I'd be more than
happy to come over.

What? She got hit by a car?

86
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,333
No, no, no. She only
almost got hit.

87
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,750
She said she was
lost in thought,

88
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,458
and the rain made
it hard to see.

89
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,333
So she just didn't
notice the car coming.

90
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,333
[KYON] She's bandaged up.
Did she get hurt?

91
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,708
[ASAKURA]
No, not really.

92
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,500
Just some scratches
here and there, is all.

93
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,291
That's good, then.
Coulda been a lot worse.

94
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,666
It's great she wasn't
seriously injured.

95
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,375
Yeah, I guess.

96
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,750
Hm? So why don't you
seem happier about it?

97
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,875
[ASAKURA]
Hm?

99
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,333
She says that she's fine,

100
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,583
but something about
her seems off to me.

101
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,541
She just hasn't been
acting like herself.

102
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,833
Well, it must have been
a pretty big shock.

103
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,416
I mean, she's reading, right?
Which is weird for her.

104
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,000
Maybe she doesn't even
have enough energy

105
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,791
to play her games.

106
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,916
You make a good point.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,916
That must be what's
really going on!

108
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,458
Huh?

109
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,208
After what she went through,
she must have been so exhausted!

110
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,833
But what did I do? I just
kept nagging and nagging.

Whoa, hey! Calm down!

114
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,708
[sighs] I'm not the
easiest person to talk to.

115
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,916
It's possible she wanted
to say something to me

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,458
but couldn't bring
herself to do it.

117
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,125
You can be sort of intimidating

118
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,958
and bossy at times,
and when you're angry,

00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,208
you just get
downright frightening.

forbid her from going out

123

or anything like that, did you?

124
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,208
Well, I admit, I
thought about it.

125
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,375
But I do have some self-control.

[KYON sighs]
That's good to hear.

127
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,250
She'll probably respond better

128
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,791
if you're not too
protective of her.

129

[KYON] Not good. I don't
remember a thing.

132
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,500
Like everything the teacher
said leaked out of my brain.

[TANIGUCHI]
Jeez, what's goin' on over here?

I'm gettin' depressed
just lookin' at you guys.

Fortunately, I'm in possession
of some valuable information.

It oughta cheer you right up.

Yeah, right. Valuable
information from you?

[KUNIKIDA] Well? What is it,
then? Come on, tell us!

141
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,791
[TANIGUCHI]
I just heard this from the guys

142
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,541
in the Tennis Club.
Don't go spreading it around,

143
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,750
but there's a seriously
hot chick working

144
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,583
at the minimart by the station.

Aw jeez, why am I not surprised?

The only kind of
information you ever seem

147

to have is about girls.

info comes my way, can I?

You look pleased with yourself.

some time after school

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,583
to go check her out.

spirits before the test.

159
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,250
What? No, I'm fine.

160
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,833
And I was totally
listening to you.

161
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,708
You're gonna play tennis
at a minimart later today,

162
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,500
am I right?

163
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,500
That's so not what I said.

164
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,583
[KYON grunts]

165
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,208
Hey, can you do me a favor?

166
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,000
[KYON]
Hm?

167
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,416
One of the teachers asked

168
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,208
if I could take care of
something after school today.

169
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,166
Could you look after
Nagato for me?

170
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,750
Make sure she gets home,
that sort of thing.

171
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,166
Sure. I got it.
Do what you need.

172
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,375
Great, thank you.

173
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,875
[ASAKURA]
See you later, Nagato.

174
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,166
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

175
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,625
Look after her. That
sounds easy enough.

176
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
[KYON]
Class is over.

177
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,833
Should we head to the clubroom?

178
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:59,375
[KYON sighs]
So, Nagato...

179
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,958
What book are you reading?

180
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,791
Le M-Me-Mys-Mystere de la.

181
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,041
Right. Looks good.

182
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,000
[KYON yawns]

183
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,416
[KYON] It sure is quiet when
Haruhi isn't around, isn't it?

184
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm not gonna lie,
it's kinda relaxing.

185
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,166
Huh?

186
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,166
[book flaps]

187
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,416
[KYON]
Mm?

188
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,583
You know, I was thinking.

189
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,083
This reminds me of when
I first joined the club.

190
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,916
We didn't have
any real activities.

191
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,833
We just sort of did whatever
we felt like at the time.

192
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,541
Another book, huh?
What are you reading now?

193
00:14:56,666 --> 00:15:00,833
[KYON]
Le P-Per-Parf-Parfum de la--

194
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,791
Yeah, okay. That
looks good, too.

195
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,666
[ASAKURA]
Okay, bye!

196
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,875
[door slides]

197
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,958
[sighs] Maybe those
two are still around.

198
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,416
I should check.

199
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,416
Oh yeah, I meant to tell you.

200
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,333
I saw you changed your glasses.

201
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,000
Were you just wanting to
mix things up a little?

202
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,708
You do seem kinda
different today.

203
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,625
These are my spares.
My usual pair got broken.

204
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,875
Oh. All right.

205
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,166
You know, I heard
about yesterday.

206
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,958
Sounded rough.

207
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,416
[NAGATO]
Did Asakura tell you?

208
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,333
[KYON]
Hm? Well, yeah.

209
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,833
[NAGATO]
Oh.

210
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,833
[KYON]
So, how are you feeling?

211
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,916
I mean, she told me that
you're basically okay, but--

212
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,041
[KYON]
Hm? What's the matter?

213
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,541
[NAGATO]
Are you worried about me?

214
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,291
What kind of question is that?

215
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,166
Of course I am!

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,583
Uh, what's up? I mean, um.

217
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,375
You're kinda staring at me.

218
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,875
[NAGATO]
Well...

219
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,916
[NAGATO]
Thank you.

220
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,166
Huh?

221
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,958
Thank you for being concerned.

222
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,958
That's nice of you.

223
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,916
Uh--

224
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,875
Oh--

225
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,250
[gasps]

226
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,083
[ASAKURA]
What's going on?

227
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,208
Uh, the bandage
was peeling off!

228
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,708
We wouldn't want your cuts
getting infected, would we?

229
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,625
No.

230
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,000
U-Uh...

231
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,750
Well. Yeah. Anyway, I'm sorry.

232
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,875
Sorry about what?

233
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,500
Huh? Well, uh...

234
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,750
Nagato?

235
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,625
[NAGATO]
Let's go.

236
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,375
Right. Okay.

237
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,833
[KYON] You're gonna go get
your glasses fixed, right?

238
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,583
I'll go with you. I've got
some shopping to do, so.

239
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,291
[sighs]

240
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,583
Man, it's gonna take a
long time to fix them, huh?

241
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,041
I guess with the frame
totally messed up

242
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,250
like that, it's not surprising.

243
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,166
[KYON]
At least they can fix them.

244
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,583
That's better than
buying another pair.

245
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,125
[KYON]
So, it looks like you're stuck

246
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,958
with your spares
for a while, then.

247
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,333
They seem to work
well enough, though.

248
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,041
And they look nice.

249
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,666
So you're okay?

250
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,041
Yes, I'm fine.

251
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,458
Oh, all right. Well,
that's good, then.

252
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,875
Hey, look. A taiyaki cake shop.

253
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,666
[KYON]
Wanna get some?

254
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,083
[NAGATO]
Yes.

255
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,375
[KYON]
Okay!

256
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,375
[yawns]

257
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,916
[KYON] The summer festival
is coming up soon.

258
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,125
[door clicks]

259
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,333
Hey there!

260
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,208
I thought we would try
putting some cheese

261
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,958
in the curry we made yesterday.

262
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,625
You like that, right?
Curry with cheese?

263
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,166
Well, what do ya
think of it?

264
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,916
Should we add a
little more cheese?

265
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,916
No, this is fine.

266
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,416
Yeah?

267
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,875
I can't believe I almost
forgot to tell you!

268
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,291
Daikon radish was on sale today,
so I made sure to stock up.

269
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,666
We'll have to use it
for oden sometime soon.

270
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,583
That should be good
with the rain.

271
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,666
And it won't be nearly as good
once summer gets here.

272
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,541
Sorry to interrupt.

273
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:58,458
Ah. No, not at all. What is it?

274
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,708
On the table.

275
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,000
Huh?

276
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,083
Oh! Whoops, I'm sorry.

277
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,458
I didn't even notice
I made a mess.

278
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,500
I should really start eating,

279
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,291
it's gonna get cold!

280
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,125
It's pretty good.

281
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,916
[ASAKURA]
You might wanna hold off

282
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,625
bathing another night.
It'll sting your cuts.

283
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,083
[NAGATO]
'Kay.

284
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,375
And I know I've
already said it,

285
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,000
but I want to put
it out there again.

286
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,625
If you need anything,
you can call me anytime.

287
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,833
I'll come right
over to help you.

288
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,458
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm.

289
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,333
And, as far as going
out is concerned...

290
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,458
"Going out"?

291
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,875
[gasps] Never mind.

292
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,958
Forget I said anything.
I'm being silly.

293
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,916
I don't think it's silly.

294
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,250
It's nice of you
to worry about me.

295
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,041
That's what friends are for.

296
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,708
[ASAKURA]
Actually...

297
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,000
[ASAKURA]
There is just one more thing.

298
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,291
Who are you?
And where's Nagato?

299
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,958
[NAGATO]
Next episode:

Nagato Yuki, Part One."
