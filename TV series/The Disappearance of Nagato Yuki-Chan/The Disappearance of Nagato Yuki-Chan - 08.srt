00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,500
[HARUHI]
Anyway, it's been a long trip

313
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,083
and we deserve a toast!

314
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,958
Here's to the Literary Club!

315
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,583
May it keep growing till
it conquers the world!

316
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,791
To the club!

317
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,833
[GROUP]
To the club!

318
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,000
[ASAKURA]
Time for the first dish!

319
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,375
The nozawana, one of
the local specialties.

320
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,500
[ASAKURA]
Very interesting.

321
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,583
There are notes of some...

322
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,875
Yummy!

323
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,083
They're generous with
the portions here.

324
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,166
You haven't seen half of it!
There's lots more on the way.

325
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,750
She's right.

326
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,583
The list of dishes that they're
serving tonight is extensive,

327
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,166
and really impressive.

328
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,291
[ASAKURA]
This savory egg custard

329
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,083
is impressively executed.

330
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,083
Yummy!

331
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,083
It says "horsemeat" sashimi.

332
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,666
[TSURUYA] From what I've read,
that's a specialty around here.

333
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,833
[ASAKURA] Horsemeat sashimi is
low in fat and in calories.

334
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,666
It's also high in protein.
A good source of nutrition.

335
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,416
[HARUHI]
I didn't know that.

336
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,208
[ASAKURA] Ah, yes, this
is an excellent dish!

337
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,750
It pairs very nicely with
the garlic and ginger.

338
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,583
Hey, Nagato, you should
really try the--

339
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,583
[NAGATO]
Mm!

340
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, never mind.
You already are.

341
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,833
This stuff sure has
an interesting texture.

342
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,583
According to this,
the main dish should be

343
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,333
coming up pretty soon,
and it's Shinshu beef.

344
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,458
Oh, yeah really?

345
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,625
I love beef!

346
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,583
Beef is yummy!

347
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,041
[ASAKURA] Hold still,
you've got a little drool.

348
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,583
Wow, you guys must
really like beef, huh?

349
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,666
I'm not gonna turn it down!

350
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,375
Hello, everybody.

351
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,875
I hope you're enjoying
things so far.

352
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,625
I'm Arakawa, the
inn's master chef.

353
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,833
For today's main dish,

354
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,291
we have a Shinshu beef
roasted on ceramics.

355
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,083
[HARUHI]
Hm...

356
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,416
Wait! I've seen you before!

357
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,625
You have a good memory.

358
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,416
I also drive the
courtesy shuttle.

359
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
[TSURUYA]
Well, thank you for all you do!

360
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,166
I like to make sure
that all our guests

361
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,166
enjoy their stays
to the fullest.

362
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,041
Please let us know if there's
anything else we can do.

363
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,750
Yeah! Bring it on!

364
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,958
[ASAKURA] I would consider
this the epitome

365
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,916
of a "meat lover's meat."

366
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,375
[ALL]
Thank you! It was delicious!

367
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:11,166
I'm having a hard time deciding.
This nozawana stuff was good.

368
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,791
Soy sauce pickles can
last for a long time.

369
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,375
Well, I think it's
time to go back

370
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,125
to our rooms and relax.
You coming, Mikuru?

371
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,666
[yawns] Yeah.

372
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,875
Anything specific you
would like to do?

373
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,500
We could visit the gift shop.

374
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,916
I already picked up my
souvenirs at the temple.

375
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,125
Okay, that's fine.

376
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,541
How about some
after-dinner coffee, then?

377
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,791
Um. Yeah, I guess.
That sounds okay.

378
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,875
[KOIZUMI]
Here you go.

379
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,416
It's hot, so be careful
with that first sip.

380
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,291
Oh, thank you.

381
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,333
[KOIZUMI]
Sure. No problem.

382
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,458
[KYON]
What's up?

383
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,125
Can I interest you in a game?

384
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,666
No, thanks. Not right now.

385
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,916
I think I just
feel like reading.

386
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,875
Oh, sure, I understand.
That's fine.

387
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,458
The atmosphere alone
is relaxing, huh?

388
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,541
[TSURUYA]
Yeah, it really is.

389
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,166
[TV MC A]
Here's the final question!

390
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,000
If you answer this one
correctly, the super-duper,

391
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,250
extra-mega underdog
leapfrog bonus...

392
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,750
[HARUHI]
This inn seems ginourmous.

393
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,291
Yeah, from what
I've gathered so far,

394
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,916
they have the main
building, the annex,

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,833
and the new wing, too.

396
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,500
[HARUHI]
Might be fun to explore it.

397
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,916
Ah--

398
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,208
[HARUHI chuckles]

399
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
[KYON]
Ahh. Silence is golden.

400
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,375
Let's explore!

401
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,416
They added all kinds
of suspicious rooms

402
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,625
to this inn. C'mon,
let's check it out!

403
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,541
You're gonna come with
us, right, Koizumi?

404
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,208
Oh, yeah.

405
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,416
You, too, Kyon.

406
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,541
No, thank you. Not tonight.

407
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm content to bask in
the peace and tranquility

408
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,958
offered by this
fine establishment.

409
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,375
[HARUHI]
Huh. Suit yourself.

410
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,583
It'll be more fun without you,
anyway. C'mon, Koizumi!

411
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,083
See ya later.

412
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,875
I guess I'll go take a bath.

413
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,708
[TV ANNOUNCER A]
Over to you, Mr. Aganakata!

414
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,833
What does tomorrow's
forecast look like?

415
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,708
[AGANAKATA] Well, you see,
when high and low pressure

416
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,000
systems collide like these two
here, they generate clouds.

417
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,416
Those clouds, in turn,
produce rain.

418
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,250
[NAGATO] I think I'm gonna
head back to the baths.

419
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,333
Are you?

420
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,250
They were really nice,
weren't they?

421
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,333
I may come and join you later.

422
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,166
Ah.

00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,541
Huh?

[KYON]
Uh, Nagato?

[NAGATO]
Oh, sorry!

427
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,000
[KYON]
About what?

428
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,208
[NAGATO] U-Uh, opening the
window without warning.

429
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,875
Yeah, it's an interesting
little feature, isn't it?

430
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,041
We can't actually open it
from this side, you know.

431
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,291
Which is exactly
as it should be.

432
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,708
[NAGATO]
Would you mind if I opened it?

433
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,916
Uh-- Uh, sure.

434
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,333
[KYON]
Here we go.

435
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,833
[KYON]
Almost there.

436
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,708
[HARUHI]
This pond is very suspicious.

437
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,000
I think it's just
an ordinary pond.

438
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,083
Hey, look at that!

439
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,541
We can see the men's
bath from here.

[KOIZUMI] Aren't you getting
cold standing outside like this?

00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,791

I'll leave it closed.

No!

in the room, so I figured.

get my money's worth, so.

00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,333
to the god of the
matchmaking shrine.

470
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,958
Now that's a worthy offering
if I've ever heard of one!

471
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,166
Yeah, great idea!
Get 'em over here, Mikuru!

472
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,083
[MIKURU whimpers]

473
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,416
[MIKURU]
No, please don't!

474
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,583
[HARUHI]
You don't have a choice!

475
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,000
[TSURUYA]
Is this the string we pull?

476
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,583
[ASAKURA]
Stop it, both of you.

477
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,500
Can't you see how uncomfortable
you're making the poor thing?

478
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,000
[HARUHI] What's the big deal?
It'll just be for a second.

479
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,708
[TSURUYA]
Squeezy, squeezy, squeezy!

480
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,166
[MIKURU]
Nooo!

481
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,833
[ASAKURA]
You are impossible!

482
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,083
Nagato, quit floating around...

483
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,541
It sounds like they're
having fun over there.

484
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,708
[KYON]
A nice, relaxing bath.

485
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,416
There's nothing like it.

486
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,458
[NAGATO] Next episode:
