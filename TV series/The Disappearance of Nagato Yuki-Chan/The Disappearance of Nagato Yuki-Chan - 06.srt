[groans]

3
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,625
We just finished
end of the year exams!

4
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,166
These people must be trying
to stress me to an early grave!

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,208
What happened?

6
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,791
Did you score poorly
on your exams?

7
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,791
O-Of I didn't! Why
would you say that?

8
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,541
I didn't see it before,
but you're a little stu--

9
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:52,125
Hey! I'll be fine, thanks!
I've got time to improve.

10
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,208
We just started sophomore year.
Isn't that right, Nagato?

11
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,208
[NAGATO]
Huh?

12
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,375
[ASAKURA]
Oh, leave her alone.

13
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,458
She doesn't wanna be
lumped in with you.

14
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:03,041
Wha...? Um, that's
not really true.

15
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,458
[KYON] I didn't think we'd all
be in the same class this year,

16
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,416
but that's pretty cool, huh?

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
[ASAKURA]
Yeah, it is.

18
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,583
I worry about Nagato when I'm
not around, so it's a relief.

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,166
I'm excited, too. It'll be fun.

20
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,166
We'll get into all
kinds of trouble!

21
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,375
[NAGATO]
Yep.

22
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,500
[HARUHI]
Hello, Miss Mori! How are you?

23
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,208
[KOIZUMI]
I hope you're having a good day!

24
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,541
[MORI] Hello, you two.
I'm doin' fine, how 'bout you?

25
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,083
It must be a pain coming
up that hill every day...

26
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,541
Ah! What is it?

27
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,166
Huh?

28
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,500
[gasps]

29
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,000
[HARUHI] Honestly, it
doesn't bother me at all.

30
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,541
[KOIZUMI]
Same here.

31
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,000
Besides, I'm happy to follow
wherever Miss Suzumiya leads.

32
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,791
Well, if you need anything
while you're here,

33
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,375
don't hesitate, 'kay?

34
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,041
Sounds good. Thank you so much!

35
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,791
What's the plan? Where do
you wanna put these up?

36
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,458
Let me see. Hmm... Oh.

37
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:33,166
A full welcoming committee
for the executive president!

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,791
I like it!

39
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,666
[ASAKURA]
What was that about?

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,416
Talking to a teacher like
actually go to school here?

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,416
[KYON]
That's reckless, even for you.

42
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,750
Listen, don't worry about
me getting permission,

43
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,416
because I already got
permission a while ago.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,541
[BOTH]
Huh?

45
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,083
[HARUHI giggles]

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,333
Hah! Take a look.
What do ya think?

47
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,416
And you got that, when?

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,333
Well, I guess
you didn't notice,

49
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,458
but we switched to our
uniforms around Valentine's.

50
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,750
Miss Suzumiya is
pretty memorable.

51
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,125
It was getting hard
to keep sneaking in.

52
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,750
[ASAKURA] Jeez, you could've
told us about that sooner.

53
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,125
Ever think about that?

54
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,875
[HARUHI] We were coming
with or without permission.

55
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,166
It makes no difference.

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,250
[ASAKURA]
It makes a difference to me.

57
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,750
Oh, well that's
interesting because

58
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,166
I'm pretty sure I told Yuki.

59
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,291
[ASAKURA]
And you didn't think

60
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,791
it was important
to tell me? Huh?

61
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,875
Uh... I don't remember. Ah!

62
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,416
[door clicks]

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,208
[HARUHI]
Hey! You got a minute?

64
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,208
Uh. Sure, just one sec.

65
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,041
[HARUHI] Oh, don't worry about
it, you can keep playing.

66
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,208
[HARUHI] I just need your
signature here real quick.

67
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,291
What? Sure, no problem.

68
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,583
[HARUHI]
I'm gonna make some stuff up

69
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,125
so we can come here more easily.

70
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,458
Oh, that's where you sign.

71
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,750
[NAGATO]
Okay. There.

72
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,958
Uh...

73
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,208
Heh, heh... Honestly, there
are so many better ways

74
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,666
that could have been handled.

75
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,750
If only I had a few hours
to explain them all to you.

76
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,708
You see? So I didn't
do anything wrong!

77
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,000
I was just--

78
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,375
You are just a
troublemaker, aren't you?

79
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,625
Having her sign something when

80
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,166
she didn't even
know what she said!

81
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,333
[HARUHI]
Not again!

82
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,833
You're always mad
at me about something!

83
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,291
[ASAKURA]
Of course I am.

84
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,916
Because you're always doing
something to make me mad,

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,791
aren't you?

86
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,958
So you guys are still coming,

87
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,125
even though it's the
start of a new year?

88
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,541
Looks like it, yeah.

89
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,250
Miss Suzumiya already
has some kind of

90
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,250
big plan in the works,
so here we are.

91
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,500
Plan you say?

92
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,500
Knowing her, "plot"
is the better word.

93
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,875
Guess we'll see.

94
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,125
She hasn't even told you
anything about it yet?

95
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,416
I'm Helper Monkey A.

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,541
I really don't get
detailed information.

97
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,333
Oh, and you're Helper
Monkey B now, by the way.

98
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,166
[laughs] I don't think so.

99
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh, well, that's a shame.

100
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,375
Ya know, there's one
thing I can say.

101
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,791
[KYON]
Hm?

102
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,750
She seems to be having fun.

103
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,916
A lot more than
last year, anyway.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,916
From what I can tell.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,041
[ASAKURA] Do you honestly feel
bad about what you did? !

106
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,791
[HARUHI] Of course I do,
all right?! Enough is enough!

107
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,708
That's fun?

108
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,541
Yeah. Can't you tell?

109
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,208
Really, truly, very bad?

110
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,500
Yes. Really, really bad.

111
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,500
Weird sort of fun.

112
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,250
[laughs]

113
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,958
[sighs] Well, if that's
her idea of a good time,

114
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,250
--then I'm terrified.
--[MIKURU yelling]

a seriously long--

00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,416
Huh?!

118
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Huh?

Well, aren't you looking
awfully pleased with yourself.

123
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,708
You did that on
purpose, didn't you?

124
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,833
[cackles] You know
how much I appreciate

125
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,500
an entrance that has impact!

126
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,125
That had impact, all right.

127
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,416
Thanks, I'm flattered!

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
[ASAKURA]
Not a compliment!

Uh, s'cuse me.

00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,500
You... You should get up.

They way you're
laying, it's dirty.

133

Could ya quit tugging
on me like that?

you're gonna-- Ugh!

[NAGATO]
The next day.

137
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,125
So, uh, how's your neck doing?

138
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:11,208
It seems fine.
Miraculously. Huh?

M-Miss Asahina. How, um...

140
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,583
How are you doing?

141
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,083
Uh, it's good to see you.

142
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,458
Huh? Oh, whoops.

143
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,208
I guess I was staring
off into space.

144
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,125
By the way, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

145
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,500
No, you really have
nothing to apologize for.

146
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,166
I'm sure it was all my fault.
Please, don't feel bad!

You guys are usually together.

150

She went to get something.

She's always forgetting
stuff, you know.

152

She should be back
in just a second.

00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,500
and I forgot my brush!

161
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,416
Very silly of you!

162
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,750
Well, anyway, I think
I should congratulate you.

163
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,625
[KYON]
Huh? For what, exactly?

164
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,291
[TSURUYA] Mikuru is super shy,
but she talks to you fine,

165
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,916
even when I'm not around.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,500
And that is quite amazing.

167
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,916
You've come a long way,

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
considering the depths to which
you sank not long ago.

169
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,166
It's impressive.

170
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,791
Um. What am I missing?

171
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,291
[MIKURU] Like I told you,
it was a misunderstanding.

172
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,291
Things got blown way
out of proportion.

173
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,541
You're just a regular member
of the fan club right now,

174
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,291
but maybe it's time to consider
a more senior position.

175
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,291
[MIKURU]
You aren't listening, are you?

176
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,208
[TSURUYA]
Something managerial, perhaps.

177
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,333
[KYON]
If we could clear this up,

178
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,916
I know I'd feel a lot better.

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,708
Hey, you guys, listen!

180
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,833
[TSURUYA]
Huh?

181
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,583
Sorry, what's up?
Is something wrong?

182
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,125
Please!

183
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,208
Will someone just tell me what
happened between these two?

184
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,083
Whatever it is you're
all talking about.

185
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,166
You seem upset.

186
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,500
[TSURUYA]
Listen to me.

187
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,500
[NAGATO]
Uh--

188
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,500
You might be shocked
by the story

189
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,750
I'm about to tell you.

190
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,208
Would you still like to hear it?

191
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,666
[gulps] Yes, please tell me.

192
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,583
I think I can handle it.

193
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,583
Very well, then. I see
your mind is made up.

194
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,791
I'll tell you everything I know.

195
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,833
It happened last year,
in early December.

196
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, that's five people in.

197
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,083
I guess I should
bring this to Nagato.

198
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,791
[TSURUYA] That's right. It was
a seemingly ordinary day.

199
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,791
That is, until Kyon put his
shameless plan into action.

200
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,750
[KYON] This narration, and it's
interpretation of events,

201
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,291
is fictitious and
bears no resemblance

202
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,500
to reality, whatsoever.

203
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,000
Miss Tsuruya seems
to be running late.

204
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,125
--[KYON] Uh--
--[MIKURU gasps]

205
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,041
Ah, that hurt.

206
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,916
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,583
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.
Don't worry about it. Really.

208
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,791
[TSURUYA] Oh, he tried to play
it off like some big accident,

209
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,375
but it was all part of his plan!

210
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,708
In fact, the worst
was yet to come.

211
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,708
[KYON]
There was no plan!

212
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,375
[gasps]

213
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,833
[KYON]
Oh, here, let me.

214
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,083
Ah!

215
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,250
[MIKURU screams]

216
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,583
[KYON]
No! I didn't mean to!

217
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,291
[TSURUYA] I heard Mikuru's
pitiful, piercing scream.

218
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,583
And then I saw it!

219
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,375
[KYON]
Tell us. What did you see?

220
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,750
[TSURUYA]
Stop right there.

221
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,583
Just what do you think
you're doing to her?

222
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,125
Like a slavering wolf
wild with hunger,

223
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,083
he had pushed Mikuru
down to the ground.

224
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,083
He did what?

225
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,458
Why do these things
happen to me?

226
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,750
A misunderstanding.

227
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,958
How many more times
to I have to say it?

228
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm really sorry.

229
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,833
[ASAKURA] Oh, yeah?
You need some help, huh?

230
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,750
You want my help
with your schoolwork?

231
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,541
Well, yeah.

232
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,541
Poor Kyon. Was it that
quiz we just got back?

233
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,875
How badly did you do?

234
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,541
Um. You know, not that bad.

235
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,750
[ASAKURA]
Yeah, sure.

236
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,625
So I was right about
you, huh? Not so bright.

237
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,416
[KYON]
So I'm not as smart as you.

238
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,916
It's not like that
makes me an idiot.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,708
I just need an answer
or two, that's all.

240
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,708
I'm begging you!

241
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,666
I could help you...

242
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,666
But if you came to
depend upon my help,

243
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,750
I would be doing you
a grave disservice.

244
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,125
Wait. Since when do
you care about me?

245
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,500
If you're going
to learn anything,

246
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,416
then you have to do
the work yourself.

247
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,583
Applying knowledge is of
the utmost importance

248
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,416
when it comes to learning.

249
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,083
Asking someone who
already knows the answer

250
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,708
may be the quickest
solution to a problem,

251
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,250
but the quickest way
isn't necessarily

252
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,708
the best way, now is it?

253
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,000
Ya know, you're probably right.

254
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,416
I see your point.

255
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,000
I knew you'd understand
if I just explained it to you!

256
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,250
I'll go and ask somebody else.

257
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,458
[ASAKURA]
He didn't understand.

258
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,250
[sighs] Fine, be a
dunce your whole life.

259
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,208
[KYON] I wonder if Nagato
would help me out.

260
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,041
She looks smart.
I bet she'll know.

261
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:37,916
[ASAKURA]
Great.

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,291
It can't hurt to ask.

263
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,041
Hey, Nagato!

264
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,958
[gasps] Ah! Hold on a second!

265
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,375
Ah! What're you doing to me?

266
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,208
[ASAKURA] I'll help you,
okay? Just be quiet.

267
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,750
What about all that
stuff you said?

268
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,541
I teach and you learn.

269
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,041
Do we understand
each other? Do we?

270
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,041
[KYON]
Uh. Yes, your Highness.

271
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,791
[ASAKURA] And consider
this your first lesson.

272
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,041
Never ask Nagato anything
related to schoolwork, got it?

273
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,291
But why not?

274
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,666
I said, got it?

275
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,583
I got it.

276
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,291
[laughs nerously]

277
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,416
Huh...?

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,541
I'm seeing things, right?

279
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,875
That looked like... [gasps]

280
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:27,083
Like they were about to... kiss.

281
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,625
[KYON]
Shall we?

282
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,958
[NAGATO] Wait, he was
probably just helping her

283
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,208
with a stray eyelash.

284
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,208
That's totally something
that happens in manga.

285
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,958
So it does happen in
real life. I never realized.

286
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,708
[ASAKURA] I have no clue
what you're talking about,

287
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,666
but my guess is you've
got the wrong idea.

288
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,041
[BASEBALL PLAYERS]
Go team!

289
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,916
[ASAKURA] All right then.
Let's get started!

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,791
[KYON]
Why are you, wearing that?

291
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,750
[ASAKURA] I think it helps
set the right tone.

292
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,000
[KYON]
Wow, she came prepared.

293
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,041
Oh. Are you guys
spending today studying?

294
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,916
Give me a sec.
I'll come and join you.

295
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,833
[ASAKURA] Don't bother.
We'll just do our own thing.

296
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,208
Huh?

297
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,000
We're just reviewing stuff.
It'll be totally boring.

298
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,041
You're better off playing
your game, I promise.

299
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,375
[NAGATO]
Oh. You think so?

300
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,916
Really, don't waste your time.

301
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,875
Enjoy your game. Just
pretend we're not here.

302
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,791
Okay, if you really think so.

303
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,500
Um. Guess I'll just leave
you guys to it, then.

304
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,541
[ASAKURA] Here we go,
let's start with this one.

305
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,000
[KYON] Uh, going with
a hard one first, huh?

306
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,375
[ASAKURA]
You think that's hard?

307
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,875
You're even more
stupid than I thou--

308
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,666
[KYON] Here's an idea: maybe
you could stop saying that.

309
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,958
Hello there! We've arrived!

310
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:34,958
Hey, guys.

311
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,250
[HARUHI]
Hm?

312
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,208
What's goin' on?

313
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,458
You look like you
have a headache.

314
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,708
Go away.

315
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,583
[HARUHI] Hm. Oh, I see.
You're just studying.

316
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,083
Huh. Well, I am a
diligent student.

317
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,375
Studying's a waste
of time, to me.

318
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,583
You can solve most problems

319
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,375
if you just listen
to your teachers.

320
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,958
It's not like something
that requires diligence.

321
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,500
Uh-- That's either because
the teachers at Kouyouen

322
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,000
are amazing or
because you're crazy.

323
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,791
[KOIZUMI]
Or neither, actually.

324
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,416
In my opinion, it's because
Miss Suzumiya is amazing.

325
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,416
[KYON]
Uh-- Hey!

326
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,333
What? This is totally confusing.

327
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,291
Why are you reviewing
stuff from last year?

328
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,208
That's something we
did a long time ago.

329
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,041
Are you guys just
getting to it now?

330
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,541
How long ago was that?

331
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,083
You know, I can't
even remember.

332
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,791
[KYON] Damn prep school kids.
You think you're so smart!

333
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,125
Uh--

334
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,625
If you're gonna interfere,
you should just go home.

335
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,541
[ASAKURA] You know, if you let
a little comment like that

336
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,166
hurt your feelings, you're
in for a lifetime of pain.

337
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,416
You big baby.

338
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,125
What do you mean?
My feelings weren't hurt.

339
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,541
I was just clenching my teeth
and grimacing in amazement

340
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,250
because I was so impressed
by the shear amount

341
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,750
of knowledge you're learning.

342
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,166
[ASAKURA]
And how much smarter they are?

343
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,833
[KYON]
They insulted all of us!

344
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,291
It's not like it was just me.

345
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,791
Are you okay with
what they said?

346
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,083
You are North High's rep!

347
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,208
I am the class representative?!

348
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,708
How could you not know?
Time to step up, Ryoko Asakura!

349
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,208
You're the best student
in the school.

350
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,416
In fact, it's even rumored
that you might become

351
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,083
the next president of
the student council!

352
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,083
Quietly. By a few people.

353
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,500
I really didn't know!

354
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,833
[KOIZUMI] What do you think?
This good?

355
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,416
[KYON] You're practically
a legend, you know that?

356
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,416
And you're gonna let those two
snobs mock North High like this?

357
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,666
Calm down. We weren't
mocking you.

358
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,500
This is serious, then.

359
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,458
I have to take
some responsibility.

360
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,625
I mean, I'm practically
the face of North High.

361
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,708
And that means, if I
allow people to mock

362
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,000
North High, then I am also
allowing them to mock me,

363
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,750
the class representative.

364
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,250
Miss Suzumiya!

365
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,541
Consider this a challenge to
you and your school, okay?

366
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,625
He played her like a fiddle.

367
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,291
Sounds like as good a way
as any to pass the time.

368
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,583
North High Rep.
Challenge accepted.

369
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,041
[HARUHI]
Hm... This should do it.

370
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,083
Solve the third
question on this page.

371
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,541
That's what we're learning
right now, isn't it, Koizumi?

372
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,791
Yes, that's right.

373
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,041
Here, let me take a look.

374
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,416
Hm. Yes, I see. It's
an English question.

375
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,083
It says "math"
right on the cover.

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,666
[KYON]
Asakura. It's up to you.

377
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,166
You must avenge my defeat.

378
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,375
[ASAKURA] You dug your
own grave on that one.

379
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,708
But don't worry. I've got this.

380
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,000
Learning is about
applying knowledge.

381
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,000
They may not have taught
us this stuff yet,

382
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,500
but I bet I can still
figure it out.

383
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,375
Just give me a minute or two.

384
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,791
[KYON, KOIZUMI, HARUHI]
Uh?

385
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,458
[whimpers]

386
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,416
[KYON]
She's crying!

387
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,208
[KYON]
It's okay, you can stop now!

388
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,916
Of course you can't
solve that problem yet.

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,291
You haven't learned how!

390
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,625
But I'm Class Rep!

391
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,583
The whole school
is depending on me!

392
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,416
[KYON] I'm sorry I put
that on your shoulders.

393
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,666
[ASAKURA]
It's come to this.

394
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,708
I have to call in the big guns.

395
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,166
Huh?

396
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,458
[ASAKURA]
Nagato... I need your help.

397
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,625
What's up? I didn't hear you.

398
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,041
Talkin' to me?

399
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,916
Here. It's up to you, now.

400
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,500
[NAGATO]
Um. What are you crying about?

401
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,750
Hey, what are you doing?

402
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,333
You told me before we
weren't ever supposed

403
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,000
to ask her about schoolwork.

404
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,875
I know, but North High's
fate is at stake.

405
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,208
Yeah, that's my fault,
and I'm sorry.

406
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,666
But even you couldn't solve it.

407
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,375
Don't you think it might
be a little demoralizing

408
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,375
to her when she tries
to work the problem-- Ah!

409
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,041
You're going to watch
and be quiet. Understand?

410
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,375
[KYON]
Yes, Your Majesty.

411
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,333
What? This problem here?

412
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,000
[ASAKURA]
Could you solve it for me?

413
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,208
Uh... Sure.

414
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,833
Three, maybe? I think that's it.

415
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,333
You already have the answer?
Koizumi, did she get it right?

416
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,708
Yep, that's the answer.
It's three. She got it right.

417
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,750
See. What'd I tell you?

418
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,541
It could've been a lucky guess.

419
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,791
She didn't write down
any calculations.

420
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,375
Yuki, explain how you solved it!

421
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,958
Okay. Sure, I can do that.

422
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,041
First, I wanted to make sure
that I understood the problem

423
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:50,833
becuase if I don't
have my bearings,

424
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:51,625
you won't have your answer

425
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,958
So that's done. Then, I...

426
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,166
...looked at all the
varriables and it was easy.

427
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541
That squished right,

428
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,500
so then I tossed the lowest
common demoninator in...

429
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,833
Uh-- That's right!

430
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,416
I start the quotient under
the sum of the answer

431
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,458
and massaged the digits after
the decimal until it was flat...

432
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,208
Squished? Tossed? Massaged?
Those aren't math terms.

433
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,208
What in the world does
she mean by "fluffy"?

434
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,708
I have absolutely no
idea what she's saying.

435
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,458
Don't even try
to figure it out.

436
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,791
Nagato's incredibly smart,
but ask her to explain

437
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,458
what she did and it
comes out sounding like

438
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,416
some crazy alien language.

439
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,458
[KYON]
You're not kidding about that.

440
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,458
I hate letting others
see this side of her.

441
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,000
They might think she's a freak!

442
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,625
Yep. I can see that.

443
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,333
So, the part that
was "boingy" before

444
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,625
now becomes
"tight-ish," you see?

445
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,625
[BOTH]
"Boingy"?

446
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,916
"Tight-ish"?

447
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,166
Exactly!

448
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,458
Which makes the answer three.

449
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,000
It's "boingy" then "tight-ish"!

Hope I'm not interrupting.

453
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,208
If you don't mind too much,
I thought I'd have lunch in--

454
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,750
[KYON]
Hm... Hello?

455
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,208
[KYON] That kind of
concentration can be very good

456
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,333
or very bad.

457
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,875
Hmm.

458
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,333
He, he...

459
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,625
Wha...? Ah...

460
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,333
[KYON]
So now you notice me?

461
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,166
[NAGATO]
Um. May I have it back please...

462
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,333
[laughs] If you want it back,

463
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,375
then you'll have
to get it yourself.

464
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,625
[whimpers] You're a big meanine.

465

[NAGATO, KYON grunting]

466
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,625
[KYON]
What? Can't you reach it?

467
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,250

00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,833
I'm... I'm sorry.

471
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,750
I didn't mean--
I just fell, and--

472
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,583
Uh. No. Don't worry. It was
my fault for teasing you!

473
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,208
[whimpers]

474
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,625
[NAGATO]
So, I'll just step back now.

475
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,458
Sure.

476
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,791
Hey, I know I'm late. Sorr--

477
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,083
[NAGATO, KYON]
Uh--

478
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,833
I'll just be leaving now.

479
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,041
You know, I'm thinkin'
it's possible

480
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,916
she may have misread
the situation.

481
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,458
Wh-What do we do?

482
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,333
Well, we'll just
explain it to her later.

483
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,916
Right.

484
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,666
[KYON]
Onto lunch, then?

485
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,875
Oh. I don't have
anything to eat.

486
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,583
Asakura's got my lunch.

487
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,375
[KYON]
Oh, yeah? I didn't realize that.

488
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,500
Only one thing to do then, huh?

489
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,625
[KYON]
I'll just give you half of mine.

490
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,333
Huh?

491
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,541
[KYON]
Well, come on. Dig in.

492
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,958
Oh.

493
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,916
Sharing sounds like it
could be kinda awkward,

494
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,750
don't you think?

495
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,208
[KYON]
Um, I don't know.

496
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,958
Maybe a little bit, I guess.

497
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,208
There should be
some boundaries,

498
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,916
even with close friends, huh?

499
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,958
[NAGATO gasps]
Oh, man, I'm an idiot!

500
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,916
How am I gonna
recover from that?

501
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,916
Um. Uh...

502
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,750
[NAGATO]
Actually, what I meant was

503
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,416
me choosing what to
have would be weird,

504
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,708
since it's your lunch
and everything. So, maybe--

505
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,083
Instead you could
feed me a bite of it?

506
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,666
Huh?

507
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,500
[KYON] How could that possibly
be the less awkward way to eat?

508
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,916
So, you want me
to feed you then?

509
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,000
[KYON] Well, if that's
really what you prefer.

510
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,208
Here you go. Say "ah."

511
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,250
[ASAKURA] I'm back.
I was just kidding before.

512
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,875
I know flirting's not
really your style, Nagato.

513
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,333
Or Kyon's, either.

514
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,291
You must be getting hungry.
Here's your lu--

515
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,708
--[NAGATO] Mm?
--[KYON] Uh--

516
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,625
[ASAKURA]
Seriously?

517
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:11,583
So, yeah. I'll just
be leaving now.

518
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,458
No, wait! Come back!
You've got it all wrong!

519
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,125
Never expected that in
a million years. Wow.

520
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,708
[KYON]
Please listen, Asakura!

521
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,916
--It's not what you think it is,
--[ASAKURA] Kyon was standing

522
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,500
--not at all!
--right there, in that room

523
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,041
--You had Nagato's lunch and
--feeding Nagato. That is not

524
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,500
--we didn't know where you were,
--what I thought I would see

525
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,666
--so I was gonna share mine,
--when I opened that door,

526
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,375
--but then she seemed
--let me tell you.

527
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,666
weirded out by that...

528
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,458
[NAGATO]
U-Um. I--

529
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,500
[KYON] Y'see? It was
perfectly innocent!

530
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,291
Hey! Are you ready
for the big reveal?

531
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,750
We're all gonna go
to a training camp!

532
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:08,625
Huh?

533
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,000
What do you mean?

534
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,041
Hey, everyone.

535
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,541
We're here, too!

536
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,000
[MIKURU giggles]

537
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,583
So this was the big plan you
were talking about before?

538
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,583
[ASAKURA] What's going on?
Did you know about this?

539
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,250
No, I had no idea!

540
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,916
What? But I told you.

541
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,250
Huh?

542
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,208
[sighs]

543
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,625
[GROUP]
Huh?

544
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:33,125
[laughs] Are you ready?
This is gonna be lots of fun!

545
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:37,291
[NAGATO]
