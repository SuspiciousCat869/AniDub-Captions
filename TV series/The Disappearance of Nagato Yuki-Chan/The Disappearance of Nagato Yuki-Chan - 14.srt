1
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,083
[NAGATO (NEW)]
Time to wake up.

2
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,583
[sighs]

3
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:46,833
[NAGATO (NEW)]
Hair whorl.

4
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,000
[gasps]

5
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,083
Ow!

6
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,250
[NAGATO groaning]

7
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,583
[NAGATO]
Huh? Hey, where am I?

8
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,166
Is anyone here? Hello?

9
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,750
[gasping]

10
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,166
[NAGATO (NEW)]
Don't get worked up.

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,625
[NAGATO]
Huh?

12
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,625
[NAGATO (NEW)]
He'll come to get you soon.

13
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,833
You shouldn't be
alone for too long.

14
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,916
[NAGATO]
Are you me?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,375
Yes, I am.

16
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,458
Oh! It's a dream!

17
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,458
[NAGATO (NEW)]
That's right.

18
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,625
[NAGATO]
It's Asakura.

19
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,708
I, um...

20
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,666
I'm glad you're here. Like I
was saying on the phone.

21
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,541
Yeah, it's weird.
I just woke up.

22
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,500
I... well, I don't know.

23
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,500
I guess I must've been
napping on a park bench.

24
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,541
Oh?

25
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,333
Welcome back. Good to see you.

26
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,416
Yeah. Good to be back.

27
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,458
[NAGATO (NEW)]
Something happened.

28
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,916
You were in an accident
on your way home.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,291
An accident? Whoa.

30
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,833
That's right.

31
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,291
You went to sleep
for a little while

32
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,791
as a result of shock
from the accident.

33
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:21,333
I took your place, living as
Yuki Nagato while you slept.

34
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,916
[NAGATO] Jeez, that's some
pretty crazy paranormal stuff.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,208
[NAGATO (NEW)] We're not
talking about anything crazy.

36
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,208
This is nothing supernatural.

37
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,833
It's just a dream.

38
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,500
Your brain is simply
taking a moment

39
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,083
to organize your memories.

40
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,916
So, we're having a little chat.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,041
You won't remember
when you wake up.

42
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,833
[NAGATO]
So, we're just killing time?

43
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,541
Oh! Hey, I know! Maybe
you can fill me in on stuff.

44
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,583
What happened when I was asleep?

45
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,041
[NAGATO (NEW)]
Not telling.

46
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,666
[NAGATO]
What?

47
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,583
But won't I find out anyway?

48
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,958
Since my memories are
being organized, and all.

49
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,125
[NAGATO (NEW)]
True enough,

50
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,208
but that's the brain
doing its own thing.

51
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,250
I really don't wanna
talk about it...

52
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,208
...so I'm not going to.

53
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,833
Except for one thing.
I told him how I felt.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,583
[NAGATO]
Huh?

55
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,333
[NAGATO (NEW)] You know,
that I had feelings for him.

56
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,750
[NAGATO]
What?

57
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,708
Whoa! This other me has
got some serious guts.

58
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,541
[NAGATO (NEW)]
To be clear,

59
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,708
I told him how I felt,
the new Yuki, not the old.

60
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,958
Right. You and I are
different people, I know.

61
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,916
But you're pretty amazing.

62
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:44,125
I did it. And you can too.

63
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,958
Right.

64
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,041
[NAGATO giggles]

65
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,541
[NAGATO (NEW)]
What is it?

66
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,041
[NAGATO] We both like the
same person. It's kinda funny.

67
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,500
[NAGATO (NEW)]
Well, we can't help it.

68
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,750
It's him.

69
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,958
[NAGATO] You're right.
We're totally helpless.

70
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,916
[ASAKURA] It's nice
how quickly clothes dry

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,791
with the rainy season over.

72
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,500
[ASAKURA]
Do me a favor?

73
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,000
[NAGATO]
Hm?

74
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,583
I need to bring the laundry in.
Will you grab the basket?

75
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,041
[NAGATO]
Sure.

76
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,833
[ASAKURA]
Back to your old self.

77
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,791
That or you've rediscovered your
obsession with gaming, anyway.

78
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,333
[NAGATO]
I like books, too.

79
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,791
I just like games
more, that's all.

80
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,208
[ASAKURA]
What, like comic books?

81
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,083
[NAGATO]
That's mean.

82
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,791
Ha! Hey, I'm teasing you!

83
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,875
[NAGATO] Would you like it
better if I liked books more?

84
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,458
Well, honestly,

85
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,916
considering that Miss Asakura
isn't much of a gamer herself,

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,166
she probably would like
it if you read more.

87
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,833
I understand.

88
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,750
[ASAKURA]
I'm just kidding.

89
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,125
You can think of it as payback

90
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,500
for asking me such
a ridiculous question.

91
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,000
Uh... I'm sorry.

92
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,458
Come on, I can tell
something's still bothering you.

93
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,875
[NAGATO] It's your reaction
when I came home that night.

94
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,333
You were happy to see me,
I could tell that,

95
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,625
but... you seemed
sorta sad, too.

96
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,750
Well, how could I not be?

97
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,666
It was really sudden
and confusing.

98
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,708
I needed to collect myself.

99
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,333
But, in the end,
it was actually simple.

100
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,625
I just had to ask myself how
I felt about the two of you.

101
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,958
[NAGATO]
Uh...

102
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,958
And do you know what I realized?

103
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,166
You and the other Yuki
are both my good friends,

104
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,041
and nothing's going
to change that.

105
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,250
So, just try to relax.

106
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,958
Be yourself and don't
think about it too much.

107
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,416
And before you know it,

108
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,583
I'll be back to
scolding you as usual.

109
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,625
Sound good?

110
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,791
[NAGATO]
Mh-hm.

111
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,833
It's a beautiful day outside.

112
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,500
Stop looking so
gloomy, would you?

113
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,583
[NAGATO]
Okay.

114
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,041
Good, that's it! See?

115
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,750
You're sounding more like
yourself every second.

116
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,958
[groans]

117
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,416
[ASAKURA] It is beautiful,
but it's so hot.

118
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,333
There's no denying
that summer's here.

119
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,125
Oh! We need to get you
some new bathing suits.

120
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,208
[NAGATO]
We do?

121
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,208
[ASAKURA]
Well, we'll be hanging out

122
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,041
with Kyon a lot over the break.

123
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,583
So it can't hurt, right?

124
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,416
[NAGATO]
Uhh...

125
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,791
[ASAKURA giggles]

126
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,166
[ASAKURA] What style do you
think we should go with?

127
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,291
I'm sure we can find
something that looks good.

128
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,458
[NAGATO]
Yep.

129
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,458
Ugh.

130
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,125
[ASAKURA]
Lovely morning, isn't it?

131
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,166
Not really.

132
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,875
Did you get your
math homework done?

133
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,750
For your sake, I hope so.

134
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,166
I don't like it when you ask
to copy mine at the last second.

135
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,750
[KYON]
Well, in that case,

136
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,583
maybe I should copy it now.

137
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,125
[ASAKURA]
Uh.

138
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,833
[NAGATO]
I've got my work done. You?

139
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,291
Yep. Why don't we compare
our answers, just to be safe.

140
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,291
I'll find mine real quick.

141
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,458
Hey. Good morning.

142
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,416
Morning. How are yo--?

143
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,666
[NAGATO (NEW)]
I love you.

144
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,708
[grunts]

145
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,083
[KYON] Man. It's really hot
in here, don't you think?

146
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,041
--I could use some air.
--What's the deal?

147
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,625
[ASAKURU] Hey! Did you wanna
copy down my answers or not?

148
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,416
[KYON]
Pathetic.

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,250
I need to get it together.

150
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,666
[ASAKURA]
Hm?

151
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,875
Great, what a mess.

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Is there somethin' wrong?

153
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,416
Oh, uh, no.

154
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,666
You wanna play?

155
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,416
Naw. I'm good, thanks.

156
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,833
You go ahead.

157
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,958
Hello! How's it goin'?
It's been such a long time!

158
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,500
How's everybody doin'?

159
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,875
Hey, guys.

160
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,375
Just when I was getting
used to the peace and quiet.

161
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,458
[HARUHI] ...like fail your tests
or something dumb like that.

162
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,250
Let's get straight
to the point, Kyon.

163
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,500
[KYON]
Um, okay.

164
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,541
Do you know what day today is?

165
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,666
I don't know, maybe
it's your birthday?

166
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,958
[HARUHI]
Not even!

167
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,625
Well, do you want to
know when my birthday is?

168
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,291
[HARUHI]
That is not important.

169
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,458
I didn't think this
would be so difficult.

170
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,791
Fine. How 'bout this: Which
month and which day is today?

171
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,916
It's July 7th. So what?

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,875
Oh, wait. I think I might know.

173
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,000
You're gonna suggest we
do something for Tanabata,

174
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:55,666
aren't you?

175
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,833
Exactly! Yes, I am!

176
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,375
I've decided all club members

177
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,416
will begin celebrating
Tanabata starting this year!

178
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,416
You might've asked us first.

179
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,083
Did she mention anything
about Tanabata to you?

180
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,333
Huh? Well...

181
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,333
Of course we did. Me and Yuki
talked about it on the phone.

182
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,666
[NAGATO]
We did? Ahh...

183
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,250
[NAGATO whimpering]

184
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,666
[ASAKURA] So, you did
know about it, didn't you?

185
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,625
All right, boys,
you're comin' with me.

186
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,125
We've got a lot to do. Come on!

187
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,791
Can you at least tell me
where she's dragging us to?

188
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,041
I don't know.

189
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,458
Well, what are you
waiting for? Move it!

190
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,791
[KYON]
Okay, fine.

191
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,291
Good luck. Be careful.

192
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,791
Yeah.

193
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, I'll see you
later then, I guess.

194
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,708
[sighs]

195
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,041
And what am I supposed
to do with this, exactly?

196
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,708
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

197
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,500
We need bamboo to
hang our wishes on,

198
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,208
so in there and get some!

199
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,375
[KYON]
Wait a sec!

200
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,666
I'm pretty sure this
is private property.

201
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,791
I don't love the idea
of stealing bamboo.

202
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,291
[HARUHI]
Don't worry,

203
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,250
I came up with a good excuse
and got permission already!

204
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,708
[KYON] You're good at getting
people to let you do stuff.

205
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,875
It's a blessing.
Now, enough talk.

206
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,666
Go get in there!
I'm counting on you!

207
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,458
And one more thing.

208
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,750
If your bamboo isn't perfect,
you'll have to do it again!

209
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,375
Okay, okay.

210
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,666
Awesome. Back for one day

211
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,958
and she's already got
us doing crazy stuff.

212
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,625
[KOIZUMI chuckles]

213
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,000
[KOIZUMI]
Exams are long and grueling.

214
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,875
Miss Suzumiya's just
blowing off some steam.

215
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,416
We've been gone a long time.

216
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,125
You seem quiet.
How have you been?

217
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,708
Oh, I'm fine. It's just that--

218
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,041
[grunts]

219
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,833
[KOIZUMI]
Mm?

220
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,958
Well, a lot's
happened, that's all.

221
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,458
You can't stop there.
You've got me curious.

222
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,500
[gasps]

223
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,875
What was that?

224
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,208
I was tryin' to help you out.

225
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,125
Huh?

226
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,333
Ah! They're all over!

227
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,666
This place is swarming
with mosquitoes!

228
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,666
[KOIZUMI chuckling]

229
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,625
[KOIZUMI]
Little flying vampires.

230
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,125
[KYON] Let's just get the
bamboo and get out of here!

231
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,166
[KOIZUMI]
I'm on it.

232
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,333
Ugh. I don't get it.

233
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,291
Why is Kyon making such a big
deal over tiny little insects?

234
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,916
[HARUHI]
July 7th, four years ago.

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,208
I can't believe
it's been that long.

236
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,333
[NAGATO]
Whoa. That looks nice!

237
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,916
[ASAKURA] Yeah. It's an
excellent bamboo specimen.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
[HARUHI]
Isn't it?

239
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,458
All thanks to my
precise instructions!

240
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,708
We would've been lost
without your guidance.

241
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,375
Well, I'm glad you like it.

242
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,083
'Cause I'll tell you what,
this bamboo didn't come cheap.

243
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,208
I paid for it with my blood.
Behold. My badges of honor.

244
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,916
Those don't look pleasant.

245
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, well, they itch,
that's for sure.

246
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,750
[HARUHI]
Oh, please!

247
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,666
If you'd been more careful,
you wouldn't have so many bites.

248
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,791
Personally, I'd say they're
proof of your defeat,

249
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,458
not badges of honor.

250
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,833
[KYON]
Interesting how she hung back

251
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,458
and let us go in there alone.

252
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,291
Confess! You knew about
the mosquitoes, didn't you?

253
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,166
[HARUHI humming]

254
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,666
[KYON]
She's a real jerk.

255
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,875
I found it!

256
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,333
Scratching like that
will only make it worse.

257
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,916
Here, put some of
this on. It should help.

258
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,833
Ah. Great, thanks.

259
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,875
Hm?

260
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,166
You can go first.

261
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,791
That's nice of you.

262
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,541
[HARUHI]
Not bad so far,

263
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,750
but I wonder how we
should decorate it.

264
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,375
We want it to look
festive but appropriate.

265
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,958
[KYON grunting]

266
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,000
I've even got some back there.

267
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh. Looks like you're
having a hard time.

268
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,250
I could help you with that.

269
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,916
[KYON]
Uh. No, I'm fine.

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,625
I don't think I need to put
any of that cream on my back.

271
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,958
It doesn't really itch that
much anymore, but thanks.

272
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,500
No problem.

273
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,083
[KYON]
Yeah.

274
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,458
[KOIZUMI]
All right, fearless leader.

275
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,833
What should we do next?

276
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,083
[HARUHI]
These!

277
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,625
Time to write out our wishes?

278
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,750
How fun! I don't remember
the last time I did that.

279
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,458
I have to think
about what to put.

280
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,083
Okay! You need to keep
certain parameters in mind

281
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,708
when you're writing
down your wishes.

282
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,041
Parameters?

283
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,125
Here's the question:
"Who are the deities

284
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,041
that are going to make all
your dreams come true?"

285
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,375
The stars Vega and Altair

286
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,833
represent the gods
Orihime and Hikoboshi.

287
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,208
They're light years away,

288
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,000
so we could make our wishes
for far in the future.

289
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,208
Is that right?

290
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,666
[HARUHI crying]

291
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,791
I don't get it.
Was it something I said?

292
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,208
You never let me have
any fun! This is...

293
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,708
Sorry! I didn't mean
to steal your thunder.

294
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,041
Was there a particular time
frame you had in mind?

295
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,125
We can go with between 16
and 25 years if you'd like.

296
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,666
[HARUHI]
Mm.

297
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
But that's just the distance
from here to there, isn't it?

298
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,250
So won't it take twice as long
for our wishes to be granted?

299
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,791
Ha. A little detail! The gods'll
sort it out, I'm sure.

300
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,208
At least, I bet that's what
Miss Suzumiya would say.

301
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,791
Are you channeling her now,
or something? Just what we need.

302
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,791
[KOIZUMI chuckling]

303
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,458
I have two. I hope that's okay.

304
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,541
[HARUHI]
Okay, guys!

305
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,083
Once you're done,
hang 'em all up!

306
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,375
[KYON] Well, Haruhi,
what'd you wish for?

307
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,083
[KYON groaning]

308
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,333
You deserved it!

309
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,000
I can tell you're thinking
something snarky.

310
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,500
Let's hear what you wished
for before I tell ya mine!

311
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,166
Well, I wished for...

312
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,708
Ugh!

313
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,958
Well, what's wrong with that?

314
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,000
Pathetic. It's obviously
a weak attempt

315
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,541
by an 11th grader with
limited intelligence.

316
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,500
Well, I think it was
pretty clever, actually.

317
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,625
Where do you think I should hang
these? The tree's getting full.

318
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,708
[chuckles] I can do it for you.

319
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,583
Would you mind? That'd be great!

320
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,708
I can tell those are yours.

321
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,916
They're so practical
and well thought out.

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,541
I like how
altruistic yours were.

323
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,291
You didn't just wish for
money like some people might.

324
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,208
[KYON]
No lottery winnings for her.

325
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,250
Hm?

326
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,416
Naga-- Uh.

327
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,041
[KYON]
Hold on.

328
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,291
You don't need to hang
'em so low. Let me help.

329
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,750
[BOTH gasp]

330
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,791
Higher up would be perfect.

331
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,333
Here, thank you.

332
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,416
Yeah, sure. Leave it to me.

333
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,083
It looks even better outside,

334
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,083
like we're returning it
to nature or something.

335
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,625
[ASAKURA]
It does look good.

336
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,875
It makes me feel like our
wishes really will come true.

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,166
[HARUHI]
Hmm...

338
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,708
Something happened to
you while we were gone.

339
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,208
[KYON]
Oh, it's you.

340
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,916
[HARUHI]
So, what was it?

341
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,583
[HARUHI] Did the other Yuki
tell you how she felt about you?

342
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,541
[gasps]

343
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,500
Hey! How did you know that?

344
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,125
Well, you just
confirmed it for me!

345
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,666
[KYON]
Huh?

346
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
[HARUHI] Ryoko told me earlier
about what happened to Yuki.

347
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,750
The rest was easy to guess
from how you've been acting.

348
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,500
So...

349
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,083
[HARUHI chuckles]

350
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,458
What? You get nervous
when you talk to her?

351
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,750
Have you ever thought
about just asking her out?

352
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,750
It's not that simple.

353
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,208
[KYON] The two Nagatos
are different people.

354
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,875
This has nothing to do
with the current Nagato.

355
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:33,500
Well, it'd be easier if
I could really think that.

356
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,000
Funny how these things work.

357
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:40,708
She doesn't even remember it,
but I still feel nervous.

358
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,500
Well, that's stupid.

359
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,958
Hey! What's taking
you guys so long?

360
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,250
The party's happenin' down
here if you haven't noticed.

361
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,666
[HARUHI]
She doesn't even remember, huh?

362
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,250
Something wrong?

363
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,625
Come on, let's get going!

364
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,666
Okay.

365
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,833
[KYON] Hey! What do
you think you're doing?

366
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:09,875
[HARUHI]
Huh?

367
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,250
[HARUHI]
Well, isn't it obvious?

368
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,875
Trespassing, of course.

369
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,458
[chuckling]

370
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,250
Well, I could use
help with something.

371
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,750
[KYON]
What?

372
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,500
Since you didn't stop me,
you're already my accomplice.

373
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,000
[groans]

374
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,541
[KYON]
So, what're we gonna do next?

375
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,333
[HARUHI] Do I have to explain
everything little thing to you?

376
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,500
[HARUHI chuckles]

377
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,000
We're gonna write
a note for the aliens!

378
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,583
[HARUHI]
Hey.

379
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,333
[KYON]
Hm?

380
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,916
So, what do you think?

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,625
Do you think aliens
are real or not?

382
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,625
I don't know.

383
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,083
[KYON]
They could be real.

384
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,458
[HARUHI]
Yeah?

385
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,083
[KYON]
Hm?

386
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,000
Weren't you the one in a hurry?

387
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,833
It doesn't even matter...
if she remembers.

388
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:44,083
What matters is that it's
important to you, right?

389
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,875
Just write it off.

390
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,875
Something significant
happened between you two.

391
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,708
She may not know it.

392
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,083
But at least somebody
does now, right?

393
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,250
You're right.

394
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,583
Although, I still have the
right to tease you mercilessly

395
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,750
if I choose to.

396
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,375
Absolutely, I would expect
no less of you, Haruhi.

397
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,875
I can't help it!

398
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,708
My motto is: "Always enjoy
yourself at every opportunity."

399
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,375
I guess I got a little sappy
there for a minute.

400
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,541
And we all know, sentiment
doesn't go with fun.

401
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,375
I think you're right.

402
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,625
We'll have to be more careful.

403
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry, by the way, for
inciting you to sappiness.

404
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,916
That's fine, but it'll cost ya.

405

[giggles]

406
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,000
Here they are!

407
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,041
We've got sweet dumplings,
courtesy of Miss Tsuruya.

408
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,000
Hey, Haru! Long time no see!

409
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,500
Come on, you two, we're gonna
need help eating all these.

410
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,833
You should really have
some. They're yummy.

411
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,958
Don't you know better than
to speak with your mouth full?

412
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,791
--Yeah.

415

[HARUHI]
I was at that awkward age

416
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,208
when growing up is
confusing and strange.

417
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,833
Common sense was
edging out imagination,

418
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,333
and that was depressing.

419
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,541
Hey, looks like
they're having fun.

420
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,416
[HARUHI]
And then I met you.

421
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,125
You helped me, even
though you didn't want to.

422
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,625
You helped me see that
imagination wasn't dead.

423
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,208
Hey, wait a minute. Aren't
those the last two pieces?

424
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,666
[KYON]
Huh?

425
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,458
You were supposed to share.

426
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,041
Yeah, okay.

427
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,666
[HARUHI] You're the one who
saved me... from my despair.

428
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,125
[chuckles]

429
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,666
[HARUHI]
So, what's your name?

430
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,500
[KYON]
John Smith.

431
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,541
[HARUHI]
That's a stupid name!
