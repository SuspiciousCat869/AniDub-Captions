[ASAKURA]
Hello there!

4
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:57,958
Hmm.

5
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,208
Looks like she's taking
a nap. We can't have that!

6
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,208
Sleeping Beauty's in
for a rude awakening.

7
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,166
[KYON] Or you could, you know,
wake her up nicely.

8

[ASAKURA]
Rise and shine!

9
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:10,916
[NAGATO]
Ow!

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,416
Good morning, Princess!

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,541
It's about time for
the club meeting.

12
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,625
[NAGATO]
That hurt.

13
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,375
If my growth is stunted,
I'm blaming you.

14
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,166
[ASAKURA] Yeah, I think
I'm all right with that.

15
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,750
You'll be cuter if you
stay pint-size, anyway.

16
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,333
That's not nice.

17
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:31,166
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato. Are you okay? Here.

18
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,375
Come on.

19
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,916
Uh-- Ah!

20
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,708
Th-Thank you, Kyon.

21
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,083
[KYON]
Hm?

22
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,958
[ASAKURA] Hm... You know you're
still holding his hand, right?

23
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,166
[gasps]

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,541
--[NAGATO gasps] Uh, sorry.
--[KYON yelps]

25
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,208
[ASAKURA] Well then, I'll just
be heading out now. Bye!

26
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,291
[NAGATO]
Ah...

27
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,791
But aren't you coming
to the clubroom?

28
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,416
[ASAKURA]
Sorry, I have to miss today.

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,458
There are some errands
I need to run.

30
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,916
But don't worry,
I'll still come over

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,541
to your place to cook dinner.

32
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,333
Great!

33
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,500
Oh, and, Kyon?

34
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,750
When club activities
are all wrapped up,

35
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,541
maybe you could
walk her home, 'kay?

36
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,833
And you're welcome to stay
for dinner, of course.

37
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:18,166
I'm off! Market, here
I come! Woo-hoo!

38
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,541
Hm. Sale days get her excited.

39
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,625
Uh-huh.

40
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,083
Well, off to the
clubroom, huh?

41
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,833
Oh!

42
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,666
[KYON]
Well, it's official.

43
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,000
[NAGATO]
What is?

44
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,250
Just that I've been a member
of the Literary Club

45
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,375
for a full week now.

46
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,791
So, do I get a
cake or something?

47
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,041
You like it so far?

48
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,166
Hm... Well, I'm not really sure

49
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,541
why I joined, honestly.

50
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,916
I basically just read
or do my homework, so.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,500
It's pretty much the same stuff
I'd be doing if I wasn't in it.

52
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,833

productive club meeting.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,416
I guess Literary Clubs aren't
much on variety, are they?

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,541
I don't think that's fair.

59
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,416
[KYON]
U-Uh--! Sorry!

60
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,791
I'm sure real Literary Clubs
are quite different.

61
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,041
Hold on, are you telling
me I joined a fake club?

62
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:49,000
[STUDENTS chattering]

63
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,791
[NAGATO]
Maybe this is boring to you.

64
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,041
We don't do much in the way of
traditional club activities.

65
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,958
But I'd rather read here,
where I can listen

66
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,916
to the noise and laughter
of the other clubs,

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,791
than sitting alone
at home with my book.

68
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,375
I find it sort of comforting.
That's why I started the club.

69
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,000
What I'm getting at is that
you joining wasn't pointless.

70
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,958
[KYON]
Uh--

71
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,250
[NAGATO] You're the whole reason
the Literary Club still exists.

72
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,291
I'd be alone without you.

73
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,708
You're an important part
of the club, you know?

74
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:24,666
So, thank you.
I mean it. I, um...

75
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,500
[gasps]

76
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:33,041
This last week...
It's been really great!

77
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,625
[KYON] Yeah. So, anyway,
we should get going!

78
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,250
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm!

00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,583
[NAGATO gasps]

What is it?

81
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,625
It's almost Christmas!

82
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,250
Which means we need
to start planning

83
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,708
for the club Christmas party.

84
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:57,375
[KYON] Fake clubs still
have parties? That's cool.

85
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,458
[NAGATO]
Can we?

86
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,041
You're the one running the show.

87
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,000
You are the club
president, right?

Was that someone you know?

Just imagining things.

92
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,125
[NAGATO] This is the story of
a somewhat shy, bookish girl.

[NAGATO]
Whoops.

95
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,500
[NAGATO] Oh! We'll need
a turkey, for sure.

96
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,833
[KYON]
Turkey?

97
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,833
Oh, are we still talking
about the Christmas party?

98
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,208
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

99
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,083
You can't have a party
without a turkey, you know?

100
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,208
Oh, is that a thing?

101
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,833

I'm sorry for interrupting

this little romantic
comedy moment.

So, Asakura, how'd
you do at the sale?

109
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,750
A good haul.

110
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,750
I may have gone overboard.
My hands hurt.

111

Will you carry these for me?

112

Hand 'em over.

You did buy a lot!

Ow, ow, ow! So cold and sore.

Let's review.

You see an opening
and you make your move.

Aggressively. Got it?

That's some high-level flirting.

coming or not?

There's something about the
way you wield that knife...

Hey, Nagato?

139
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,333
[NAGATO]
Just a sec. What is it?

140
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,750
Well, I heard a rumor.

141
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,625
About a certain club
Christmas party.

142
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,083
Yeah! What do you think?

143
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,208
I hate to burst your bubble,

144
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,583
but I don't think
it's going to work.

145
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,958
Not in the clubroom, anyway.

146
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,750
The school won't let us.
If you're so set on a party,

147
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,791
why don't we just have
it at home, instead?

148
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,958
That way we have
everything we need.

149
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,666
I wanna have it
in the clubroom, okay?

150
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,708
Can we please just
leave it at that?

151
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,125
[ASAKURA]
Hm?

152
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,708
[KYON] I admit it: this
looks pretty darn good,

153
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,291
even the vegetables.

154
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,666
[ASAKURA giggles] With veggies,
it's all in how you cut them.

00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,375
Why do you wanna hold
it in the clubroom?

162
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,083
[gaggs]

163
00:07:59,166 --> 00:07:59,708
[gasps]

164
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,875
Are you all right?

165
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,708
Oh, no! Your cute
sweater got all stained!

166
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,333
Come on, hurry!

167
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,666
We need to get it
in the wash quickly.

168
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,875
Um. I can undress myself.

169
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,583
But it's easier without
stuff in my hands.

170
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,208
[laughs] You two are
really close, aren't you?

171
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,583
[ASAKURA]
This stuff is dangerous.

172
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,291
One clumsy move
with a chopstick,

173
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,208
and you're covered
in boiling broth.

174
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,083
Nagato is always--

175
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,250
Huh?

176
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,791
[screams]

177
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,416
[KYON]
S-Sorry! Sorry!

178
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,250
[ASAKURA shrieks] I forgot
that Kyon was here, too!

179
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,541
[KYON]
You think she's okay?

180
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,916
Get in there! Go!

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,625
[yelps]

182
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,416
Hey, how ya doin'?
Is this seat taken?

183
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,791
Okay, great!

184
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,291
--[NAGATO] Uh...
--[KYON] I...

185
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,125
--Oh!
--Uh!

186
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,625
No, you first. Go on.

187
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:05,208
Oh! I was just...
I wanted to know...

188
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,541
How much did you see?

189
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,916
[KYON]
Strike one!

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,875
Some pitchers begin with
a couple of warm-up throws,

191
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,208
but not this one! Nope, it's
straight to the curve ball!

192
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,916
I guess beating around
the bush isn't her style.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,250
Well, I saw... Uh... Your belly!

194
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,958
Just your waist, I mean!

195
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,291
That's really all?

196
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,708
Totally! I didn't see
anything else, I promise!

197
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,333
[KYON]
Let's see if she bought it.

198
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,750
[NAGATO]
Okay. That's good, then.

199
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,708
[KYON]
Hook, line, and sinker!

200
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,958
[sighs]

201
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,833
Um. I do have just one
more question, though.

202
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:33,875
Yeah, shoot.

203
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,083
The toughest one's
out of the way.

204
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,916
So you saw my stomach.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,458
What'd you think?

206
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,166
[KYON] That question's
a conversational landmine!

207
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,541
And I'm about to get
blown to pieces.

208
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,916
[NAGATO]
What's he gonna say?

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,208
I think boys like
a little more... meat.

210
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,375
[KYON] If I say I liked it,
then I'm the creepy guy

211
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,916
who likes her stomach.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,583
But if I say I didn't, then
I'm the jerk who insulted her.

213
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't do this on my own!

214
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,666
[KYON]
I can't say that!

215
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,875
Calm down!

216
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,958
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

217
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,541
It's not like you're a bad guy.

218
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,791
You've got nothing to hide.

219
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,458
Just tell her the truth,
and it'll be fine.

220
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,041
[KYON]
Your stomach's nice.

221
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,083
I-I mean, I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

222
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,041
It's not like I have
a stomach fetish.

223
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,541
[NAGATO]
Hm? Stomach fetish? What's that?

224
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,500
[KYON]
Mm...

225
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,416
Nothing! I'm an idiot
who talks too much.

226
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,250
Forget I said anything,
okay? I'm begging you!

227
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,125
Uh. Yeah. Sure.

228
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,291
[KYON sighs]
There's gotta be something else

229
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,833
we can talk about.
New subject. New subject.

230
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,833
So, why's it so important
that we have the party

231
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,583
in the actual clubroom?

232
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,125
Wouldn't it make more
sense to have it here,

233
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,583
like Asakura said?

234
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,958
[gasps]

235
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,416
[NAGATO]
It wouldn't be the same.

236
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,625
The party isn't really
about Christmas.

237
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,000
It's about celebrating
the club itself.

238
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,000
With a party?

239
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,541
Yeah. That's right.

240
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,125
To celebrate the fact
that there is a club.

241
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,458
That you guys joined.

242
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,458
That we're all
doing this together.

243
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,375
[ASAKURA] And you think the
best place to have a party

244
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,625
for the club is in
the clubroom, huh?

245
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,791
That's right.

246
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,750
Having it there would
mean a lot to me.

247
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,291
If that's the case,
I guess it can't be helped.

248
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,333
Okay, then. Let's do it!

249
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,708
Really?

250
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,916
[ASAKURA] Yes! I'm a member
of the Literary Club.

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,750
If you're serious about this,
I'll do whatever I can

252
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,833
to help you make
it happen, President!

253
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,375
[ASAKURA]
Where should we start?

254
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,291
What's the most important
part of the party?

255
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,208
A turkey!

256
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,291
[ASAKURA]
There's a lot of oden left!

257
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,083
Come on, we can't
let it go to waste.

258
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:44,958
[KYON]
Subject change!

259
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:45,875
[NAGATO]
Right!

260
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,125
[KYON]
Hey, it worked!

261
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,833
[NAGATO] No, wait. I was
talking about turkey.

262
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,625
We need to get a turkey!

263
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,625
[SHOP OWNER A]
Nope, you're outta luck.

264
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,916
We don't carry turkeys here.

265
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,625
No room for that
kinda thing, y'know?

266
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:05,958
Yeah, I sorta figured that.

267
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,625
Sorry. I can give
you a great deal

268
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,583
on chicken wings, though!

269
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,666
Really? I love a good bargain!

270
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,958
[SHOP OWNER A] Sure! And I'll
throw in something extra.

271
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,041
Thanks so much!
That's wonderful!

272
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,708
Hey! I got a really
good deal, you guys.

273
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,333
[KYON]
Chicken wings? Really?

274
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,041
If you've got your heart
set on a whole bird,

275
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,541
we're gonna have to go
to a bigger store.

276
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,916
It's a little far away,
but I'm game.

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,083
[gasps]

278
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,041
I had no idea that
something like a turkey

279
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,958
could complicate things so much.

280
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,458
[sighs]

281
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,791
[ASAKURA] I'm sure you
thought things through

282
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,333
pretty carefully when
you were coming up with

283
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,750
this whole Christmas party idea.

284
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,875
Except...

285
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,458
...I think this turkey
obsession has more

286
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,458
to do with appetite
than anything else.

287
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,208
Admit it! You've just got
a big, fat turkey craving!

288
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,791
Nuh-uh! I--

289
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,333
I thought it would be
festive and memorable.

290
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,791
Plenty of people have turkey
for the holidays, you know.

291
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,666
It's not that weird.

292
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,958
Oh, look, I've got a piece
of fried mincemeat cake,

293
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,291
courtesy of my friend
the butcher over there.

294
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,208
[gasps] Okay, I admit it!
I just wanted turkey!

295
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,041
[ASAKURA] Mm-hm! I will
reward you for your honesty.

296
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,166
[NAGATO]
Thank you! Thank you!

297
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,250
That didn't take much.

298
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,083
[TSURUYA laughs]
That's a classic tactic.

299
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,333
[gasps]

300
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,166
[TSURUYA] The old
carrot-and-stick approach.

301
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,875
And it worked like a charm, too!

302
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,791
[MIKURU]
She's such a good friend!

303
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,000
[KYON] I-I didn't see you
lovely ladies standing there!

304
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,333
Miss Tsuruya. Miss Asahina.

305
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,833
Nice to see you!

306
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,250
Kyon.

307
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,083
Surely you aren't suggesting
that we aren't allowed

308
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,416
to come shopping here, are you?

309
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,833
[KYON]
No! I wouldn't dare.

310
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,625
Well, I think I can guess why

311
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,041
seeing us has shaken
your composure so much.

312
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,375
Huh?

313
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,083
[TSURUYA] Just look at the
company you're keeping!

314
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,166
Who are these little cuties?

315
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,125
I take my eyes off
you for a second,

316
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,958

Wow, that's a terrible picture.

Although your initial approach
left a lot to be desired,

323
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,708
your fervor was such that

324
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,708
I hoped you might one day
become a leader within the club.

Which means going to a

The best way to see
what you're capable of

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,458
[NAGATO] I'm the one who
insisted on this party.

473
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,791
I have to deliver.

474
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,750
It's gotta be the
best party ever.

475
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,916
[NAGATO]
And next time...

476
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,541
[KYON]
I've got a question.

477
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,708
Yes?

478
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,208
[KYON] What're we gonna
do about the tree?

479
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,458
Asakura's on it.

480
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,416
She invited those girls
we met at the mall

481
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,166
the other day to the party.

482
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,958
And the bossy one said
she'd get a tree for us.

483
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,166
Yeah, I remember her.

484
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,500
She and Asakura sure
have a lot in common.

485
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:14,250
Well, I'm happy to
help carry it here.

486
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,416
Oh, thanks.

487
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,166
I hate to ask you
to do manual labor.

488
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,125
[KYON]
I really don't mind helping.

489
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm actually looking
forward to this party.

490
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:27,583
Really? Well, I'm glad.

491
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,458
[NAGATO]
Wow, I can't believe it!

492
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,250
He's looking forward
to my party!

493
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,500
Um, in that case, just
forget what I said earlier.

494
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,083
Would you like to
help out with the plans?

495
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,916
[KYON]
Sure. I'm happy to.

496
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,250
[KYON]
Hm...

497
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,666
Well, first of all,

498
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,041
no scattering snow in the
clubroom. It'll just melt.

499
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,375
[NAGATO sighs]

500
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,666
--As for the cake...
--[NAGATO] Just four tiers?

501
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,958
That's like a wedding cake!

502
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,125
Wha-- Huh?

503
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,208
--W-Wait! Wedding?

504
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,541
--Fine. Two tiers.
--W-Wait! Wedding?

505
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,125
--But that's the absolute most.
--W-Wait! Wedding?

506
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,375
[KYON]
Now about this dress.

507
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,166
[NAGATO]
I want pure white!

508
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,416
It's a wedding dress!

509
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,750
It's not!

510
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,166
Maybe we should just table
the dress for now, okay?

511
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,166
[NAGATO]
Mm-hm.

512
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,208
Hey, you guys!

513
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,291
Hey, Asakura.

514
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,541
[KYON]
You're late. Where've you been?

515
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,416
[ASAKURA giggles]

516
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,166
How do you like them apples?

517
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,625
[KYON]
No way!

518
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,666
[ASAKURA] It says we can use
the clubroom on Christmas.

519
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,625
I just kept bugging
them until they caved.

520
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,875
I thought we were just gonna

521
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,625
have to sneak in here
after hours. Good job!

522
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,833
Well, being an honor student
does open some doors.

523
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:37,083
Now that it's official,
I think that we can go all-out.

524
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,875
So, what have you guys
been up to today?

525
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,375
We're trying to hash
out party decorations.

526
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,708
Yeah? What do you have so far?

527
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,916
[ASAKURA]
Oh?

528
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,208
So, what do you think?

529
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,625
[ASAKURA] Hm... I think
these look pretty good.

530
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,125
Seriously?

531
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,166
Well, there might be one or two
suggestions I would make.

532
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,666
But I know Nagato's been
working really hard on this,

533
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,791
and I wouldn't wanna
seem too controlling.

534
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,125
Huh?

535
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,541
Hey!

536
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,458
If you have something to say,
I think now's the time.

537
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,666
[ASAKURA]
Oh yeah? Well...

538
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,083
A cake with four tiers?

539
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,083
[KYON] I was able to
get it down to two.

540
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,916
[ASAKURA]
And the snow in the clubroom?

541
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,166
[KYON]
"Yuki" means snow, right?

542
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,333
[ASAKURA]
Huh?

543
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,583
[KYON] That's why she's
always so chilly!

544
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,833
[ASAKURA] Do you know
how bad that joke was?

545
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,916
[KYON]
It wasn't that bad.

546
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,291
[ASAKURA]
Awful.

547
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,000
[NAGATO] It'll be fun.
I'll make it a good party.

548
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,291
And when I do, maybe...

549
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,208
[KYON]
Hey there. Let me help you.

550
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,791
Here, gimme that book.

551
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,500
You want a library card, right?

552
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,500
I'll go take care of it for you.

553
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,000
[NAGATO]
Ah--

554
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,250
[KYON]
Hey. Nagato.

555
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,250
Huh?

556
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,625
Don't worry. The
party'll be great.

557
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,541
[gasps] Yep!

558
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,166
[NAGATO]
And maybe... I'll tell him...

559
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,416
...how I feel about him.

560
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:37,708
[NAGATO] Next episode:
"Joy to the World."
