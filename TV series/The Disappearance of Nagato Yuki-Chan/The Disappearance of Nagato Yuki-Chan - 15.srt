1
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,166
[KYON]
I felt pretty confident

2
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,666
that I'd gotten decent
scores on the exams.

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,000
But that didn't stop me

4
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,833
from being relieved to
find out that I'd passed.

5
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,666
And, as a reward for my
valiant academic efforts,

6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,375
it arrived at last:
Summer break!

7
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,958
The sun felt almost
impossibly hot,

8
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,333
but, temporarily freed
from the rigors of school,

9
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:59,458
the Literary Club was gearing up
for its first summer vacation.

10
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,500
[KYON]
Led, of course, by Haruhi,

11
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,125
we started thinking of
ways to fill our time.

12
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,750
But fortunately,
Miss Tsuruya joined us,

13
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,083
and instead of making
theoretical plans,

14
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,083
we were able to
make actual ones.

15
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,375
And for our first activity,
we're heading to--

16
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,375
[ALL gasping]

17
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,916
[HARUHI giggles]

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,375
[KYON]
The beach!

19
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,458
[HARUHI]
Ahh!

20
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,750
The beach is the
best in the summer!

21
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,583
Thanks a lot for inviting us.

22
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,166
It's so cool that your family
has a summer home here.

23
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,666
Aw, it's no big deal.

24
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean, there'd be no point
in letting it sit empty.

25
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,208
I say we worry about
settling in later.

26
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,083
For now, let's just dump our
bags and get down to the beach.

27
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,750
[KYON]
Yes! Like now!

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,916
[KYON] Man, what is
this place? Paradise?

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,666
How are we the only ones here?

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,166
I wonder if this is
their private beach.

31
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,250
There's no way. Those don't
exist in Japan, do they?

32
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,041
It's totally possible.

33
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,916
I've got this distant relative.
He bought an uninhabited island.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,916
[KYON]
Well, that's impressive.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,458
To be honest, I thought that
sort of thing only existed

36
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,125
in mystery novels.

37
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,000
[KOIZUMI] Actually, he did
take advantage of the location

38
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,916
to stage a little
murder mystery prank.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,166
The police wound up
getting involved, though.

40
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,666
[KYON]
That's not surprising.

41
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,333
It sounds like something
only Haruhi would enjoy.

42
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,416
[KOIZUMI] Yeah. Like a
locked room murder mystery.

43
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,666
A reality sealed within itself.

44
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,458
That's something Miss Suzumiya
would probably like.

45
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,208
[TSURUYA]
Stare at this, instead!

46
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,208
[TSURUYA giggles]

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,166
--[HARUHI] What are you guys
--[KYON] One!

48
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,250
--standing around for?
--Two!

49
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,625
--The ocean awaits!
--Three!

50
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,583
[KYON] She may be nuts,
but she's got a great body!

51
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,000
[chuckles]

52
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,416
You know how to choose a suit.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,083
Not everybody can
pull off a bikini

54
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,041
with that much personality,
but you sure can.

55
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:32,875
You look perfect!

56
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,375
[HARUHI]
Of course I do!

57
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,041
What, aren't you going
to say something about me?

58
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,916
You look great
in your suit, too.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,583
We're finally here.

60
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,875
Nagato got a new suit.

61
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,458
I think it looks good
on her, don't you, Kyon?

62
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,500
[KYON]
Mmm.

63
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,833
Yeah. Looks good.

64
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,500
You could've been
more enthusiastic,

65
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,875
but I guess it'll do.

66
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,541
Glad you like it.

67
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,791
Let's go already!

68
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,083
But Miss Asahina isn't here yet.

69
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,958
Don't tell me that brat
is causing her trouble.

70
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,666
What? No. I don't think
she's done anything wrong.

71
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,875
Take it easy! Mikuru's just
helping her change, that's all.

72
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,416
Really? No way!

73
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,958
Isn't she old enough to be doing
that sort of thing herself?

74
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,750
Hey, everybody!

75
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,041
I'm sorry it took us while.

76
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,000
[KYON'S SISTER giggling]

77
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,375
[KYON]
Hey.

78
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,875
Don't tell me you're annoying
my friends already.

79
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:24,791
We just got here.

80
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,041
[giggles]

81
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,541
Nu-uh! I'm not annoying
anybody! Right, Mikuru?

82
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,375
Right.

83
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,500
[KYON]
I'm really sorry.

84
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,791
I'll try to keep her from
bugging you anymore.

85
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,666
It's okay, we're having fun.

86
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,791
I think you're little
sister's adorable.

87
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,541
She was pretty insistent
on coming along.

88
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,458
What the--?

89
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,458
[KYON]
Hm? Uh!

90
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,083
[KYON'S SISTER yells]

91
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,166
I don't ever get to
have fun! It's not fair!

92
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,166
[groaning]

93
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,708
Anyway, sorry again.

94
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,916
The little stowaway
is welcome to join us,

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,416
Aw, thank you!

96
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,583
[KYON'S SISTER giggles]

97
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,833
[KYON'S SISTER]
Tee-hee.

98
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,500
[KYON]
Evil little brat!

99
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,458
[HARUHI]
Now that we're at the beach,

100
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,833
it's time to do some
cool beachy stuff!

101
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,791
We've got a whole list to cover!

102
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,791
First, we'll race to that
island over there! See?

103
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,125
[ASAKURA]
We're going to swim there?

104
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,083
[HARUHI] Yeah!
It'll be an adventure!

105
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,250
Fighting against the waves is
the real challenge of the sea!

106
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,833
Come on, Mikuru! Let's go!

107
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,625
--[HARUHI laughing]
--[MIKURU screaming]

108
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,708
[HARUHI] Aw. Come on,
you guys, that was pathetic.

109
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,083
Let's do somethin' else.

110
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,458
Okay, next!

111
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,458
[HARUHI]
A little to your left.

112
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,500
You can do it! Keep going!

113
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,916
Just a little further!

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,583
[HARUHI] There's more than
watermelon out there,

115
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,291
so careful where you strike!

116
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,083
I really, really, really hope
she hits the right thing.

117
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,500
At least we're on the beach.

118
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,875
We might as well just sit
back and relax and enjoy.

119
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:16,958
How exactly?

120
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,000
[yelps]

121
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:20,958
I missed.

122
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,250
[KYON]
Which one?

123
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,291
[BOTH giggling]

124
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,625
[HARUHI]
Gotcha!

125
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,000
All right!

126
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,958
[HARUHI]
Yeah!

127
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:54,041
[screaming]

128
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,791
Yep, this is a classic
day at the beach.

129
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,791
[clicking]

130
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,833
Huh?

131
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,000
[KYON]
Well, she's consistent.

132
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,708
Everyone's got their own
version of fun, don't they?

133
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,500
Uh.

134
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,041
[KYON]
Um, can I help you?

135
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,833
Koizumi has a point.

136
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,958
Different people have different
hobbies, and that's just fine.

137
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,375
[KYON]
Uhhh...

138
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,041
[ASAKURA] But we did come all
the way to the beach, so--

139
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,541
[NAGATO]
Huh?

140
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,333
[ASAKURA] I know you're busy,
but do you have a second?

141
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,750
The ball flew all
the way down there.

142
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,500
Maybe you could go and get it?

143
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,916
[NAGATO]
Huh?

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And while you're there,
you might as well play with it.

145
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,708
Uh. Okay. In a minute.
I'm about to get a rare item--

146
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,750
[ASAKURA] No, you're not.
You're going to play.

147
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,916
[NAGATO]
Yes, ma'am! Right away, ma'am!

148
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,833
What're you waiting for?

149
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,791
You... mean me?

150
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,666
[ASAKURA] Do you see anyone
else I could be talking to?

151
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,291
[KYON]
Mm.

152
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,208
Are you going to go
down and join her,

153
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,041
or are you going to make
Nagato play all by herself?

154
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,500
[KYON] Do you have to
look so proud of yourself?

155
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,708
Go on. She awaits.

156
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,750
[KYON]
Who are you supposed to be now?

157
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,833
Looks like I've been assigned
as your beach ball partner.

158
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:19,875
[NAGATO]
Oh.

159
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,708
[NAGATO]
Um, okay. Here I go. Ready?

160
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,750
Yeah, ready.

161
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,916
[NAGATO]
There!

162
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,041
[NAGATO]
Got it?

163
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,083
[KYON]
Uh-huh!

164
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:02,750
[KYON]
Uh!

165
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,541
Ah!

166
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,083
Sorry, that was my fault!

167
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,833
It's ok. I don't
mind getting it.

168
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,083
Okay, thanks.

169
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,208
[KYON] Nothing like
some awkward silence

170
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,500
to round out a day at the beach.

171
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,666
How did I talk to Nagato before?

172
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,916
I've been so nervous
around her lately.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,708
Uhh. This isn't
gonna work at all.

174
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,083
The way I'm acting,

175
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,333
it must look like I'd rather
be anywhere but here.

176
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:32,833
I have to act normal.
Act normal. Act normal.

177
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,125
[NAGATO]
I can't believe the two of us

178
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,291
are playing together on
the beach! It's incredible!

179
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,625
Ah! No! If I smile like that,
he'll think I'm weird.

180
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,000
I should act normal. Act normal.

181
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,291
Act normal.

182
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,708
--[NAGATO] Act normal.
--[KYON] Act normal.

183
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,958
--Act normal. Act normal.
--Act normal. Act normal.

184
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,958
[KYON] Act normal.
Act norm-- I can't do it.

185
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,041
[KYON]
Hey, Nagato!

186
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,083
[NAGATO]
Hm?

187
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,583
Let's just head back
to the others.

188
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,208
[KYON'S SISTER]
Kyon! I wanna play!

189
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:07,250
Let! Me! Play!

190
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:07,958
[BOTH gasp]

191
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,000
[thud]

192
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,791
[KYON]
I... didn't... mean to--

193
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,500
To what?

194
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,541
[KYON'S SISTER]
Uhh...

195
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,000
[NAGATO, KYON gasp]

196
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,000
[yelps]

197
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,250
Are you gonna kiss?

198
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,250
N-N-N-N-N-N-No!

199
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,750
You're the one who kicked me!
This is your fault!

200
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,208
[KYON'S SISTER giggling]

201
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,791
[KYON'S SISTER]
You're a naughty boy, Kyon!

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,333
[KYON]
Act Two.

203
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,000
[KYON] We're headed
into the mountains now,

204
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,041
which might require
some explanation.

205
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,291
It was the second night
we spent at the beach house.

206
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,208
We were having
dinner and talking.

207
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,541
[KYON]
A test of courage?

208
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,750
[TSURUYA]
The beach is getting kind of old

209
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,250
and we're still only in
the middle of the break.

210
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,041
So why go there next?

211
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,583
Besides, I know the
perfect place for it.

212
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,250
We can pack up and head there.

213
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,125
Huh? What, like right now?

214
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,125
[TSURUYA]
Hmm.

215
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,416
It's a bit far,
so maybe tomorrow.

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,708
[KYON]
Okay.

217
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,708
A test of courage.
Can you handle it?

218
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,958
Yay! Fun! I wanna
test my courage!

219
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,708
[KYON]
Yeah, you'll be fine.

220
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,791
I can't wait!

221
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,958
Boogey men. Goblins. Demons.

222
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,916
Ghosts and ghouls.
Rabid squirrels.

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,416
It's gonna be so cool!

224
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,750
I'm especially worried
about those rabid squirrels.

225
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,791
[HARUHI] What's the matter?
You look a little pale.

226
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,166
Are you getting scared?

227
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,375
[ASAKURA]
Of course not! W-Why would I be?

228
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,291
Your hand's trembling.

229
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,833
What's the matter?

230
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,458
Have you heard of this place
we're going to? Is it that bad?

231
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,000
[ASAKURA] What happens at this
place that's so terrifying?

232
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,625
[MIKURU]
They just... appear.

233
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,791
I knew it?!

234
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,791
There really are boogey men!

235
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,708
[MIKURU]
No...

236
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,333
[HARUHI]
Ghosts? Ghouls? Demons?

237
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,375
[MIKURU]
Well, actually.

238
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,791
Goblins, yes!
I knew it all along!

239
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,541
[KYON] Haruhi, give her
a chance to finish.

240
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,750
[ASAKURA] Calm down, Miss
Asahina. Here, have some water.

241
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,416
I'm sorry for getting
so freaked out about it.

242
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,333
I was thinking 'bout what
happened last year, and I just--

243
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,041
It'll be okay. I really doubt
there will be any ghosts.

244
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,583
[HARUHI grunts]

245
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,791
But, so you know, Miss Tsuruya
has done everything she can

246
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,833
to make the test scary, so
I hope you're ready for it.

247
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,375
Yeah. Poor Mikuru actually
fainted last year.

248
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,250
It's that bad?

249
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,125
[TSURUYA giggles]

250
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,625
I don't think it's very funny.

251
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,250
You really scared
me, Miss Tsuruya.

252
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,708
[KYON]
What did she do?

253
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,250
Miss Asahina seems traumatized.

254
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,791
[KOIZUMI] She can probably set
up something pretty extravagant

255
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,625
with the money she's got.

256
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,750
[ASAKURA]
I don't wanna be scared.

257
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,791
That's not my idea of fun.

258
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,208
Is that so weird?

259
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,458
[HARUHI]
It's the goblins.

260
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,000
She's pretending it's
not, but I know it is.

261
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,541
Good curry. You mind
if I have some more?

262
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,166
[KYON] She's the only one
still focused on the food.

263
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,958
Well, despite what
Mikuru says, I'm innocent.

264
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,583
I didn't do anything.

265
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,291
[MIKURU] That's not true,
and you know it!

266
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,041
[TSURUYA] Say what
you want. I'm not lying!

267
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,166
[KYON]
Something here's not adding up.

268
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,083
So now, we're headed
to the mountains.

269
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,416
And at the end of this bus ride,

270
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,416
we get to face a
"test of courage".

271
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,833
Whatever that means.

272
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,041
[KOIZUMI]
Wow.

273
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,041
Look at this place.
It's so big.

274
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,958
Yeah, well, doesn't
surprise me much anymore.

275
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,833
The mountains are totally
the best in the summer!

276
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,083
Who wants watermelon?

277
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,166
This is nice,

278
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,666
but I'm kind of starting
to feel like a freeloader.

279
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,041
It seems like we're
always staying

280
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,541
at somebody else's house.

281
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,750
It's not like they're using it.
You really worry too much.

282
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,708
[HARUHI] See, she says it's
fine, so, that means, it's fine!

283
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,208
Kyon! Can we go bug hunting?

284
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,208
[KYON]
Huh?

285
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,708
I wanna go!

286
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,083
[grunting]

287
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,333
Okay, fine. I give, already.

288
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,208
Oh, no! We don't have
bug nets. What a shame.

289
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,208
Never mind.

290
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,875
I wanna live here!
This house has everything!

291
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,583
Including insect cages!

292
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,250
We'll do the test
of courage at night

293
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,875
so there's still time to spare!

294
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,000
Bug hunting sounds fun, too!

295
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,750
Sometimes I think you
can find fun in anything.

296
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,375
We should have a
cicada-catching contest next.

297
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,083
That's totally summery!

298
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,166
[KYON]
So, one word from Haruhi,

299
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,500
and here we are having
a cicada-catching contest.

300
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,583
Aw!

301
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,833
What're you doing?

302
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,000
You have to think like
a cicada to catch 'em!

303
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,333
[KYON]
Seriously?

304
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,166
There!

305
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,708
Hold still, I've almost got you.

306
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,875
Ha, ha! He got away!

307
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,000
I got one!

308
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,708
[TSURUYA]
You're good at this!

309
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,166
[whimpering]

310
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,958
--[TSURUYA laughing]
--[MIKURU screaming]

311
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,541
[HARUHI]
It's huge!

312
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,000
Is that a Hercules beetle?

313
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,625
That's not a cicada
so it doesn't count.

314
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,166
[KYON] We all met back up
to compare bug counts.

315
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,583
And, sure enough, to
absolutely nobody's surprise,

316
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,625
Haruhi was the big winner.

317
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,625
And in last place...

318
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,625
[KYON]
Also to no one's surprise.

319
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,750
Okay! We're splitting
up into pairs.

320
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,250
On a side note,

321
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,458
while no one can question her
enthusiasm about the test,

322
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,916
Kyon's sister fell asleep,
so she won't be participating.

323
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,083
And we can't go off and
leave a little kid alone,

324
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:21,625
so Ryoko offered to skip
the test and stay with her.

325
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,333
Someone had to do it.

326
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,000
[HARUHI]
Nice evade.

327
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,791
All right, we have teams of two.

328
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,416
First up, Koizumi and Haru.

329
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,166
Mikuru and I will be
the all-girl pair.

330
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,625
And, then there's the couple
we've all been waiting for:

331
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,000
Yuki and Kyon.

332
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,291
We're not a couple.

333
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,875
Now then, as for the
route we'll be taking.

334
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,333
You just go straight along
this path and that's it.

335
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,833
There are no lamps or anything,

336
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,541
so we'll have to make
do with moonlight.

337
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,750
Keep going until you
reach the meeting point.

338
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,958
It's gonna be a deep, dark pond.

339
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,375
That's everything. You
know all you need to know.

340
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,041
When we come back,
we'll walk together.

341
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:56,916
So, first up--

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,708
We volunteer to be the first!

343
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,500
If there's supernatural
stuff out there,

344
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,083
I wanna get to it first!

345
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,958
That's fine. Mikuru and I
don't mind going second.

346
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,625
You can soften up whatever
might be waiting for us.

347
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,041
They're out there waiting.

348
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,666
And obviously that leaves
the two of you going last.

349
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,250
[KYON]
All right. Fine by us.

350
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,833
All right, Koizumi you
gotta keep up with me, 'kay?

351
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,333
Get ready to catch at least
two or three ghosts!

352
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,666
[KOIZUMI]
I'll do my best.

353
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,041
It's not all that far
from here, actually.

354
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,458
At that pace,

355
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,541
they'll have some time to
kill when they get there.

356
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,875
That could be dangerous.

357
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,250
When Haruhi's bored, she's
always at her craziest.

358
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,000
Ha. Yeah, she is.

359
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,916
[NAGATO] Just looking
at her is scaring me.

360
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,125
[TSURUYA] That should be enough
of a head start for them.

361
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,083
We'll go ahead and leave now.

362
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,625
Stay here, and then take off
in another five minutes or so,

363
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,500
okay?

364
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,541
[KYON]
Uh-huh.

365
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,791
[TSURUYA]
Here we go!

366
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,833
[MIKURU whimpering]

367
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:07,916
[KYON] Huh, here we go.
More awkward silence.

368
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,666
[KYON] This is like
the beach all over again.

369
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,500
[NAGATO] We're alone again.
Just like at the beach.

370
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,208
[KYON]
Nagato?

371
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,750
[NAGATO]
Huh? Yes?

372
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,958
What Miss Tsuruya did with her
flashlight was kinda scary.

373
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,875
Do you think-- Should
I have said something?

374
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,041
[NAGATO]
Huh?

375
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,041
You know what, never mind.
Forget about it.

376
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,625
[NAGATO]
Maybe you should've.

377
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,166
[KYON]
Yeah, I guess I should've.

378
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,375
[NAGATO]
Yeah.

379
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,041
[KYON] Way to keep the
conversation going, Kyon.

380
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,625
Are you okay? With this
kind of stuff, I mean.

381
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,250
What, like ghosts and
goblins and stuff?

382
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,750
Yeah. You're totally calm,
like it's not fazing you at all.

383
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,125
[NAGATO]
Huh?

384
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,166
Hmm. I'm not really
a fan of scary stuff,

385
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,625
but I guess... it's not
bothering me right now because--

386
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,666
[KYON]
Uh.

387
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,833
Because, I've got you here
to protect me. You know?

388
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,041
[gasps]

389
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:26,750
[NAGATO]
Because--

390
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,083
[KYON]
Uh...

391
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,666
A lot of the horror games I play

392
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,708
are scarier than anything that
exists in real life. You know?

393
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,250
[chuckles] Yeah.

394
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,375
[KYON sighs]

395
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,750
[KYON] What the hell
is wrong with me?

396
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,583
[NAGATO]
Let's go.

397
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,083
[KYON]
Uh, yeah.

398
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,375
[MIKURU screaming]

399
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,250
[KYON]
Huh?

400
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,500
Why are you stopping?

401
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,958
Wait a sec. I thought
I heard something.

402
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:57,708
[MIKURU screaming]

403
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,500
[BOTH gasp]

404
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,000
[MIKURU screaming]

405
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:00,875
That sounds like--

406
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,708
Yeah. Sounds like Miss Asahina.

407
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,625
Something might've happened
to them. Let's hurry!

408
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,333
Are you two okay?

409
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,083
[NAGATO]
Are those?

410
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,791
They... just appeared.

411
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,083
But aren't they...?

412
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,916
[HARUHI]
Fireflies.

413
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,250
Yeah. And a lot of 'em, too.

414
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,541
This pond is actually
famous for its fireflies.

415
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,166
[NAGATO]
How beautiful.

416
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,750
[KYON]
Yeah.

417
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:55,083
[HARUHI] Aw, I thought we were
gonna have a test of courage.

418
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,583
Ghosts, goblins,
boogey men, and demons.

419
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,416
But all we got to see
was a buncha fireflies.

420
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,583
Yeah. Disappointing.

421
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,083
Hold on a sec.

422
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,750
Before, when Miss Asahina
said "they just appear"?

423
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,958
[TSURUYA]
Mh-hm. This is what she meant.

424
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,250
She assumed the fireflies

425
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,625
were some kind of mean
spirits or something.

426
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,708
[KYON] That was last
year, though, right?

427
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,541
Why did she faint again
when she saw them this time?

428
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,375
[TSURUYA giggles]

429
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,666
[TSURUYA]
The thing is,

430
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,458
she still doesn't know
they're only fireflies.

431
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,958
I'm waiting for her to
figure it out on her own.

432
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,500
[KYON] So you were just messing
with us this whole time?

433
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,958
Yeah, a little.

434
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,791
Although, I wasn't the
one acting terrified.

435
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,583
So, how much longer
are you going to wait

436
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,916
before you say something
to her about it?

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,333
[TSURUYA]
Hm.

438
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,708
[KYON]
What? Why are you smirking?

439
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,041
Forget about it.

440
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,250
I'll let you figure this
out on your own, too.

441
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,500
[KYON]
Huh?

442
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:38,000
[NAGATO]
Next episode: "Fireworks."
