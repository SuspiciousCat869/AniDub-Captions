1
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,625
[NAGATO]
It's like I can't tell who I am.

2
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,458
I don't mean that
I lost my memory.

3
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,416
[TAXI DRIVER]
There's a hospital nearby.

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,333
Get in my cab.
I'll take you to--

5
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,958
I'm fine, thank you.
The fall wasn't bad.

6
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,708
It probably looked a lot
worse than it felt.

7
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,208
[NAGATO]
I know my name.

8
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,250
I know that I am Yuki Nagato.

9
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,625
But...

10
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,916
[NAGATO]
At the same time, I'm not.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,208
I don't recognize
my memories as my own.

12
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,791
[doorbell rings]

13
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,250
[ASAKURA]
The rain just won't stop.

14
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:55,000
[ASAKURA] We've got
curry for dinner today.

15
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,375
[NAGATO]
I know her.

16
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,208
Her name is Ryoko Asakura.

17
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,833
She's my friend.

18
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,708
Yuki Nagato's friend.

19
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,958
[ASAKURA]
You know,

20
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,166
this curry would be good
with a pickle relish.

21
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,208
I could whip one up now,
if we have any pickles.

22
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,208
Hm? Is something wrong?

23
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,166
[ASAKURA] What? You almost
got hit by a car?

24
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,875
[NAGATO]
She's a little like a mother,

25
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,208
helping Yuki out
with everyday things.

26
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,416
[ASAKURA]
You're hurt!

27
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,666
I'm okay.

28
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,458
No! I can see your injuries.

29
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,375
You should undress.
Are there more?

30
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,125
[NAGATO]
She can be pushy.

31
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,166
[NAGATO]
You're overreacting.

32
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,166
[ASAKURA]
"Overreacting"?

33
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,416
I am not overreacting!

34
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,958
Yeah, okay, the car
didn't actually hit you,

35
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,750
and you're just a
little banged up.

36
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,458
[NAGATO]
Whatever her flaws,

37
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,041
she's genuinely
concerned for me.

38
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,416
You're right. I'm sorry.

39
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,083
[NAGATO] Or rather, she's
genuinely concerned for Yuki.

40
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,791
[NAGATO]
But that... isn't me.

41
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,875
[doorbell rings]

42
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,916
[KYON]
Morning!

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,791
[ASAKURA]
Good morning!

44
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,958
[inaudible]

45
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,458
[NAGATO]
I know him.

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,166
[NAGATO]
I know that boy.

47
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,125
[KYON]
What book are you reading?

48
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:15,666
[KYON]
Le M-Me-Mys-Mystere de la--

49
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,791
Right. Looks good.

50
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,791
[NAGATO] I don't really
know how to talk to him.

51
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,833
It feels sort of awkward.

52
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,125
I know how Yuki
feels about him,

53
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,166
but I'm not sure what
to do about that.

54
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,000
You know, I heard
about yesterday.

55
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,083
Sounds rough.

56
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,833
[gasps]

57
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,875
[NAGATO]
Did Asakura tell you?

58
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,208
[KYON]
Hm? Well, yeah.

59
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,666
[NAGATO] While I'm aware
of Yuki's feelings for him,

60
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,208
my current self cannot
actually feel them.

61
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,208
[NAGATO]
Oh.

62
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,208
So, how are you feeling?

63
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,000
[NAGATO] Although,
from the way he behaves,

64
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,833
I can tell that he
cares about me, too.

65
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,500
[KYON]
Uh, what's the matter?

66
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,583
[NAGATO]
Just to be sure.

67
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,625
[NAGATO]
Are you worried about me?

68
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,333
What kind of question is that?

69
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,416
Of course I am!

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,375
[NAGATO]
He's just a nice person.

71
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,750
There's no special
meaning behind this.

72
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,708
But, I think...

73
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,375
Uh--

74
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,791
[NAGATO] It's this side
of his personality

75
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,875
that Yuki is the
most attracted to.

76
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,333
[NAGATO] Nothing around me is
any different than before.

77
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, what do you think of it?

78
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,958
Should we add a
little more cheese?

79
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,958
No, this is fine.

80
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,958
Yeah?

81
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,291
[NAGATO] We're eating dinner
just like we always do.

82
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,958
But...

83
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,500
[NAGATO]
I don't think it's silly.

84
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,000
It's nice of you
to worry about me.

85
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,833
[ASAKURA] Well, that's
what friends are for.

86
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:14,583
[NAGATO] But I'm not her.
I'm not the same Yuki as before.

87
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,458
[ASAKURA]
Actually...

88
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,708
[ASAKURA]
There is just one more thing.

89
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,916
Who are you?
And where's Nagato?

90
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,083
[NAGATO]
Another thing about her.

91
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,708
She's very perceptive.

92
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,041
In a way, you're still Nagato.

93
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,208
But in a way, not.

94
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,291
I can feel you're
a different person.

95
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,166
Can you explain what's going on?

96
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,375
Because I don't understand.

97
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:53,750
I'm very sorry. I wish I could
make sense of it. Truly.

98
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,375
But I don't know
who I am, either.

99
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,000
From what I can tell,

100
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,708
it doesn't seem like the
same thing as memory loss.

101
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,666
It feels like I'm reading
someone else's diary.

102
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,875
While I have the memories,

103
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,708
they don't feel like
my own experiences.

104
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,708
But, since I remember all
the same things Yuki does,

105
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,958
I can pretend to be
her easily enough.

106
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,416
Just because you can pretend
doesn't mean you should.

107
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,541
Why didn't you explain
this to me earlier?

108
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,375
I'm sure it isn't too late
to get you some help.

109
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,166
Let's go to the hospital.

110
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,125
I don't want to.

111
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,666
But why not?

112
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,208
You see me as abnormal.

113
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,750
I'm not the version of Yuki
Nagato that you've come to know.

114
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,791
[gasps]

115
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,875
To you, I'm
essentially a stranger.

116
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,166
But, what about me?

117
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,583
Am I just supposed to accept
that I'm abnormal somehow?

118
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:52,208
If I do that, I'm lost.
If I do that, I'm totally alone.

119
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,041
And that scares me.

120
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,458
So I'll just be normal.

121
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,041
You're right, I'm sorry.

122
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,416
I didn't think about how this
must be making you feel.

123
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,541
Well, anyway.

124
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,916
I think it's better that
we talked about it.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,291
The longer we let it go on,

126
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,666
the more complicated
it would have become.

127
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,500
I guess I'll just treat you
like I always have, then.

128
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,916
Right, Nagato?

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,416
Yes, if that's okay.

130
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,208
Well, it is true that I'd like
to have the old Nagato back.

131
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,958
She is my friend, after all.

132
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:28,000
But that doesn't mean I should
reject the person you are now.

133
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,458
You're having a hard time.

134
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,166
I understand that you're
confused and scared.

135
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,291
So, you're the person
I should be helping.

136
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,166
The current version of Nagato.

137
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,041
Thank you for that.

138
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,875
But, even so.

139
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,916
Maybe... we can
skip school tomorrow

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,333
and go to the hospital instead?

141
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,916
You might feel okay now,

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,291
but I still think you should get
checked out, just to be sure.

143
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,500
I'm not rejecting you.

144
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,708
I just wanna know
you're healthy.

145
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,916
That's okay. I'll go.

146
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,875
I'm not scared now.

147
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,541
[DOCTOR] I see some light
abrasions on your head,

148
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,041
but no abnormality
in your brain.

149
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,083
Certainly nothing that
seems life-threatening.

150
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,791
Well, that's good to hear!

151
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,625
[DOCTOR] I think the
symptoms you described are

152
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,083
a temporary dysmnesia

153
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,958
caused by having received
a substantial shock,

154
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,000
but I can't be sure
without further observation.

155
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,583
We'll hospitalize you
for the week and--

156
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,083
Excuse me.

157
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,541
Do you think you could treat
her without hospitalization?

158
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,416
She's been able to live
her normal life just fine,

159
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,666
and I can stay nearby
in case something happens

160
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,958
or she needs me for anything.

161
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,333
I think that'll be better,

162
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,500
if we act like things
are still normal.

163
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,916
[DOCTOR sighs]

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,958
All right, we can keep an
eye on her at home, then.

165
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,541
We appreciate it, thanks!

166
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,416
[DOCTOR] It's not like being
hospitalized is a cure-all.

167
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,208
And she'll probably
feel more comfortable

168
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,250
being close to a friend.

169
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,083
[DOCTOR]
Here's the plan:

170
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,833
Your brain organizes
your memories

171
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,666
while you're asleep at night.

172
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,541
So make sure you sleep well.

173
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,000
Eat well, too.

174
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,750
Try to be patient
and take it easy.

175
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,000
[ASAKURA sighs]
That was nerve-wracking!

176
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,041
How are you? Did you
hold up all right?

177
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,041
It helped having
you with me.

178
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,916
That's sweet of you!

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,375
Well, time to tell him.

180
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,083
[KYON]
What?

181
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,250
Her personality just changed?

182
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,500
I understand this might be
difficult for you to accept.

183
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,541
But... Hey, what're you doing?

184
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,250
Hey, Nagato, think I
could borrow your game?

185
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,708
[NAGATO]
I don't have it with me.

186
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,958
You're not kidding!
She's totally different!

187
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,958
You didn't need
much convincing!

188
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,541
Well, honestly.

189
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,750
I've been feeling like there was
something wrong since yesterday.

190
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,333
Didn't expect this, though.

191
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,000
[ASAKURA] It might be sort of
inconvenient for a little while.

192
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,041
Nah, I think it'll be fine.

193
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,583
But are you sure you're
okay to come to school?

194
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,250
I mean, it seems like it
might be kind of difficult.

195
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,291
[ASAKURA]
Huh?

196
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,875
[KYON]
Well...

197
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,250
I'm thinking about this from the
current Nagato's perspective.

198
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,375
If she's coming to school,
that means she has to keep

199
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,125
pretending to be
the old Nagato, right?

200
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,708
And pretending to
be someone else

201
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,625
sounds like it could
get pretty exhausting.

202
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,375
Do you think you can do it?

203
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,833
[NAGATO]
I've been thinking about this.

204
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,208
And even if I'm not
the Yuki I was before,

205
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,166
that doesn't change the
fact that I'm still Yuki.

206
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,375
I wanna be normal.

207
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,833
Fair enough!

208
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,583
Well, now we have to tell
Miss Suzumiya and Koizumi.

209
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,791
But I don't think
they'll be here today.

210
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,291
[KYON]
Oh, yeah.

211
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,375
They said they wouldn't be
coming for a while, actually.

212
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,500
Something about refresher
classes before finals.

213
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,666
[ASAKURA]
Ah, yes.

214
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,458
The pressures of being
in a prep school.

215
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,208
[KYON] She said we'd better
be ready for when they're done,

216
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,250
though, because she's got lots
of "fun" plans for the summer.

217
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,541
Let's not forget, we've
got exams to take, too.

218
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,958
A little quiet time is probably
exactly what we need.

219
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:05,041
Oh! I didn't think to ask
you about your classes.

220
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,625
Have you been able
to follow them so far?

221
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,208
It's been fine.

222
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,875
I may not feel like the personal
memories that I have are mine,

223
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,000
but knowledge is knowledge,
so classes aren't a problem.

224
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,291
I shouldn't be too much
trouble for you.

225
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,208
[sighs]

226
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,708
And I won't do anything
to embarrass the old Yuki

227
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,750
or ruin her academic standing,

228
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,375
if that's what
you're worried about.

229
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,708
[ASAKURA]
Oh, um, I--

230
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,000
[ASAKURA] Is that really
what she thought

231
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,208
I was trying to get at?

232
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,625
Oh, no! That's not
what I was saying.

233
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,500
I'm not worried!

234
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,000
[KYON]
It was just a misunderstanding.

235
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,541
Don't worry about it.

236
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,791
Thanks for saying so.

237
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,833
And even more,
thanks for Nagato.

238
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,041
[KYON]
Hm?

239
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,791
For accepting the fact
that she's changed.

240
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,250
She was afraid to
say anything at first.

241
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,833
I guess she was worried she
might end up alone if she did.

242
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,875
What do you mean "alone"?

243
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,125
She probably figured we would
get all distant from her

244
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,708
if we knew.

245
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,833
We are a little thrown off, but
how could we not be, you know?

246
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,500
[sighs]

247
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,125
You should stop getting
so worked up, though.

248
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,666
Now, I'm not saying that's
going to be easy for you to do.

249
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,166
But you should try.

250
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,958
You're too worried about her.

251
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,541
I bet she can sense that,

252
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,375
and it's making her even more
nervous than she already was.

253
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,250
Stop acting like it's only me.

254
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,125
You're every bit
as worried as I am.

255
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,333
You might as well admit it.

256
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,500
[KYON]
Pot, kettle. Kettle, pot.

257
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,833
Nice to meet you.

258
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,916
[ASAKURA] Stop it, what do
you think we should do?

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,208
More than anything,

260
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,791
I want her to go back
to being her old self,

261
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,916
but I don't wanna just
abandon the current Nagato.

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,625
Well, we'll keep being
her friends, then.

263
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,125
Was it even a question?

264
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,291
Of course we're going to!

265
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,500
[door clicks]

266
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,000
[KYON]
You want something to drink?

267
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,750
I'll even let you choose.
I've got tea or, uh...

268
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,250
Huh.

269
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,458
[NAGATO]
Huh?

270
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,750
Uh, sorry to interrupt.
Maybe you're not thirsty.

271
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,250
You don't mind if I have one?

272
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,375
[KYON]
Of course not!

273
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,333
[NAGATO]
Then, I'll take the tea.

274
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,375
[KYON]
You really like books, huh?

275
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,083
[NAGATO]
Yes. I enjoy reading.

276
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,000
[KYON]
Yeah, I noticed.

277
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,250
Maybe you'd like to go
to the library sometime.

278
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,541
[KYON]
Hmm? You okay?

279
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,125
[NAGATO]
That sounds nice.

280
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,291
Great!

281
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,291
We'll have a library
day. It's a promise.

282
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:55,791
[alarm beeps]

283
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,166
[NAGATO]
I had a dream.

284
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,958
But I don't remember it.

285
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,083
I have no idea
what it was about.

286
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,041
[doorbell rings]

287
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,166
Good morning. How are
you, sleepy-head?

288
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,291
I stayed up really
late last night.

289
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,625
I guess it's books
now instead of games.

290
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,083
Maybe you're just meant
to be a night owl.

291
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,750
I'll get a nice
breakfast ready for us.

292
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,250
You go wash your face.

293
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,958
[NAGATO]
Okay, thanks.

294
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,208
[ASAKURA] How many pieces
of toast would you like?

295
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,041
[NAGATO]
Just one, please.

296
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,166
[ASAKURA]
I'll take care of the dishes.

297
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,583
You can go change.

298
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,750
Okay.

299
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,458
[stomach growls]

300
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,125
[ASAKURA]
Mm?

301
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,958
[ASAKURA] I'll take care of the
dishes and make some more toast.

302
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,166
You can go change.

303
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,958
[NAGATO]
'Kay.

304
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,416
[ASAKURA chuckles]

305
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,791
Well, I guess her
appetite's the same.

306
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,333
[KYON]
Well, I made it.

307
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,500
[ASAKURA]
Hm? You were almost late.

308
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,291
That's been happening
a lot lately.

309
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,375
I've been working really
hard for the exams.

310
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,750
[ASAKURA]
Oh?

311
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,791
You don't seem worried,
though, honor student.

312
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,291
Must be nice.

313
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,041
Well, I have to work really
hard to look this confident,

314
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,750
so I've got a lot
of stress stored up

315
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,875
that you may not see at first.

316
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,000
But, I do have my limits,
and when I get there,

317
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,250
it's not too pretty.

318
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,458
Oh, yeah? What's gonna happen?

319
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,583
[ASAKURA]
No way to know.

320
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,416
One day the pressure
will make me snap.

321
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,291
Maybe I'll come up and
stab you from behind.

322
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,666
Okay, you're starting
to freak me out.

323
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,375
But listen, should we
be worried about Nagato?

324
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,541
With classes? You
heard her yesterday.

325
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,458
She says she's doing fine.

326
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,000
We're just going to
have to trust her.

327
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,875
It's just that we have PE today.

328
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,541
[ASAKURA] Hm. That could
present a problem.

329
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,208
We'll have to keep an
extra-close eye on her!

330
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,416
[chuckles nervously]

331
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,791
[TEACHER] So, who would
like to solve this for us?

332
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,666
Nagato, come on up.

333
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,333
Okay.

334
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,750
[ASAKURA, KYON]
Uh-oh!

335
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,208
[ASAKURA] I was worried about
whether she could follow

336
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,125
what the teachers were saying.

337
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,041
[KYON] But I didn't think
about this possibility!

338
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:28,166
It becomes "boingy"
then "tight-ish"!

339
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,666
--Get ready.
--Right.

340
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,500
So what's our plan
if this goes south?

341
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,541
[NAGATO]
There, I'm finished.

342
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,708
[TEACHER]
Yep, that's right.

343
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,166
[ASAKURA, KYON]
Huh?

344
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,958
What's wrong with
you two? Sit back down.

345
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,958
Impressive! That
was a good time.

346
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:57,625
Huh. I always thought of Nagato
as a slower-moving sorta girl,

347
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,333
but that looked pretty fast.

348
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:03,208
Oh. She's a speed demon.

349
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,583
I did something wrong?

350
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,750
[ASAKURA]
Huh? What're you talking about?

351
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,708
[NAGATO] You're giving me
that worried look again.

352
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,291
[chuckles] Am I
really that obvious?

353
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,041
I am, aren't I?

354
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,291
[NAGATO]
Yes, a little.

355
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,333
I'm sorry. I'm trying
not to worry, I promise,

356
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,958
but it's pretty
difficult for me.

357
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,583
You ran really well,
though, so good job!

358
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,333
[NAGATO]
Thank you.

359
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,625
I guess we didn't have anything
to worry about after all.

360
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,500
That's good.

361
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,916
Yeah, it is.

362
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,916
And I don't think anybody's
noticed the difference.

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,166
Even so.

364
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,208
I could probably stand
to be more authentic.

365
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,541
--[ASAKURA] Huh?
--[KYON] Hm?

366
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,541
Ahhh!

367
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,166
Um, are you okay?

368
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,166
[KYON]
What the heck was that?

369
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,875
[NAGATO] That's something
Yuki says a lot.

370
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,791
It's one of the memories
of hers that I have.

371
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,041
Ahhh!

372
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,458
[chuckles]

373
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,708
Um, you did a good job answering
that math question, too.

374
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,875
Clear and concise.

375
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,166
I knew I could do math, easily.

376
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,833
But I didn't think I could
explain well if I was called on,

377
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,916
so I read the textbook and
reviewed some of the problems.

378
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,291
That was a good idea.

379
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,875
[ASAKURA]
A textbook.

380
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,625
Was that what she was
up so late reading?

381
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,750
She's really trying
not to let it show,

382
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:26,708
but she's doing her best to
play the part of Yuki Nagato.

383
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,333
That was a delicious lunch.

384
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:32,333
[stomach growls]

385
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,875
[ASAKURA, KYON]
Huh?

386
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,333
Here. If you want,
you can have some of mine.

387
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,791
I'll make some more next time.

388
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,333
And the same goes for breakfast.

389
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,666
I'm happy to do it.

390
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,333
I like cooking, so don't
ever hesitate to ask.

391
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,458
Oh, um, it's not like that.

392
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,833
Oh?

393
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,583
I was too embarrassed
to ask you.

394
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,583
That's understandable.

395
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,958
Asakura can be very
judgmental sometimes.

396
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,958
[ASAKURA]
What? Really?

397
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

398
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:13,000
[KYON]
Hm... Huh? Huh?!

399
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,625
Argh! I'll never
understand this!

400
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,000
Studying?

401
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,750
Yeah, exams and all.

402
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,125
[NAGATO]
Can I see?

403
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,583
Sure.

404
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:31,250
[NAGATO] You just have to bring
this number over here. See?

405
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,500
That's amazing! Thank you!

406
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,000
So, how about this one?

407
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,791
[NAGATO] You just need to solve
this part, then this one.

408
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:38,666
[KYON]
Nice!

409
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay, okay! Do this one next!

410
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:41,875
[NAGATO]
Like this.

411
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,541
[KYON]
Oooohhh!

412
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,125
Heh, heh, heh.
This is excellent.

413
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,291
I can just have Nagato
teach me everything.

414
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,583
I won't have to endure
Asakura's dirty looks anymore

415
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,541
whenever I ask her for
help with my homework.

416
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,083
[NAGATO]
He's up to something.

417
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,000
Still. It's nice
that he wants my help.

418
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,041
It feels good.

419
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,375
Oh. I didn't know
you guys were still here.

420
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,666
With exams coming up,

421
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,583
club activities are
cancelled, starting today.

422
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,000
[KYON]
Huh?

423
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,541
The teacher should've told
you about it in homeroom.

424
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,833
What are you waiting
for? Get goin'.

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,166
You didn't know?

426
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,541
I didn't.

427
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,750
I was actually reading
a book during homeroom.

428
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,458
[KYON] And I was just
sort of spacing out.

429
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,166
Guess that explains
why Asakura didn't come.

430
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,291
Weird that she didn't
mention it, though.

431
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,083
[NAGATO]
Grocery shopping usually takes

432
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,833
all of her attention
after school.

433
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,458
[KYON]
Yeah, that's true.

434
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,875
Not sure what to do now.

435
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,416
There are more problems
I wanted to ask about.

436
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,416
It would be easier if we
could just use the clubroom.

437
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,791
[NAGATO]
There's your promise.

438
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,208
[KYON]
My promise?

439
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,625
You said we'd
go to the library.

440
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,333
We could go now.

441
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,958
Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

442
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,500
Now's the perfect time.

443
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,000
Okay, let's go!

444
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,750
[NAGATO]
Next episode:

445
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,833
"The Disappearance of
Nagato Yuki Part II."
