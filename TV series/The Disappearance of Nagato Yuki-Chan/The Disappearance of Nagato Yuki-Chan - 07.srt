00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,708
[ASAKURA grumbles]

2
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,583
[HARUHI]
Attention!

3
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,500
The club's going
to a hot spring!

4
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,000
That's where our
training camp is gonna be.

5
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,291
[KYON]
Wait, what's going on?

6
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,458
[HARUHI]
Here!

7
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,541
[KYON]
And this is...?

8
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,208
"The North High Literary Club

9
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,833
and Kouyouen Academy
Joint Training Camp."

10
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,166
This says it's a trip journal?

11
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,416
What is this? Like a guidebook?

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,625
[KYON] Man, look at this.
It's really elaborate.

13
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,291
[KOIZUMI] Looks like it's
even got a step-by-step

14
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,166
description of our route.

15
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,333
A hot spring sounds nice!

16
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,750
Look at that price, though.

17
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,958
Not sure I trust
someplace so inexpensive.

18
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,125
Oh yeah, I know.

19
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,250
[cackles]

20
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,208
Miss Tsuruya's family
has rooms at the inn

21
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,750
they rent throughout the year,
so we got 'em on the cheap.

22
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,125
[KYON]
I've got a question.

23
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,583
Now what?

24
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,416
[KYON] This is supposed to
be like a guidebook, right?

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,916
What's this?

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,083
Because it looks like it's a
report on how the trip went.

27
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,583
Well, look at that.
Yeah, it sure does.

28
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,916
Whoa! It's got my
thoughts in it!

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,541
Hey, What's going on here?

30
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:27,333
[chuckles] It's not my fault
you got the wrong idea.

31
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,166
I never said it was a guidebook.

32
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,916
Well, tell us what
it really is, then.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
It's the report on our camp.

34
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,875
The one we'll submit to
our respective schools.

35
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,458
We can't just say,
"We went on a trip

36
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,541
and it was great!"
Things don't work like that.

37
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,500
We're the Literary Club, right?

38
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,041
So it's only appropriate that
we create a written report

39
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,750
to turn in when we're done.

40
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,708
It'll prove how much we've
grown as a result of our trip.

41
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,416
Academic growth
is the whole point

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,458
of this little
getaway, after all!

43
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,125
At least, that's what
I told our schools

44
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,708
when I was getting permission.

45
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,375
I thought my arm
was gonna fall off

46
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,666
making those for everyone.

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,041
Only you. Really. Only you.

48
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,041
[sighs] If we have
to submit a report,

49
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,666
shouldn't we all work
together to write it

50
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,041
after the training camp?

51
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,958
You don't get it, do you?

52
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,500
All right, let me see if
I can make this clearer.

53
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,375
Take summer homework
for example.

54
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,416
You end up dreading it
over your whole vacation,

55
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,166
which totally ruins your fun.

56
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,666
However, take care of it first,
and the problem's solved!

57
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,708
So that's precisely what I did!

58
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,416
So now this trip can be
all about having fun.

59
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,583
Ya got that? F-U-N!

60
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,208
You have so much energy.

61
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,291
Have you ever
thought about doing

62
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,708
something productive with it?

63
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,958
[laughs] That's Miss Suzumiya.

64
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,833
It's all part of what makes
her so charming, ya know?

65
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,458
I feel bad.

66
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,875
You did everything.

67
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,666
Planned the whole trip,
wrote reports for everybody...

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm supposed to
be the president.

69
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,000
And what did I do?

70
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,125
[HARUHI]
Seriously.

71
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,500
Why do you always have
to be such a downer?

72
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,083
I did this because I wanted to.

73
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,541
I mean, why else would I do it?

74
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,708
It's not like I had to.
So we're good now, right?

75
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,916
Huh?

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,833
I'd listen to her
if I were you.

77
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,458
If she didn't feel like
doing it, she would have

78
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,708
no problem dumping it
on the rest of us.

79
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,208
Wait a minute! That's enough!

80
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,708
Anyway, I figure there's
a good chance our teachers

81
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,875
will ask about the reports
later, so you'll wanna

82
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,750
be sure to read your own
so you'll know what you wrote.

83
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,041
Well, I'm off to give these

84
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,291
to Miss Tsuruya
and Miss Asahina.

85
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,750
Oh. Hold on,
I'll come with you.

86
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,083
I need to say thank
you to Miss Tsuruya.

87
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,916
Yeah, good idea. I'll come, too.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,333
Well, in that case,
maybe we should all go.

89
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,041
[ASAKURA] She's in the
middle of club activities.

90
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,000
We don't need to send a
whole parade of people.

91
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,875
The two of us can
thank her for everyone.

92
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:48,958
It'll be fine.

93
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,250
Good point. We'll
wait here, then.

94
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,416
[ASAKURA]
Cool.

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,666
[HARUHI]
What? Whoa, you're kidding!

96
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,083
He was feeding Yuki?

97
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,458
I didn't realize they had
become that much closer!

98
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,666
I also saw them in
each other's arms.

99
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,000
No way!

100
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,666
Well, let's remember who
we're talking about here.

101
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,125
Knowing those two,
I'd say there's a pretty

102
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,041
decent chance that
it was an accident.

103
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,458
Yeah. Knowing them,
that is a possibility.

104
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,916
So that could be a fluke.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,708
Just something to
think about, I guess.

106
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,833
What I'm really concerned
about is him feeding her.

107
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,250
[HARUHI] But that seems
more harmless than him

108
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,250
grabbing her or them
getting all snuggly.

109
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,708
[ASAKURA] More of a
friendly gesture, maybe.

110
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,291
But what if it wasn't?

111
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,291
I mean, it could
have been anything.

112
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,791
[HARUHI]
I guess.

113
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,583
[ASAKURA] If they announced
they were officially dating,

114
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,041
I wouldn't be so worried
about that, you know?

115
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,208
That's not true, I would!

116
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,833
[HARUHI]
That sounds more like you.

117
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:48,625
[ASAKURA] Ah. Maybe this trip
isn't such a good idea.

118
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,625
To them, it could be less
of an academic trip

119
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,041
and more of a chance to
spend quality time together.

120
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,625
[ASAKURA] What do I do
if they get caught up

121
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,791
and cross the line?

122
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,041
It'll be fine.

123
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,916
[ASAKURA]
Don't forget: this is them!

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,291
They could go into the
coed bath by mistake.

125
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,583
[HARUHI]
That's not gonna happen.

126
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,833
[ASAKURA]
Oh, no!

127
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,250
What if they get into
the same bed by mistake?

128
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,458
[HARUHI]
Relax!

129
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,250
I got separate rooms
for the guys and girls.

130
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,666
[ASAKURA]
What if they go out stargazing?

131
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,833
Would that really
even be a mistake?

132
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,458
It's the kind of thing
that only happens

133
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,541
in romantic comedies, but with
them, it could really happen!

134
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,958
I promise: it's serious!

135
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,750
[HARUHI] Just sounds like
foreshadowing to me.

136
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,583
[ASAKURA] Maybe I am getting
a little too worked up, here.

137
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,291
Now that I think
about it calmly,

138
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,666
the answer is actually simple.

139
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,833
Huh?

140
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,166
I'll just watch them
without them knowing

141
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,625
and make sure they behave.
It's as easy as that!

142
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,875
Isn't that called stalking?

143
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,208
Nagato and Kyon deserve
to have a relationship

144
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,208
that is pure and beautiful.

145
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,750
And we're gonna make sure
that happens, aren't we?

146
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,666
[HARUHI] Hey, hold on!
Since when am I part of it?

147
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,666
All right! I feel
much better now.

148
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,458
Hey! Come back here!
Ugh. What's with her?

149
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,541
So be it then.

150
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,500
I guess it'll be a different
sorta training camp.

151
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,541
[HARUHI]
Here's your ticket.

152
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,458
[NAGATO]
Oh, thank you.

153
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,791
So where's everybody else?

154
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,958
[ASAKURA]
I'm back! Good!

155
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,958
Looks like more people
have joined us.

156
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,916
[HARUHI]
What'd you run to the store for?

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,125
What'd you get, some snacks?

158
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,666
Better than that!
Anti-bacterial wipes.

159
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,083
Is that all? Yech.

160
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,000
[TSURUYA]
Heya!

161
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,666
[KOIZUMI] Looks like all
the ladies are here now.

162
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,041
I'm so sorry we're late.

163
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,416
Have you been waiting
for very long?

164
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,166
Nah! You guys are fine,
nothin' to worry about.

165
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,166
Kyon's still not
here, of course.

166
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,125
Hey!

167
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,333
[HARUHI]
You're late!

168
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,791
[KYON panting]
I'm sorry!

169
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,833
Pay the price!

170
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,208
Come on.

171
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,833
It took me forever to
shake off my little sister.

172
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:02,333
No excuses. You can't get
away without a penalty.

173
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,500
Kyon's treating us, everyone.

174
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,041
[gags, coughs]

175
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,708
Always in such a rush, Haruhi.

176
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,208
That's how you end up
getting burned.

177
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,625
I'll take care of this.

178
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,500
So, anyway--

179
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,375
[coughs]

180
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,833
Just take a second and breathe.

181
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,125
[HARUHI]
The reason why we came here--

182
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,583
[coughs]

183
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,083
[sighs] Now, what was I saying?

184
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,791
Oh, yeah, I remember.

185
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,458
Our destination is in the
middle of the mountains.

186
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,958
We're going to be spending
a long time on the train,

187
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,666
so we need to
think this through.

188
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,333
What's really important?

189
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,083
I'll tell ya what's important!

190
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,166
Who sits with who.

191
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,458
That kind of thing
can really affect

192
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,958
how enjoyable the trip will be.

193
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,208
[gasps]

194
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,958
So, I propose the
following: Tadah!

195
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,666
We'll draw sticks to
determine the seating.

196
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,875
She could be right.
It is a long trip.

197
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,125
What are you waiting
for? Start pickin'!

198
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,625
[KYON]
What'd you do? Color-code them?

199
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,041
Yeah! That should be
clear enough, right?

200
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,041
[KYON] Okay, I'll take
this one.

201
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,166
It's red.

202
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,208
[ASAKURA]
This may appear to be about

203
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,916
seating arrangements,
Nagato. But!

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,333
For a girl in love, it's so
much more! This is your chance!

205
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,166
[ASAKURA] You could be
sitting a few inches away

206
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,666
from him the whole time!
What more could you ask for?

207
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,041
No pressure, but the
lot that you select now

208
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,708
could very well determine
your entire future.

209
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,958
[HARUHI]
Okay, your turn, Yuki!

210
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,958
[gasps]

211
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,208
Pick one.

212
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,750
Whoa. I wonder what that is.

213
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,875
Oh, I don't know, Miss Asahina.
I wish I could tell you.

214
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,250
[TSURUYA] Where? What're
you talkin' about?

215
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,750
Show me! Show me!

216
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,916
[KOIZUMI] Oh. That over there?
It's an apple orchard.

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,208
[TSURUYA]
Oh, yeah?

218
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, I guess the randomness
is the whole point

219
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,416
of drawing lots, huh?

220
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,958
Yeah, trying to pick a certain
one doesn't really work.

221
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,666
Wha--? You mean me?

222
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,625
No, I... I wasn't doing that.

223
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,833
And I'm not
thinking things like:

224
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,666
"I wish I was sitting
next to him," or

225
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,875
"We could've talked so much."

226
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,125
--[NAGATO] Or...
--Emotional eating?

227
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,250
Nope. That never even
crossed my mind at all.

228
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,291
Nagato. Nagato?

229
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,041
Looks good. Could I have some?

230
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah.

231
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,375
Here you go.

232
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,000
Cool. Thank you.

233
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,375
Look at that.

234
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,708
I guess she is sort of sitting
next to him, after all.

235
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,625
[TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENT]
Now boarding Nagano.

236
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,333
[KOIZUMI] Nice to be out
of that train, huh?

237
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,750
Feels good to stretch! Okay!

238
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,291
It's time to have fun!

239
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,916
Well, we're here. So now what?

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,500
Do we go straight
to the hot spring?

241
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,083
How far is the inn from here?

242
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,166
Jeez.

243
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,750
Did you even look
at the guidebook?

244
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,291
The inn is set deep in the
heart of the mountains!

245
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,291
So we'll switch to
a van for this leg.

246
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,041
Really?

247
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,416
More traveling?

248
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,791
You wrote that thing.
So, why are you surprised?

249
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,875
I'm not surprised. I'm just
really tired of traveling.

250
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,583
Well, we have some time until

251
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,083
the inn's shuttle gets here.
Anyone want to explore?

252
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,208
[KYON] What're we gonna
do with our bags

253
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,958
while we walk around?

254
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,500
Let me help you with that.

255
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,083
Oh, thank you.

256
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,750
[KYON]
I'll take yours.

257
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh. Thank you so much.

258
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,000
[KYON]
All right. We're all set.

259
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,125
Looks like it.

260
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,625
What do you think
we should do first?

261
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,583
Uh, I don't know.

262
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,375
[stomach growls]

263
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,125
[ALL but NAGATO]
Huh?

264
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,458
[KYON]
Well, with all this traveling,

265
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,583
we need all the fuel we can get.

266
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,125
This is really good!

267
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,166
[NAGATO]
Yup!

268
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,250
So the van's coming
to pick us up

269
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,666
some time around dusk?

270
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,875
And, according to
the guidebook,

271
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,291
we're supposed to be visiting a
temple that's nearby until then.

272
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,875
It's not the most
exciting thing.

273
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,416
But yeah, that's what
everybody does.

274
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,666
Here, take a look.

275
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,625
This temple is one of
those places people call

276
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,416
"power spots."

277
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
[HARUHI]
What's that?

278
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,333
One of the keirakuhiko
vital points?

279
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,208
"How many hits in the vital
points until you die?"

280
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,500
Power spots are spiritual.

281
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,375
Supposedly, they give you
energy if you visit them.

282
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,083
[HARUHI] You get some
kind of mystical power

283
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,291
just by going there? That's
so totally ridiculous!

284
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,875
Who would believe
that kinda thing?

285
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,083
I mean really, come on!

286
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,791
So, Koizumi. Will
you come with me?

287
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,083
I can't not check out
something called a power spot.

288
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,041
I mean, it's not like I believe
in all that mystical stuff.

289
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,541
Sure. I'm happy to come along.

290
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,125
It's always something
with her, huh?

291
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay guys, then we're off!
We'll see you up there!

292
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,250
[ASAKURA]
Hey! Slow down a second!

293
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,833
[EMPLOYEE A]
Thanks, have a nice day!

294
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,708
I don't think she
understands the concept

295
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,916
of traveling in a group.

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,791
[KYON] Just accept it.
That's how she is.

297
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,541
And Koizumi can't ever say
no to her, either, so.

298
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,916
[ASAKURA sighs]

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,458
[TSURUYA] Well, we know
where she's headed, anyway.

300
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,125
[KYON] Let's not worry
about her for now.

301
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,458
[ASAKURA]
Yeah, you're right.

302
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,916
We should do some sightseeing
while we're here.

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,541
Oh? Looks like that's
Zenkoji Temple.

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,041
[laughs nervously]

305
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,250
[MIKURU] Do those Nio statues
freak out anybody else,

306
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,583
or is it just me?

307
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,208
[HARUHI] Hmph. I guess
they're pretty impressive,

308
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,250
lookin' all fierce like that.

309
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,166
But, fierce or not, those guys
have got nothin' on me.

310
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,041
Yep, those statues
can not touch you.

311
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,041
You're competing against
statues now? For what?

312
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,416
Ah! What am I thinking?
We're wasting time! Power spot!

313
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,833
Power spot! Power spot!

314
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,500
[KOIZUMI]
You've already got your wish.

315
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,125
This entire temple is
considered to be a power spot.

316
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:17,875
So, there's--

317
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,958
[HARUHI
 We're goin' in!

318
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,916
[KOIZUMI]
Right behind you!

319
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,208
[KYON]
Godspeed.

320
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,500
Wow. There are a lot
of shops around here.

321
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,750
So which should we visit?

322
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,166
Well, they've got food stalls.

323
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,541
We could eat something.

324
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,875
[ASAKURA] Hmm. I don't know
if I'm hungry again yet.

325
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,583
[KYON] Yeah, you're right.
We pretty much just ate. Huh?

326
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,041
[NAGATO] Vegetable. Azuki beans.
Pumpkin. Soba bun.

327
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:51,000
Vegetable. Azuki beans.
Pumpkin. Soba bun.

328
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,833
Vegetable. Azuki beans.
Pumpkin. Soba bun.

329
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,416
Vegetable. Azuki beans.
Pumpkin. Soba bun.

330
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,750
Vegetable. Azuki beans.
Pumpkin. Soba bun.

331
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,375
Excuse me! A vegetable
bun, please.

332
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,375
Comin' right up.

333
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,041
[NAGATO]
And, um, azuki beans,

334
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,541
pumpkin and soba
buns, too, please.

335
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,125
[GROUP]
All four?

336
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,583
Ow, that's hot! But so yummy!

337
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,833
[laughs]

338
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,208
Hm? What is it?

339
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,958
Nothing. Don't mind me.

340
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,625
[NAGATO]
Hm?

341
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,875
[KYON] Man. Can't tell
if it's good or not.

342
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,083
She always looks happy
when she's eating.

343
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,000
Huh. This isn't half bad.

344
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,875
[HARUHI]
Yeah, it's pretty good.

345
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,041
Unique, that's for sure.

346
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,666
Uh? You're back.

347
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,458
What happened to the power spot?

348
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,791
Well, it's not like
it's going anywhere.

349
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,208
Hey! Let's try that next!

350
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,208
Brain freeze!
Brain freeze! Ow!

351
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,000
--Ugh. Can't eat any more.
--[HARUHI] Is that a power spot?

352
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,125
--Hey, Kyon.
--[KOIZUMI] Wait up!

353
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,458
Huh?

354
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,791
Were you planning to buy
souvenirs for your family?

355
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,041
Kinda have to.

356
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,625
My little sister will
flip out if I don't.

357
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,541
How 'bout you?

358
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,291
Oh. I'm not sure
yet, actually.

359
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,583
My parents live overseas,
so I don't know.

360
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,208
Well, if you buy them
now, you'll have to

361
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,416
carry them around.

362
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,916
You could always pick up
something later on.

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,416
Good call.

364
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,458
[NAGATO]
Whoa. That's a lot.

365
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,833
Those bags must be heavy.

366
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,041
Do you know how many people
I was shopping for?

367
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,208
These are actually
surprisingly light.

368
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,250
[ASAKURA]
Impressive.

369
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,791
Huh.

370
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,958
You know, I feel like I see
those things sold everywhere.

371
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,708
I guess there must be a
market for them, huh?

372
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,083
[NAGATO]
So shiny!

373
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,833
t's even got a face-roller-
massager-thing, too!

374
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,416
You're into some
really weird stuff,

375
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,750
you know that?

376
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:50,166
Wow! That's so adorable!
Aw! This is really cute, too!

377
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,458
Ah! And look how
precious that is!

378
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,333
[ASAKURA]
She's special.

379
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,375
[TSURUYA laughs] Looks like Haru
and Koizumi wandered off again.

380
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,541
[KYON] Hurricane Haruhi.
She does what she wants.

381
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,500
[ASAKURA]
And there's no stopping her.

382
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,833
[ASAKURA]
So, what exactly are you doing?

383
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,500
What does it look
like I'm doing?

384
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,458
I'm receiving mystical power!

385
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,208
So this is the power spot
you keep talking about?

386
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,958
[HARUHI]
Yeah, this is part of it.

387
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,458
Apparently when you bathe
yourself in this smoke,

388
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,750
your physical strength
goes up one level.

389
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:49,166
[coughs] I don't know about
increasing physical strength,

390
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,083
but I have heard people
say that the smoke

391
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,541
can heal the parts of your
body that it touches.

392
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,708
Except, I think it's
a bundle of incense

393
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,958
per body part.

394
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,541
Using the same one for a
long time doesn't work.

395
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,000
[HARUHI] Don't worry.
I've got it covered.

396
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,666
I set up a system where Koizumi

397
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,250
throws in another bundle
about every minute.

398
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,541
Okay, it's been a minute.

399
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,291
Are you ready for
the next bundle?

400
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,625
So it's all good.

401
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,791
I'm getting everything the
power spot has to offer!

402
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,333
Okay, that's enough!

403
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,416
[HARUHI]
Ow! Stop!

404
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,291
[ASAKURA]
Step away from the smoke!

405
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,875
Say goodbye to the power spot!

406
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,083
I've got so much
left to do, though!

407
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,750
I only got up to the
bicep of my right arm.

408
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,375
You guys are having
too much fun here!

409
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,125
I've got my hands full.
Please don't complicate things.

410
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,625
Okay, it's been a minute.
Ready for more incense?

411
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah, Koizumi! Bring it on,

412
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,750
[ASAKURA]
We're done with the incense.

413
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,791
Understand? Just give up!

414
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,166
Knock it off!

415
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,833
[ASAKURA]
Quit wiggling!

416
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,791
Do you think we should
go and join them?

417
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,250
Nope.

418
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,541
I think we should pretend
we've never met them before.

419
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,416
That's a good idea.

420
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,333
How about we just go and
pray the regular way?

421
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,541
I saw something about
this on TV one time.

422
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,583
They said when you're
making a wish to the gods,

423
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,958
you want to include as
many details as possible.

424
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,416
Things like, who
you're wishing about

425
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,166
and what you want to happen.

426
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,916
Wait.

427
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,625
Was that at a Shinto shrine
or a Buddhist temple?

428
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,666
Eh, it's probably the same.

429
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,583
[NAGATO]
Who I'm wishing about...

430
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,291
[NAGATO]
What I want to happen...

431
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,125
[NAGATO]
Who I want it to happen with...

432
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,750
[ASAKURA]
Think I could get some help?

433
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,708
[HARUHI] All right!
The quadriceps are next!

434
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,666
I can't deal with both of them!

435
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,125
[HARUHI] I haven't achieved
physical perfection yet!

436
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,208
Miss Tsuruya, don't
encourage her!

437
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,333
[TSURUYA]
If she can do it, so can I!

438
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,291
It looks like she
needs some backup.

439
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,625
If you guys will excuse
me, I should help.

440
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,250
Go ahead. Don't
worry about us.

441
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:03,125
I'm sorry about this, Kyon!
Take good care of Miss Tsuruya!

442
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,583
[sighs]

443
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,541
[MIKURU]
Are you done making your wish?

444
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,125
Yes. I'm done.

445
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,375
Well then, why don't we
go check out that shop?

446
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,458
They have some cool amulets.

447
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,583
[NAGATO]
Wow. There are so many!

448
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,541
I have college entrance
exams next year.

449
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,333
Maybe I'll get
something for that.

450
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,500
Ah! What's this?
I like how it looks.

451
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,291
Maybe not.

452
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,875
[sighs]

453
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,208
Uh...

454
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,625
Here, I think this
is the one you want!

455
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,875
Huh?

456
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,375
No thanks!

457
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,583
Go ahead, get it.

458
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,041
I don't think there's
anybody watching.

459
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,333
Okay, tell you what.

460
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,458
There you go!

461
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,000
Now there's really
nobody watching.

462
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,958
That's sweet of you.

463
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,166
Well, go on. Buy it.
Now or never!

464
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:13,458
[NAGATO] Excuse me. I'd
like to buy this, please.

465
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,666
[sighs]

466
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,625
Help! I'm suffocating
in all this smoke!

467
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,875
Too much smoke!

468
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,625
So now you want less smoke?

469
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,250
I wonder if I'm any stronger!

470
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,375
That's ridiculous.

471
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,041
Come on, aren't we there yet?

472
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,125
I want a bath! I want a bath!

473
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,708
Will you please be quiet?

474
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,625
[TSURUYA laughs]
It's not much further.

475
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,166
We can't get to the
inn soon enough.

476
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,791
[HARUHI] No! I want a bath
right now! Now, now, now, now!

477
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,208
[ASAKURA] Seriously!
You're acting like a child!

478
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,791
[HARUHI]
No, I am not! How dare you!

479
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:57,333
I just want a bath!
I feel so gross!

480
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:00,041
[ASAKURA]
Just shut up!

481
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,791
