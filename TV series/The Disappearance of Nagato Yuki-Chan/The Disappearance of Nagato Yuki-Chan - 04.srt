00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,958
[COACH A]
Move it, boys!

2
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,875
[HARUHI] Anyway, I wanted
to teach them a lesson,

3
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,166
so I ordered them
to go buy some snacks.

4
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,500
Wow.

5
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,041
So you sent them out in
this weather for supplies

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,208
that we don't even need?

7
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,750
It's pretty cold out there.

8
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,833
Yep. That's kinda the idea!

9
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,541
[ASAKURA] Aren't you
chilly in that outfit?

10
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,791
It doesn't look warm.

11
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,375
[HARUHI laughs]
I'm just fine, thank you!

12
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,958
I feel bad for
Koizumi. Poor guy.

13
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,583
[HARUHI]
What about Kyon?

14
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,958
[ASAKURA giggles]

15
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:56,666
[door clicks]

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,750
Hello there, everyone!

17
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,625
[MIKURU]
Hi, how are you today?

18
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,000
Ah! Mikuru's here!

19
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:02,916
[MIKURU yelps]

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,791
[TSURUYA]
That's far enough.

21
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,208
Huh?

22
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,458
You don't think I'll just
let you play with Mikuru?

23
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,291
If you want to do that,
first you're gonna

24
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,875
have to get through me!

25
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:13,958
Ha!

26
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,333
You wanna piece
of me? Fine, let' go.

27
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,375
[HARUHI, TSURUYA]
Ha!

28
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,625
I don't think so!

29
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,791
Battles are forbidden
in the clubroom.

30
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,083
Isn't that right, President?

31
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,416
[NAGATO]
Huh?

32
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,791
Aw. How am I supposed to
ignore someone that cute?

33
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,250
I have to admit, I understand
that feeling well.

34
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,750
No! Not you, too!

35
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,625
[TSURUYA] If you saw Mikuru
sitting on the sidewalk,

36
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,916
how could you not take her home?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,375
Excuse me!

38
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,875
You're talking about me like
a kitten or pocket change.

39
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,791
[ASAKURA] Let's press pause
on this for a moment.

40
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,291
If we're discussing cute girls,

41
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,000
then why don't I
hear Nagato's name?

42
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,791
Wait! This isn't a competition!

43
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,250
I'm afraid you leave
me with little choice.

44
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,083
I accept your challenge!

45
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:56,750
[gasps]

46
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay!

47
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,291
Cute Fact Number One:
when Nagato's sleeping

48
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,083
and I try to wake her up,
she calls me "Mom."

49
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,750
You'll catch cold
if you're not careful!

50
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,833
Just five more
minutes, Mom, okay?

51
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,583
How is that an example
of being cute?

52
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,416
Hold on! Do I actually do that?

53
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,750
[cackles] Not good enough.

54
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,583
Mikuru bumps into a pole
whenever she chases a cat.

55
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,208
When she looks up at the sky,
she sticks her foot in a puddle.

56
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,208
Ah! It's not like these are
things I do every day!

57
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,083
They only happen sometimes.

58
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,208
Oh! That's nothing!

59
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,083
Nagato sets time aside
every single day

60
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,375
to stare at her tummy
in the mirror!

61
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,166
Why would you even
tell them about that?

62
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,833
It's not a "most
embarrassing story" contest!

63
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,041
If that's how you're gonna play,

64
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,791
I can do you one better:
there's a birthmark

65
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,791
shaped like a star
on Mikuru's chest.

66
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,625
Hold on, I didn't
even know that!

67
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,541
Are you sure? Oh my
goodness there is one!

68
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,666
[gasps] Oh, I see I'm
facing off against a master.

69
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,791
I didn't expect you to
know things about Mikuru

70
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,208
that she didn't even know.

71
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
What're you gonna do?

72
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,500
If you leave it at that,
you'll lose for sure.

73
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,750
Uh, let's not egg her on, okay?

74
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,416
Um, you're done, right?

75
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,750
Please say you're done.

76
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,791
There's nothing else
you know, is there?

77
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,250
Actually, there is.

78
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,625
There is?

79
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,000
Nagato went shopping.

80
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,958
She attempted to
do so in secret.

81
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,708
She purchased ingredients for
Valentine's Day chocolate.

82
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,083
[gasps]

83
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,708
[HARUHI]
Hmm.

84
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,875
How nice.

85
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,208
No shame in sharing
a holiday, is there?

86
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,333
Okay. Well...

87
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,041
So, you bought a
little chocolate.

88
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,958
That's not really embarrassing.

89
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,458
Yeah, there's no reason
to be so secretive about it.

90
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,375
You see, Nagato?

91
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:32,833

[TEACHER 4A]
During the Heian Era, courtship

93
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,500
depended upon wealth,
family status, and one other

94
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,166
very important and
surprising factor:

95
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,833
the ability to
write good poetry.

96
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,291
[ASAKURA]
Hey!

97
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,375
Ow! Geez!

98
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,125
Did that hurt?
It wasn't very hard.

99
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,083
Well, I guess it was
hard enough, huh?

100
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,458
What do you want?

101
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,708
Well, here's the thing.

102
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,916
Hm?

103
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,833
[TEACHER B]
All right. Moving on.

104
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,375
Here is how we find the
coordinates of the intersection

105
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,750
of a parabola and
a straight line.

106
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,500
[KYON]
Hm. Huh?

107
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,166
Well, this is a surprise.

108
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,500
Spending your time
out here waiting for me?

109
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,500
I like the change
in your attitude!

110
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,625
[laughs] Hey, it looks
like you're alone.

111
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,750
Where's your shadow?

112
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,041
[HARUHI]
Couldn't make it today.

113
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,250
Busy or something.

114
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,875
Okay. That works.

115
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,833
Turns out Asakura and Nagato
had something to do today, too.

116
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,083
Huh?

117
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,458
I didn't wanna sit in
the clubroom by myself.

118
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,583
So we cancelled today's meeting
and I came out here to tell you.

119
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,583
I thought I would save you
the trouble of trespassing

120
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,708
on school grounds again.

121
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,166
You just cancelled
the meeting without

122
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,291
consulting the
executive president?

123
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,250
[KYON] You're not even
a real club member!

124
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,208
[HARUHI]
Oh. I get it!

125
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,583
Today is the 13th.

126
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:26,375
That must be why the
other two are busy.

127
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,625
[yelps] Okay, I'll just
be on my way, then.

128
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,750
Just a second.
We're not done here.

129
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,708
What is it now? I'm very busy.
Places to go. People to see.

130
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,916
[chuckles] Whatever!
You're comin' with me.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,958
Like I said--

132
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,208
Yeah, I don't care!

133
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,625
[KYON]
Wait! Hey! Where are we going?

134
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,416
Are you listening to me?

135
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,833
[ASAKURA]
All right.

136
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,541
Now I guess we just have
to decide where to start.

137
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,041
[NAGATO]
Yeah!

138
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,750
[ASAKURA] So, were there any
ingredients you didn't buy?

139
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,333
[HARUHI] So, here's the deal.
You know the saying,

140
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,791
"Good things come
to those who wait"?

141
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,833
Yeah, well, I think
it's all wrong.

142
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,291
I'm not getting out of
here anytime soon, am I?

143
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,583
If you ask me, you won't
accomplish anything

144
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,625
sitting around and waiting
for bizarre occurrences

145
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,875
and mysterious
phenomena to happen.

146
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,250
You gotta go out there and
hunt them down yourself.

147
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,541
That's the key.

148
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,208
[KYON]
Right...

149
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,250
So, basically,

150
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,208
if we don't want
to die of boredom,

151
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,375
we need to get off our butts

152
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,500
and start lookin'
for mysterious stuff!

153
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,166
[KYON]
We do?

154
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,416
Of course!

155
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,833
Good things don't just
come to those who wait!

156
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,625
I bet they're out there waiting
for me to come to them!

157
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,000
[KYON] Actually, my guess
is they'd be perfectly happy

158
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,791
never to cross your path.

159
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,916
That's enough!

319
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,625
to meet up with her.

320
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,833
You were, were you?
It's decided, then!

321
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,666
We're gonna have our lunch in
the Literary Club's room, too.

322
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,625
That sounds good
to you, doesn't it?

323
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,875
Hm? Well, sure.

324
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,791
It's okay with me, but
maybe we should ask her.

325
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:33,791
Huh?

326
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,291
[MIKURU]
May we join you for lunch?

327
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,375
Huh? Oh, yeah. Of course.
It's no problem!

328
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,250
I knew that's what
you would say!

329
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,500
[MIKURU]
Well, thanks.

330
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,500
There's lots of tension
in the classroom today,

331
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,750
so it'll be more comfortable
eating somewhere else.

332
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,166
What do you mean, "tension"?

333
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,250
Well, you know.

334
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,750
It's Valentine's Day
today, right?

335
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,708
So the guys have got
themselves all worked up.

336
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,500
[NAGATO]
Oh. That does sound tense.

337
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,125
I don't know. I think
you're exaggerating.

338
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,458
They're like hungry dogs!

339
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,083
If we don't give 'em
something to chew on,

340
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,416
I don't know what'll happen.

341
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,916
Things could get
pretty frightening.

342
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
There are more than 100 guys

343
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,166
in the Mikuru fan club!

344
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,250
That must be an exaggeration.

345
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,791
[gasps] Oh, no.

346
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,583
Don't tell me you made
chocolate for all of them!

347
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,041
[laughs]

348
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,291
You're not denying it.
Please deny it.

349
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,500
[NAGATO]
Is it true?

350
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,708
[TSURUYA]
Hm?

351
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,375
Well, uh, this might
be a stupid question.

352
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,333
but do guys really sit
around hoping to get

353
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,916
Valentine's chocolate from the
girl they're interested in?

354
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,500
Are you kidding?
Of course they do!

355
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,791
They may like to play it cool,

356
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,958
but nobody can ignore
Valentine's Day.

357
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,833
They care about this stuff
as much as girls, ya know.

358
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,333
[NAGATO]
I didn't know that.

359
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,791
So, if they get chocolate
from a girl they don't like,

360
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,166
is it just embarrassing?

361
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,791
Oh, well, I don't
know about that.

362
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,583
Totally possible!

363
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,166
Don't say that!

364
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,833
[TSURUYA] Sorry, but it is.
I mean, guys are human, too,

365
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,625
and that kind of reaction
is only natural.

366
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,500
[TSURUYA] The point is, how
he reacts shouldn't matter!

367
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,958
Here's the thing.

368
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,333
A gift like this is about
how the one giving it feels.

369
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,625
It's something you do for
your own sake, not his.

370
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,208
So don't worry about
what he might be thinking.

371
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,541
Just take those chocolates.

372
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,875
and throw 'em at him with
everything you've got!

373
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,041
[MIKURU] She probably shouldn't
actually throw them.

374
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,666
[TSURUYA laughs]

375
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,291
Oh, whoops. That was dumb.

376
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,041
I forgot to get
something to drink!

377
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,541
I'm just gonna go
grab something.

378
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,125
Feel free to start without me.

379
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,125
[door clicks]

380
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,125
I really don't think
she'll mind at all.

381
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,208
I say we go ahead
and start eating.

382
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,541
Okay. Sounds good to me.

383
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,291
[MIKURU]
Great! I'm hungry.

384
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,875
Uh, there's something
you should know.

385
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes?

386
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,000
It's, well, um...
You know, earlier...

387
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,875
Miss Tsuruya was actually
trying to be encouraging.

388
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,708
It's how she talks. She wasn't
being mean or anything.

389
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,916
That? Don't worry, I know.

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,916
[MIKURU] She's not always
the most sensitive person

391
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,333
in the world, but...

392
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,125
True. But that's okay.

393
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,125
[MIKURU]
And, um. If you want my opinion,

394
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,250
I think he'll be happy
to get them from you.

395
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,750
[gasps]

396
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,000
He might not show it, 'cause,

397
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,166
you know how guys
can be all tough.

398
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,166
But if I was a guy and
you gave me chocolate.

399
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,041
I would definitely be happy!

400
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,791
[gasps]

401
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,833
[laughs nervously] Wow, that
kind of made it sound like

402
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,875
I was confessing my love to you.

403
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,916
I'm not so good at
explaining things.

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,791
It's all right.
I know what you meant.

405
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,625
[MIKURU, NAGATO gsap]

406
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,416
Oh, my! Did you hear
what I just heard?

407
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,541
I certainly did, and
it was pretty clear.

408
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:47,958
That most definitely sounded
like a confession of love to me.

409
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,291
I'm so sorry. I hate
to have to tell you.

410
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,750
Huh?

411
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,916
I'm afraid Nagato's heart
is no longer hers to give.

412
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,333
It belongs to Kyon.

413
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,916
[MIKURU] What? No! This is
a big misunderstanding.

414
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
[giggles]

415
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,833
Why were you two eavesdropping?

416
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,833
I ran into Miss Tsuruya
on my way here,

417
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,250
so we walked back together.

418
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,666
When we saw you
staring at each other

419
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,500
like a scene from
a manga, well...

420
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,958
We silently agreed that
observing your conversation

421
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,875
could turn out to be
highly entertaining.

422
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,250
[NAGATO]
It's kinda creepy how similar

423
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,750
their thought processes are.

424
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,875
It was like something
out of a Broadway musical.

425
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,250
I never understand
what you're saying.

426
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,625
How are you feeling now?

427
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,375
Huh? About what?

428
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,291
You know that all three
of us are behind you.

429
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,750
Does that help give you courage?

430
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,166
Uh-huh.

431
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,250
When school's over--

432
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,000
that's when you'll
make your move.

433
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,041
[NAGATO]
Mm.

434
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,041
[TSURUYA]
Well, we have to get going.

435
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,166
This was fun. See you later!

436
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,958
[NAGATO]
Hey, wait.

437
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,625
[MIKURU, TSURUYA]
Huh?

438
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,041
I just wanted to say thank you.

439
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,833
Soldier! Time to discuss
our plan of attack.

440
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,708
So listen carefully, got it?

441
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,250
Hm!

442
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,541
[ASAKURA]
First order of business:

443
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,083
hand over the key
to the clubroom.

444
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,541
[NAGATO]
Here.

445
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,833
This is where it starts.

446
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,708
After school's over,
I'll give this key to Kyon

447
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,916
and instruct him to
unlock the clubroom door.

448
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,416
[NAGATO]
Okay.

449
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,541
[ASAKURA] So, Kyon uses the
key and enters the clubroom.

450
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,750
Shortly thereafter, you arrive.

451
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,458
And, oh, hey! It's
just the two of you!

452
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,708
Which makes it the perfect time
to hand over your gift.

453
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,000
Ah!

454
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,083
And I'll take my sweet time

455
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,750
heading to the clubroom,
so you lovebirds

456
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,750
will have plenty of privacy.

457
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,333
[gasps]

458
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,875
Hey, easy there!

459
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,208
If you're already like this,
how bad is it going to be later?

460
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,875
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

461
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,083
Are you sure you'll be okay?

462
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,291
Yeah. I can do it. Although,

463
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,666
do you think we could do it
and not be so sneaky about it?

464
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,791
I mean, couldn't I just
hurry and wait for him?

465
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,625
That would make
it a lot simpler.

466
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,625
[ASAKURA sighs]
Oh, Nagato!

467
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,458
Think this through
with me, okay?

468
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,541
You can casually enter a room
where Kyon is already waiting.

469
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,250
or you can desperately
rush there yourself

470
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,708
and wait for him to grace
you with his presence.

471
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,541
Now tell me which of
these two situations

472
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,208
sounds more stressful to you?

473
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,625
[gasps]

474
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,208
Yes, you're right.

475
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,458
He should be the
one waiting, not me.

476
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,083
I'm glad you realize that.

477
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,416
This way, things are more
firmly under your control.

478
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,791
You can take time to breathe
and collect yourself.

479
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,166
You'll remember
to do that, right?

480
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,833
Whatever happens today,
you should be proud of yourself.

481
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,750
You put your whole heart
into making those chocolates.

482
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,958
[NAGATO]
Yeah, I did.

483
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,791
Heh, heh? And still nothing.

484
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,000
That's it! The end!

485
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,500
I am now officially
giving in to despair.

486
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,750
[KUNIKIDA]
You okay?

487
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,958
[TANIGUCHI]
Kunikida!

488
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,375
If it makes you feel any better,

489
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,291
all I got was courtesy
chocolate. Want some?

490
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,916
[COACH A]
Let's fight!

491
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,583
[BASEBALL TEAM]
Yeah!

492
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,166
[sighs]

493
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,250
Throw those chocolates at him
with everything you've got!

494
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,791
I would be happy if
you gave me chocolates!

495
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,291
Whatever happens today, you
should be proud of yourself.

496
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,375
Okay? Your heart went
into those chocolates.

497
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,958
[NAGATO sighs]

498
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,583
[NAGATO inhales, exhales]

499
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,166
I'm sorry it took
me so lo-- [gasps]

500
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,916
