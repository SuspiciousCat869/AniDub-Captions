1
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,350
[ALBEDO]
I'm off, Lord Ains.

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,430
I will ensure that
the Re-Estize Kingdom

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,930
fully recognizes our
fledgling nation.

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,060
[AINS]
Good.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,270
Judging by the size
of our delegation,

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,270
I have confidence that they'll
get the idea quickly enough.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,230
Still, be mindful.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,700
Whoever brainwashed Shalltear
is still out there

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,490
and we don't know where.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,860
Of course.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,950
I will be sure to keep
the Ginnungagap on my person

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,490
at all times.

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,950
[AINS] As long as you have that,
you shouldn't be affected

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,000
by the brainwashing
of another world item.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,630
But I worry, since this is your
first time going out alone.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,050
If you sense any danger,

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,130
retreat without
a second thought.

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,170
Do you have a teleportation
item for that?

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,130
Oh, but there might be
enemies that'll stop you

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,760
from teleporting
when they attack.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,470
Have you thought
of countermeasures?

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,220
Hm, what else?

23
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,060
[clears throat] I suppose
that's enough nagging.

24
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,190
Oh, and as for Demiurge.

25
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,150
No, never mind.

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,070
Are you certain, My Lord?

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,650
[AINS]
Yes.

28
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,530
[MOMONGA] I want to know what
Demiurge is plotting right now,

29
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,700
but I'm supposed to be
the supreme leader here.

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,530
I have to look smart
in front of the others.

31
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,120
[AINS]
One last thing.

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,000
They say it's easier to get sick
during the change of seasons.

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,370
Even though you're immune
to all known illnesses,

34
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,880
there could be an unrecognized
ailment in this world

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,880
that catches you unaware.
So do be careful.

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Not to worry!

37
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,460
I happen to know
the perfect little trick

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,260
to keep any sickness away!

39
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,420
[AINS]
What's that?

40
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,970
A kiss!

41
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,220
[AINS]
A what?

42
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,850
[ALBEDO] A kiss reduces
stress and revitalizes

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,180
the parasympathetic nervous
system, which in turn increases

44
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,810
the activity of
one's immune response!

45
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,190
In other words,
a kiss can prevent illness!

46
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,400
You must protect me, My Lord!

47
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,360
[AINS]
Ah--

48
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,410
[AINS] A kiss on the mouth
seemed too much,

49
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,200
so one on the cheek
will have to do.

50
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,450
You actually did it!

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,540
And here I thought you
would just ignore me!

52
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,750
[AINS]
Wait, is this because...

53
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,340
...I don't have any lips?

54
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,170
[AINS]
Albedo, please don't cry.

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,560
[ALBEDO sobbing]

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,930
[AINS]
I just want you to stay safe.

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,730
[AINS]
Are you all right now?

58
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,400
[ALBEDO]
Never been better.

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,740
Though I hope you can forgive me

60
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,320
for showing such an
embarrassing side of myself.

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,070
[AINS] It's fine,
but you should go now.

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,910
Yes, Lord Momonga.
I will return soon.

63
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,340
[AINS] Forget everything
you've seen today.

64
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,790
Of course, My Lord.

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,670
[ZINEDINE] We offer thanks
to you, o mighty gods,

66
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,260
for allowing us mere humans
to live another day

67
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,350
in the light of your grace.

68
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,010
[PRIESTS]
Thank you, mighty gods.

69
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,440
The first topic of discussion

70
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,810
is the newly established
"Sorcerer Kingdom."

71
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,190
This began with the
ReEsteeze Kingdom's loss

72
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,480
in the Kahtz Plains.

73
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,070
Aiding the Baharuth Empire,
Ains Ooal Gown

74
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,490
crushed the kingdom's army
with a terrifying offense.

75
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,330
Afterwards, he claimed their
fortress city of E-Rantel

76
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,950
as his own and
announced the founding

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,700
of the Sorcerer Kingdom.

78
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,580
Emperor Jircniv has announced
to neighboring countries

79
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,000
that the Empire
acknowledges this claim.

80
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,040
A kingdom ruled by
an undead monster...

81
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,000
Truly a living nightmare!

82
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,630
Perhaps we should
have intervened.

83
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,880
This can't be
allowed to continue.

84
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,680
We all agreed that it
would be too dangerous

85
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,600
to face Gown,
and even in hindsight,

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,140
that seems to be the case.

87
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,390
I can't fathom what
the Empire is thinking.

88
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,440
Could it be that Gown could be
manipulating them with magic?

89
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,650
Doubtful, since Paradyne would
protect them from such a thing.

90
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,320
Speaking of the battle once
more, the Black Scripture's

91
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,150
Thousand Leagues Astrologer
observed the event,

92
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,070
but due to some
personal complications

93
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,200
we weren't able to receive
the report until now.

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
At any rate, the document
in your hands

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,120
contains the Thousand Leagues
Astrologer's exact words

96
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,250
on the matter.

97
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,500
Raymond, are you
sure this is true?

98
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,750
As I mentioned, this is
a record of her account,

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,840
so as long as you trust
the Astrologer, it's true.

100
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,630
It's not that
she's untrustworthy,

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,350
it's just that these
numbers seem impossible.

102
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,470
It's sick!

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,100
All those Death Knights!

104
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,850
Hordes of undead with
frightful difficulty ratings.

105
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,600
So many over 100!

106
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,610
Perhaps it's illusion magic?

107
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,860
The Astrologer would have seen
through any deceptions easily.

108
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,280
Also, she's confirmed a large
number of Death Knights

109
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,860
are patrolling the
Sorcerer Kingdom, even now.

110
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,030
It is our sworn duty
to protect humanity.

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,870
What can we do for the people
trapped in that city?

112
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,200
The Black Scripture is our
most powerful resource.

113
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,370
Are they capable of
winning this or not?

114
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,710
They're not enough.

115
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,040
As their former Third Chair,
I can assure you,

116
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,880
they would suffer
a devastating defeat.

117
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,050
Humans cannot stand up
to Death Knights,

118
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,130
especially not that many.

119
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,140
But, that said, God-kin
are a different story.

120
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,640
[ALL gasp]

121
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,230
[RAYMOND]
Our two God-kin could triumph

122
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,770
against an army of Death
Knights, or any other undead.

123
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,940
However, that doesn't mean

124
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,900
that we shouldn't
think of alternatives.

125
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,150
You had me scared for a while.

126
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,320
[sighs] Tell us already.

127
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,740
You're hiding
something, Raymond.

128
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,370
What do you mean? I've been
honest from the start.

129
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,580
In that case, I have a question.

130
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,580
That battle, why did it affect
the Astrologer so much?

131
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,460
She felt something more
than fear of the undead

132
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,130
when she locked herself away.

133
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,420
She felt despair, didn't she?

134
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,510
She witnessed a power that
even God-kin cannot defeat.

135
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,760
This report may be true, but I
doubt it's the whole truth.

136
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,440
I was going to wait until I
could offer everyone a solution,

137
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,400
but you may share this
burden with me, if you like.

138
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,070
[MAXIMILIAN]
I see.

139
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,910
I admit, if you'd
shown this first,

140
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,530
I would've had a tough
time believing it.

141
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
Frankly,

142
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,950
I don't want to believe
this nightmare.

143
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,290
A single spell that can
kill over 130,000 people?

144
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,420
This magic's in the
realm of the divine.

145
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,800
An Eleventh-Tier spell
here in this age.

146
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,420
The time has come.

147
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,590
The descent of a new god?

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,550
It has been quite a while.

149
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,560
Two hundred years.
That does match the legends.

150
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,730
And yet, our plan is
so far behind schedule.

151
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,640
If the Re-Estize Kingdom
hadn't failed us,

152
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,810
our forces would be stronger.

153
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,020
Fools. Useless fools.

154
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,440
They were given all our support,
and a safe, fertile home.

155
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,610
We thought their children
would be strong,

156
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,110
that they would
cultivate heroes.

157
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Ones fierce enough to fight
against the nonhuman races.

158
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,700
But affluence invited
corruption instead,

159
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,580
rotting the entire nation
from the inside out.

160
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,750
Not to mention the drugs
they sold to the Empire,

161
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,710
dragging them down as well.

162
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,960
They've proven themselves to be
unsalvageable at this point.

163
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,590
All we can do is
change our approach.

164
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,430
We'll have the Empire
take over the Kingdom

165
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,800
and start from there.

166
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,600
I worry that it's too late,
but we can try at least.

167
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,600
Let's get back to that later.

168
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
I wonder about the
Sunlit Scripture members

169
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,060
we sent to the Kingdom.

170
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,230
Perhaps it was the Sorcerer
King who killed them.

171
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,610
That leads me to believe that he
may be allies with Honyopnyoko,

172
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,860
the vampire that the
Black Scripture encountered.

173
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,110
They're both powerful undead.

174
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,280
In that case, do you think
they have a connection

175
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,280
to Jaldabaoth, since
he's another monster

176
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,240
who appeared around
the same time?

177
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,950
Sorcerer King, Hanyopenyoko,
and Yalldabayoath.

178
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,710
It's hardly a relief,
but if they all came

179
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,460
from the same place, that would
certainly explain a few things.

180
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,840
It would be quite the
coincidence, otherwise.

181
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,090
So many fearsome monsters
attacking the Kingdom at once.

182
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,630
The adventurer Momon
possesses similar power,

183
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,640
but his motives
are a mystery to us.

184
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,010
When he first appeared,
he defeated the vampire

185
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,730
and fought against Jaldabaoth,
but recently he's become

186
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,440
the Sorcerer King's ally.

187
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
Then perhaps we're
dealing with two groups.

188
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,480
The Sorcerer King may not
work with other monsters.

189
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,980
Let's hope that's the case.

190
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,240
The four of them together would
an unprecedented disaster.

191
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,530
That scenario is
extremely unlikely.

192
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,870
Momon fought and vanquished
the vampire, if you recall.

193
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,200
Uncertainties aside,
if we're sure Momon

194
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,620
is with the Sorcerer King,
shouldn't we try to turn them

195
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,870
against each other?

196
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,630
We shouldn't involve
ourselves directly,

197
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,130
especially when
we know so little.

198
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,500
Yes, I agree.

199
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,090
We've suffered too many losses
to take unnecessary risks.

200
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,390
We didn't just lose the Sunlit
Scripture to the Sorcerer King.

201
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,390
When Windstrider betrayed us,
we also lost the Crown of Wisdom

202
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,890
and the Shaman Princess.

203
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,390
And though we've resurrected
most of the Black Scripture,

204
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,150
Kaire's death has weakened them.

205
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,690
It will take years to recover.
We shouldn't grill meat

206
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,780
under a sleeping dragon's
nose in the meantime.

207
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,740
[MAXIMILIAN] For the time being,
we should get in contact

208
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,320
with the Empire and
gather some information.

209
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,820
[BERNICE]
Agreed.

210
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,030
Let's hope the Emperor is just
pretending to wag his tail

211
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,830
for the Sorcerer King.

212
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,960
[JIRCNIV growls]
You bastard! I hope you die!

213
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,710
Die and rot!

214
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,800
Wait. He's already dead.

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,220
If you're cursing an undead,
do you tell them to live?

216
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,140
I've heard from a priest that
you can wipe them from existence

217
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,100
with holy magic.
Wouldn't that be nice?

218
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,100
[JIRCNIV]
I'm losing it.

219
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,640
It's all the
Sorcerer King's fault.

220
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,900
[sighs]

221
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,820
[knocking]

222
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,320
[JIRCNIV]
Come in.

223
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,610
[SECRETARY 3A]
Your Highness.

224
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,410
You have quite a lot
of paperwork there.

225
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,700
Is all of it from the knights?

226
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,250
It is. They're letters
of resignation,

227
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,370
many of them submitted
by our elite forces.

228
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,710
They've lost their will to fight

229
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,750
after the war in
the Katze Plains,

230
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,960
spending their sleepless
nights in terror.

231
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,710
If you would like,
the secretaries

232
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,420
could handle this work
until things calm down.

233
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,720
It's fine. I told the knights

234
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,350
that they could voice their
opinions to me directly.

235
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,810
I can't afford to lose any more
support at a time like this.

236
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,810
That aside, do you
have news for me?

237
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,980
I do. The merchants you
were hoping to hear from

238
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,730
have contacted us today.

239
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,440
I'm thrilled to hear it!

240
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,190
They have some highly
valuable merchandise

241
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,700
to show off and would like to
have a private audience with you

242
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,320
at your earliest convenience.

243
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,910
Valuable merchandise, you say?

244
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,830
[JIRCNIV] If the "merchants"
from the Slane Theocracy

245
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,910
want to meet with me,
I assume they're wary

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,460
of the Sorcerer Kingdom
and are hoping

247
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,080
to cooperate with the Empire.

248
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,790
If I want to stand a chance
against Ains Ooal Gown,

249
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,710
then allying with the
Theocracy is my only hope.

250
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,720
But I can't even speak
their name out loud.

251
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,550
It would be too dangerous to
invite their messenger here.

252
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,390
We need protection.

253
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,350
[BAZIWOOD] We're headed
straight to the colosseum?

254
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,520
Are you going to meet
the adventurers

255
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
from the Silver Thread
Bird out front?

256
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,860
[JIRCNIV] Yes. They'll be
guarding our perimeter

257
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,400
while I speak with
the "merchants,"

258
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
but I don't want them in my box.

259
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,570
They'll shut down
any eavesdropping,

260
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,410
whether it be physical
or magical in nature.

261
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,910
[NIMBLE] As far as humans go,
adamantine adventurers

262
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,870
are the best bet that we've got.

263
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,250
That said, they still can't
surpass mankind's limits.

264
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,330
And yet look at what
Momon has done!

265
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,380
I heard he stood up to
the Sorcerer King himself!

266
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,250
The people that we're employing
are in the same class as him.

267
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,880
They have to do this
or we're all dead.

268
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,090
Please, Your Highness,

269
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,010
you can't get caught
saying things like that.

270
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,600
Or looking like that.
You can't seem desperate.

271
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,850
You'll make people worry

272
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,890
if you're not as
confident as usual.

273
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,640
A fine point, but since
it's just the three of us

274
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,900
here right now, might I
speak off the cuff a bit?

275
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,240
This stinks! What am I
s'posed to do?

276
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,990
Why did this monster
show up to ruin my life?

277
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,870
Fluder was my trump
card in this mess,

278
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,370
but he defected to the enemy!

279
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,830
Now the knights are
too scared to protect me!

280
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,870
And was it so wrong to ask Ains
for his strongest spell?

281
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,670
How else was I supposed to find
out what he was capable of?

282
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,920
Who could've guessed it
would turn out like that?

283
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,590
I was doing what
I had to as a leader,

284
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,300
now all of a sudden
everything is my fault?

285
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,340
No one will help me!

286
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,190
But don't worry,
I'm not giving up yet.

287
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,650
There must be something
we can do to win this.

288
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,820
Your Highness.

289
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,730
I stood next to
the Sorcerer King.

290
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,940
I saw him myself,
during that battle.

291
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,740
That creature cannot
be defeated by humanity.

292
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,370
Making enemies of
the Sorcerer Kingdom

293
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,200
is more than just foolish,
it may be suicidal.

294
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,870
How frank of you.
Though you're absolutely right.

295
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,750
But let's think of it this way.

296
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,130
The Sorcerer King
has the strength

297
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,920
to destroy the Empire at will.

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,960
Even if we surrender, there's no
guarantee he'll show mercy.

299
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,340
Yes, that's true.

300
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,510
So, I'll keep fighting.

301
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,550
[JIRCNIV] The Slane Theocracy
must have an answer.

302
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,060
They've been around much
longer than our Empire.

303
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,930
Surely, they have some weapon,
some knowledge that can aid us!

304
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,230
I won't roll over so easily!

305
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,650
It is an honor to meet
you, Your Highness.

306
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,990
We're known as
Silver Thread Bird.

307
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,620
An adamantite adventurer
team, as requested.

308
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,620
I've heard you're the strongest
team in the Empire.

309
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,790
I'm sure you'll live up
to your sterling reputation.

310
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,500
We do try not to disappoint.

311
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,090
My name is Freivalds,
by the way.

312
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,710
I'm the bard and leader
of our proud team.

313
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,090
As for the others, please
allow me to introduce you.

314
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,130
[SODER] Let's not do
the whole song thing.

315
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,850
It's just too much
for me, all right?

316
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,680
Perhaps I should
make this brief.

317
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,230
This fellow is the eyes
and ears of our team.

318
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,310
Soder.

319
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,440
[FAN]
I'm Fan Long.

320
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,480
Our warrior, as you might guess.

321
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,950
And this man here is our
irreplaceable healer.

322
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,570
Greetings, Your Highness.
I am Unkei.

323
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,950
And the last one, you must be
terribly cold in those clothes.

324
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,620
His name is Powapon.

325
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,120
All our talents are
at your disposal.

326
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,580
No harm will come to you
on our watch.

327
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,790
It seems I'm in capable hands!

328
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,010
[CROWD cheers]

329
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,630
[SODER]
All right, all clear.

330
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,890
No magic items here,
Your Highness.

331
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,010
[UNKEI] I do not sense
any active magic, either.

332
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,560
Do you have any
countermeasures in place

333
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,680
if someone tries
to listen in on me?

334
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,890
[SODER]
Honestly, you've got us

335
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,150
and a ton of protection
spells guarding you.

336
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,520
I think you're good.

337
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,360
Very well. Now listen.

338
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,320
I'll be having a very important
discussion momentarily.

339
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,280
I would like all of you to go
outside and stand guard.

340
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,160
I fear if something
bad were to happen,

341
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,040
that would render us
incapable of assisting you.

342
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,710
I understand your concern.

343
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,540
But no, as the ruler
of the Empire,

344
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,420
I must not yield on this.

345
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,960
That's fair enough, then!

346
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,710
We'll stand right outside the
door, just as you requested.

347
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,590
But might you tell us who
your guests will be today?

348
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,590
The head priests of
the fire and wind temples

349
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,010
will be coming soon.

350
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,300
And they will have four
of their attendants with them.

351
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,470
All right, then.

352
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,850
As a tiny safety precaution,

353
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,060
are we allowed to break
the lock on the door?

354
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,190
If you deem it necessary,
then I won't stop you,

355
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,150
as long as you remain outside.

356
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,030
[FAN growls]

357
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,780
Wait! Don't break the whole
door--just break the lock.

358
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,320
[FAN]
But why?

359
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,870
Normally I'll just smash the
door and say "oops, sorry, boss,

360
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,540
I guess I missed the lock!"
Then we get to stay in here.

361
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,040
"No point in having
us wait outside

362
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,540
when there's no
door, after all!"

363
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,500
This time, things are different.

364
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,710
There's no need for us

365
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,130
to wade into the muddy
waters of politics.

366
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,170
I'm with you on that.

367
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,130
You'll be drowning in politics

368
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,680
if you don't get out
of this room right now.

369
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,060
They can get away with that
behavior because they're strong.

370
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,560
[CROWD cheers]

371
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,480
[JIRCNIV]
Thanks to Fluder's betrayal,

372
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,110
I no longer have
anyone highly skilled

373
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,610
or highly knowledgeable
by my side.

374
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,320
Help from powerful adventurers

375
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,030
will continue to be
an absolute necessity.

376
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,870
[BAZIWOOD]
The crowd is getting excited.

377
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,710
The Warrior King is up soon.

378
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,790
He hasn't had a match in ages.

379
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,840
[JIRCNIV]
This is what peace looks like.

380
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,420
[BAZIWOOD]
You think so?

381
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,130
They can enjoy violence
because they don't fear it,

382
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,180
because they have no idea
that there's a monster

383
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,930
breathing down the
neck of the Empire.

384
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,260
[knocking]

385
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,810
[NIMBLE]
What is it?

386
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,100
[FREIVALDS]
The priests have arrived.

387
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,600
They all check out.

388
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,770
[gasps]

389
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,570
It's a pleasure, Your Highness.

390
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,120
We thank you for
your warm invitation.

391
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,160
The pleasure's all mine.
Please, take a seat.

392
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,040
You arrived just in time
for the main event.

393
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,010
[JIRCNIV] They're grilling me
right out the gate, are they?

394
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,140
The fact that they handed me
the letter personally

395
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,890
shows how cautious
they are about this.

396
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,480
Or perhaps they don't trust
the Empire very much.

397
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
[CROWD cheers]

398

[ANNOUNCER 3A] Even
His Imperial Highness El Nix

399
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,690
is in attendance for
this grand event!

Everyone, please turn your
attention to the box seat above!

401
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,820
One moment, please.

402
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,040
[ANNOUNCER 3A] An honor to see
you here today, Your Highness!

403
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,380
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready

404
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,790
for the Warrior King to make
his triumphant return?

405
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,010
Who is this "Warrior King"?

406
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,670
Our champion. It's a title

407
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,260
given to the strongest
fighter in the country.

408
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,680
This one is the eighth king.

409
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,720
The strongest this
arena's ever seen.

410
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,680
So, it can be difficult to find
a suitable challenger for him.

411
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,140
I take it today you've
found one of them?

412
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,190
Apparently, the matchup was
decided at the last minute.

413
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,860
Even I don't know who it is.

414
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,400
They've likely kept it a secret
to garner even more excitement.

415
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
I've heard of this great
"king" of yours,

416
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,360
so I know that he's
actually a war troll.

417
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,990
He might be a useful ally,

418
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,910
assuming he would heed
your command in battle.

419
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,950
But The Theocracy
believes that mankind

420
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,950
is the chosen race of the gods.

421
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,790
You wouldn't mind
working with a troll?

422
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,460
It was a personal remark,
not an official stance.

423
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,300
But enough talk. Please
answer our questions.

424
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,050
That will decide
what comes next.

425
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,550
Of course, just a moment.

426
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,390
[ANNOUNCER 3A] But before
our champion takes the stage,

427
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,430
I'd like to introduce today's
challenger to all of you!

428
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,020
[CROWD cheers]

429
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,100
[ANNOUNCER 3A] This is a name
I'm sure you all remember!

430
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,110
King of the Sorcerer Kingdom,
His Majesty Ains Ooal Gown!

431
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,650
[gasps]

432
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,540
[JIRCNIV]
Ains Ooal Gown?

433
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,250
Why? It can't be.

434
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,750
How did he know?

435
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,000
It's a setup! Everyone, wait!

436
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,130
We came in good faith
and you treat us like this?

437
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,550
It's not me!

438
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,630
But you were the one who
decided on this meeting place.

439
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,840
That's beside the point.

440
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,850
Listen, I'm as
scared as you are.

441
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,640
What do you think
I have to gain from this?

442
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,060
There's no reason
for us to trust you.

443
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,480
Were you offering our lives
to the Sorcerer King?

444
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,150
Or perhaps you're telling us
to join you or die?

445
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,190
Neither! You've got
this all wrong!

446
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,190
[JIRCNIV] How did the
information leak?

447
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,320
Or maybe it didn't and he knew
everything from the start!

448
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,910
He just watched and waited
as I ran straight into his trap!

449
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,240
Hurry! Run away!

Jircniv Rune Farlord El Nix.

451
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,750
[AINS]
It's been a while, hasn't it?

452
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,010
Indeed, it has!
What a pleasant surprise!

453
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,340
It just seems so unlikely that
we would meet here like this!

454
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,850
[AINS]
Yes, and yet, here we are.

455
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,140
The power of coincidence
can be quite frightful!

456
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,430
[JIRCNIV]
If this information leaked,

457
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,730
what else does he know?

458
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,980
I was so cautious!
Nothing is safe!

459
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,110
In one move, he's crushed
my alliance with the Theocracy

460
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,610
and sent both of our
countries spiraling!

461
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,360
[AINS] Are these associates
of yours, Your Highness?

462
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,490
[JIRCNIV]
I see. It's a test of loyalty!

463
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,830
He's forcing me to either
protect the Theocracy

464
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,290
or sell them out and ally
with the Sorcerer Kingdom!

465
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,410
Forgive me.

466
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,870
I cannot offer a
proper introduction.

467
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,710
I'm afraid that an
urgent matter came up,

468
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,840
requiring my
immediate attention.

469
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,630
I'm sure that His Highness
would be happy

470
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,710
to fill you in on the details.

471
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,130
[AINS]
How unfortunate.

472
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,720
Don't let me keep you.

473
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,100
I'm certain we'll
meet again soon enough.

474
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,060
Until then, please
stay in good health.

475
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,640
What's wrong, El Nix?

476
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,190
Or may I call you
Master Jircniv?

477
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,820
You seem a bit pale.
Are you feeling unwell?

478
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,860
Uh, no. I'm doing fine.

479
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,150
[AINS]
I see. The body is a treasure.

480
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,660
You have to take care of it.

481
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,870
Well, better get to that match.
We'll speak later!

482
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,580
You thought to ensnare us.

483
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,990
I'm the victim, here!

484
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,750
How can we trust what you say?

485
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,540
This is an act
of pure cowardice.

486
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,750
I shudder to think what you
told him to just save yourself.

487
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,090
I didn't say a word!
It was all a trick!

488
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,090
What can do to
make you believe me?

489
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,720
[FIRE HEAD PRIEST] You've
lost all credibility with us.

490
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,140
[JIRCNIV]
Wait!

491
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,510
Before you go, please give
me your temple's opinion.

492
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
I need to know your position
on the Sorcerer King!

493
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,060
He's an evil undead.
There's nothing to say.

494
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,190
We refuse to acknowledge him
as a king, no matter what.

495
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,820
That is why we are
currently looking

496
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,530
for a means to destroy him.

497
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,730
If you question such a thing,

498
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,570
then you've fallen
for his trickery.

499
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,490
Do what you will, but we will
never play a part in it.

500
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,580
I'm sure this is just
what he planned for.

501
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,450
He's cunning, after all.

502
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,370
Far more than me, I fear.

503
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,410
Even though I'm sure you'll
find it hard to believe,

504
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,130
there's something you should
know before you make plans.

505
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,090
The Sorcerer King has proven
to be a benevolent ruler.

506
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,670
The people of E-Rantel
seem to be living in peace.

507
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,920
[WIND HEAD PRIEST]
Even if that's the case,

508
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,380
we don't know how long
his mercy will continue.

509
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,760
But they're safe right now.

510
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,720
So please avoid
any hasty actions

511
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,520
that might harm our country!

512
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,720
And one last thing.

513
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,350
I want you to watch
this next battle

514
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,140
from somewhere
in the colosseum.

515
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,480
If you find that he has any
weakness, please tell me!

516
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,530
Perhaps there will be
more to discuss later.

517
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,070
[ANNOUNCER 3A]
And here he is at last,

518
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,080
making his dramatic return!
It's the hero of the colosseum,

519
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,790
the most powerful fighter
in all the land!

520
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,410
Let's hear it for
the Warrior King!

521
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,000
[JIRCNIV] I can't win against
the Sorcerer King's cunning.

522
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,380
I can only place my bets on
the power of the human heart.

523
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,380
[WARRIOR KING yells]

524
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,220
Warrior King,
give him your worst!
