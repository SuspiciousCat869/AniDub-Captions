General! There are Quagoa

34
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,030
Apparently, the Quagoa
figured out a way

to get across the Great Chasm,

[AINS] What an honor that
someone so prestigious

has come to welcome me.

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,000
I assume that means the Quagoa
have been giving you trouble?

43
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,000
Ah. Very astute.

44
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,170
You were able to tell so much

45
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,260
from the fact that
I came to greet you?

46

[AINS] The situation
is rather apparent.

47
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,340
It seems that the
Sorcerer King's aware

48
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,930
of our current predicament.

49
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,970
It's looking dire.

It's taking up
all of our resources

to hold off the Quagoa attacks.

52

And since we have
no additional forces,

53

abandoning the city.

relations with your kingdom,

Please consider
accepting my help.

to spare, I can wait.

but does not move forward."

that, we're pretty much in.

If it was the work

Yes. I've heard that vegetables

require some thought.

160
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,400
[AINS] Please take all
the time you need.

161
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,770
There's no rush.

162
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,690
Shall we speak of the Quagoa?

163
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,240
I believe I have repelled
their invasion for now?

164
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,030
Through my strength alone.

165
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,530
It's just as you say.

166
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,450
Until you arrived, we held them
off with one set of doors.

167
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,620
Had they been breached,

168
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,830
many dwarves would've
been killed there.

169
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,580
[AINS] However, the peace that
we have won for Feo Jera

170
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,750
is temperory, I fear.

171
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,170
[DWARVEN GENERAL] Yes,
now that they've found a way

172
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,840
to get past the Great Chasm,

173
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,880
we can expect that
they'll attack again.

174
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,010
[AINS] Then you should not
wait until things are too dire

175
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,140
to accept help. So?

176
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,760
Shall I lend you my strength?

177
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,270
With my kingdom's power,
we can easily prevent

178
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,190
any invasion for the
foreseeable future.

179
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,270
It goes without saying that this
would be very beneficial to us.

180
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,320
[AINS] Allow me to
take it a step further.

181
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,070
What if we could go to their
nest in... Feo Berkana, was it?

182
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,410
Then I could reclaim
the old dwarven capital

183
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,030
for your country.

184
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,450
You say that like
it's so easy!

185
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,620
With all due respect,
that's too dangerous!

186
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,410
It's ruled over by a Clan Lord.

187
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,670
He controls all eight
Quagoa factions!

188
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,750
We don't stand a chance,
even with you.

189
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,290
Not to mention the capital
is impossible to get to.

190
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,760
Three impasses would be awaiting
you in the trails ahead!

191
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,260
[HIGH PRIEST OF EARTH]
And even if you're able

192
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,510
to get through alive, there's
a terrifying frost dragon

193
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,390
that's settled in that area.

194
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,970
[AINS]
Hm. How intriguing.

195
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,470
One moment.

196
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,810
Do you really think that we
can reclaim our old capital?

197
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,230
[AINS]
Indeed.

198
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,480
[FORGEMASTER]
I find that hard to believe.

199
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,360
Why help us to that extent?
What exactly are you after?

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,900
Now, let us be respectful.

201
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,030
[FORGEMASTER] If a stranger
walks into a bar and pays off

202
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,950
your whole tab, you gotta wonder
what he's after, don't you?

203
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,490
[AINS]
Your suspicions are warranted.

204
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,660
But it's those sensibilities
that make you a desirable ally.

205
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,210
Despite their strength,
I have decided not to align

206
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,210
with the Quagoa, because
they are beasts at heart.

207
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,500
Furthermore, I recognize
the losing side

208
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,340
is always more grateful for
help than the winning party,

209
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,140
so this is a fine opportunity
to build our trust.

210
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,640
Tch.

211
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,600
[AINS] The second reason--
and I'll be frank with you all--

212
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,890
is that you have something
I desire in return.

213
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,930
There's the catch.

214
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,020
Then this is a
business transaction.

215
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,480
[AINS] Yes, though it may be
different than you expect.

216
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,940
I want to invite your
runesmiths to my kingdom.

[GROUP]
Huh?

218
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,320
What did you say?

219
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,700
So, you're here to
enslave our people?

220
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,870
[AINS] Why would I do that
to country I wish to have

221
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,950
diplomatic relations with?

222
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,200
I merely want to invite
your dwarven artisans

223
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,790
to practice their craft
in my land. It's that simple.

224
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,840
How about instead
if we gave your kingdom

225
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,040
the right to purchase items

226
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,500
before they were
sent off to market.

227
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,090
[AINS]
No.

228
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,050
The returns would not be high
enough to warrant such a deal.

229
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,800
I want to be the sole producer
of rune technology.

230
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,180
If you want our strength
to regain your capital,

231
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,140
this is what I am
asking for in return.

232
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,690
[AINS]
When can I expect a response?

We'll need until
tomorrow, Your Majesty.

Need I remind you, the Quagoa
are already attacking us?

Forgive my comrade here.

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,950
Can you please go wait in the
reception room, Your Majesty?

the terms you have set forth.

259
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,550

A wise choice.

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,510
Then I will lend you enough

and keep the Quagoa at bay.

As for the runesmiths,
we have agreed to let them

join your kingdom,
as you have requested.

send an investigation party in

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,850
For what reason do you
want rune technology?

314
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,690
Honestly speaking, it's an
artform that's on its way out,

315
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,820
even in this country.

316
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,070
[RUNESMITHS gasp]

317
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,080
[ELDER 406A] Wow.
What a beautiful black blade.

318
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,700
[RUNESMITH 406A]
Let me get a closer look!

319
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,040
[RUNESMITH 406C]
Pass it here!

320
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,500
--Back away!
--[RUNESMITHS yelp]

321
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,170
[AINS]
Be quiet! What a racket!

322
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,800
[AINS]
Please let me finish.

323
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,470
I'd like to know if
it's possible for you

324
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,640
to inscribe 20 runes on
a single sword, like this.

325
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,140
Frankly, I've never
heard of such a thing.

326
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,640
To my understanding,

327
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,770
the most that can be engraved
on a single piece is six.

328
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,860
But that was done
over 200 years ago.

329
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,150
It's just a record from
the golden age.

330
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,150
[RUNESMITHS gasp]

331
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,450
[AINS]
I see.

332
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,240
Then this must have been
made with technology

333
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,280
that has been since
lost, unfortunately.

334
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,830
[ELDER 406A]
You don't know where it's from?

335
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,500
[AINS]
I merely acquired this weapon,

336
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,160
I have no clue of its origin.

337
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,040
The ones who created it
are no longer of this world.

338
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,420
Then that is a terrible tragedy.

339
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,130
[AINS]
My wish is simple.

340
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,550
This precious knowledge has
been lost to the sands of time.

341
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,050
I want to revive this valuable
craft in the modern age!

342
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,350
In order to do so,

343
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,810
I need the expertise
of craftsmen such as you!

344
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,980
I would like to try!

345
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,360
[RUNESMITHS chattering]

346
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,150
[MOMONGA] They were more
enthusiastic than I expected.

347
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,450
The presentation
went over swimmingly!

348
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,080
Man, I just love this
feeling of accomplishment!

349
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,950
I would jump for joy
right now if I could.

350
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,620
That was amazing
work, Lord Ains!

351
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,210
You really inspired those
dwarves back there!

352
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,830
You're the only man in Nazarick

353
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,210
who could accomplish
such a thing!

354
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,250
[AINS]
It was nothing.

355
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,090
I only spoke the truth.

356
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,720
What's wrong, Gondo?

357
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,640
[GONDO] I suppose that means
the Regency Council agreed

358
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,970
to send all the runesmiths
to the Sorcerer Kingdom?

359
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,140
[AINS]
They have.

360
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,480
[GONDO]
I see.

361
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,020
My country doesn't have
a need for runes anymore.

362
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,730
They really gave
it up that easy?

363
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,700
[AINS]
Yes, Gondo. That's right.

364
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,450
But I'm different from them,

365
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,120
I see the potential
in your craft.

366
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,370
You may have been
discarded by your people,

367
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,000
but you will be
cherished in my kingdom.

368
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,000
That means this is far
from the end, right?

369
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,380
[GONDO] I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

370
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,670
We will do our best

371
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,140
to live up to your
expectations, Your Majesty.

372
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,180
[AINS] Starting tomorrow, we
will be leaving for a few days.

373
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,020
[GONDO]
Where are you headed, sir?

374
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,020
[AINS]
We're going to reclaim

375
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,060
the royal capital
of your people.

376
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,480
[gasps]

377
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,610
[DWARVEN GENERAL]
Your Majesty!

378
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,530
We came to talk to you about
your guide to the royal capital.

379
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,700
He insisted on
escorting you himself.

380
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,950
[AINS]
Hm.

381
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,080
Listen, I gave it
a lot of thought.

382
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
I talked it over
with my companions.

383
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,710
I've decided to join you

384
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,830
as I know the quickest
route to the capital.

385
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,590
[AINS] Gondo, I can't have you
risking your life like this.

386
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,760
[GONDO] I'm well aware
of the dangers, sir.

387
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,340
[clears throat]

388
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,390
[whispering] There's a treasury
there that includes a manual

389
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,260
of rune technology passed
down in the royal family.

390
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,810
I want to recover it
no matter the cost.

391
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,520
[AINS] Are you asking me to be
accessory to your pilfering?

392
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,860
Is that not a dwarven treasure?

393
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,480
[GONDO] Please, if a country
doesn't care if it loses

394
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,230
precious knowledge like that,
does it really need a book

395
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,200
about its secrets?

396
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,030
[AINS] I have a feeling I will
have a sudden bout of blindness

397
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,790
at what happens to be your
most opportune moment.

398
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,620
[gasps]

399
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,040
[AINS] Gondo, I shall
accept your guidance.

400
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,460
Outgoing party! Open 'em up!

401
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,880
[GONDO gasps]

402
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,550
[SHALLTEAR] Seems like
the Death Knights really put

403
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,680
these filthy beasts
in their place.

404
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,350
[AINS]
As one can expect.

405
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,810
--Mass Fly.
--[GONDO] Whoa!

406
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,560
[gasps] The bridge!

407
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,070
What happened here?

408
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,030
The Great Chasm is perilous
enough to cross on its own!

409
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,400
[AINS] I assume this is
the work of the Quagoa?

410
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,740
No, that can't be.

411
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,740
An opponent strong enough
to slay a Death Knight

412
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,620
would have no reason
to take out a bridge.

413
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,290
[AINS]
Shalltear, allow me to brief you

414
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,540
on some details while
we have the chance.

415
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,420
Pen and paper ready, My Lord!

416
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,050
[AINS clears throat]
We're about to go into

417
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,920
an extremely dangerous place.

418
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,880
I feel the need to
preemptively warn you,

419
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,890
there is a formidable foe
out there who was able

420
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,810
to best two of my Death Knights.

421
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,390
I shall do everything in
my power to defeat them!

422
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,020
[AINS] No, that is absolutely
not what you should do.

423
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,190
I'm afraid I don't understand.

424
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,520
[AINS] You must consider
what the enemy's

425
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,110
likely course
of action would be.

426
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,570
What our opponent wants
most is information--

427
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,940
a gauge on our strength.

428
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,400
[gasps]

429
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,490
[AINS] They will likely send in
a disposable strike team

430
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,080
to measure our capabilities.

431
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,620
Find something interesting
down there, kiddo?

432
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,750
That what I think it is?

433
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,960
Um. Pardon, Lord Ains.

434
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,500
[AINS]
Shh.

435
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,880
[AINS] As I was saying,
that's what I would do

436
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,260
against someone like that.

437
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,760
In fact, that's what my
comrades would've done, too.

438
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,510
You're sharing the wisdom of
the Supreme Beings with me?

439
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,260
[AINS] Shalltear, no matter
what, you must keep thinking.

440
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,100
Keep thinking. Keep
thinking. Keep thinking.

441
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,890
[AINS] Aura, what were
you trying to say?

442
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,020
It was nothing, sir! I'm sorry!

443
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,110
[AINS]
Mm. Very well.

444
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,780
Then, we should move forward
while preparing ourselves

445
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,570
for the possibility
of an enemy ambush.

446
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,870
[GONDO] There are still
two more dangerous areas!

447
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,870
The second one's a doozy.

448
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,910
[GONDO] A sea of lava with a
magical beast that--oh, well.

449
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,210
Alas, that's not all!

450
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,500
There's the labyrinth
of death, too!

451
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,550
It's a cave with
countless branching paths

452
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,590
where poisonous gas is
emitted from every direction.

453
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,050
Breathing it in
could result in death!

454
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,510
Gaseous or no, undead
beings aren't phased

455
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,260
by such inconveniences.

456
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,140
[AINS] Hence, we shall protect
the two of you with magic.

457
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,940
[AINS]
Breath of Titania.

458
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,860
[AINS] We'll be able to take
the quickest route through

459
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,190
using this.

460
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,610
Incredible!

461
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,950
[AURA]
Easy-peasy!

462
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,780
[AINS] Indeed. We'll reach
the royal capital soon.

463
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,580
Ready to hear
the rest of the plan?

464
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,910
[BOTH]
Yes!

465
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,660
[AINS] The two of you
will deal with the Quagoa.

466
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,620
If they submit to us, fine.

467
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,420
If they resist, do not hesitate

468
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,590
to show them the
power of Nazarick!

469
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,840
Oh, heck yeah!

470
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,710
As you wish, My Lord!

471
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,090
[AINS] I'll take care
of the dragon, myself.

472
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,510
[AINS]
A frost element, huh?

473
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,930
I've heard that there are quite
a few living frost dragons

474
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,470
that make their nests
on the other side

475
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,100
of the Azerlisia mountains.

476
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,480
There could be
hundreds up there.

477
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,020
[AINS] Ninya. You wouldn't
happen to know

478
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,440
the name of the dragon
with the power over nature?

479
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,480
[NINYA]
Huh?

480
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,570
Sorry. No idea.

481
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,530
[AINS] She said she
would find out the truth

482
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,700
once we made it back to town.

483
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,830
A shame she died.
