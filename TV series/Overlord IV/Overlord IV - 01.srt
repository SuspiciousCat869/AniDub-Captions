1
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:16,125
[ALBEDO sighs]
Lord Momonga.

2
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:28,458
It's the glorious dawn
of the Sorcerer Kingdom.

3
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:30,583
But what form shall it take?

4
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:36,083
What country shall Lord Ains
forge in his boundless wisdom?

5
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,542
It matters not.

6
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:38,875
Whatever your vision may be,

7
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,375
it is my sworn
duty to follow it.

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,417
Please, My Lord. Show it to me.

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,750
Oh! Show me everything,
Lord Ains!

10
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,166
[AINS]
It is time.

11
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,750
[FOIRE]
Yes, My Lord!

12
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:17,291
I will submit my report and
change shifts with today's maid.

13
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,625
Is there anything else you need?

14
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,542
[AINS]
I only ask that you rest well.

15
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,458
You worked hard,
staying up all night.

16
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,542
That's very kind
of you, My Lord!

17
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,458
I'm grateful, but it's my job
to serve you the best I can!

18
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,083
Don't worry about me!

19
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,667
[MOMONGA] They're really
not taking a hint.

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,333
[AINS]
Oops.

21
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:40,834
How do I tell them these bedside
shifts are a bit excessive?

22
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,542
What a pain.

23
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,250
[MOMONGA] What if I said that
I didn't want servants at all?

24
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,166
That I wanted us to be equals?

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,625
'Scuse me, Lord Ains!

26
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,000
Good morning!

27
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,667
--I will be assisting you today.
--[MOMONGA] Maybe...

28
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,125
Maybe if we did that, it would
be like the good old days.

29
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,917
It would be like having
my friends back.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,959
First off, let's get
you dressed.

31
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,792
What would you
like to wear today?

32
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,375
[AINS]
Here's an idea.

33
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,208
Why don't you decide, Fith?

34
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,625
That's perfect!
I know just the look!

35
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:13,041
Leave it to me!
You'll be thrilled!

36
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,792
[AINS] I hate to question
your expertise,

37
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,208
but I do worry that this robe
might be a bit gaudy for me.

38
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,500
There's no need to be
insecure, trust me!

39
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,083
A lesser ruler might
look pretentious

40
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,834
with all those jewels but you
can definitely pull this off!

41
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:28,125
Your black cloak certainly
has a wonderful mystique,

42
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,583
but it's nice to see
you in other colors!

43
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,875
[AINS]
Good morning, Nurunuru.

44
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,542
Time for breakfast.

45
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,417
[FITH]
Lord Ains.

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,667
Lady Albedo and the
Elder Liches are here.

47
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,208
[AINS]
Very well. You may let them in.

48
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,208
Greetings, My Lord.
It's a pleasure, as always.

49
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,125
What a dashing ensemble
you're wearing!

50
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,208
Why, it seems
as if it's glowing!

51
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,375
But these fine jewels
wouldn't shine so brightly

52
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,417
if they adorned anyone but you.

53
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,250
[AINS] Well, thank you
for the kind words, Albedo.

54
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,208
But I was merely
stating the truth!

55
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,208
I would never engage in
meaningless flattery, My Lord!

56
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,083
It's only natural that--

57
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,667
[AINS]
I get the idea.

58
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,667
Moving onto the
business at hand.

59
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,917
These are the documents
you put together last night?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Correct.

61
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,500
[MOMONGA] Nope. I don't
understand any of this.

62
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,542
I'm just an office worker--
Not even management!

63
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,500
There's no way I can
run an entire kingdom.

64
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,458
But I can't exactly
tell them that, now can I?

65
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,500
I'll just pretend to read these,
so I look the part at least.

66
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,417
Okay, last one.

67
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,250
Huh. What is this?

68
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,208
It's a report about
some materials, I think.

69
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,375
But the details don't
make any sense to me.

70
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,625
Did something catch
your attention?

71
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,875
[AINS]
No, just lost in thought.

72
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,834
More importantly,
have you constructed

73
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,667
a code of law for the kingdom?

74
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,667
I've discussed the
matter with Demiurge,

75
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,834
but we've only come up
with an initial draft.

76
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:00,166
[AINS] I speak with confidence
in many subjects,

77
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,750
but when it comes to
social law, I regret to say

78
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,333
that I'm not very knowledgeable.

79
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,083
But a supreme ruler such
as you commands all laws!

80
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,250
[gasps] I see!

81
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,125
You didn't bother learning any
laws, because you're above them,

82
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,959
so they're meaningless to you!

83
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,875
[AINS]
Yes, uh, naturally.

84
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,792
So, I'll allow you to
proceed as you see fit.

85
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,542
I believe in you.

86
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,125
[gasps] Thank you!

87
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll do my very best!

88
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,750
Is something wrong?

89
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,625
[AINS]
I didn't mean to stare.

90
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,083
Your smile was so cute,
it caught me off guard.

91
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,375
Excuse me, I can't
find the words.

92
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,792
This is terribly awkward.

93
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,166
[ALBEDO]
Oh, my! I'm so embarrassed!

94
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,542
[AINS]
Ahem! Moving on.

95
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,583
[gasps]

96
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,000
[AINS]
Let's handle our usual business.

97
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,625
These are various proposals
from the people of Nazarick.

98
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,000
I am going through
them personally

99
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,542
so that they remain anonymous.

100
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,625
[MOMONGA] That way I can
sneak in my own ideas, too!

101
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,250
[AINS]
Here's the first one.

102
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,500
"I think it would be good

103
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,375
to set up an educational
system for the children.

104
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,875
If we find and raise
talented individuals,

105
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,834
they will continue to strengthen
Nazarick for years to come."

106
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:13,083
Interesting.

107
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,083
Most likely from Yuri Alpha.

108
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,959
It is a foolish suggestion.

109
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,750
Pigs do not need knowledge.

110
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,959
All they need to do is
live, breathe, and die

111
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,500
for their master.

112
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,709
[AINS]
I agree in a sense, at least.

113
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,583
Knowledge is worth more
when it's monopolized.

114
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,166
But that's only one way
to look at the situation.

115
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,792
I think the proposal could
work out quite well, actually.

116
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,208
[gasps]

117
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,750
[AINS] Although it's not exactly
what Yuri had in mind,

118
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,125
I think we can salvage the play

119
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,250
by establishing an
orphanage in E-Rantel.

120
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,667
A more traditional school
may open Nazarick's secrets

121
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,583
and technology to espionage.

122
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,125
But if we pull prospective
students from the orphanage,

123
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,417
we can guarantee that
only the most talented

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,709
and loyal candidates
are elevated.

125
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,041
The orphanage itself can be
run by the war widows

126
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,583
created in the recent conflict.

127
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,709
So, not only will you
give children a home,

128
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,417
you'll also give jobs
to poverty-stricken women.

129
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,458
The masses will
surely applaud this.

130
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:05,083
Your popularity
will rise quickly.

131
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,250
[AINS] Then have Pestonya and
Nigredo attend to the matter.

132
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,041
Release them from house arrest
as soon as we're done here.

133
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,291
Perhaps I should
remind you, My Lord.

134
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,542
During our attack on the
capital, they were ordered

135
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,667
to kill the humans
that you captured.

136
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,750
To maintain the secrecy
of Jaldabaoth's

137
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,375
relationship to Nazarick.

138
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,625
Quite simple.

139
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:24,375
And yet those two
went against your orders.

140
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,709
They sheltered
an infant in secret.

141
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,208
Never mind their house arrest,

142
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,000
they should be executed
for their foul treachery.

143
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,208
[AINS]
Albedo...

144
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,417
Oh, please, My Lord.

145
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,625
Don't look at me with
that piercing gaze!

146
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,041
[AINS]
Huh?

147
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,291
[sighs] But your
orders are absolute.

148
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,083
I won't question them further.

149
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,166
I will release those two
from house arrest.

150
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,000
[AINS] And don't execute
them afterwards, please.

151
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,333
Of course.

152
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,667
[AINS]
Now, the next proposal.

153
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,917
"I would like to suggest
making uniforms

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,333
to give Nazarick a
stronger sense of unity."

155
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,500
An exceedingly
tasteless proposal.

156
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,959
Who suggested such a thing?

157
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,208
[MOMONGA]
I'm sorry! It was me!

158
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,917
Let me look into this matter.

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,625
The perpetrator must
face punishment.

160
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,542
[AINS] These are supposed
to be anonymous!

161
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,875
Also, when I asked
everyone for suggestions,

162
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,542
I promised there would
be no repercussions!

163
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,583
Fine, then.

164
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,291
[knocking]

165
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,750
You have guests!
It's Lady Aura and Lord Mare.

166
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,041
[AINS]
Let them in.

167
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,583
I missed you!

168
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,959
Good morning, Lord Ains!

169
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,834
[MARE]
Um, good morning, My Lord.

170
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,333
I like your robe.

171
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,709
[AINS]
Thank you, I suppose.

172
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:32,959
[AURA]
Good morning, Albedo!

173
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,166
Is something wrong?

174
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,000
You didn't make
an appointment first, so--

175
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,375
Hey! Wait!

176
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,375
[AINS]
Ah, is this what you wanted?

177
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,542
Huh?! His lap? How dare you!

178
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,792
It's no big deal!
He doesn't mind!

179
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,458
[AINS]
You can come, too.

180
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,625
Well, My Lord.
With your permission?

181
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,709
Is there room for me?

182
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,583
[AINS]
Albedo, please. You're an adult.

183
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,750
[ALBEDO squeals]

184
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:12,834
[AINS]
Don't mind her.

185
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:13,917
What brings you here?

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,125
No reason. We just
wanted to see you!

187
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:21,542
[AINS] Very well, then.
I'm happy to see you, too.

188
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:26,917
[ALBEDO]
Lord Ains. What if I was a baby?

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,875
[AINS]
Hm?

190
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,667
[mimicking baby cry]

191
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,208
You know, I think I've had
enough lap time for today.

192
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,625
Here. Why don't you
take my spot?

193
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,500
[AINS]
That's very generous of you.

194
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,959
All right, Albedo, come here.

195
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,000
Thank you!

196
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,333
[AINS]
You can sit on my lap,

197
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:48,917
but I'm not going
to pick you up.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,208
[MOMONGA]
So soft.

199
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,834
And wait. What's that fragrance?

200
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,959
Is there a problem, My Lord?

201
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,458
[AINS] I was just admiring
your lovely smell.

202
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:00,542
If you'd like to sniff me some
more, by all means, be my guest!

203
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,125
Sniff me for an hour
or sniff all day!

204
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,542
[AINS] An hour is a bit
excessive, I think.

205
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,917
[ALBEDO whines]

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,625
[AINS] Though, perhaps
I could sniff for a bit.

207
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,542
[MOMONGA] It smells
so familiar--what is it?

208
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,792
[AURA]
Lord Ains.

209
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,750
It looks really pervy
when you do that.

210
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,375
[AINS]
Oh. Sorry.

211
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,375
All right, we've had our fun.

212
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,750
Get down.

213
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,583
But this isn't fair.

214
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,625
Aura got on much
earlier than me!

215
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:28,875
I deserve more time!

216
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,583
Stop whining! You get to spend

217
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,583
way more time with
him than we do!

218
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,375
That's only natural, isn't it?

219
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,709
I have to for work.

220
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,542
Oh, I see! So, it's just a job!

221
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:43,750
Whereas I came here to visit
Lord Ain's because I wanted to!

222
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:47,291
[MOMONGA] Albedo's one thing,
but why's Aura acting like this?

223
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,417
[MOMONGA]
Maybe she lacks a father figure

224
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,583
and she wants more
attention from me?

225
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,500
This environment
isn't exactly ideal

226
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,625
for someone's
emotional development.

227
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,792
Maybe there's a kingdom of
dark elves they could visit

228
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,750
and make some friends.

229
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,000
Um, are you angry?

230
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,500
[AINS] Sorry, no, not at all.
My mind was wandering.

231
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,667
Worried about that
issue from before?

232
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,125
[AINS]
Yes, that's right. Naturally.

233
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,500
[MOMONGA]
What issue?!

234
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,542
I've given it some thought,
and I have a couple of

235
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,041
suggestions that
could be helpful.

236
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,041
[AINS]
I would expect nothing less!

237
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,458
Wait, is something bad going on?

238
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:22,667
Let's tell them.

239
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,208
They might have some
good ideas of their own.

240
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,500
[AINS]
I agree.

241
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,834
Please explain it to them
in a simple manner.

242
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,792
In a way that's
easy to understand.

243
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,709
For their sake, of course.

244
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:36,208
Also get off my lap.

245
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,583
All right.

246
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,792
Simply put, there's
not enough trade.

247
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,208
E-Rantel is facing
a shortage of goods.

248
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,583
That sounds bad.

249
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,000
[MOMONGA]
Uh-oh!

250
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,125
It must have been
in that document.

251
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,500
Until recently, E-Rantel was
a vital city of commerce.

252
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,667
But the sudden shift in power
seems to have worried merchants.

253
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,875
We have precious
little outside trade.

254
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,750
The amount of goods in
circulation keeps dropping.

255
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,166
So, what should we do?

256
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,291
We don't need to worry about it.

257
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,667
I'm sure Lord Ains
will fix everything.

258
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,917
Yeah! Right!

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,750
[AINS] Albedo, have we
taken any action yet?

260
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,500
We have. With any luck,

261
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,458
we'll be reaping the seeds
that Demiurge sowed in no time.

262
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,709
[AINS]
I see.

263
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,500
[MOMONGA] I'm sure
he has it under control,

264
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,834
but I thought he
was busy setting up

265
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,959
plans in the Holy Kingdom.

266
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,750
In the meantime,
I have a small matter

267
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,792
I need to attend to as well.

268
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,166
With your permission,

269
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,917
I'd like to go to the
Re-Estize Kingdom for now.

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,250
[AINS]
What? But you're responsible

271
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,709
for all of Nazarick's
domestic affairs.

272
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,583
That might be tough.

273
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,000
I promise I'll return
as soon as possible.

274
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,792
Pandora's Actor can take my
place for a while, can't he?

275
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,166
[AINS]
I suppose that might work.

276
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,792
I'll speak with him directly
about the matter.

277
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,166
I trust your judgement.
I expect good results.

278
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,542
And as for Demiurge...

279
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,166
No, never mind.

280
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,792
[AINS]
Now, let's continue.

281
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,458
Since the two of you are here,

282
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll listen to your
opinions, as well.

283
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,709
[MARE]
Opinions on what?

284
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,125
[AINS]
On anything.

285
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,792
I'm looking for ideas to
improve the Sorcerer Kingdom.

286
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,291
Speak freely.

287
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,166
[AURA] Ooh! In that case,
I have a great idea!

288
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,208
[AINS]
Oh? Go ahead.

289
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,583
I think that all of the boys
should dress up like girls!

290
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,208
And all of the girls
should dress like boys,

291
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,625
as required by law!

292
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,291
Yes. I agree. That sounds good.

293
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,375
[MOMONGA]
Bukubuku Chagama, why?

294
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,875
[MOMONGA]
That was a close call!

295
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,792
Even if it's a
degenerate indulgence,

296
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,166
Albedo won't question one
of the "Supreme Beings."

297
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,291
If I hadn't convinced
the twins that their creator

298
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,709
wanted them to be unique,
the kingdom would've taken

299
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,166
quite the turn!

300
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,417
[AINS]
Hm.

301
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,959
[AINS]
Wake up, Hamusuke.

302
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,792
Huh? Is it morning, already?

303
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,959
Oh! Hey there, Master of mine!

304
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,417
[AINS]
Call me Lord Ains in public.

305
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,333
Remember, you're the riding
beast of the great hero Momon.

306
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,917
That I am, Master. Yes, sir!

307
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,792
[AINS] So, why is that
Death Knight with you?

308
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,125
We're training partners, we are,
so we're together all the time!

309
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,750
[AINS]
Oh, that's right.

310
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,333
We were experimenting to see

311
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,917
if you two could
obtain Martial Arts.

312
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,291
[AINS]
Well, never mind that.

313
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,709
I'm looking for Momon
or rather, Pandora's Actor.

314
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,125
Have business with your
body double, do you?

315
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,125
He should be in that
building over there.

316
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,959
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Oh, Supreme One!

317
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,709
My dear, beloved
creator, Lord Ains!

318
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,291
[AINS]
Greetings are not necessary.

319
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,458
Sit.

320
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:36,000
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Sir! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

321
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,250
[MOMONGA]
Uh-- Come on!

322
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,792
There's an empty seat
right across from me!

323
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,208
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
What's wrong? Tell me!

324
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,959
[MOMONGA]
So intimate!

325
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,375
[AINS] There's no reason
to be so uppity.

326
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,041
I just need to go over
a few things with you.

327
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,041
First of all, how are you faring
as Momon's body double?

328
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,166
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
No issues, sir! In fact I--

329
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,750
[AINS]
Good! Good!

330
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,333
Do you have any other concerns?

331
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,875
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Actually,
there is something.

332
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,083
It's a tragedy!

333
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,000
I haven't touched
a magic item in ages!

334
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,250
That means no
regular maintenance

335
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,959
and no organizing our
data crystals, either!

336
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,041
Work left undone!

337
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,834
You must rectify
this matter, My Lord!

338
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,792
Let me touch them!
Just for a moment!

339
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,500
Those sweet magic items!

340
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,709
[AINS] Did I really
make you so emotional?

341
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,041
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Yes! These feelings

342
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,709
overflowing from my heart
were a gift from you!

343
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:25,875
[AINS] Of course. It's all
coming back to me now.

344
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,041
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Please allow
me to return to the treasury

345
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,166
and fulfill my only
purpose in life!

346
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,750
[AINS] I understand.
Let me speak to Shalltear.

347
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,500
I'll have her get
a teleportation ring

348
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,291
for you, all right?

349
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,250
--[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Sir, yes--
--[AINS] No. Stop. Stop.

350
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:43,959
I understand that your manner
of speech is my doing, probably.

351
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,750
But I have a suggestion.

352
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,583
Although I don't
recall why I set you

353
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,625
to these specifications,
I'm honored

354
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,792
that you've stuck
to them so diligently.

355
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,625
However, I also believe
that a child should surpass

356
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,458
the expectations
of their parents.

357
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,458
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Lord Ains!
You see me as your child?

358
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,500
[AINS]
Indeed, I do.

359
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,166
Thus, there's no need to salute

360
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,083
or act quite so
extravagantly before me.

361
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,166
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Ah, of course.

362
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,083
[AINS] I want to see you do
new and different things.

363
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,291
Things that exceed
my imagination!

364
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,000
I want to see your growth
as an individual!

365
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,166
[AINS]
Huh?

366
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,959
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
I understand, Father!

367
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,333
I will abide by your wishes

368
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:24,208
and blossom into
a beautiful new "me"!

369
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,291
[AINS]
Good.

370
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,333
Wait! Actually, one more thing.

371
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,750
Do as you like,
but don't mention

372
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,834
this conversation to anyone.

373
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,542
There will be unrest
if the others think

374
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,917
I give you
preferential treatment.

375
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,166
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Right.

376
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,333
[AINS] That goes for
you as well, Fith.

377
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,959
[AINS]
I will take my leave now.

378
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,417
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
One moment.

379
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,834
There's is something I want
to ask you, if you don't mind.

380
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,500
What kind of ruler do you intend

381
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,917
to be in this new
kingdom of yours?

382
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,417
Many people come to Momon with
trepidation in their hearts.

383
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,583
They ask what will
become of this country,

384
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,208
what will become of them.

385
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,709
Will they be forced
to work like slaves?

386
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,291
Will they be sent off
to fight in a war?

387
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,750
[AINS] What form should
the Sorcerer Kingdom take?

388
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,542
[AINS] Undead servants are
naturally quite productive.

389
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,667
They require neither sleep
nor rest, after all.

390
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,625
But I wonder.

391
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,625
Fith, what do you think
about this country?

392
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:38,917
[FITH]
Well, My Lord,

393
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,542
thanks to your
wisdom as a ruler,

394
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,917
life here is easy
and convenient.

395
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,125
However, it troubles
me that no one

396
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,917
comes running to worship you.

397
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,250
They hide when you show
your reverent figure.

398
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,083
I don't understand why they
would do such a shameful thing.

399
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,875
[AINS] I see. And what
do you think of humans?

400
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,083
Do you find them to be insipid?

401
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,667
I do.

402
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,959
They weren't created by any of
the supreme beings, after all.

403
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,500
They're wretched creatures.

404
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,959
[MOMONGA] It seems like all
the NPCs see humans as inferior,

405
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,959
as misguided as that is.

406
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,458
I used to hear the same sorts
of things from Narberal.

407
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:16,417
She called humans "worms"
when we traveled together.

408
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,542
Huh. Haven't been
to the guild in a while.

409
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,291
[AINS]
Is no one here?

410
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,250
[DESK ATTENDANT 401A]
Oh! Greetings, Your Majesty!

411
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,208
[AINS]
Not many quests, available.

412
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,500
Yes, I'm terribly
sorry, My Lord.

413
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,083
[AINS]
I'm not blaming you.

414
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,458
I was just curious.

415
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,041
The board used to be
overflowing with jobs.

416
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,500
At least, that's what I heard
from the adventurer, Momon.

417
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,083
Yes, that's true.

418
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,542
But monster hunting and security
quests are no longer necessary.

419
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,667
So, personal requests are
the only thing available now.

420
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,834
[AINS]
In other words, my undead forces

421
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,500
are properly
maintaining the peace.

422
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,083
[MOMONGA] Adventuring isn't
all it was cracked up to be,

423
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,625
so that's for the best.

424
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,583
[AINS]
Is the guild master in?

425
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,083
Yes, of course!

426
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,333
Wait just a moment and I'll let
him know that you're here.

427
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,792
[AINZACH] Your Majesty,
it's an honor for you to visit

428
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,542
this humble establishment.

429
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,333
Forgive me for offering
such a meagre welcome.

430
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,250
[AINS]
Let's talk, Ainzach.

431
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,291
I'm surprised the
Sorcerer King knows the name

432
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,834
of a commoner like me.

433
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,250
[AINS]
Of course.

434
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,291
[MOMONGA]
I feel like a sleazy salesman,

435
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,917
but I have to get him
on board for this to work.

436
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,291
Is there something on your mind?

437
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,792
[AINS]
Ah. I'll cut to the chase.

438
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,709
I'd like to absorb
the adventurer's guild

439
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,875
into the Sorcerer Kingdom.

440
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,417
Well, then no one will stop you.

441
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,625
[AINS]
Is that so?

442
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,709
I heard that the
adventurer guilds don't like

443
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,208
to align themselves
with any nation.

444
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,875
You have no objections?

445
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,083
I won't protest.

446
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,000
[AINS]
Mm. No, that's too easy.

447
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,792
I imagine you'll
tell the adventurers

448
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,166
to leave the kingdom.

449
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,417
Then, once they've all
cleared out, you'll hand me

450
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,166
an empty shell of
an organization.

451
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,375
[AINS]
Tell me this.

452
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,208
Why is it that
the adventurer guilds

453
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,208
never involve themselves
with the government?

454
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,959
It's quite simple.
Because adventurers exist

455
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,333
to protect the people. If we
lent our strength in a war,

456
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,792
then that would
betray our purpose.

457
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,834
[AINS] Hmph. Your duty
is to protect the people?

458
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,375
And how would you
define "people," exactly?

459
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,458
Do you only mean humans?

460
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:27,542
I don't follow, My Lord.

461
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,500
[AINS]
What about elves and half-elves?

462
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,834
Races that live
alongside humans?

463
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:34,834
Well, yes. They're
included, of course.

464
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,458
[AINS] Aren't elves treated
as slaves in the Empire?

465
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,625
It doesn't sound like
you're protecting them.

466
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,583
What about other
intelligent creatures?

467
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,834
Ones with less "traditionally
appealing" forms, I mean.

468
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,792
Like lizard men,
orcs, and goblins?

469
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,375
Your Majesty.
Those are subhumans.

470
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,834
Are you trying to mock me?

471
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:56,458
[AINS] Hm. As an undead,
they're not much different

472
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,083
than humans to me.

473
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,208
[AINS]
Well, have a seat.

474
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,959
Listen to my proposal.

475
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,917
[AINS]
To me, the ideal adventurer

476
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,333
is not a mere fighter,

477
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,583
but someone who
explores the unknown.

478
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,583
And through that
exploration, they have

479
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:17,041
the unique opportunity to make
our world a better place.

480
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,125
Can you elaborate, please?

481
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,083
[AINS] Until now, most of your
jobs were monster hunting

482
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,083
or security details--
Mercenary work.

483
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,125
But there is no need for that
in the Sorcerer Kingdom.

484
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,875
My subordinates are tireless
and much stronger

485
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:33,000
than the average adventurer.

486
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,750
But while they're quite adept
at killing, I'm not confident

487
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,375
they would do as well
charting a course

488
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,959
into unknown lands.
Especially if the goal

489
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,417
is to establish amicable
relations with the people there.

490
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,250
Embarrassing, I know.

491
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,875
Your Majesty.

492
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,625
That's why I want adventurers
to take up this role.

493
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:52,959
I can protect the kingdom,
they will explore beyond it.

494
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,959
Why not simply post a request?

495
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,834
I don't see why the government
needs to get involved in this.

496
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,834
If I post my request and
problems arise between

497
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:03,583
unknown races or countries,
will the guild be able

498
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,625
to resolve these
issues on their own?

499
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,166
Since you're an
independent body,

500
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,583
the kingdom would
disavow any involvement.

501
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,542
But since you exist in my
territory, I won't tolerate

502
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,542
any actions that cause
this kingdom harm.

503
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,041
That's awful.

504
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,083
[AINS] Which is why I need
to take the adventurer's guild

505
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,875
under my wing if
I want this to succeed.

506
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,291
But this is an
important operation,

507
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,375
so I vow to give you
my complete support.

508
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,500
There's something I need
to get straight, first.

509
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,250
You talk about exploring
new lands, but are you only

510
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,750
doing that because you intend
to invade them later?

511
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,709
[AINS] That's not the plan,
but I can't make any promises.

512
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,417
If we find a nation that is an
imminent threat to our kingdom,

513
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,291
we may need to take action.

514
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,667
Fair enough.

515
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,208
[AINS]
And consider this.

516
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,875
I have enough military power
to do all the invading I choose.

517
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,792
I don't expect adventurers to
gather intel and chart a course

518
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,291
for that, when I have
more effective means.

519
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,125
As things stand now,
adventurers are simply

520
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:00,041
glorified exterminators. I want
to elevate them beyond that.

521
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,542
I want them to embody
the spirit their title invokes.

522
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,375
Your guild will be reborn!

523
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:17,291
You will become adventurers,
in the true sense of the word!

524
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,083
It is a very compelling
offer, Your Majesty.

525
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,625
I do admit.

526
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,542
Count me in.

527
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,250
You brought a spark back
to this old adventurer.

528
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,667
The unknown's calling for us
and it's time to answer.

529
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,917
[AINS]
Fith.

530
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
My Lord?

531
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,291
[AINS]
There's nothing I treasure more

532
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,834
than servants like you.

533
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:43,291
You're the creations left
behind by my beloved comrades.

534
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm honored you think that!

535
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,709
[AINS] But I must bestow love
upon those I rule over as well.

536
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,667
This is my kingdom, after all.

537
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,333
I must show it proper
care and affection.

538
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,750
Absolutely, My Lord, I agree!

539
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,041
[AINS]
Then, let us create a utopia.

540
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:05,625
A land as sweet as honey--
a dream that never ends.

541
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:07,792
A kingdom where the
people bow before me

542
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,458
in reverence and gratitude.

543
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,458
How wonderful! I can
hardly wait to see it!

544
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,500
[AINS] But this will not be
a utopia for humans alone.

545
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,792
All humanoid races shall
flourish beneath my banner

546
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,709
and all non-humanoid
races as well!

547
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:23,458
We shall let the world know.

548
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:26,625
Eternal prosperity can only
be found under the rule

549
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:28,750
of the Sorcerer Kingdom!

550
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,667
[MOMONGA]
This is my purpose!

551
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,125
I'll recreate the guild of Ains
Ooal Gown here in this world.

552
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,709
And if my comrades are
still out there somewhere,

553
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,917
then maybe they'll take notice
and I can show them my work

554
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
with pride in my heart.
