1
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,550
[RIYURO] So, the enemy
had a secret weapon?

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,980
One so powerful that you
abandoned the plan and fled?

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,650
Think you were followed?

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,690
[YOHZ]
I can't be sure.

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,480
But we destroyed the bridge.

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,570
It would be pretty difficult for
the enemy to chase us down.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,870
Golems in black armor,
but you only saw two?

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,080
If the dwarves mount
an attack on us,

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,910
I have a feeling they may
break out a few more.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,580
So? What's it gonna
take to beat 'em?

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,340
[YOHZ]
They're strong, Lord Riyuro.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,590
But they're no match for you.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,970
[RIYURO]
Want one?

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,890
No. I'm fine.

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,850
--Your loss.
--[door opens]

16

[QUAGOA 407A]
Clan Lord!

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,230
A small party is approaching us,

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,230
from the direction
of the dwarven city!

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,690
Seems they found a way
to follow you here after all.

20
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,860
If they're that bold,

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,030
they probably have
some golems with them.

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,940
I'm going to pay
the dragons a visit.

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,570
Yohz, move all the Quagoa
to the abandoned district,

24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,530
just to be safe.

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,120
So, we won't fight?

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,160
[RIYURO]
Why would we do that

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,080
when the dragons
can fight for us?

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,380
That way, we'll weaken both
of our enemies at once.

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,590
[OLASIRD'ARC]
Clan Lord Riyuro.

30
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,890
What brings you here?

31
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,560
Tell me.

32
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,060
[RIYURO] First, allow me
to humbly thank you

33
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,400
for this audience, Great White
Dragon Lord, Olasird'arc.

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,520
You can spare the flattery.

35
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,650
[RIYURO] Of course. Getting
straight to the point, then.

36
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,740
I've come in hopes of borrowing
some of your strength

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,860
to vanquish a group of
invaders marching on our city.

38
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,120
We believe the enemies
to be dwarves.

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,790
I'd like to teach them a lesson.

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,500
If Lord Olasird'arc would
defeat them on our behalf,

41
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,040
we could offer a fitting reward.

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,920
What say you, honored wives?

43
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,680
Let's remind them
who this city belongs to.

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,800
Squashing a few lowly
dwarves should be simple.

45
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,640
That's my sentiment, too.

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,350
A dragon lord
should instill fear

47
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,560
in the hearts of those
who oppose them.

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,730
I agree, but I
don't much like it.

49
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,980
It's terribly audacious
of them to attack,

50
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,400
knowing that we're here.

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,150
Perhaps these troops are
more formidable than we think.

52
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,780
But if that's true, it would
be foolish to ignore them.

53
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,160
So be it.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,780
Rejoice, lowly Quagoa,

55
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,660
for I have decided
to grant your request.

56
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,000
[RIYURO]
Thank you. That's very generous.

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,670
But I will require
ten times more gold.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,250
That seems like a bit much!

59
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,210
Your survival comes
free of charge,

60
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,800
but I have named the
price of my assistance.

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,590
[RIYURO]
No, you're right. Of course.

62
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,260
Just allow us to
prepare the money.

63
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,060
[MIANATALON]
Will you be going personally?

64
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,100
Of course not. I'll send
one of our sons.

65
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,940
Anyone have a suggestion?

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,810
This would be a fine test
for my eldest child.

67
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,690
You mean Hejinmal?

68
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,030
He's sharp, you know.

69
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,280
Any dragon could defeat
a couple of dwarves,

70
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,650
but he may be able to
negotiate terms with them

71
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,950
that would benefit you far more.

72
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,450
Very well. Bring Hejinmal to me.

73
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,960
[KEYLISTRAN] I can't.
He won't leave his room.

00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,210
Break his door down!

But, My Lord, you've always said

78
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,880
we should take great care not
to destroy your precious castle.

79

Enough of this,
I'll get him myself.

[OLASIRD'ARC] It's your father,
open the door now.

I won't ask again.
Don't defy me!

[gasps] Wh-Why, hello, Father!

To what do I owe
this great honor?

85
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,210
I have a job for you.
It's time to prove your worth.

Apparently, the dwarves are
coming to attack the Quagoa

and they need us.
Take care of it quickly.

"Eek"?

I was just sneezing, that's all!

91
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,640
I'm terrible at fighting.
Why did they ask me?

92
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,980
[HEJINMAL] Well, the dwarves
don't know that.

93
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,320
Hopefully they'll run
when they see a dragon,

94
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
even a cowardly one.

[HEJINMAL] Hm?

One dwarf, an I-don't-know-what,

That's an elder lich!

My frost breath will be
completely useless on him!

I bet he'll cast a nasty
fireball and burn me up!

102
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,220
Why is he wearing
such a fancy robe?

103

Who is he?

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,810
Ugh. My stomach hurts.

105
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,940
You're about to enter a dragon's
nest. Perhaps you're lost?

106
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,990
[clears throat] I mean,
please state your business here.

107
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,410
[AINS] I assume you're the
frost dragon that's taken over

108
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,370
the dwarven capital?

109
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,200
You seem a bit soft
around the edges.

110
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,040
I... I am the son
of that fearsome dragon!

111
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,170
[HEJINMAL]
Um, uh-oh.

112
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,880
These people--they're not
afraid of dragons at all!

113
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,510
That can't be a good sign!

I am Ains Ooal Gown.

But why are you making
that strange pose?

This is a gesture to
express my utmost adoration!

is a man of
extraordinary status!

123

[AINS]
So, you submit to me?

124
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,330
At the very least, I can
find use for your parts:

125
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,300
meat, fangs,
scales and the like.

126
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,130
Stand up for a moment.

127
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,590
[AINS]
I see.

128
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,140
Dragons survive
these cold conditions

129
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,470
by accumulating
subcutaneous fat.

130
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,270
Actually, the fat belly
is kind of specific to me.

131
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,440
[AINS]
Interesting.

132
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,730
So, you're a rarity
among your species?

133
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,730
[HEJINMAL]
That's a generous way to put it!

134
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,530
[AINS] In that case, it would
be a waste to kill you.

135

How many other
dragons are there?

136
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,620
Plenty! There are
four larger than me,

137
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,910
six about my size,
and nine that are smaller.

138
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,250
[AINS]
Splendid!

139
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,830
Aura, you may have
this dragon, if it suits you.

140
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,130
Thank you so much, Lord Ains!

141
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,830
Just so there's
no misunderstanding,

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,630
I'll make it clear

[yelps]

147
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,680
My apologies, I assure you

148
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,020
I only urinated out
of unbridled joy!

149
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,360
[AINS]
This is not uncommon with pets.

150
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,610
In fact, Ankoro
Mocchi Mochi said

151
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,820
that her dog used to piddle
when it was excited to see her.

152
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,030
Troublesome, but harmless.

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,660
Even Supreme Beings
deal with pet pee?

154
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,330
[AINS] Just think of it
as an expression of emotion.

155
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,580
Well then, perhaps I
too should urinate

156
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,460
to express the joy I feel
standing beside you.

157
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,790
How about no?

158
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,210
Also, the fact that you
suggested that so casually

159
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,710
is kind of creepy.

160
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,760
[AINS] Yes, let's leave
the public urination

161
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,300
to the pets, please.

162
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,050
Otherwise, I might
collapse in shock.

163
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,850
--[SHALLTEAR, AURA chattering]
--[AINS laughing]

164
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,350
So, what are we going to do now?

165
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,430
[AINS]
I'll leave the Quagoa

166
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,980
in Aura and Shalltear's
capable hands.

167
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,980
In the meantime,
I'll take our new pet

168
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,020
and go deal with
the frost dragons.

169
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,900
Huh?

170
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,070
Here, Your Great Majesty.

171
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,950
Uh. Beyond this door
lies my father,

172
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,250
the dragon lord Olasird'arc,
along with his three wives.

173
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,660
If all of his queens are there,

174
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,330
then I assume we're
about to see your mother?

175
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,630
Yes.

176
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,540
I'm sure this is
gonna be a bloodbath,

177
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,380
but perhaps you could save
the boy's mother at least?

178
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,130
[AINS] No promises,
but I shall do my best.

179
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,390
That's very generous of you,
Your Great Majesty!

180
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,680
[AINS]
You needn't be quite so formal.

181
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,270
So long as you are loyal,

182
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,020
you may call me "Ains"
or "Sorcerer King."

183
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,190
Understood!

184
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,770
Thank you, Your Majesty
the Sorcerer King!

185
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,860
The man standing upon my back

186
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,450
is the Sorcerer King
Ains Ooal Gown!

187
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,950
His Majesty shall
henceforth rule this land

188
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,790
and all dragons
that reside here.

189
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,500
You shame yourself!

190
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,920
[whimpers]

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,670
[AINS]
Dragon Lord. If you submit to me

192
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,670
without question,
I will allow you to live.

193
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,760
I would never bow
to a skeleton.

194
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,550
[AINS]
I see that my mercy is wasted

195
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,260
on one as witless as yourself.

196
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,600
Such insolence!
I'll grind you to dust!

197
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,980
[AINS]
Grasp Heart!

198
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,360
[sputters]

199
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,240
[AINS] Hejinmal.
Which one is your mother?

200
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,990
Dragons have valuable parts,

201
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,330
so I'll be killing the
other two in short order.

202
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,120
--[KEYLISTRAN] It's Me!
--[MIANATALON] Here! Me!

203
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,540
[AINS] What? Did one
mother lay your egg,

204
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,000
one mother warm it
and one mother hatch it?

205
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,540
Yes, precisely so, Your Majesty.

206
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,050
It is my great fortune
to have three mothers!

207
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,300
[AINS]
I see.

208
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,680
A pity, but I shall keep
my word all the same.

209
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,100
Since you have been spared,
make yourselves useful.

210
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,010
Gather all the dragons
in this castle

211
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,770
and inform them
of their new ruler.

212
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,020
[MUNUINIA, KEYLISTRAN]
My Lord!

213
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,770
[AINS] Hejinmal. Collect
any dwarven documents

214
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,270
you've seen in the capital
and bring them to me.

215
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,230
Of course, Your Majesty!

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,070
[AINS]
And now we wait.

217
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,240
[GONDO]
This is our chance.

218
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,990
Shall we open the
treasury and peek around

219
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,530
while everyone is gone?

220
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,330
[AINS chuckles] Quite the
little villain, aren't you?

221
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,750
This item can only be used
seven times, but it's worth it.

222
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,840
[gasps]

223
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,890
[AINS]
Mm.

224
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,640
Truly magnificent!

225
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,100
[AURA]
All right! Let's do this!

226
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,650
[AURA] I've contained
them in this space,

227
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,610
so our first order
of business is to see

228
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,450
if they'll join us willingly.

229
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,030
And if they refuse, I will
butcher them aggressively

230
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,330
until only 10,000 remain.

231
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,960
Just don't overdo it.

232
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,910
Maybe "aggressively"
isn't the right word.

233
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,790
What I meant to say is that
I'll butcher them cautiously

234
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,460
with the utmost care,
so nothing goes wrong!

235
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,960
Use your head, okay?

236
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,760
That's precisely what I've
been doing this entire time!

237
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,380
And speaking of using my head,
I've mulled it over,

238
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,100
and I truly don't think there's
anything here powerful enough

239
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,600
to defeat our Death Knights.

240
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,640
I can't help but feel
that Lord Ains' concerns

241
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,480
are a bit unfounded for once.

242
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,600
Were you always such a dope?

243
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,730
If you were really thinking,

244
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,730
you would have
figured it out by now!

245
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,400
The only reason
the Death Knights died

246
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,030
is 'cause they fell
down the chasm.

247
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,950
Their footprints were on
one side of the bridge,

248
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,990
but nowhere to be
found on the other.

249
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,280
If they didn't cross the bridge,
then they must have fallen

250
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,990
when it was destroyed.

251
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,450
I don't see how
that changes things,

252
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,250
as it still means that
Lord Ains guessed wrong.

253
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,460
Ugh! You know how
perceptive Lord Ains is!

254
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,000
He figured it out ages ago.

255
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,630
[AURA] When I was checking
the ground for footprints,

256
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,340
he signaled for me to stay quiet

257
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,470
before I said what happened
to the Death Knights.

258
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,640
I thought he shushed you
because he was talking.

259
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,220
But wait, he did
that to test me?

260
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,730
More like he was
encouraging you to think.

261
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,060
It's good to prepare
for every possibility.

262
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,570
But you didn't hear
that from me.

263
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,940
Let's say you figured it
out yourself, okay?

264
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,070
Yes. It'll be our
secret, of course!

265
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,950
Where did all of
this fog come from?

266
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,460
Hey Yohz.

267
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,040
Just to be clear, those two
aren't golems, are they?

268
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,290
No, sir. They're
smaller, for one.

269
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,750
[RIYURO]
We've got a whole army here,

270
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,420
and they're waltzing
right up to us.

271
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,550
That's not a good sign.

272
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,050
Don't do anything aggressive.
Let me talk to them.

273
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,050
What?! On your own?

274
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,350
If they kill me,
then that's that.

275
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,810
I guess you can
figure out the rest.

276
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,190
[AURA]
Who are you?

277
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,150
I am the Clan Lord
of the Quagoa.

278
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,110
My name's Pe Riyuro.

279
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,950
So, uh, what brings you here?

280
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,070
[SHALLTEAR]
We have come on orders

281
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,160
from the great and
wise Sorcerer King.

282
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,080
Our mission is to subjugate
your Quagoa clan.

283
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,120
Just you?

284
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,330
[SHALLTEAR]
I'm more than enough.

285
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,370
Now kneel and bow your heads.

286
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,540
I was told there were
others in your party.

287
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,960
Would you mind telling
me where they went?

288
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,380
There's no need to tell you
that or anything else.

289
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,210
You may submit to
our rule or refuse,

290
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,550
but I will not indulge
your pointless questions

291
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,840
or attempts to deter us.

292
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,050
There are 60,000 Quagoa here.

293
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,100
It's simply not logical for
a force this size to surrender

294
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,100
without question, especially
when there are only two of you

295
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,400
and we don't have a
grasp of your strength.

296
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,940
I'm not going to argue with you,

297
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,440
but just so we're
perfectly clear,

298
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,110
we have been ordered to
cull your numbers considerably

299
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,650
and force your surrender
if you will not submit.

300
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,990
Can't we discuss this?

301
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,530
Only 4,000 males, 4,000 females,

302
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,990
and 2,000 children
will be spared.

303
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,250
Choose them if you'd like!

304
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,500
Once we're done
with the massacre,

305
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,790
we'll take you to the
Sorcerer Kingdom.

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,240
The golems we fought were
nothing compared to this!

313
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,830
We've gotta make
a run for it, quick!

314
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,830
We can't run! Where would we go?

315
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,210
They didn't make any demands,

316
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,880
they're just--
just butchering us!

317
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,840
At this rate, I'll be
finished in no time.

318
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,260
[QUAGOA 407F groans]

319
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,810
My chosen heroes,
now is your chance.

320
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,480
Although the enemy is fearsome,
they're surely exhausted by now,

321
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,940
and if anyone can
defeat them, it's you.

322
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,520
Heroes, prove your worth!

[QUAGOA yell]

Lord, are you sure?

325
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,280
[RIYURO]
It's all we can do.

326
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,590
It seems their demands
will be met in the end.

327
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,760
At this point, all we can do
is choose who dies.

328
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,760
That means all hope is lost.

329
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,470
If they keep their word,
10,000 of us will remain.

330
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,640
With a number like that,

331
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,390
we'll have a chance
to rebuild someday!

332
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,680
I would have surrendered
if I'd known!

333
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,770
You could have told me
how strong you were!

Monsters.

335
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,320
What kind of wicked kingdom
do you come from?

336
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,320
[HEJINMAL] I have returned,
Great Sorcerer King.

337
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,200
The other dragons are here to
pledge their allegiance to you.

338
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,290
[AINS]
You may raise your heads.

339
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,500
[MOMONGA] I mean,
allegiance is fine and all,

340
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,750
but I was kind of hoping

341
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,210
I'd get my hands on a
few more dragon corpses.

342
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,170
[TRANGEALIT]
This is unacceptable!

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,050
Watch your tongue, Trangealit!

344
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,920
You look weak.

[SHALLTEAR]
Greetings, Lord Ains!

351
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,330
We've followed your orders

352
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,830
and finished the
culling of the Quagoa!

353
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,370
Whoa.

354
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,670
[AINS] I see. They didn't
accept my kindness.

355
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,670
It seems they were more
foolish than I'd hoped.

356
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,470
[AINS] Clan Lord of the Quagoa,
you may raise your head.

357
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,180
My Lord.

358
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,470
[AINS] I am known
to be a merciful king.

359
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,850
I shall grant you a kindness

360
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,770
that you would have
denied the Dwarves.

361
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,690
Refusing to accept my
conditions was a grievous sin,

362
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,440
but I shall allow it
to be washed away

363
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,270
by the blood of your people.

364
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,270
So long as you work hard for me,

365
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,940
I promise prosperity
to the Quagoa.

366
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,900
Then we pledge our loyalty,
and I vow that our people

367
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,870
and their descendants will serve
you with all our body and soul.

368
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,120
[AINS] That's a fine
answer. I like you.

369
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,330
Thank you for your
outstanding work.

370
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,880
You've made me very proud today.

371
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,000
It was our pleasure!

372
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,380
Ah! Such kind words!

373
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
Although I'll never forget
the mistakes I've made,

374
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,380
the shame in my heart
can finally fade away!

375
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,630
[AINS]
Uh, yes.

376
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,640
So, did you encounter
any formidable enemies?

377
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,140
The Clan Lord's stronger
than the rest, but not by much.

378
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,640
[AINS]
I see.

379
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,560
Then who defeated the Death
Knights in the Great Chasm?

380
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,650
[AINS]
Aura, Shalltear, come with me.

381
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,450
I have a confession to make.

382
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,490
Do you remember when I told
you to be wary of our foes?

383
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,030
That they possessed
a force strong enough

384
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,910
to defeat my Death Knights?

385
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,250
It seems that was a bit of
poor judgement on my part.

386
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,420
[SHALLTEAR]
It's all right Lord Ains!

387
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,880
I already know!
You did that for me,

388
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,800
so that I would think harder
and expand my horizons!

389
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,920
You only pretended
to say a foolish thing!

390
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,050
I'm touched that you would shame
yourself to help me improve!

391
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,430
My heart is overflowing
with gratitude!

392
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,060
You've been patient
with my incompetence

393
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,060
and thoughtful, always!
I'll remember this lesson!

394
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,520
[AINS] An impressive display
of personal growth!

395
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,230
However, though my mistake
was a ruse this time,

396
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,070
I am not all-knowing, and am
just as capable of failure

397
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,490
as anyone else.

398
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,610
Although I can't imagine
a Supreme Being

399
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,280
such as yourself
making a mistake,

400
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,660
I shall remain diligent
all the same!

401
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,910

I wish you well, Runesmiths!

May you sharpen your skills
and achieve success

to join your associates?

[GONDO]
You're breaking my heart, here.

411
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,900
I don't have the talent
to be considered

412
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,990
a real runesmith like them.

413
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,540
Sulking aside,

414
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,040
this food is extraordinary,
made from such fine ingredients.

415
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,460
And I've never seen
liquor of this kind.

416
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,380
This feast is a farewell
that we'll remember

for the rest of our lives!

And let me say, I am
in awe of your genius!

Why, in no time, you got both
the Empire and these dwarves

I only wish I was
worthy of such praise.

432
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,960
I wonder, how many steps ahead
do you see, Lord Ains?

433
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,720
[MOMONGA] I'm flying
by the seat of my pants!

of something cool to say!

Speaking of cool.

436
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,180
I remember a Guild in Yggdrasil
called the Millennium Kingdom

437
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,640
that used a crane on its flag.

438
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,060
Yamaiko told me there's
an old Japanese proverb

439
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,270
that says cranes live
for 1,000 years,

440
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,940
and turtles live for...

00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,940
[gasps] You see that far ahead?

443
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,200
[AINS]
No, it was a joke.

444
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,320
In that case, some of
your strategies take on

445
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,030
a whole new meaning.

446
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,410
For starters, you've been using
the undead for physical labor

447
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,120
more and more, as time goes on,

448
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,830
the whole world becomes
dependent on them.

449
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,040
It's almost frightful.

450
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,750
[AINS]
I assure you I'm not thinking

451
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,590
that deeply into things.

452
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,300
Yes, of course.
Say no more, My Lord.

453
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,260
I shall keep your
words in my heart.

454
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,930
Your vision of the future
is mine as well!

456
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,560
[AINS]
I'm counting on you, Demiurge.

457
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,390
I completely understand,
