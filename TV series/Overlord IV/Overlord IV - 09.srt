1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,140
Now, civilities aside,

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,930
what is it that brings
you here today?

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,520
Well, just recently,
we were transporting

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,810
some relief supplies
through your kingdom.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,020
They were stolen
by a certain noble.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,520
As ruler of this nation,
I would like to apologize

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,070
for the inexcusable
actions of my subject.

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:29,950
Furthermore...

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,200
[gasps]

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,200
If I were to offer
my head to you,

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,870
would that be enough
to settle this matter?

12
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,590
[gasps]

13
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,340
[ALBEDO chuckles]

14
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,590
Interesting.

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,970
Seems I've misjudged you,
Ramposa the 3rd.

16
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,770
Not that it matters much.

17
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,440
Though I do wonder
what caused this change.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,190
Is it because you recognized
the talents of your child?

19
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,820
Or because you lost
your greatest warrior?

20
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,740
Perhaps you don't
realize it yourself,

21
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,320
but something inside
you has shifted.

22
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,740
Never mind that,
just a bit of idle musing.

23
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,330
My purpose here
remains the same.

24
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,710
In response to the
aforementioned attack,

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,620
we're declaring war on you.

26
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,000
[gasps]

27
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,630
We will deploy our troops,
at precisely noon,

28
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,960
one month from now.

29
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,510
However, if you invade
E-Rantel, we may be forced

30
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,010
to alter the timeline
and defend our territory.

31
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,310
Now, I have a message
from His Majesty.

32
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,140
You planned this treachery
from the start, didn't you?

33
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,190
I was about to grace you with
the words of the Sorcerer King,

34
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,110
and you have the audacity
to interrupt me?

35
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,610
Human.

36
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,780
Are you so eager to die,
you can't even wait a month?

37
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,280
[gasps]

38
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,830
[ALBEDO sighs]
This is His Majesty's message.

39
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,000
"I do not intend to cast any
spells on the same scale

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,620
as the previous war.

41
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,130
Let's enjoy ourselves
this time."

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,050
That is all.

43
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,800
And now to answer your question.

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,220
This war was not one
that we had planned,

45
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,430
nor one we tried to instigate.

46
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,470
Rather, we were shocked that
anyone would be foolish enough

47
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,970
to provoke our kingdom's wrath.

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,530
[CHILDREN]
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

49
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,860
Hup! Hup!

50
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,990
[DISCIPLE 409A] The Sorcerer
Kingdom gave us one month

51
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,240
to prepare for their invasion.

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,790
Their declaration of war
seemed sincere enough,

53
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,830
but they haven't shown
any sign of mobilizing

54
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,960
their troops whatsoever.

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,670
Maybe they were just
trying to scare us.

56
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,710
Trust me, that's not the sort of
thing the Sorcerer King does.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,920
Is that assumption based on

58
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,970
something you learned
when you saw him?

59
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,260
I did more than just
see the bastard.

60
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,970
I had a front row seat
to his duel against Gazef.

61
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,980
That said, I still have no idea
what happened in the fight.

62
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,230
Gazef sure lost, but I
couldn't tell you how.

63
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,360
Wait, that sword...

64
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,190
[sighs] I'm just taking care
of it for the time being.

65
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,940
The princess pushed it on me.

66
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,900
[DISCIPLE 409A] Still,
it must be amazing to hold

67
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,370
one of the kingdom's legendary
treasures in your hand.

68
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,240
But you're telling me
even Razer's Edge

69
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,000
couldn't leave a scratch
on the Sorcerer King?

70
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,080
[BRAIN]
It didn't, but maybe it could.

71
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,750
Thing is, the blade
never reached him.

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,510
Anyway, the Sorcerer King's
planning something.

73
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,220
Call it a gut feeling, but I'm
not taking any risks here.

74
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,890
That's why I'm getting these
kids out of the kingdom.

75
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,220
You found a way?

76
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,600
[BRAIN] Finally, yeah.
I'll have them catch a ride

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,560
on a caravan heading towards
a city near the Council State.

78
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,940
I might not survive this war,
but my teachings will.

79
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,230
Maybe my sword techniques
aren't worth much,

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,030
but that's the only
legacy I have to leave.

81
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,650
Master Vesture said the same,

82
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,080
that he lives as long
as our swordcraft lives.

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,200
Maybe we should be
thinking of the future.

84
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,500
Would you mind if one of our
disciples went along, too?

85
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,420
That's... what you want?

86
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,590
I'm just happy
you trust my plan.

87
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,710
I'll make it happen.

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,260
[AINS]
So, it's been a month

89
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,430
since we declared
war on Re-Estize.

90
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,260
The invasion has begun, but they
seem to think that we've been

91
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,310
holed up in E-Rantel, twiddling
our thumbs all this time.

92
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm certain I owe
that to you, Demiurge.

93
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,310
Thank you for
monitoring the enemy

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,020
and keeping our actions covert.

95
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,980
You flatter me, Lord.

96
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,530
[AINS] On a related note, thanks
to some well-placed threats,

97
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,990
we've turned quite a few
nobles to our side.

98
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,240
Fine work, Albedo.

99
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,990
Always ready to serve.
It's my honor.

100
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,040
[AINS] Mm. Now, moving on. The
purpose of our current operation

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,630
is to prevent other countries
from sending support troops

102
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,880
or otherwise intervening
in the war.

103
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,050
We've accomplished this
thus far by shutting down

104
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,970
Re-Estize's borders unnoticed.

105
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,130
Since we annihilate

106
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,090
both the villages
and their inhabitants,

107
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,390
there's no chance of
information leaking.

108
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,560
Uh... [clears throat]

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,690
Although this has been a
particularly savage approach,

110
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,860
it's an effective one, born from
your reliable contributions.

111
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,940
But the fact that we've been
so successful troubles me.

112
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,410
Cocytus, you tasted defeat
at the hands of the Lizard Men,

113
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,870
but I believe that
helped you grow.

114
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,290
[COCYTUS]
Indeed.

115
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,700
The lessons I learned stay
with me to this very day.

116
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,420
[AINS] Meaning, there is wisdom
that can only be found

117
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,290
in the face of defeat.
Priceless wisdom.

118
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,130
Destroying cities and
massacring their citizens

119
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,010
is a simple matter for us,

120
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,010
but "simple" does not
always mean "best."

121
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,600
We have precious little
experience with failure,

122
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,430
a weakness that may
lead to our demise

123
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,520
in more challenging times.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,020
One challenge
we're already facing

125
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,270
is the rapid expansion
of our territory.

126
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,770
To manage our new resources,

127
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,570
I'll need to assign a wider
variety of tasks to you all.

128
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,070
And not all of us have
experience in every job.

129
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,070
So, you're trying to build
those skills up now, correct?

130
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,660
[AINS] Well put, Demiurge!
That's exactly right!

131
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,290
So, let us prepare for the day
when we might face a guild

132
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,290
that is stronger than our own!

133
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,750
[GUARDIANS]
Yes, sir!

134
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,250
[ALBEDO] Lord Ains.
I'm sure we're all aware,

135
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,250
but our next battle
is approaching soon.

136
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,420
[SHALLTEAR]
Is that so?

137
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,420
And who shall be
organizing the charge?

138
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,010
Our lord himself.

139
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,220
Then I'll watch closely in hopes
that I can learn a trick or two.

140
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,350
[AINS] I didn't prepare
anything extravagant.

141
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,980
[COCYTUS] It seems
our forces for this battle

142
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,110
are rather limited.
Are they needed elsewhere?

143
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,110
[AURA]
You're right. That reminds me.

144
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,980
When we destroyed
that town nearby,

145
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,240
Lord Ains let
some people escape.

146
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,570
I didn't think to question it
at the time, but...

147
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,950
Was there a reason
why you did that?

148
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,580
[AINS]
These are reasonable questions.

149
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,120
All of you should
watch this next battle.

150
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,290
If you still don't understand,

151
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,380
I'll explain things
to you afterwards.

152
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,430
[SHALLTEAR] Hm, so our next
target is a city named E-Naeul.

153
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,430
[MARE]
Looks like it's by the sea.

154
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,600
It's got a big port and
a bunch of fishermen,

155
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,180
but not many soldiers.

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,020
[COCYTUS]
Their defenses are weak.

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,690
Even a small force could break
down those ramparts in no time.

158
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,310
[MOMONGA]
I can't play cool forever!

159
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,480
Well, that's a problem for
Future Ains to deal with.

160
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,700
[SEBAS] Forgive me for summoning
you here under these pretenses.

161
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,910
The truth is, Lady Nigredo
and Pestonya wished

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,160
to meet with you, and
they were quite insistent.

163
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,790
[AINS]
There's no need to apologize.

164
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,340
I was the one who forbid
Nigredo from leaving Nazarick.

165
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,420
It's only natural that I should
be the one to visit her.

166
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,090
That's very generous
of you. I am grateful.

167
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,220
[MOMONGA] Wonder if I
should've brought Albedo.

168
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,850
She's Nigredo's
little sister after all,

169
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,810
and I think they get
along well enough?

170
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,600
Oh, wait, last time I
talked to Albedo about her,

171
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,270
she said Nigredo
should be executed.

172
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,940
Never mind!

173
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,650
[SEBAS]
This is the room.

174
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,740
They have been awaiting
your arrival, so please enter.

175
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,990
[AINS]
All right.

176
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,220
[NIGREDO] Thank you for coming
all this way, Lord Ains.

177
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,640
What an honor.

178
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,430
[AINS]
Think nothing of it.

179
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,520
You may raise your head.

180
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,940
[AINS]
What did you want to talk about?

181
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,320
[NIGREDO]
Well...

182
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,120
In my humble opinion, the
massacre that we're carrying out

183
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,370
in Re-Estize seems excessive.

184
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,160
Can we not resolve
this matter peacefully?

185
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,210
[AINS]
We cannot.

186
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,580
Furthermore, you have to
go through the proper channels

187
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,250
to make a request like this.

188
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,420
You should have discussed it

189
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,170
with your direct superior,
Cocytus, first.

190
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,380
So even if I did
accept your proposal,

191
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,220
it would undermine
Cocytus' authority.

192
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,390
[MOMONGA] I'll pass on
the office politics!

193
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,230
[PESTONYA] As usual, your
judgement is correct, Lord Ains.

194
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,770
Which is why I would
like to propose

195
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,560
the same matter,
myself, arr-ruff.

196
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,650
[AINS] Which would follow
the rules I suppose,

197
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,610
since your superior is Sebas.

198
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,070
Correct.

199
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,860
[AINS]
I understand your feelings,

200
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,370
but let me ask you
a question in return.

201
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,410
An essential part of
this operation involves

202
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,830
the strengthening of Nazarick
through experimentation.

203
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,410
Is it more important
to show mercy

204
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,910
than to increase our potential?

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,380
I'd argue that babies have
limitless potential, My Lord!

206
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,470
Let's not hyperfocus
on the babies, woof.

207
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,720
Humans have potential, I mean.

208
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,390
They are unrelenting innovators.

209
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,850
I believe they hold the power

210
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,810
to advance our
civilization in new ways.

211
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,100
Take these biscuits for example.

212
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,310
They are popular
in E-Rantel now,

213
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,270
but they used to be
hard and flavorless.

214
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,860
Thanks to the declining
cost of fresh ingredients

215
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,820
and emerging culinary arts,

216
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,570
they have become
a desirable product.

217
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,990
Try one yourself
and you'll understand.

218
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,910
[AINS]
Very well.

219
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,330
They're nearly as good
as the fine foods

220
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,880
we enjoy here, ah-woof.

221
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,250
[AINS] But is that
not cause for concern?

222
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,670
If civilization
progresses too far,

223
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,590
it could become a threat to us.

224
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,350
We are strong, but we
cannot grow stronger.

225
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,850
Humans are weak,
but always evolving.

226
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,730
My loyalty is to Nazarick,

227
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,190
I cannot allow anyone
to overtake us.

228
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,570
I trust you understand.

229
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,230
I'm grateful that
you have granted us

230
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,900
even a moment of your time.

231
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,200
You have heard their concerns,

232
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,030
and that's all that we
could ask for, My Lord.

233
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,240
As always, I am confident
that you will steer

234
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,120
The Great Tomb of Nazarick
in the right direction.

235
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,790
[AINS] Well, if that's all,
then I'll take my leave.

236
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,380
[PESTONYA] Not just yet!
Please, forgive my outburst!

237
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,460
[AINS]
It's fine.

238
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,590
If you have something
to say, say it.

239
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,760
Thank you. I do
understand your plan.

240
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,090
We must be purposefully
cruel to Re-Estize

241
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,350
to demonstrate how we
treat a rebellious kingdom

242
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,220
compared to a vassal
state, arr-ruff?

243
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,640
[AINS]
Correct.

244
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,020
In that case, isn't it better
to have more survivors?

245
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
They can tell tales of
their harrowing experience

246
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,940
to the world. Oh, uh... woof!

247
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,110
[AINS] Allow people
to survive as witnesses?

248
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,650
[MOMONGA] My feelings aside,
I doubt that would pass

249
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,410
with Albedo and Demiurge.

250
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,870
But you know,
a lot of different races

251
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,040
with different ways of thinking

252
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,330
will be joining our
kingdom eventually.

253
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,670
This merciful approach
might be in the minority

254
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,540
among my inner circle,
but in a way,

255
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,550
that makes it all
the more valuable.

256
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,720
[AINS]
I understand, I will consider

257
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,090
allowing a small number
of humans to survive.

258
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,970
[MOMONGA] But they might
get mad if I tell them that!

259
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,560
[MOMONGA] Well, like I said,
let's leave it to Future Ains.

260
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,570
Wow! Look at that army!

261
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,240
[SCAMA] I wouldn't give
them too much credit.

262
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,290
It's just a horde of
zombies, Count Naeura.

263
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,210
Judging by their clothes,
they're likely a bunch

264
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,160
of villagers that were
raised from the dead.

265
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,750
Seems like the Sorcerer Kingdom
has been wiping out settlements

266
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,500
and weaponizing their corpses.
A truly revolting tactic.

267
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,670
Whoa. They can really
do something like that?

268
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,590
There are certainly spells
that can give rise to the undead

269
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,890
and the situation we have here

270
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,010
matches what the
survivors described.

271
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,430
But that's hardly
our primary concern.

272
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,940
Look, do you see those two?

273
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,900
[NAEURA]
Definitely not villagers, huh?

274
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,860
They're special undead sent
by the Sorcerer King himself.

275
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,610
He had the power to kill
200,000 soldiers in an instant.

276
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,280
So, I'm thinking they're strong.

277
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,030
And I'm thinking you're right!

278
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,910
Still, not counting the zombies,
he believes he can conquer

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,330
our whole city with
just two of his soldiers.

280
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,170
Doesn't that piss you off?

281
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,880
Not really, I suppose!

282
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,920
After all, I got you folks from
the Four Armaments on my side,

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,670
and you're mithril-rank
adventurers! I'm pretty lucky!

284
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,720
This is a bit out
of character for us.

285
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,720
We adventurers don't usually
pick a side during a war,

286
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,310
but I'll make an exception
for the undead.

287
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,730
[NAEURA] Wouldn't it be nice
if I could just surrender?

288
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,020
Don't think they go
for that, though.

289
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,610
[SCAMA]
Couldn't you hop on a ship?

290
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,190
Take your family
and flee by sea?

291
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,990
Probably. But when I look
at the number of survivors

292
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,280
left in other towns,
it paints a picture.

293
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
A real ugly one.

294
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,700
You mean he kills them all,
down to the very last citizen.

295
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,200
[NAEURA]
That's what it looks like.

296
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,160
It's not conquest.

297
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,170
They're plannin' on eradicating
everyone in the whole kingdom.

298
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,090
Make us all into zombies, maybe.

299
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,340
It's just a theory,
but if that is the case,

300
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,010
there's nowhere to run.

301
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,510
[NAEURA]
Thank you, all who came here!

302
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,230
Our city is facing
an unprecedented threat,

303
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,690
let us work together
to brave the storm!

304
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,400
We're mithril adventurers:
the Four Armaments!

305
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,190
We will be leading all of you
in the battle today.

306
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,400
[NAEURA] Don't worry!
I've prepared plenty of rewards

307
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,620
for you daring adventurers!

308
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,660
Of course, my soldiers will be
generously compensated as well!

309
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,450
We're a team!

310
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,960
That said, be careful,
or you'll be taking those riches

311
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,910
straight to the grave!

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,460
[ADVENTURERS laugh]

313
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm looking for a different
kind of reward, if that's okay.

314
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,300
Count, you have some magic
items that you've passed down

315
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,720
in the family, right?

316
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,300
Yep! Sure do!

317
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,760
There's the Five-Colored
Holy Sword!

318
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,100
Not something I'd give up easy!

319
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,310
It's a weapon that commands

320
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,140
the power of five
different elements!

321
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,600
Could you give it to me?

322
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,480
Lilynette, no!

323
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,820
That's a valuable
heirloom, you know!

324
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,110
But I might consider it, if you
become my child's concubine.

325
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,940
She's mine!

326
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,860
Don't you dare!

327
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,320
Lilynette belongs to me!

328
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,660
I believe you have four
children in your family?

329
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,160
Your wife gave birth to your
eldest son and third son.

330
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,290
Your concubine gave birth

331
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,000
to your second son
and eldest daughter.

332
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,790
I assume you're not talking
about your daughter,

333
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,670
so which one is it?

334
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,000
Uh, my third son.

335
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,880
Oh, my gosh.

336
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,760
Ahem. If I recall,
he's only 12 years old.

337
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,260
And I'd be his concubine?

338
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,890
Yeah, I mean. That was the idea.

339
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,560
But I'm not a very
influential noble,

340
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,270
so why would you know
the age of my third son?

341
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,640
Is that the kind of research
you adventurers do?

342
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,520
No, this is...

343
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,020
This is something else.

344
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,400
Well, I 'spose that's that!
Yep, that's the deal!

345
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,650
I have to have that holy sword!

346
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,200
Guess I'll be that
little boy's concubine.

347
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Can't really complain,
since I suggested it,

348
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,870
but I thought she'd
try to laugh it off,

349
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,910
instead of acting like this.

350
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,080
Was she planning all
this from the start?

351
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,340
And does she want my son
or the magic sword more?

352
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,250
It's not the sword.

353
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,840
There's no fruit
more tantalizing

354
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
than an unripened
one, you fools!

355
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,920
[NAEURA]
Now I don't know what to think.

356
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,550
This has gone in
a really weird direction.

357
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,930
We need to move on, sir.
Don't get me wrong,

358
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,100
I do appreciate you easing
the tension with a bit of humor,

359
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,560
but those undead will be
on us in no time at all.

360
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,230
Good point.

361
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,690
Prepare for battle!
I'm depending on you!

362
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,280
[SCAMA] One of the
big guys has a shield

363
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,120
and the other is a dual-wielder.

364
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,580
Anyone know how strong they are?

365
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,250
I was being serious, damn it.

Same here.

Remember, our foes are undead!

They might not flinch
when you hit them,

382
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,770
but that doesn't mean
the spells aren't working!

it falls! Fire Ball!

has to offer,

only two of them.
