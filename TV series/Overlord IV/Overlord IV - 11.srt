[REP OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS]
Your Highness.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,640
I'm sorry for intruding
so late at night.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,230
Since my captor
is here to see me,

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,770
I can only assume what happened.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,530
Our kingdom has fallen.
The day is lost.

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,370
So it seems. Soon, at least.

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,870
[RAMPOSA III]
Hm?

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,450
[REP OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS]
In short, we've lost all contact

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,200
with the royal army, and none
of the messengers we've sent

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,000
to the battlefield
have returned.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,130
Prince Zanac's whereabouts
are also unknown.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,090
My poor, foolish boy.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,970
You had to follow your brother.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,300
To think that both of my sons
would go before me.

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,140
I am relieving everyone
in the castle

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,020
of their positions immediately.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,850
If they hurry, they might
still have a chance to escape

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,980
under the veil of night.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,690
Understood, My Lord.

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,400
That includes you.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,780
[gasps] Your Majesty.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,360
I will stay here and
meet our conqueror,

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,490
as the last king
of this fallen kingdom.

[BABY crying]

26
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,340
I worry that the children
are making too much racket.

27
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,050
You can never be too careful.

28
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,840
If we offend the emissary,
it could mean our death.

29
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,300
I'm bored!

30
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,550
How long do we have to wait
for these guys to show up?

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,930
We got our families and
everyone from the Eight Fingers

32
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,100
ready to ship out.

33
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,730
Does this Sorcerer guy
care if we're all here?

34
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,060
Watch it, Cocco Doll!

35
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,230
Uh-- Sorry, I mean...
"His Majesty"!

36
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,690
You're our colleague.

37
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,030
We must introduce you to
the Sorcerer King's emissary.

38
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,530
[COCCO DOLL] Hey, don't
get me wrong, I'm grateful.

39
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,240
I was just venting a little!

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,240
That aside, I still don't
get why you bothered

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,200
to break someone
like me outta prison!

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,830
What are you trying to imply?

43
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,910
I'm a has-been. I lost all
my power and connections,

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,420
so it just seems
like you're being

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,960
awfully generous to me.
What's your objective exactly?

46
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,300
Why would you say
such a thing, Ampetif?

47
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,800
You're one of us!
Of course we'll help you!

48
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,840
We're in this together, always!

49
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,390
Uh-- Huh?

50
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,430
Okay, no, this is weird.
Something's up.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,310
You're not an
imposter, are you?

52
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,560
You're the same old Hilma?

53
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,270
If you're a monster
wearing her skin,

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,440
just come out and
say it already!

55
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,440
You really think I've
changed that much?

56
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,740
Yeah! And you're all so thin!

57
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,320
Did you get on some
weird diet together?

58
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,700
You don't look the same
or act the same!

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,580
It'd make more sense if you
were a bunch of skin-stealers!

60
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,710
What can I say?

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,960
It shows how much
we've been through.

62
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,380
Been through what exactly?

[ALL gasp]

We'll be destroying
the royal capital soon,

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,640
so I've come to bring
all of you to safety.

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,480
I've been told you have 1,000
people that are coming with you?

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,850
Bring them here and
we'll depart immediately.

Yes, ma'am.

Come, Shadow Demon.

Pardon me.

71
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,990
If you could spare a moment,
while we're waiting on them,

72
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,740
there's someone I believe
we should introduce you to.

73
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,160
That won't be necessary.

74
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,250
Rather, we should gather
your luggage first.

75
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,830
[GROUP]
Huh?

76

You will stay here

77
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,670
until we can transport
you to a proper home.

78
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,630
I'll return to check
on you in a few days,

79
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,840
but you should have
adequate food and supplies

80
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,550
to last till then.

you require of me?

There's nothing we could have
done to save the poor man.

Don't say it like that.
He will survive, after all.

95
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,710
It's better to think of it
as a rite of passage.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,880
It will bring us
closer in the end.

[AINS] Yes, but be careful
not to kill him.

is to collect information.

Of course. But what about you?

Right!

121
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,920
[ALBEDO] I'd catch him easily
if I could use my War Bicorn.

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,710
Not very subtle, are you?

123
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,010
Do you really think I don't
notice that you're leading me

124
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,430
away from Lord Ains?
He won't fall so easily.

125
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,720
But how far does he plan to go?

126
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,310
Perhaps I was the
target all along.

Be my guest!

129
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,650
[ALBEDO] Those aren't
even magic projectiles.

130
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,940
Are you just testing my armor?

131
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,490
Well, I certainly know
what's coming next.

132
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,120
Physical projectiles don't work,

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
so you'll try hitting me
with a spell.

134
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,740
Let's see it, then.

135
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,460
[ALBEDO]
No damage.

136
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,130
Perhaps it's not attack magic,
but instant death magic?

137
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,420
Did you expect such low-tier
magic to work on me?

138
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,340
I find that offensive!

139
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,140
[ALBEDO] He's so weak!
It's like punching tofu!

140
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,520
[ALBEDO] What a boorish
little goon you are,

141
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,230
and cowardly as well!

142
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,440
I'll sever your limbs
and grind you with my boot

143
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,820
till you offer Lord Ains
a proper apology

144
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,280
for your insolence.

145
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,820
[AZUTH] Just what I'd expect
from a genocidal butcher.

146
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,450
[ALBEDO] Oh, and here I was
thinking you were some savage,

147

incapable of human speech!

148
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,410
Well, the people of this kingdom
might as well be animals,

149
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,960
seeing how foolish
and weak they are.

150
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
[AZUTH]
Your poison tongue is unbecoming

151
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,170
of a prime minister, Albedo.

152
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,590
Your invasion was
never justified.

153
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,170
You're the savages, using any
excuse to slaughter people.

154
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,470
No. You're worse than that.

155
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,840
You're monsters.

156
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,140
So call my methods
cowardly all you want.

157
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
This is a battle
against pure evil.

158
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,600
[ALBEDO]
Let him talk.

159
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,440
Maybe the fool will slip up
and reveal something.

160
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,270
[AINS]
Nothing is happening.

161
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,820
How odd. Surely he's
not working alone.

162
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,660
[AINS]
Explode Mine!

163
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,080
[AINS]
I may be standing in the open,

164
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,250
but I'm hardly defenseless.

165
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,010
[AINS]
Life Essence.

166
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,760
It seems he has
a lot of HP left.

167
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,180
As for his MP, none at all.

168
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,600
A pure warrior class, then.

169
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,860
[AINS laughs] Thought you
were clever, did you?

170
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,860
Indeed, skeletons are weak
against blunt attacks,

171
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,490
but I've taken special
care to address that.

172
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,530
Don't take me for a fool!

173
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,450
So, you can put
your hammer away.

174
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,670
No weapon of the sort
will work on me!

175
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,460
[RIKU]
World Isolation Barrier.

176
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,210
[AINS]
Wait a minute.

177
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,220
His HP dropped when
he used that technique.

178
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,600
[AINS] I'll forgive you
for the surprise attack.

179
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,390
I believe you know who I am,

180
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,310
but allow me to introduce
myself all the same.

181
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,270
I am the Sorcerer King,
Ains Ooal Gown.

182
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,230
Now, your turn.

183
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,070
Will you grace me
with your name as well?

184
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,740
[RIKU]
Riku Aganeia.

185
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,530
[AINS] Hm. I can't say
I've heard of you.

186
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,700
Though that platinum armor
of yours does make me wonder.

187
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,660
There was a nameless warrior
among the Thirteen Heroes

188
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,380
that was known for the
platinum armor he wore.

189
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,670
Could it be that I'm
dealing with a celebrity?

190
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,470
At any rate, a pleasure
to meet you, Riku Aganeia.

191
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,340
So, may I call you Riku?

192
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,760
[RIKU]
You may not.

193
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,010
[AINS]
Forgive me for being informal.

194
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,310
Sir Aganeia it is, then.

195
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,100
Unless you object
to that as well.

196
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,230
[RIKU]
No, that's fine.

197
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,400
[AINS]
In that case,

198
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,690
Sir Aganeia, I have
a proposal for you.

199
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,070
Why don't you become
my subordinate?

200
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,610
[RIKU]
I refuse.

201
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,150
[AINS]
You won't even consider it?

202
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,870
The strong are valued
in my kingdom, you know.

203
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,200
In fact, if you joined me,
I could easily be persuaded

204
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,250
to stop my attack on Re-Estize.

205
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,580
A talented warrior like yourself
is worth more than any land.

206
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,510
Hm. If he doesn't care,
perhaps he isn't from Re-Estize.

207
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,970
So much for diplomacy,
I suppose.

208
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,680
[RIKU]
Cloak of Light.

209
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
[AINS]
His HP went down again.

210
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,230
[AINS]
Greater Teleportation.

211
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,440
[AINS]
My magic failed.

212
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,940
I see.

213
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,490
This must be the barrier
he cast earlier.

214
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,530
It doesn't seem to be magic
or a normal skill.

215
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,500
It blocks teleportation.
And physical objects, too.

216
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,830
Body of Effulgent Beryl!

217
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,420
[AINS grunts]
Knock-back?

218
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,130
[AINS] Another attack
that reduced his HP.

219
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,050
I told you blunt damage
would not harm me.

220
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,680
Are you really that stubborn?

221
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,350
[RIKU] Keep talking if you must,
but your fate is sealed.

222
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,900
You will die within
this barrier, by my hand.

223
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,150
[AINS]
Twin Magic. Obsidian Sword.

224
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,410
[AINS]
What?

225
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,120
Wall of Skeleton!

226
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,160
[AINS]
Blasting Staff!

227
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,380
[AINS]
Grasp Heart!

228
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,790
No good?

229
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,510
[AINS]
I need to move!

230
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,970
Greater Teleportation!

231
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,640
Body of Effulgent Beryl!

232
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,310
It's not just the weapons.

233
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,430
It looks like he's controlling
the armor remotely, too.

234
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,870
[AINS]
Call Greater Thunder!

235
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,840
[AINS]
Are you surprised?

236
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,130
While this Blasting Staff
doesn't have much physical

237
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,380
attack power, it more
than makes up for it

238
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,430
with its strong
knock-back effect.

239
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,100
Convenient for a magic
caster such as myself,

240
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,600
since I like to create distance
between me and my enemies.

241
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,020
Summon Undead Tenth-Tier!

242
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,400
Doom Lord.

243
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,820
[AINS] Now, show me the full
extent of your strength!

244
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,120
[AINS]
Seems to be about level 90.

245
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,670
A tank that specializes
in hand-to-hand combat.

246
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,840
His weapons have HP, too.

247
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,550
And I noticed something
when I knocked him back.

248
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,550
The swords were sent
flying with him.

249
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,510
That would imply that
those floating weapons

250
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,470
are a part of his
body in some way.

251
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,970
I must assume that he's
controlling them and the armor

252
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,310
from another location.

253
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,480
I think that's all the
information my Doom Lord

254
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,520
can draw out.

255
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,980
Time to finish things up.

256
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,820
Here as well.

257
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,200
[AINS]
Summon Undead Tenth-Tier!

258
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,080
Elemental Skull!

259
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,250
Unlike the Doom Lord, this
summon specializes in magic,

260
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,040
commanding the power of
the four elemental spirits.

261
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,710
I'm sure you're weak to
at least one of those elements,

262
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,420
so now it's time
to find out which.

263
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,010
Or, we can cease this charade,

264
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,300
now that we have a grasp
of each other's strengths.

265
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,390
Ah-- Wait! No!
I'm still talking!

266
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,810
[AINS]
Please! I beg of you!

267
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,230
Just a moment of your time!

268
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,780
I have no desire to
fight you to the death!

269
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,400
This all began when
Re-Estize stole provisions

270
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,530
intended as aid for
the Holy Kingdom!

271
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,040
I believe it's clear who
is at fault in this situation.

272
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,750
Unless you object to our
charity for some reason,

273
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,120
surely you don't think
we're wrong for taking action

274
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,040
after we were attacked.

275
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,250
[RIKU] The action you
took was excessive.

276
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,300
[AINS]
What would you have done?

277
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,670
What if it was your
food that was stolen?

278
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,680
Would you still think
that this thieving kingdom

279
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,890
would be worth protecting?

280
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,350
[RIKU] Those who possess power
must use it responsibly.

281
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,190
You cannot act solely
in your own self-interest.

282
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,360
That's why I will
protect this world,

283
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,650
or rather, why I
must protect it.

284
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,780
Absolute power is
the root of evil.

285
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,330
A sin I carry as well, but
I won't beg for forgiveness.

286
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,830
Rather I shall use it
to extinguish wickedness

287
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,290
from the world,
starting with you.

288
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,370
Now perish!

289
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,290
[ALBEDO]
Mind your filthy tongue!

290
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,420
You worm!

291
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,970
[ALBEDO] How dare you speak
to Lord Ains that way!

292
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,220
I'll make you suffer!

293
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,350
Get back here!

294
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,560
[AINS]
Albedo, stop! That's enough!

295
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,230
[ALBEDO]
My Lord.

296
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,890
[AINS]
Sir Aganeia.

297
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,610
Before you depart,
I will ask you once more.

298
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,070
Will you not serve me?

299
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,360
I will grant you
whatever you may wish!

300
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,070
The gates of
the Sorcerer Kingdom

301
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,370
will always be open to you.

302
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,950
Come visit me
whenever you please!

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,210
[AINS]
A pity.

304
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,630
But with that, our job is done.

305
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,800
Good work.

306
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,800
[ALBEDO]
Our enemy is still unknown.

307
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,920
I worry that there
may be eyes upon us.

308
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,300
We should return
to Nazarick immediately.

309
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,760
[AINS]
A fine idea. Let's depart.

310
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,230
[RIKU]
I hope you weren't waiting long.

311
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,780
[AZUTH]
Hey, Tsa!

312
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,780
[RIKU] It seems you survived
your encounter with that demon.

313
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,870
Yeah, but I couldn't
even hit her.

314
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,120
Best I could do was
keep her at a distance.

315
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,040
Used every weapon at my disposal
and she shrugged 'em off,

316
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,790
one after another.

317
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,330
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,590
Wish I could've
held her off a bit.

319
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,130
But that aside, how'd you fare
against the Sorcerer King?

320
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,880
[RIKU]
Poorly, to be quite honest.

321
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,260
Guess that's it, then.
For the kingdom, at least.

322
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,730
[RIKU]
Forgive me.

323
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,480
You put your life at risk,
and I couldn't finish the job.

324
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,610
Don't blame yourself for this.

325
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,110
I'm the one who couldn't
buy you enough time, right?

326
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,110
[RIKU]
No, you did your part well.

327
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,450
Given your opponent,
I could scarcely expect more.

328
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,870
To be frank, time
wasn't the issue.

329
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,910
I failed to defeat the
Sorcerer King because he was

330
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,000
much stronger than
I had anticipated.

331
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,790
Still, it's strange.

332
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,670
The World Isolation Barrier
worked perfectly against

333
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,550
the Sorcerer King, but Albedo
seemed to break through it

334
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,800
quite easily when
she came to his aid.

335
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,630
The space was isolated
from the outside world.

336
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,430
The only way she could
have made it through

337
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,680
was if she used wild magic
or possessed a world item.

338
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,730
She appears to be subservient
to the Sorcerer King,

339
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,400
but perhaps she's the "player"
and he's the "NPC."

340
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,570
It could be a method to
protect herself from enemies.

341
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,450
Pretending to be
second-in-command

342
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,240
would have a few advantages.

343
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,410
And she did seem
suspiciously powerful.

344
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,790
Or perhaps the Sorcerer King
has more than one world item.

345
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,120
Though that would mean that he
chose not to bring it with him

346
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,580
to the battlefield
for some reason.

347
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,550
So, he's strong,
but what do you think

348
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,420
our odds are for next time?

349
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,380
Even if we weren't
able to pull this off,

350
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,430
you must've figured
something out, right?

351
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,140
Y'think I--or rather,
y'think my suit could win?

352
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,430
[RIKU] Don't take this
the wrong way, Azuth,

353
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,310
but you wouldn't stand a chance.

354
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,900
Yet as you said,
I know his power now,

355
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,480
and that also means
I know its limits.

356
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,980
While I can't hope to
defeat him in a single blow,

357
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,360
I should be able to win,

358
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,070
provided he doesn't have
any allies with him.

359
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,330
Well, hey! Not bad!

360
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,240
Though I'd expect nothing less.

361
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,790
You are the world's
strongest dragon lord.

362
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,370
[RIKU] I do my best, but I'm
sure there are many beings

363
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
out there stronger than me.

364
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,670
Thankfully, my skill
set is well suited

365
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,670
to beating the Sorcerer King.

366
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,260
Oh! Before I forget.

367
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,720
When he asked for my name,
I said it was "Riku Aganeia."

368
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,970
Good to remember that,
in case it comes up.

369
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,890
I'll write it down
when I get the chance.

370
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,810
Does that name have
a special meaning?

371
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,020
[RIKU]
Not at all.

372
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,270
I didn't plan ahead,

373
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,850
and it was the first thing
that came to mind.

374
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,400
Now that I think about it,
I hope no one is actually

375
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,730
named that, or they're about
to have a very bad time.

376
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,700
That should keep
the Sorcerer King busy,

377
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,660
trying to hunt down someone
who doesn't even exist.

378
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,080
[RIKU]
Not only him, his Prime Minister

379
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,120
certainly seems like the
type to hold a grudge.

380
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,210
I could not have accomplished
what I did today

381
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,130
without your help,
and I can't defeat

382
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,170
these evil "players" on my own.

383
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,880
So please take care of
yourself until next time.

384
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,380
Azuth has been agreeable
thus far, but I worry.

385
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,050
Perhaps it would be better
to kill him and give his armor

386
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,520
to a more capable
and obedient ally.

387
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,480
Riku. I already have
blood on my hands.

388
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,310
No turning back.

389
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,570
I could blame his death
on the Sorcerer King,

390
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,070
but if someone resurrected him,

391
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,950
then they would
find out the truth.

392
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,950
I can't afford to do
anything I'll regret.

393
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,230
[AINS]
Outstanding work, Albedo.

394
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,440
Pandora's Actor.

395
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,650
[BOTH]
Thank you.

396
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,490
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Truly, I am undeserving

397
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,740
of such praise, My Lord!

398
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,990
[AINS] I observed your battle,
but I'd like to hear

399
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,620
your impression of
this "Riku Aganeia,"

400
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,410
since you interacted
with him directly.

401
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,170
His words, his emotions,
all that you could draw out

402
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,050
of this man, everything the
mirror could not convey.

403
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,800
Reveal it to me.
