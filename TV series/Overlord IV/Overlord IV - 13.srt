[MARE] This city is bigger

I don't think the women
and children fled.

Did something happen just now?

No, but I remembered a plan
that I need to take care of.

We'll get a little revenge
against the Sorcerer Kingdom.

[RENNER] Just a little idea.
A last-minute plan.

Not for victory, but...
Why do you have those?

Our royal treasures. We've
had these for generations.

It's my duty to
preserve our history.

Though all I can
do now is pass on

these relics to our conqueror.

I will be our final king.

The least I can do is
face the end with dignity.

[RAMPOSA III]
This is a royal decree.

Take Renner and
escape from here.

41
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,880
There is a secret passage--

take it and it will lead
you outside the city.

43

That's your last chance
to live. Please, hurry.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,140
There's no need for that.
Don't listen to him.

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,560
As I said--

46

Ignore him. Sorry, father,
but Climb is loyal to me.

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,400
He won't follow your
orders over mine.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,400
So I feared.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,280
And yet, loyalty is more
than following orders.

Listen, Climb, in order
to preserve the bloodline

will you take my daughter

As a reward, I offer you
her hand in marriage.

You flatter me with
such a fine reward.

But I must decline.

Can we get to my plan, please?

Yes, of course, I almost forgot.

I have nothing left
to lose, after all.

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,940
Let me take the
royal crown with me.

62
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,980
I'll hide it somewhere
in the capital.

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,230
But why?

64
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,690
It's a way to thwart
the Sorcerer King.

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,690
We'll tell him we've
hidden our treasures,

66
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,820
the symbols of
this kingdom itself.

67
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,070
And if he reduces
the capital to rubble,

68
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,370
then the trophies of his
conquest will be lost.

69
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,210
That makes sense. As you said,
it won't bring victory,

70
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,830
but it might save a few lives.

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,330
Good then.

72
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,750
Climb, I'll leave it to you
to take these and hide them.

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,300
Of course, it would be my honor.

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,380
Is there someplace in particular
where I should go?

75

Not to worry.

My brother made a hideout for
us in the warehouse district.

Indeed. Actually,
it was his idea, as well.

Of course, Princess.

If a magic item is desired,
even by a demon,

162
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,510
Our kingdom was at peace!
You took that away from us!

163
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,890
You made Princess Renner suffer!

164
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,480
You trampled over the
lives of all her people!

165
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,440
[AINS chuckles]

166
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,810
[yelling]

167
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,610
[RENNER]
Climb!

168
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,990
[screams]

169
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,080
[AINS] If this was a fairy tale,
the strength of

170
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,080
your pure heart would empower
you to vanquish me,

171
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,380
and love would triumph over
my perceived wickedness.

172
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,880
But this is reality.

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,550
Unfortunately no such
miracle will happen!

174
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,920
[CLIMB groans]

175
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,260
[AINS]
You will die in short order.

176
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,100
After all, there's no
value in sparing you.

177
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,770
To be frank, you have

178
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,190
no special talent or
power to speak of.

179
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,400
This world is an unfair place.

180
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,480
But that doesn't mean
you should despair.

181
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,400
Inequality exists from
the moment of birth.

182
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,280
There are those who have
talent and those who do not.

183
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,870
Those who are born into wealth
and those born into poverty.

184
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,830
And thus, the fortunate
live a life of comfort,

185
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,920
while the unfortunate are
left to wallow in misery.

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,540
No fault of their own.

187
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:32,220
But there is a truth, even more
absolute than injustice.

188
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,800
Death. For all life
ends in death,

189
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,140
and all are equal
in its embrace.

190
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,230
And that is I. Death itself.

191
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,610
[AINS] There is only one truly
fair thing in this unfair world,

192
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,030
and that is my mercy as
the overlord of death.

193
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,450
I don't care!

194
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,410
[AINS]
Hm...

195
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,580
I am Princess Renner's shield!

196
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,330
[AINS] You have a splendid
fire in your eyes.

197
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,510
[AINS]
Pick it up.

198
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,980
[AINS] It is possible to
harm me with that sword.

199
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,440
Under the right circumstances,
one might even kill me with it.

200
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,940
[RENNER]
Climb!

201
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,280
Tell me this.

202
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,490
Will you kill Princess Renner
after you kill me?

203
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,570
[AINS]
Hm...?

204
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,490
[ALBEDO, DEMIURGE chuckle]

205
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,870
[AINS laughs] What answer
will make you suffer the most?

206
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,040
Or rather, I suspect
that no answer at all

207
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,840
will do the job quite nicely.

208
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm not afraid of you!

209
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,180
This is it! Ability Release!

210
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,400
[GAZEF]
Climb. Take this with you.

211
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,650
What is it?

212
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,480
That ring can transcend
human bounds

213
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,110
and push your strength
well past your limits.

214
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,070
[CLIMB yelling]

215
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,330
[CLIMB grunting, yelling]

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,420
[AINS]
Clever. That was a fine attack.

217
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,790
[CLIMB screaming]

218
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,590
Climb, no!

219
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,720
[AINS] Is Razor Edge capable
of destroying world items?

220
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,140
Fascinating. I may have
to experiment with that.

221
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,440
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
I have to kill you first.

222
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,570
He's using magic?
On a nobody like me, huh?

223
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,860
[chuckles]

224
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
[yelling]

225
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,450
[AINS]
Grasp Heart.

226
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,830
[AINS]
You did well.

227
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,130
[PESTONYA]
If you'll excuse me, woof.

228
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,970
[CLIMB grunting]

229
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,130
[RENNER]
Oh, good. You're awake!

230
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,600
[CLIMB grunting]
Princess... You...

231
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,520
That's right! It's me!
Don't worry, Climb. I'm safe.

232
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,020
[CLIMB gasping]

233
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,740
You noticed my wings.

234
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,240
The Sorcerer King used his
powers to change me into this.

235
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,790
I'm afraid that I'm no longer
human. I'm a demon.

236
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,710
[CLIMB gasping]

237
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,790
I know it's shameful of me.

238
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,340
So many people died
and I'm here like this.

239
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,920
[grunting]

240
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,600
You must be confused.

241
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,270
You lost to the Sorcerer King

242
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,980
and you're wondering why
you're still alive, right?

243
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,480
[grunts]

244
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,230
I'll tell you, of course.

245
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:22,360
But first, I fear I have a
selfish request to ask of you.

246
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,200
As I said, I've turned
into a demon.

247
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,160
Unlike a human,
I'll live for eternity.

248
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll be left all alone.

249
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,000
Please, Climb. Stay with me.
Become a demon like I did.

250
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,210
[grunts]

251
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,130
I know you'd never leave me.

252
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,970
Now, I said I'll tell
you why you're alive.

253
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,590
The truth is,
you died back there,

254
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,600
but you were resurrected

255
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,140
by the will of
the Sorcerer King.

256
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,680
He did it as a personal favor

257
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,930
because I pledged
my allegiance to him.

258
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,140
[gasping]

259
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,650
Can you do that?

260
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,520
Can you pledge
allegiance to him, too,

261
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,070
so we can be together?

262
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,530
[grunting]

263
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,110
Y-Yes.

264
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,950
[RENNER] I'm certain
that the Sorcerer King

265
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,370
will test your loyalty
in some way.

266
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,410
Whatever it is,
I'm afraid it will be

267
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,960
terribly painful for you.
I know that's the only way,

268
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,290
but it still hurts my
heart to think of it.

269
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,790
Don't worry. I'll make
it through for you.

270
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,010
I'm so glad to have you.

271
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,590
But let's not worry about
these things right now.

272
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,840
We have plenty of time.

273
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,770
All you need to do now is rest.

274
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,150
[gasps] Forgive my rudeness,
Lady Albedo!

275
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,530
And I apologize. I should
have thanked you sooner.

276
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,320
It's gone so quickly.
I forgot my manners.

277
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,820
Thank you for preparing the
poison and playing along

278
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,660
with my charade in
the throne room.

279
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,580
The Sorcerer King has
been most generous

280
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,210
in his support of my proposals.
I'm undeserving of such mercy.

281
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,090
[laughs] It's adorable, but you
don't need to be nervous.

282
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,050
The plan to destroy the kingdom
was almost entirely yours,

283
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,760
after all, and you
played your part well.

284
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,350
We know what you're capable of.
You've proven yourself plenty.

285
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,010
Just keep up the good work,
and I'm sure you'll make

286
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,270
a fine addition
as my subordinate.

287
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,890
But of course. I'll do my best.

288
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,150
Lord Ains must think
you have great potential,

289
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,520
seeing how much
trouble he went to.

290
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,030
You're starting out
with a debt to pay.

291
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,530
[gasping]

292
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,160
[ALBEDO] But that's all right.
In fact... I'll reward you

293
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,450
for your next thousand
years of work in advance.

294
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,710
This is another Seed of the
Fallen, for your little puppy.

295
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,130
Thank you for your faith.

296
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,420
And please express my gratitude
to His Majesty as well.

297
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,090
I'll work hard to repay him.

298
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,880
In fact, I'll work hard enough
to repay him several times over.

299
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,850
Heh. On that note, I have
some lingering matters

300
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,680
to attend to,
if you'll excuse me.

301
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,320
[sighs]

302
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,200
Seems I'll be able to clear
that final hurdle after all.

303
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,030
Only one thing defied
my calculations.

304
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,740
I never thought His Majesty
would make a personal appearance

305
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:21,290
just to play such a
ridiculous role. Oh well!

306
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,420
It didn't take long at all
to make my dream come true.

307
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,210
And all I had to do was
sell out one measly kingdom

308
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,880
to achieve it.
I'm truly blessed.

309
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,340
Oh, Climb. I hope you're ready

310
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,560
for an eternity of
happiness by my side!

311
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,890
We should celebrate,
shouldn't we?

312
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,180
If I were to share my
first time with you,

313
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,600
how would you like that?

314
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,520
Oh, but it's too early.

315
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,570
I have to build your
anticipation a bit, after all.

316
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,910
[RENNER laughing]

317
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,580
[DEMIURGE]
Lord Ains.

318
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,170
I'd like to make a request--
if you'll indulge me.

319
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,550
After reading over
Sebas' findings,

320
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,010
there is one place
I would like to see.

321
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,590
Could I impose on you, Lord?

322
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,010
[AINS]
I don't mind.

323
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,720
You are acting for the benefit
of Nazarick, aren't you?

324
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,060
Go ahead. Enjoy.

325
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,430
I plan to, Lord.

326
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,730
[RENNER] Is that you, Climb?
Please, come in.

327
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,200
I'm sorry for being gone
so long, Princess.

328
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,950
I was terribly worried.

329
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,160
Uh?

330
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,120
I couldn't help but fear
the worst for you,

331
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,410
[RAEVEN] I hear you plan to go
up against Eight Fingers.

332
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,460
Where will you be attacking?

333
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,000
[RENNER]
Seven locations.

334
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,960
Also, sister, I have an
important question to ask you.

335
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,380
You're aware that our
beloved older brother

336
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,590
is also taking money from
Eight Fingers, right?

337
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,720
[gasps] Not Brother Barbo.

338
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,430
This could be our
opportunity to depose him!

339
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,270
We should definitely
consider including

340
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,350
his drug division stronghold
in your plan of attack.

341
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,400
Taking out eight targets is
obviously better than seven.

342
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,690
[DEMIURGE]
What I'm about to tell you

343
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,440
is a matter of great importance.

344
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,650
Entoma?

345
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,860
[ENTOMA]
Acknowledged.

346
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,410
Killing this person
is strictly forbidden.

347
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,620
Understood, Shalltear?

348
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,790
Oh, ha-ha! Poke fun
at the vampire,

349
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,540
why dontcha? Jerk.

350
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,500
[DEMIURGE]
Hm? What is it, Shadow Demon?

351
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,630
Excellent. It appears
we now have one more

352
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,000
Eight Fingers base
to attack tonight.

353
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,960
Mare. You and Entoma will
focus on the new location.

354
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,380
[SHALLTEAR]
Insolent ant!

355
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,840
I refuse to let a measly human
escape from me unharmed.

356
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,510
Time Accelerator!

357
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,180
[SHALLTEAR]
Is that...?

358
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,560
[CLIMB] Princess Renner has
requested that I go into battle

359
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,810
without changing my armor.

360
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,360
[PHILIP]
Hey, is anyone there?

361
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,070
You're s'posed to serve me.

362
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,580
Ingrates.

363
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,870
[ALBEDO]
Oh, good. Awake at last.

364
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,880
[gasps] What are you doing here?

365
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,840
I set up a barrier to keep
you isolated from the war.

366
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,670
But it was so peaceful
and quiet in here,

367
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,590
I feared you might
sleep forever.

368
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,590
Well! I'm honored you
made the trip to see me!

369
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,050
[gasps]

370
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,060
You're here to save me because
you know what I'm worth!

371
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,560
They thought they could
use me as a scapegoat!

372
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,600
But you... you
understand that I was

373
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,610
a victim and their
envy is at fault!

374
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,030
I never lost faith!
I knew you were wise!

375
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,860
All I've ever done was work hard

376
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,280
to make this kingdom
a better place!

377
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,740
Ha! I admit you've
rendered me speechless.

378
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,290
At this point, I can
only be impressed.

379
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,250
Oh, before I forget,
I brought you a little gift.

380
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,750
How considerate of you!

381
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,170
[PHILIP yelping]

382
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
[ALBEDO]
You sullied my good name.

383
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,380
I was kind enough to
associate with you,

384
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,510
and this is how you act?

385
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,060
[PHILIP whimpering]

386
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,100
Your father begged and
begged me before he died.

387
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,060
Not for mercy, mind you.

388
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,850
He wanted to make
sure you suffered

389
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,940
as much as his
people did and more.

390
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,240
I have every intent to
honor his dying wish.

391
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,660
[PHILIP screaming]

392
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,260
[RAEVEN]
Your Majesty, we've come from

393
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,930
our domains to greet
you, as decreed.

394
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,760
[AINS] Marquis Raeven,
was it? A pleasure.

395
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,180
[RAEVEN grunts]

396
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,560
[AINS] Perhaps I should
commend you for your efforts,

397
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,810
but I do detest idle chatter.

398
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,150
Instead of wasting
our time any further,

399
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,070
I suggest we end this quickly.

400
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,440
I trust no one has
any objections?

401
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,030
[RAEVEN]
No, My Lord.

402
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,820
[AINS] The Sorcerer Kingdom's
army will continue its assault.

403
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,280
We will destroy the
remaining noble fiefs,

404
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,040
then return home.

405
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,330
In the meantime,
continue governing

406
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,370
your own domains as usual.

407
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,880
We may relocate some
of you in the future,

408
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,250
but there are no such
plans at the moment.

409
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,300
Is all of that correct, Albedo?

410
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,220
Indeed. Just as you
say, Lord Ains.

411
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,510
[AINS]
There you have it.

412
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,930
Govern as you wish
until told otherwise.

413
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,180
[RAEVEN]
Thank you.

414
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,060
[AINS] As you can see,
the Kingdom has fallen.

415
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,520
Nothing remains of the capital.

416
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,650
With that in mind, I'd like
to ask you something.

417
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,770
Of course. As you wish.

418
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,570
[AINS] Do you think
rulers will understand

419
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,110
the futility of defying me?
In lands far and wide?

420
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,620
[RAEVEN]
Yes, Your Majesty.

421
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,660
This rubble will
serve as a monument.

422
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
And tales of what befell
the people here

423
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,330
will travel the lands for
countless ages to come.

424
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:42,010
[AINS] I see. Then it was
well worth the effort.

425
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,090
I am thoroughly satisfied
with this result.
