1
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,100
[RENNER] You spoke with
the Roble Holy Kingdom?

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,560
Not quite.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,390
One of their representatives
did come calling, though.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,140
Since they were in
such a dire position,

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,310
I thought we might discuss
some countermeasures together.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,860
But you strongly
insisted we should

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,730
stand by our foreign policy.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,230
So, what could I say?

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
You were the one who decided

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,570
not to meet with them.
Don't blame me!

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,360
You said it yourself,
didn't you?

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,070
There's nothing that
our kingdom can do

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,200
against a demonic
foe like Jaldabaoth.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,870
[sighs] Let's not point
fingers, dear sister.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,960
The issue is, we keep pushing
all our little problems aside,

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,340
and now they've piled up
into quite the mountain.

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,920
Since we refused the
Holy Kingdom's request for aid,

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,720
they had to turn to
the Sorcerer King instead.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,970
In the end, his forces
defeated Jaldabaoth

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,220
and even provided some
generous post-war relief.

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,720
They're developing
an air of legitimacy.

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,850
If you didn't want them
to deliver the supplies,

23
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,980
then you shouldn't have let
them come through our kingdom.

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,610
I did everything in
my power to deter them.

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,570
We requested the right to impose
import taxes and charge fees

26
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,570
for the use of our
merchants and warehouses.

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,320
The Sorcerer Kingdom
accepted everything

28
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,780
without a hint of resistance.

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,240
What could I say?

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,330
And now, our nation
is full of their wares,

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,040
their wagons, their flags.
Their generosity on display.

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,040
Is a bit of charity truly
so threatening to you?

33
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,960
It's not "charity"--
they're plotting something.

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,380
Just like with the Empire.

35
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,710
They didn't become
a vassal state

36
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
because the Sorcerer
King is nice.

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,300
If we became a vassal state,

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,140
we might be joining
the winning side.

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,720
Have you considered that?

40
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,600
[gasps] Unlike our kingdom,

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,230
the Empire has all of its
nobles on a tight leash.

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,060
Also, the Sorcerer King
slaughtered us.

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,190
Siding with him would
cause a civil war.

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,690
Pessimism doesn't
look flattering on you.

45
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,480
[ZANAC]
I know she's just taunting me,

46
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,530
but why do I get the feeling
she wouldn't object

47
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,240
if I bowed down to them?

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,780
If only I had Elias's
guidance to rely on.

49
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,870
[RENNER] If you're thinking
about Marquis Raeven,

50
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,330
I doubt we'll be
able to convince him

51
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,080
to return to the capital.

52
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,130
[gasps]

53
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,500
The war with the Empire
crushed his will.

54
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,880
We should consider him
a lost cause, I'm afraid.

55
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,220
That aside, don't you
think it's about time

56
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,800
you ascend to the throne?

57
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,340
[ZANAC]
Huh?

58
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,890
You promised me my own domain,
and I will hold you to that.

59
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,140
Why the delay?

60
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,940
Father's waiting
for the right moment.

61
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,310
He's planning something.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,810
This is a trying
time for us all,

63
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,770
so please be patient for now.

64
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,820
Things will work out.
Soon enough.

65
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,450
[PHILIP]
This was supposed to be easy.

66
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,660
[VIANNEY]
Oh, Baron Montserrat.

67
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,170
[PHILIP]
Baron Delvi. Baron Rokerlen.

68
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,880
Good evening.

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,970
[VIANNEY] To our faction's
great leader, Baron Philip!

70
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,480
[GROUP]
Cheers!

71
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,600
My mistake!

72
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,980
It's hardly a drop.

73
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,440
But you seemed quite out
of sorts when we stepped in.

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
What ails you, friend?

75
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,780
[sighs] I had high hopes
for my faction,

76
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,610
but my all associates have
failed me at every turn!

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,280
The commoners are even worse!

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm the head of the
prestigious Montserrat family!

79
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,290
You'd think they
would listen to me!

80
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,750
Our lands our fertile enough--

81
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,170
If they'd do the work,
we'd be raking it in!

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,170
I told them which
cash crops to shift to,

83
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,090
but they still won't do it!

84
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,670
"We don't have the manpower--
too many people died!"

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,050
or "Those crops can't grow
in this climate!" Excuses!

86
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,930
Isn't that how it always goes?

87
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,810
When you're ahead of the times,
the world never understands you.

88
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,560
Ignorance is the
enemy of progress

89
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,940
and the bane of a genius
like yourself! Right?

90
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,190
Precisely so.

91
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,060
Ah! It's a joy to speak
with likeminded fellows!

92
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,190
If only someone else would
recognize my sizable talents!

93
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,820
I don't know if I'd say that--
Since you have a backer,

94
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,450
at least one commoner
believes in what you can do!

95
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,240
Yes, Hilma is wonderful.

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,620
So true!

97
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,540
And you can drink your fill
whenever you so choose!

98
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,910
She's crafted the perfect
meeting place for your faction,

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,080
without asking for
anything in return!

100
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,090
As a proper noble, I intend
to pay her back fully!

101
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,710
Though the whole
kingdom will thank me

102
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,260
once I dismantle our
broken aristocracy!

103
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,430
One's age and rank
isn't everything!

104
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,760
Oh, my! You're such a visionary!

105
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,600
Isn't he?

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,220
[YEAG]
Yes. Precisely so.

107
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,970
By the way, I hear you're close

108
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,180
to the Sorcerer Kingdom's
prime minister.

109
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,640
Indeed!

110
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,980
In fact, I'm writing letters
to Lady Albedo constantly!

111
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,860
[gasps] Then you know
of the situation, I assume?

112
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,110
Huh?

113
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,110
It seems the Sorcerer
Kingdom is producing

114
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,740
a huge amount of food,
equivalent to our entire output.

115
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,200
But how?

116
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,790
They're a tiny kingdom and
E-Rantel is their only city!

117
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,160
It's simple.

118
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,670
The undead never tire,
so they're able to cultivate

119
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,710
a massive amount of farmland
in no time at all.

120
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,290
[PHILIP]
How troubling.

121
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,170
It sends a chill down my spine!
But they don't need that food.

122
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,430
It's sent as aid
to the Holy Kingdom.

123
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,760
I've seen it myself,

124
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,470
since convoys from the
Sorcerer Kingdom have been

125
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,810
so brazenly traveling
through my land.

126
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,930
That sounds awful, Lord Vianney.

127
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,350
The thing is, they're storing
that huge supply of food

128
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,150
in warehouses throughout
our kingdom. And the excess

129
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,440
can be sold at rock-bottom
prices any time.

130
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,440
We'll go broke! That's cheating!

131
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,780
[VIANNEY] Lord Philip,
please keep your voice down.

132
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,070
We're struggling enough already!

133
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,240
We can't turn a profit

134
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,820
if someone's undercutting
us that much!

135
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,910
You've gotten right to
the heart of the problem!

136
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,750
I knew you'd understand
if we told you.

137
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,830
[sighs] We need to do something
about this, immediately.

138
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,460
The question is,
how could I make

139
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,010
the Sorcerer Kingdom lower
their production of crops?

140
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,340
[gasps]

141
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,630
No, this is good!

142
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,510
If I can bring down
the hammer of justice

143
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,180
on the Sorcerer Kingdom, not
only will my domain benefit,

144
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,430
I'll be a hero!

145
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,600
It's three birds with
one stone. I can't lose!

146
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,730
[VIANNEY]
Huh?

147
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,360
I think this plan
may interest you.

148
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,650
Let's work together, gentlemen.

149
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,190
[ALBEDO] We're conquering
territories at a good pace,

150
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,620
thanks to the
genius of Lord Ains.

151
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,530
It's hard to keep up.

152
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,250
[ALBEDO] We're lacking
in skilled workers,

153
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,120
but it would look like
a personal failing

154
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,580
if I asked the
Supreme One for help.

155
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,170
[ALBEDO] "Problems encountered
during the transport of aid

156
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,090
to the Holy Kingdom"?

157
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,260
[ALBEDO]
What?

158
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,480
[MOMONGA] I get that we're
trying to show the public

159
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,690
that I have a good
relationship with Momon,

160
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,320
but this oppressive silence
is really ruining the mood.

161
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,490
Not that there's anything

162
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,490
I want to talk to
Pandora's Actor about.

163
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,120
[AINS]
So, uh, Nabe.

164
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,120
Yes?

165
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,330
[AINS]
Just making conversation,

166
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,790
but how is Yuri's
orphanage going?

167
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,920
Have you been?

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,380
Not yet, I'm afraid.

169
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,250
[AINS]
Then, should we stop by?

170
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,250
[NARBERAL]
All right.

171
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,260
[chiming]

172
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,460
[ENTOMA]
Lord Ains.

173
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,970
[AINS]
What is it, Entoma?

174
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,090
[ENTOMA] I'm sorry for the
interruption, but Lady Albedo

175
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,890
is requesting your presence
at the Great Tomb of Nazarick

176
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,100
as soon as possible.

177
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,730
[AINS]
Oh?

178
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,520
[ALBEDO] Thank you for heeding
my call so quickly, Lord Ains.

179
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,110
I have gathered all the
floor guardians before you.

180
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,190
[AINS]
Yes. So, I see.

181
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,940
Raise your heads.

182
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,320
[GUARDIANS]
Sir!

183
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,070
[AINS]
It's unusual for you to call

184
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,910
everyone together like this.

185
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,700
Did something troubling occur?

186
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,620
Correct. It was
four days ago.

187
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,830
One of the convoys we deployed
to the Holy Kingdom was robbed.

188
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,750
They were ambushed in Re-Estize.

189
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,590
[AINS]
I see. And the culprit?

190
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,470
It was a noble from Re-Estize.

191
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,670
It was strange.

192
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
He had a small army
of commoners with him.

193
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,890
Seems they blocked
our carriages by force.

194
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,430
[AINS] If I remember correctly,
wasn't the convoy

195
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,180
lead by a merchant selected
by the Eight Fingers?

196
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,110
Furthermore, the carriage should
have been flying our flag.

197
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,400
In other words,
Re-Estize decided

198
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,860
to directly attack
the Sorcerer Kingdom.

199
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,650
If not that, then perhaps the
Eight Fingers have betrayed us?

200
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,080
[ALBEDO]
It's not like that.

201
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,660
[AINS]
Hm. What's wrong, Albedo?

202
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,540
[MOMONGA]
Jeez, what's with that look?

203
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,330
It's like when an office worker
screws up something really bad

204
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,840
and has to come
clean to their boss.

205
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,340
I don't remember
any of the nobles

206
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,220
from Re-Estize, though.
Did I piss someone off?

207
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,550
Albedo, don't hold back.
Whatever it is, tell me.

208
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,550
[ALBEDO]
As you wish, My Lord.

209
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,230
If you will recall, we
formulated a plan to take over

210
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,730
the Re-Estize Kingdom by
manipulating a witless noble.

211
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,070
[AINS] Yes, the one you've been
sending letters to, correct?

212
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,400
They aren't personal
letters, I swear!

213
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,900
Wait. Sorry, never mind that.

214
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,450
I'm ashamed to tell you this,

215
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,660
but the robbery
was all his doing.

216
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,910
You're surely thinking
this was a clever ploy,

217
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,580
that the Re-Estize
Kingdom is plotting

218
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,330
something greater against us.

219
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,250
[AINS]
Mm. If that was the case,

220
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,630
then I'm sure you've already
looked into it thoroughly.

221
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,630
Correct.

222
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,040
I have prepared
a witness for you.

223
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,630
This is the one responsible
for managing that noble.

224
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,850
[MOMONGA]
Do I know her?

225
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,600
[HILMA] It's an honor
to see you, Your Majesty.

226
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,430
And in such good health, too!

227
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,770
[AINS] Before we begin, I would
have you state your name.

228
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,730
It's Hilma Cygnaeus,
Your Majesty!

229
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,520
Member of the Eight Fingers!

230
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,280
[MOMONGA]
Okay. Right! That lady!

231
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,400
I-I didn't know anything
about this, I promise!

232
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,740
Why, I would never do anything

233
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,620
that went against your
wishes, Your Majesty!

234
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,120
This was Philip's plan alone!

235
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,410
[AINS]
I see.

236
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,660
Well, I hope you're
telling the truth,

237
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,750
but I will confirm that myself.

238
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,920
[HILMA whimpers]

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,630
[AINS]
Dominate.

240
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,590
[AINS] Were you involved
with the robbery

241
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,050
orchestrated by that
noble, in any way?

242
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,720
No, I wasn't.

243
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,640
[AINS] Do you have memory loss
or multiple personalities?

244
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,230
[HILMA]
No, I don't.

245
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,850
[AINS] Hm. And do you have any
intent to operate against us?

246
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,230
[HILMA]
Absolutely not! Never! Never!

247
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,030
[AINS]
A decisive response. Very well.

248
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,360
Even if your actions may
have indirectly triggered

249
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,160
this result, it would be unfair
to blame you for the crime.

250
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,080
I find Hilma Cygnaeus innocent.

251
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,460
But she's still his superior!
His mistakes are hers, too.

252
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,540
A leader must always
take responsibility.

253
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,790
I couldn't believe it!

254
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,210
I never thought he would
do something so insane!

255
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,880
--I warned him many times!
--[ALBEDO] How--

256
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,510
[AINS]
What you said is correct.

257
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,260
A superior should be responsible

258
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,140
for the mistakes of
their subordinates.

259
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,510
However, those words
should be used by a leader

260
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,220
to protect their followers.

261
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,930
It shouldn't be used by another
to force responsibility

262
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,060
on someone beneath them.

263
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,520
Albedo, if she is
responsible for that noble,

264
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,440
who is responsible for her?

265
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,990
Ah, well. That would
be me, My Lord.

266
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,080
[AINS] Correct and by that
measure, I am your master.

267
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,120
Which means this failure is
ultimately my responsibility.

268
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,040
No, not at all, Lord Ains!

269
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,170
I would never dream of blaming
you for this disaster!

270
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,460
[AINS] Cygnaeus, prepare
several new policy changes

271
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,300
and present them to Albedo.

272
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,260
That will be your punishment.

273
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,880
[HILMA]
Yes, My Lord.

274
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,680
[AINS] With that,
the matter is settled.

275
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,810
[NOAH]
Hilma!

276
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,890
How are you?

277
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,940
[OLIN]
I have some fruit liquor here,

278
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,520
if you need to wash
the taste out!

279
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,480
[NOAH] The others are coming
as quick as they can!

280
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,740
[HILMA]
I'm grateful for your concern.

281
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,940
But it's all right.

282
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,950
They didn't do
anything cruel to me.

283
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,780
[GROUP gasps]

284
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,990
Then, what happened?

285
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,200
This time, they took me
before His Majesty.

286
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,700
I spoke with the Sorcerer King.

287
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,200
And he didn't punish you?

288
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,500
[HILMA giggles]
Would you believe it?

289
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,290
He was a kind and
reasonable man.

290
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,170
I went there,
certain that I would die,

291
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,260
but His Majesty was merciful.

292
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,880
He had an air of true wisdom.

293
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,970
I see now that he is worthy of
the throne, above all others!

294
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,510
Hilma, they're simply giving
you the carrot and stick.

295
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
[HILMA]
Perhaps you're right.

296
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,560
I've certainly used
that approach myself,

297
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,270
but you could never
understand how it felt!

298
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,980
It was so warm!

299
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,520
It's only because
I've tasted such pain

300
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,740
that the flavor of mercy
is so sweet on these lips.

301
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,990
I felt that I could
trust His Majesty

302
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,660
above anyone else.

303
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,870
More than that,
I wanted to trust him.

304
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,450
Fine, then.

305
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,210
If that's your opinion, we must
show him our unwavering loyalty.

306
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,710
[HILMA]
Indeed! Now, let's get to work!

307
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,840
He's given me a new task!

308
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,220
[AINS]
Surely you didn't call me here

309
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,170
just to pass judgement on her.

310
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,550
Is there something else?

311
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,010
[ALBEDO] Of course,
I'll get straight to it.

312
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,510
That noble is nothing.

313
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,060
but what if someone is using him
for a much larger agenda?

314
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,640
Should we change our approach?

315
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,610
Can we conquer Re-Estize
the same way we planned?

316
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,610
I thought it best
to ask for your opinion

317
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,360
before we went any further.

318
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,570
[AINS]
Mm. I know you and Demiurge

319
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,450
are involved in the operation,

320
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,120
but have you explained the
details to the others yet?

321
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,450
I didn't assume
it was necessary.

322
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,290
[AINS] Then this is a fine
opportunity to tell them.

323
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,160
[MOMONGA]
And me, too, of course.

324
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,580
[ALBEDO]
Understood.

325
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,040
[AINS] I'm interested in hearing
your opinions, everyone.

326
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,500
[GUARDIANS]
Yes, sir.

327
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,090
Operation Carrot and Stick
is quite simple.

328
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,300
We are to conquer the Re-Estize
Kingdom by inciting instability,

329
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,010
and then civil war.

330
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,390
The citizens will come
to beg for our help,

331
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,220
at which point, we will
enter their kingdom

332
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,140
to restore peace,
then bring it under our rule.

333
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,640
Lord Ains came up with the name,

334
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,520
but the suggestion came from
someone within Re-Estize.

335
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,610
To be frank, the idea was
quite clever from the start.

336
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,190
We hardly altered a thing.

337
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,740
But we need that nobleman,

338
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,700
and now he's thrown
the whole plan into disarray.

339
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,910
[MOMONGA]
Wait, he did?

340
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,030
Seems like everything's
working out fine.

341
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,950
Hold on.

342
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,450
[ALBEDO]
What is it, Shalltear?

343
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,120
I'm afraid I'm failing
to see the issue here.

344
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,500
We wanted trouble and the
foolish noble provided it,

345
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,880
without any effort on our part.

346
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,090
[MOMONGA] Thank you!
That's what I'm saying!

347
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,760
He chose the wrong target.

348
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,340
They're supposed to be
unhappy with their own rulers.

349
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,010
I never suspected
they'd be foolish enough

350
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,720
to attack us.

351
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,510
They might have someone
much more clever

352
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,480
than we anticipated
on their side.

353
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,270
If we move carelessly,
we may play

354
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,600
straight into the hands
of an unknown enemy.

355
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,150
[MOMONGA]
Seems like a stretch.

356
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,360
Super geniuses don't just
pop up out of nowhere.

357
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,650
[AINS]
Are you sure that nobleman

358
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,070
didn't do something foolish
on his own accord?

359
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,450
Seems unlikely.

360
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,780
The man is a dunce,
but even that has its limits.

361
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,160
[DEMIURGE]
No, let's think this through.

362
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,410
We can predict the actions
of a logical man,

363
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,910
but not a complete imbecile.

364
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,670
Yet Lord Ains sees the truth
even in a fool's heart.

365
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,880
[GROUP gasps]

366
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,130
Perhaps the simplest
answer is the right one.

367
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,550
Perhaps arrogance and ignorance
warped that man's feeble mind.

368
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,340
No, but how?
No one is that stupid!

369
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,550
Surely not!

370
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,510
If Lord Ains says so,
I trust him.

371
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,310
Humans are not smart at all.

372
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,520
That makes enough sense to me.

373
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,730
[COCYTUS] There is no noble wise
enough to outsmart Lord Ains,

374
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,070
so I don't see why we had
to use one quite so stupid.

375
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,690
Couldn't you find a smart one?
Or are they all this useless?

376
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,030
Some are sensible.

377
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,820
In fact, a number
of capable nobles

378
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,570
have already joined
our side in secret.

379
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,950
But we have decided to gather
all the useless nobles

380
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,450
in a faction together.

381
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,460
A wastebasket we can burn
when the time comes.

382
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,830
[COCYTUS]
Ah, a fine plan.

383
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,250
For now, let's decide

384
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,960
no how we should
respond to this noble.

385
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,630
As I'm sure you are aware,

386
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,340
the convoy they
stole supplies from

387
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,380
bore the flag of
the Sorcerer Kingdom.

388
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,930
How should we punish
such a brazen attack?

389
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,510
Kill them and move on.

390
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,890
[MOMONGA]
Huh?

391
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,180
I don't think there's
any other solution, really.

392
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,440
[MOMONGA]
What?

393
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
So, we execute all those
involved in the robbery?

394
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,360
[SHALLTEAR]
That's not enough.

395
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,480
Their masters share the blame,
I say the entire kingdom

396
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,940
should be punished
for their impudence!

397
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,530
[COCYTUS]
I concur, My Lord.

398
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,410
[MOMONGA]
Stop!

399
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,910
That would be
my judgement as well.

400
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,540
But I wonder.

401
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,160
Are you recalling
Lord Ains' words of wisdom?

402
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,120
He told us that it is easy
to rule with violence,

403
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,380
but that gives birth
to more enemies.

404
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,670
And what joy is there
in standing victorious

405
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,710
upon a great pile
of rubble, correct?

406
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,260
[AINS] You remember
my words well, Demiurge.

407
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,970
I'm impressed.

408
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,470
Ooh, I remember them
as well, My Lord!

409
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,350
How could I ever
forget them, Lord Ains?

410
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,770
Uh, me, too!

411
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,850
[AINS]
Yes, yes.

412
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,850
I'm thankful for all of you.

413
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,600
[DEMIURGE] In accordance
with your wishes,

414
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,150
we must refrain from laying
waste to the kingdom.

415
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,610
However, we cannot give them too
light of a punishment, either.

416
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm afraid this puts
our current task on hold.

417
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,700
We may have to scrap,
or at least,

418
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,530
substantially rework our plans.

419
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,910
[AINS]
I see.

420
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,410
[MOMONGA]
Well, now I feel guilty.

421
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,910
Seems like a waste to toss
everything out just like that.

422
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,460
[AINS]
Are you certain, Demiurge?

423
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,750
Has our plan truly failed?

424
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,210
[DEMIURGE]
No! What a fool I've been!

425
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,760
Lord Ains is right!

426
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,970
[DEMIURGE]
I see now.

427
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,430
So, this is why you brought
the Empire under your control!

428
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,930
You want to use the
"carrot and stick"

429
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,680
on an international level!

430
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,520
[MOMONGA]
I what?

431
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,480
[gasps]

432
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,350
[GROUP gasps]

433
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,230
[MOMONGA]
Uh...

434
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,400
[AINS]
Precisely.

435
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,280
Thank you for your guidance.

436
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,570
Very well.

437
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,900
Since we've received
permission from Lord Ains,

438
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,120
we'll give Re-Estize
a truly wicked punishment.

439
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,540
[MOMONGA]
What?

440
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,040
The Empire bowed to us quickly,
so they get the carrot,

441
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,830
but the ingrates in
Re-Estize will get the stick.

442
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,080
This message shall
be presented to all.

443
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,210
They will see both your wrath
and your mercy as clear as day.

444
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,170
And suddenly,
every leader in the world

445
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,420
will have to ask themselves,

446
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,840
"which do I want,
the carrot or the stick?"

447
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,350
This is exciting,
Lord Ains, terribly so.

448
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,390
[AINS]
Indeed.

449
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,890
[MOMONGA]
No, no, no!

450
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,980
[ZANAC] Let us begin this
meeting of the royal court.

451
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,110
We have gathered here today
to discuss the letter

452
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,490
we just received from
the Sorcerer Kingdom.

453
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,820
"Our convoy was sending
food to the Holy Kingdom

454
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,080
when it was attacked by a group
of people from Re-Estize."

455
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,450
"We, the Sorcerer Kingdom
consider this action

456
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,290
blatant hostility
and are willing

457
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,380
to declare war if necessary."

458
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,050
They've placed their seal
here, alongside the seals

459
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,300
of the Baharuth Empire,
the Dragon Kingdom,

460
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,710
and the Dwarven Kingdom,

461
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,090
all who support the
contents of this letter.

462
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,720
Next to them is the seal
of the Holy Kingdom,

463
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,010
and the seal of one individual,
known as "Faceless,"

464
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,020
who seems to hold authority
over their temples.

465
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,390
One question. Is it
possible this incident

466
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,770
was caused by the
meddling of a third party,

467
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,570
in order to destroy

I can't confirm that there
isn't a larger conspiracy,

I agree.

Perhaps he was afflicted
with Charm Person

and made to do it
against his will.

Then we must hurry,

will want to silence him.
