1
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,810
[MOMONGA]
Huh? What the hell?

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,100
That's a powered suit!
Like we had in Yggdrasil!

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,730
Does that mean they're
a player like me?

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,980
I can't believe they
were eliminated so easily.

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,360
[AINS] Mm. All according
to my plan, of course.

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,580
[GUARDIANS gasp]

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,450
[AINS]
Mm...

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,080
[COCYTUS] Ah, it took me
a moment, but I get it now!

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,750
[MOMONGA]
What? You do?

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,790
[SHALLTEAR]
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,880
I think I understand
the plan, too!

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,460
Lord Ains suspected that this
person in the red might appear,

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,630
so he reacted accordingly
with his deployment!

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,680
In other words, he sent
an underwhelming force,

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,640
because he never intended
to win in the first place!

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,680
[AINS]
Mm.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,850
Fine work!
A brilliant deduction!

18
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,350
[AINS]
Y-Yes.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,730
So, wait, am I supposed
to know the red guy?

20
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,860
He's from one of only
three adamantite-rank

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,610
adventurer teams in Re-Estize.
They're called Drop of Red.

22
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,530
Our reports indicated
that they operate

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,360
in the north of the Kingdom.

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,780
Oh, so Lord Ains
attacked a northern city

25
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,450
in hopes of drawing him out?

26
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,120
[COCYTUS]
Like a master fisherman,

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,040
our lord seized his quarry.

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,000
[AINS] Couldn't have
said it better myself.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,250
[GUARDIANS gasp]

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,670
Now, the next step.

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,260
We should plan another
attack on the city soon.

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,170
Only this time,
we will handle it properly

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,470
and raze everything
to the ground.

34
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,600
[AINS]
Yes. Exactly what I was--

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,770
[AINS]
O-On second thought,

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,230
that port city is frankly
beneath our notice.

37
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,150
I believe it's time to shift to
the next phase of our operation

38
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,020
and attack the royal
capital directly.

39
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,190
If that's what you
wish, so be it.

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,400
We can always decimate
the remaining cities later.

41
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,740
[AINS]
Yes.

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,860
[MOMONGA] While we're busy
finishing up this war,

43
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,410
they should have
plenty of time to flee.

44
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,410
[AINS]
Make preparations, for soon,

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,210
we shall march on the capital.

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,210
Every city and every
town along the way

47
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,750
will be flattened
beneath our boots!

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
Let's teach the world
what becomes of a kingdom

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,420
that defies Nazarick!

50
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,670
[GUARDIANS]
Yes, sir!

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,430
[knocking]

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,980
[ZANAC]
Yes?

53
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,730
[SOLDIER 410A] Forgive the
intrusion, Your Highness,

54
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,230
but Princess Renner is here.

55
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,780
I'm busy. Tell her we can
speak during dinner.

56
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,940
My Lord, she said
if you don't meet

57
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,700
with her immediately,
she'll start spreading

58
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,530
unfounded accusations about you.

59
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,410
[sighs] We can't have that.
Tell her I can spare a moment.

60
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,080
But if she has those
other two with her,

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,290
then they wait outside.

62
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,750
As you wish, My Lord.

63
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,880
What is it?

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,050
[RENNER] I wanted to see
if Father was still alive.

65
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,260
Is that a joke?

66
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,590
What, do you think I killed him,

67
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,470
because I wanted to do
all this paperwork myself?

68
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,970
[ZANAC] Father's alive,
but he isn't well right now.

69
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,930
I'm having him rest a bit.

70
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,480
It's remarkable that you've
been able to detain him.

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,690
Without Marquis Raeven's
help, no less.

72
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,940
That settles it.

73
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,730
The military and the
head of internal affairs

74
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,320
must've taken your side.

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,900
Father kept insisting
that we could

76
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,530
talk our way out of this.

77
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,200
But we're long past the stage
where negotiation's an option.

78
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,910
I'm sure he just wanted
to save more lives,

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,040
but he only maintained that
position because he thought

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,380
the enemy's declaration
of war was an idle threat.

81
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,460
In reality, the Sorcerer
Kingdom's army

82
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,960
has been heading north
this whole time.

83
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,670
It would seem that
they targeted the border

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,920
near the Council State.

85
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,800
I assume that's to
prevent us from receiving

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,470
any support troops from them.

87
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,430
Quick to catch on, I see.

88
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,140
At any rate, the settlements
were completely destroyed

89
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,100
and all of their
people were massacred.

90
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,440
The message is clear.

91
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,020
They won't negotiate,
we must fight.

92
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,360
But enlighten me,

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,070
why do you think their
forces have gone unnoticed

94
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,860
until just now?

95
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,360
If you've figured out this much,

96
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,700
surely you know
the answer already.

97
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,450
Yes. It means some of our nobles
have betrayed us, right?

98
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,290
Still, who outside of the palace
could control so much intel?

99
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,040
Marquis Raeven, of course.

100
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,460
[gasps] What? No. Surely not.

101
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,670
[RENNER]
This is his domain, isn't it?

102
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,880
Here's a thought.

103
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,470
Marquis Raeven loves
his son quite dearly.

104
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,890
What do you think he would do if
someone took his family hostage?

105
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,770
[ZANAC]
So, they forced his hand?

106
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,980
Is that what you think?

107
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,390
Well, it's possible,
but it's just as likely

108
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,940
he decided our kingdom
has no future.

109
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,650
[sighs] You've always been
more clever than me.

110
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,860
How would you handle this mess?

111
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,410
I believe the enemy
will be coming

112
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,950
straight for the capital.

113
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,080
So first, I must ask
if you have any army ready.

114
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,370
Well, yes.

115
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,960
[RENNER] And do you think
that army can win?

116
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,130
It's not a matter
of winning or losing.

117
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,210
We don't have any choice.

118
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,300
The enemy is burning
down our cities,

119
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,090
and they're murdering
everyone who lives in them.

120
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,970
Our chance of victory is slim,
but we have to fight.

121
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,510
We'll gather our soldiers
for one last battle.

122
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,260
The citizens will help.

123
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,310
Once they see the
cruelty of our enemy,

124
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,270
they'll want to fight, too.

125
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,980
I must admit, you've
truly become a king.

126
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,360
[gasps]

127
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,490
[RENNER] Your logic is correct.
I have nothing to add.

128
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,200
It's a pity, I won't
be much use in battle.

129
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,620
But as the face of our kingdom,
it's my duty to lead the troops.

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,620
If I die, then Father
will see this

131
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
to its grim conclusion.

132
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,500
You are free to escape
whenever you like.

133
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,710
I'll stay for now,

134
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,250
but I'll be ready to go
when the time arrives.

135
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,210
[SOLDIER 410B]
You think we should run?

136
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,300
[SOLDIER 410C]
Hell no! I'm fighting!

137
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,010
Hey, our client didn't
specify who needs to come,

138
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,810
and this hardly requires
the whole party,

139
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,730
so how about I take care of it?

140
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,230
Lakyus, if there's a reason
why you don't want us

141
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,310
coming along, just say it.

142
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,190
Uh, no. Don't worry,
it's nothing like that.

143
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,610
[GAGARAN] I bet it's
'cause the Drop of Red

144
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,320
will be at the meeting, too.

145
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,490
Their leader, Mr. Azuth
is your uncle, isn't he?

146
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm sure the two of you
have a lot to catch up on.

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I get it.

148
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,580
Yes! That's exactly right!

149
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,910
--So, I'll just--
--[TINA] Something's fishy.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,200
--[TIA] Agreed.
--[LAKYUS] Huh?

151
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,120
Summoning us
and the Drop of Red?

152
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,080
What kind of job needs
two adamantite rank teams?

153
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,460
Could be a trap.

154
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,250
You think they mentioned
Mr. Azuth to lure us in?

155
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,090
[EVILEYE] Maybe. Either way,
we should stick together.

156
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,100
Plus, I'm looking forward
to meeting a famous hero.

157
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,850
Though I wish you had
introduced us sooner,

158
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,470
since he's a relative of yours.

159
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,810
[sighs]

160
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,940
[LAKYUS]
This is the meeting place.

161
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,310
Yep, fishy all right.

162
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,230
We should prepare for the worst.

163
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,410
[AZUTH]
Come on in.

164
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,910
[WOMEN laughing]

165
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,160
So, uh, the thing is...
About my uncle--

166
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,830
some of the stuff he does can be
a little bit controversial.

167
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,040
[WOMEN laughing]

168
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,170
What's up, Laky?
Long time no see!

169
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,340
[LAKYUS]
Your "lady friends" aside,

170
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,880
this is a business meeting,

171
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,680
couldn't you at least
put a shirt on?

172
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,850
Well, I could.

173
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,640
But I also could have
stayed in bed,

174
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,680
so let's just call it
a compromise.

175
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,060
You can't act like this!

176
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,180
Act like what?

177
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,770
--[WOMEN moan]
--[WOMAN 410B] Oh, you!

178
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,110
[EVILEYE sighs]
What a sorry excuse for a hero.

179
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,740
Get your floozies out of here.

180
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,240
Wow, kid, that's rude.

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,860
What, are you jealous, shrimp?

182
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,740
So insecure you have
to wear a dumb mask?

183
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,830
[EVILEYE]
Charm Person.

184
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,290
Now scram.

185
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,460
Okay, no prob.

186
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,670
[EVILEYE]
Charm Person. Go.

187
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,630
Sure, whatever you say.

188
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:11,130
[AZUTH]
All right.

189
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,010
Nice thinking.

190
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,550
I approve. Lakyus!

191
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Everyone made it on time.

192
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,360
[gasps]

193
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,530
[AZUTH]
Whoa, whoa, cool it.

194
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
You're the last ones to show
up to the meeting and you

195
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,660
waltz in here like you're
looking for a fight?

196
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,920
Maybe we were just waiting

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,040
for your whores to leave,
you dirty old man.

198
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,000
Heh. You guys're the ones
who decided on this place.

199
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,800
Can't blame me for
having a little fun with it.

200
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,630
Ew.

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,800
[FIFTH SEAT]
Very clever.

202
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,350
Now can everyone
settle down and play nice?

203
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,890
All right.

204
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,480
You are the leader this time,
so I guess that's only fair.

205
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,520
Then let me get
straight to the point.

206
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,350
I come to you
with a proposition.

207
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,980
I speak to Lord Azuth Aindra,

208
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,070
and the other members
of the Drop of Red.

209
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,940
As well as all members
of Blue Rose.

210
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,820
We want to recruit you
to an exclusive team.

211
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,950
[BLUE ROSE gasps]

212
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,580
One second. What country
are you folks from?

213
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,790
We're talking about
the future of the world here.

214
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,910
--[TINA] What?
--[TIA] Who's there?

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,830
[FIFTH SEAT]
No need to be alarmed.

216
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,040
After all, if we really
intended to kill you,

217
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,170
we'd do it quickly,
instead wasting time

218
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,880
with all these pleasantries.

219
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,720
I get it now. They're
from the Theocracy.

220
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,930
[EVILEYE]
Are you sure?

221
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,760
An elite team of
their greatest heroes.

222
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,600
"The Black Scripture,"
I believe it was?

223
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,940
Though I heard
at least one of you

224
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,360
deviated from the
heroic path a bit.

225
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,820
[laughs] Seems I've developed
quite the reputation!

226
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
That said, I'm not special.

227
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,990
In fact, there are people
here as strong as me,

228
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,120
maybe even stronger.

229
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm looking at you, Evileye.

230
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,870
You'd give me run for my money.

231
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,540
[AZUTH] So, I don't
think this is the time

232
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,500
to join your little club.

233
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,880
But while you're here,

234
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
why don't you help us
drive out the Sorcerer King?

235
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,130
No thank you.

236
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,800
Right now, our only mission
is to recruit talent.

237
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,220
Well, ladies, may I have
an answer from you as well?

238
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,770
[FIFTH SEAT] We have no
intention of forcing your hand.

239
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,480
If we're truly to secure
the future of humankind,

240
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,900
then how would we?

241
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,150
I require loyal allies
for the struggle ahead.

242
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,570
I'm afraid I'll have
to refuse. Everyone--

243
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,240
[GAGARAN] Come on.
You're the leader, aren't you?

244
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,200
You don't need to ask.
We'll follow your decision.

245
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,530
Very well then.

246
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,210
No need to waste
your time any further.

247
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,750
We shall pray for your health,

248
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,250
and for the downfall of the
Sorcerer King, of course.

249
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,760
[LAKYUS] Uncle.
What are you going to do now?

250
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,170
I'll hang out in the capital,

251
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,760
until the Sorcerer
King shows up.

252
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,180
No way anyone
can stop his advance.

253
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,220
So don't you even entertain
the thought of fighting him.

254
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,680
Run away.

255
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,100
That's not funny.

256
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,270
I won't leave the capital
behind. Can't we help you?

257
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,440
I've got a job to do,

258
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,400
and I'm the only man
who can pull it off.

259
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,650
That means I gotta
do it all on my own.

260
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,820
[EVILEYE]
Cryptic.

261
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,200
You think you can kill
the Sorcerer King?

262
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,830
[AZUTH] Wouldn't even
dream of it, little lady.

263
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,990
But as long as I'm alone,
I'll be fine.

264
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,790
Even if he surrounds
the whole capital,

265
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,670
he won't be able to catch me.

266
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,920
Well, time to get
some bodies rocking,

267
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
if you ladies catch my drift.

268
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,050
Sorry for the wait, my dears!

269

[WOMAN 410B]
Get over here, silly!

270
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,550
[MILITARY REPRESENTATIVE]
Your Highness.

271
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,010
Yes, I know.

272
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,820
[ALBEDO]
Lord Ains.

273
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,610
An enemy envoy is approaching.

274
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,490
And judging by his armor,
he thinks himself important.

275
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,700
[AINS]
Mm.

276
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,910
[ZANAC] I am the crown prince
of the Re-Estize Kingdom,

Zanac Valleon Igana
Ryle Vaiself!

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,620
I would like to
request an audience

279
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,040
with the Sorcerer King,
one-on-one!

280
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,210
Shall I shoo the
rat away, Lord Ains?

281
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,760
We're under no obligation
to humor our foe, after all.

282
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,840
[COCYTUS] If Lord Ains refuses
to converse in good faith,

283
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,550
others may think him
vindictive and close-minded.

284
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,470
And who will spread that opinion
once we've killed them all?

285
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,180
[AINS]
Let us take care, Albedo.

286
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,680
There are those
who may be stealing

287
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,350
glances at us from afar.

288
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
[ALBEDO]
Forgive my negligence.

289
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,400
[AINS]
I suppose I'll go see him, then.

290
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,570
[COCYTUS]
Shall I act as your guard?

291
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,950
[AINS] A prince has
come to face me alone.

292
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,200
It's only appropriate
that I answer in kind.

293
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,210
[ZANAC] It's an honor that you
came to meet me, Your Majesty.

294
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,090
I am Zanac Valleon
Igana Ryle Vaiself.

295
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,050
[AINS]
The honor is all mine.

296
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,850
I am the Sorcerer King,
Ains Ooal Gown.

297
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,560
Will water suffice?

298
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,680
[ZANAC]
Yes.

299
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,230
Very considerate
of you, Your Majesty.

300
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,770
Ah, this is lovely.

301
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,230
[AINS]
Good.

302
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,690
With that out of the way,
we may begin our discussion.

303
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,990
[AINS] What did you wish
to speak about?

304
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,700
Perhaps you are rejecting the
justification for our invasion?

305
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,370
That part is clear enough,
but I still have a question.

306
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,790
Why have you chosen to engage
in such needless cruelty?

307
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,340
Why won't you accept
our plea of surrender?

308
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,670
[AINS]
Hm. Because there's no benefit

309
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,720
in accepting your surrender.

310
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,220
How is that?

311
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
[AINS] It is more advantageous
for us to make an example

312
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,060
out of you, and in doing so,
show the world how foolish it is

313
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,430
to oppose the Sorcerer Kingdom.

314
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,730
To that end, we will
decimate all of your forces,

315
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,060
then we shall march upon
the capital and reduce it

316
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,520
to naught but a pile of rubble.

317
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,820
And thus it shall remain,
for hundreds or even thousands

318
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,410
of years, a lasting monument
to the folly of opposing

319
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,330
the Sorcerer Kingdom.

320
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,750
That seems so close-minded.

321
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,290
[AINS]
What?

322
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,460
You possess such great power.
So there are countless ways

323
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,090
that you could demonstrate
it to the world.

324
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,130
And yet you have chosen
to be vindictive instead.

325
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,470
[AINS]
One might think so.

326
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,560
Do you have a goal
in doing this?

327
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,230
[AINS]
How shall I answer that?

328
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,820
[MOMONGA]
My friends from Yggdrasil

329
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,360
may exist somewhere
in this world.

330
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,610
That's the hope I've held on to.

331
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,030
[AINS] My goal is simple,
but shapeless.

332
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,290
It is honest
and straightforward,

333
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,000
but it slips through
one's fingers so easily.

334
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,290
In short, there is only one
thing that I am searching for.

335
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,210
Happiness.

336
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,130
That can't be all.

337
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,760
[AINS] In the end,
is that not the prize

338
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,470
that all creatures yearn for?
Living and undead?

339
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,720
And to achieve that,
you would rob others

340
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,020
of their happiness?

341
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,730
[AINS]
Is that such a surprise?

342
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,110
My only purpose is to bring
prosperity to those I treasure.

343
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,980
If I can do that,
why should I care

344
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,650
what happens to anyone else?

345
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,110
If your people could only
achieve happiness by making

346
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,490
the people of another country
suffer, what would you do?

347
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,250
Would you tell your subjects
to give up on their own joy?

348
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,960
Pure sophistry!

349
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,250
I do apologize, Your Majesty.

350
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,210
[AINS]
Please, I take no offense.

351
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,590
But do you truly believe

352
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,840
that this is the only way
to achieve your goal?

353
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,930
With so much strength and
intelligence at your disposal?

354
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,640
[AINS]
Mm. There may be other ways.

355
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,600
But they say that the
goddess of opportunity

356
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,730
has hair on her forehead,
but is bald from behind.

357
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,110
In other words,
when you see a chance,

358
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,360
you must seize it immediately,
lest it pass you by.

359
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,900
That's quite the
strange goddess!

360
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,070
Pardon me.

361
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,950
I didn't intend to
belittle your deities--

362
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,910
I'd simply never heard
of such a thing.

363
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,990
Forgive my rudeness.

364
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,790
[AINS] No, I only meant it
as a turn of phrase,

365
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,500
not an object of worship.

366
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,830
But the point is,
I will not take chances.

367
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,130
If I can destroy you

368
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,460
to better protect my
loved ones, then I shall.

369
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,880
Thus is war. Does that
answer satisfy you?

370
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
[sighs] I suppose so.

371
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,590
It's the duty of
any nation's leader.

372
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,850
We must act in the best
interests of our people,

373
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,100
above all else.

374
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,140
So, I do understand
your logic, at least.

375
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,230
I see why you won't accept
my kingdom's surrender,

376
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,980
and I see there's
nothing I can do.

377
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,780
[AINS] Perhaps it's my turn
to ask a question now,

378
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,240
though nothing comes to mind.

379
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,570
No, wait. The sword
of Gazef Stronoff.

380
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,870
Do you know who has it now?

381
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,160
I noticed that you're
wearing his armor.

382
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,660
Indeed. Though I
was given the armor,

383
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,420
the sword was entrusted
to a man named Brain Unglaus.

384
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,710
[AINS] Ah, I see. I know him
in passing, at least.

385
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,550
So, is he here with
your forces now?

386
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,510
No, to my knowledge,
he is in the royal palace.

387
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,010
[AINS] In that case, I suppose
I can destroy your soldiers

388
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,970
with whatever spells I fancy,

389
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,930
since you have
nothing worth saving.

390
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,270
It's not really
my intention to lose,

391
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,770
but I would appreciate it
if you'd use magic

392
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,110
that doesn't cause
undue suffering.

393
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,150
[AINS]
Mm. Fair enough.

394
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,530
Since we've become
acquainted with one another,

395
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,320
I'll make certain to slaughter
you as gently as I can manage.

396
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,990
[laughs] I'll call that a mercy!

397
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,120
Truly refreshing. I'm grateful.

398
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,460
[ZANAC]
Your Majesty.

399
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,420
Before I go, might I ask
one last question?

400
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,630
[AINS]
Hm.

401
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,590
I fear my elder
brother was killed.

402
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,590
Were your subordinates
responsible for that?

403
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,600
[AINS]
Elder brother?

404
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I do seem to recall
a prince being slain.

405
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,890
I see. I s'pose that's
closure at least.

406
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,610
Thank you, you've finally
put the matter to rest.

407
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,980
Farewell.

408
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,280
[AINS]
A dauntless man.

409
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,870
That must be what
true royalty is like.

410
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,160
[ZANAC sighs]

411
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,170
[AINS] In short,
there is only one thing

412
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,250
that I am searching for.

413
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,630
Happiness.

414
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,130
[ZANAC]
Well, that settles it.

415
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,220
I was never fit to be king
in the first place.

416
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,640
All I ever wanted was
to make this kingdom

417
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,520
a place worth living.

418
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,610
[NOBLES]
Your Highness!

419
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,810
[NOBLE 410A]
You're unharmed!

420
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,320
[NOBLE 410B]
What did the Sorcerer King say?

421
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,690
The enemy plans
to kill every last person

422
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,570
in the kingdom, I'm afraid.
Negotiation was never an option.

423
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,080
[MILITARY REPRESENTATIVE]
Welcome back, Your Highness.

424
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,830
It sounds like the talk
didn't go well.

425
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,080
No, but I never had
high expectations.

426
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,620
That's fair enough.

427
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,920
So, what kind of monster
was this Sorcerer King?

428
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,710
[ZANAC] I'd say he
was surprisingly human.

429
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,880
It's true.

430
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,630
He was certainly a monster
on the outside,

431
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,010
all bones and such.

432
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,060
But on the inside, he's
just like any other person.

433
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,970
Now then, what's
our plan of attack?

434
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,270
I'm afraid we don't have a plan.
We've lost our talented knights.

435
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,730
Most of them were wiped out
in the previous war.

436
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,230
Honestly, I wasn't
too fond of Stronoff

437
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,360
when he was alive, so I
never thought I'd miss him

438
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,950
at a time like this.

439
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,660
[SOLDIER 410D]
What do you want? [groans]

440
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,870
Don't move an inch!

441
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,960
[gasps]

442
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,750
[MILITARY REPRESENTATIVE]
Stay away!

443
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,170
Don't touch His Highness!

444
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,540
[ZANAC]
A rebellion at a time like this?

445
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,260
No, they're just desperate.
They'll do anything to survive.

446
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,260
Heh.

447
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,840
Stand down, you traitors!

448
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,590
[ZANAC]
Wait. I'll speak to them.

449
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,470
Out with it, then. What
business brings you here?

450
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,890
Your Highness.

451
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,890
We've come to demand that
you offer up a surrender!

452
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,390
That is not an option.

453
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,400
Our only hope for survival
is defeating the Sorcerer King.

454
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,020
I confirmed that myself.

455
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,150
How could we possibly win?

456
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,780
He has a whole army of undead!

457
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,150
Perhaps our kingdom
cannot survive this,

458
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,990
but we don't all
have to die here.

459
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,870
If we offer your head
to the Sorcerer King,

460
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,290
then he may spare us.

461
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,410
We pray that he'll accept
it as a sign of loyalty.

462
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,870
[NOBLE 410A]
There's no time.

463
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,040
Don't resist and we'll
make it quick.

464
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,000
I am a prince.

465
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,430
I will fight to the bitter end.
There's no fear within me.

466
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,850
If you dare to challenge me,
you must be prepared to die!

467
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,680
Lost your nerve? Face me!

468
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,520
Come and take this head
if you think you can!

469
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,110
[ALBEDO]
Lord Ains.

470
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,400
[AINS]
Yes? What is it?

471
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,030
It would seem we have guests.

472
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,240
Some nobles from Re-Estize
request an audience.

473
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,870
[AINS]
Bring them here.

474
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,870
[NOBLE 410A] It's an honor
to bask in your glory,

475
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,160
Your Majesty.

476
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,790
Our only wish is to serve
humbly at your feet.

477
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,590
So, we offer this gift.
Please accept it.

478
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,730
[AINS]
Give him a proper burial.

479
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,690
[AINS] So, what happened
to the armor he was wearing?

480
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,530
[NOBLES gasp]

481
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,030
[ALBEDO]
What's wrong?

482
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,900
Surely you wouldn't refuse
to answer Lord Ains' question.

483
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,780
Well, uh, I would
assume it's still

484
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,160
on the prince's corpse,
which would be in his tent

485
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,450
where we left it.

486
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,620
[AINS]
Hm. I see. Very well.

487
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,670
Splendid job, all of you.

488
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,380
And fine work
deserves a fine reward.

489
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,920
What is it that you wish?

490
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,460
[NOBLE 410A] Please spare me
and my family, Sorcerer King!

491
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,670
I pledge my undying allegiance
to you and you alone!

492
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,930
[NOBLE 410B]
As do I, Your Majesty!

493
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,300
[AINS]
Yes, yes, no need to beg.

494
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,060
Don't worry. As requested,
I won't kill you.

495
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,850
[NOBLES]
Thank you, My Lord!

496
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,940
[AINS]
Albedo. Send them to Neuronist.

497
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,610
We'll find their families later.

498
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,980
Of course, My Lord.

499
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,360
[NOBLE 410A]
I'm truly grateful!

500
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
Long live the great
Sorcerer King!

501
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,110
[AINS]
Aura.

502
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,570
[AURA]
Uh. Yes, My Lord?

503
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,910
[AINS]
You heard the deal.

504
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,990
Tell Neuronist not to kill them,

505
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,540
not until they beg
for death, at least.

506
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,040
[AURA] Understood,
Lord Ains! No problem!

507
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,590
[AINS] And even when
they do beg for death,

508
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,800
she doesn't need to be
in a hurry about it.

509
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,960
Got it!

510
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,840
[AINS] I've lost interest
in this farce.

511
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,300
Cocytus, take command,
with Mare as your second.

512
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,600
[COCYTUS, MARE]
Yes, sir.

513
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,140
[AINS]
Don't hold back.

514
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,980
Use the full extent of your
strength, however you see fit.
