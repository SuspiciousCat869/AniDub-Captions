1
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,625
[ANNOUNCER 3A]
And here he is at last,

2
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:16,667
making his dramatic return!

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,792
It's the hero of the colosseum,

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,625
the most powerful fighter
in all the land!

5
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:24,834
Let's hear it for
the Warrior King!

6
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:33,875
[AINS] Forget everything
you've seen today.

7
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:35,667
Of course, My Lord.

8
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,041
[MOMONGA] There's no doubt that
Nazarick is an overwhelmingly

9
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:44,083
powerful force,
but I still worry.

10
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,291
There's an enemy out there

11
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:49,208
with a world item and
we don't know where.

12
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,208
The "world domination approach"
has gone well enough

13
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,834
and I know that's what
everyone else wants.

14
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:01,417
[AINS] But I must bestow love
upon those I rule over as well,

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,417
this is my kingdom, after all.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,125
I must show it proper
care and affection.

17
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,625
Absolutely, My Lord, I agree!

18
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,875
[AINS]
Then, let us create a utopia.

19
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,750
A land as sweet as honey,
a dream that never ends.

20
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:21,542
A carrot and stick
approach, perhaps?

21
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:24,166
[MOMONGA] Come to think of it,
I might be onto something.

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,959
I could even see this bringing
us some good publicity,

23
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,542
which is exactly what I need
to recruit adventurers!

24
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,875
[AINS]
What a splendid idea.

25
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:13,375
Pardon, Your Majesty?
This city looks familiar.

26
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,125
If I may ask, is this Arwintar,
the Imperial Capital?

27
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,291
[AINS]
That is correct.

28
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,875
I-I see.

29
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,792
Then is there a reason we didn't
pass through a check point?

30
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,166
[AINS]
A trivial detail.

31
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,041
Kings entering other
countries unannounced

32
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,333
is an international issue!

33
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,458
[AINS]
Do not fret.

34
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,667
Master El Nix and I
are on good terms.

35
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,083
I'm sure that he will
look the other way.

36
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,000
If you say so.

37
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,917
[MOMONGA] There's good
reason for our secrecy.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,500
If Jircniv knew I was coming,

39
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,500
he'd throw a formal
welcome for sure.

40
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,125
Last thing I need
is for him to find out

41
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,250
I know nothing
about noble society.

42
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,709
I intentionally used a
Gate spell so that we could

43
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:51,291
sneak into their country
on the downlow.

44
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,000
Excuse my bluntness,
but what are you

45
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,000
planning to do here
now that we've arrived?

46
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,125
I think it's time
that I learn the plan.

47
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,750
[AINS] I intend to invite
the adventurers from the Empire

48
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,500
to my kingdom.

49
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,083
You're saying this
is a recruiting mission?

50
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,417
[AINS]
Indeed.

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,083
There is potential.

52
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,166
However, are you sure they
would uproot their lives

53
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,333
and leave everything
they gained behind?

54
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,709
This will be a hard sell.
It's a lot to ask of people.

55
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,000
[AINS]
Hm.

56
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,709
[MOMONGA] This is exactly
the sort of opinion

57
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,375
I wanted to hear.

58
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,333
Sorry if I overstepped
my boundaries.

59
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:25,542
[AINS]
No, no.

60
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,583
I am a different type
of entity from you.

61
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,667
That's why some of
my reactions may vary

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,959
from those of a
typical human being.

63
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,750
Please continue to voice your
concerns so that I may adapt.

64
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:38,166
All right. Then
allow me to add this.

65
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,709
You mentioned previously that
you want to have adventurers

66
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,542
to explore the unknown, correct?

67
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,667
And that you would give us
your unconditional support

68
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,792
for that purpose?

69
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,000
Then I must ask, does
that generous offer extend

70
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,875
to the new recruits as well
as the ones we have now?

71
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,583
[AINS]
That is my intention.

72
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,709
Creating an institute
to nurture adventurers

73
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,667
is the point, after all.

74
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,583
I didn't realize
you thought that far.

75
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,959
Then, wouldn't it be a good idea

76
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,917
to gather and raise
some fledglings?

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,542
[AINS]
Hm...

78
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,125
People admire the
strong, don't they?

79
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,834
This is the Imperial Capital.

80
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,542
Why not publicize your mission

81
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,458
by showing off your power
at the colosseum?

82
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:16,625
[AINS]
Ah. Now that is a clever idea.

83
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:17,709
Do take note.

84
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,583
The Empire has an
infamous champion.

85
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,375
"Warrior King" he's called.

86
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,458
[AINS] That is quite a
hefty moniker, indeed.

87
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,375
He's the current title holder,
and although he's the eighth man

88
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,333
to carry that name,
he's the strongest so far.

89
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:34,667
I just so happen to be
acquaintances with his promoter.

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,291
And if you like, I can arrange
a meeting with him for you.

91
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,000
[MOMONGA]
Look at the size of that place!

92
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,000
This guy must be rolling in it!

93
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,583
Then again, he is the promoter
for the greatest champ

94
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,333
the colosseum has ever known,

95
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:52,583
I'm sure that's
pretty lucrative.

96
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,041
Looking good.

97
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,250
As requested, I've set up
a meeting with him for you.

98
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:01,041
So be ready by 10 o'clock
tomorrow morning.

99
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,625
I imagine we could
squeeze in sooner, though.

100
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:06,083
If he knew it was you asking
for a private audience,

101
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,000
he might swing for it right now.

102
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,792
[AINS]
That won't be necessary.

103
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,125
We should be thankful he's
available to see us so quickly.

104
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,417
[gasps]

105
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,375
[AINS]
What is it?

106
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,750
It's nothing.

107
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,375
I was thinking how
impressed I was

108
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,375
by your patience, Your Majesty.

109
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,709
[AINS] Mm. Anyway, I will have
you accompany me again tomorrow.

110
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,792
In the meantime, please
enjoy the evening off.

111
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,667
I'll send you back to E-Rantel
by using a bit of magic.

112
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,250
Greater Teleportation.

113
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,125
[gasps]

114
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,333
[AINS]
All right.

115
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,542
I'll take this time
to now contact Fluder.

116
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,917
I wanted to look into something.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
[FLUDER]
Why, hello!

118
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,709
So good of you to visit,
my radiant Lord!

119
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:49,333
[AINS] So, Fluder, have
my orders been carried out?

120
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,166
[FLUDER] Yes! As requested,
I have finished

121
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,792
recording the data for
the nearby countries.

122
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,917
However, I encountered
one problem

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,542
that may cause some concern.

124
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,750
The emperor has discovered
my betrayal, unfortunately.

125
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,458
[AINS]
That's hardly unexpected.

126
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,709
But don't worry,

127
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:06,333
I'll simply adjust our
next course of action.

128
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,542
Please be seated.

129
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,125
[FLUDER]
Very well.

130
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:13,959
Huh? What is that?

131
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,542
[AINS]
It's your reward.

132
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,333
With this, I shall bestow a
piece of my wisdom upon thee.

133
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:26,750
[FLUDER]
My apologies.

134
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,583
It seems I am unable
to decipher this.

135
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,750
[AINS]
Mm. In that case, try this.

136
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,000
[FLUDER]
Thank you!

137
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,917
[MOMONGA]
Hope this is a good gift.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,667
I doubt it even applies
to the magic in this world,

139
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,000
but at least the
cover looks fancy.

140
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,208
[FLUDER gasps]
Incredible! It says here

141
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,000
that human souls
are like droplets

142
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,875
that have separated from
the river of the greater world.

143
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,375
While the size of the soul
may be varying in size,

144
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,000
they all originate from
the same source!

145
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,375
What a breakthrough!
Now, this is truly fascinating!

146
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,417
It is exactly the knowledge
I have been seeking! Wow!

147
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,125
[AINS] Splendid. I'll
take my eyeglass now.

148
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,792
It's my only one, so I
can't just give it to you.

149
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,709
But I'll need it for the future.

150
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,792
[AINS] You'll only be able
to ascend to the next realm

151
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,291
of knowledge when you
can translate, decipher,

152
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,542
and understand the text.

153
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,458
Very well, My Lord.

154
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,333
I shall not fight you
on that logic.

155
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,000
[AINS]
Thank you.

156
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,875
Now, please divulge what
you know of the Warrior King.

157
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,625
Quite a rare sight.

158
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,625
A female Rabbit Man.

159
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,125
They come from far east of here.

160
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,125
[BUTLER 4A]
This way, if you would.

161
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,291
You may enter.

162
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,250
[OSK]
Does what you see please you?

163
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:06,500
[AINS] Yes. This is
quite the collection.

164
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,583
Anything happen
to catch your eye?

165
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,458
Ah, that one, maybe?

166
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:12,959
[AINS]
May I hold it?

167
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,333
[OSK]
Of course.

168
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:19,000
[AINS]
Interesting. Are these runes?

169
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,542
I'd expect nothing less
from the Sorcerer King!

170
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,333
Are these familiar to you?

171
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,291
[MOMONGA]
Dang, so they actually are?

172
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,792
I wonder if a player
spread the knowledge.

173
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,333
[AINS]
This is a fine work.

174
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,750
Who created it?

175
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,417
This was made
in a rune workshop,

176
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,083
by a dwarven craftsman.

177
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,333
They have a kingdom in the
Azerlisia mountain range.

178
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,417
[AINS]
Ah, how intriguing.

179
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
So tell me, Osk.

180
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,458
How did you know
it was His Majesty?

181
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,041
I'm surprised you
figured it out so easily.

182
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,917
Honestly, it really
wasn't that hard

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,542
to put two and two together.

184
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,542
If you, the head of
the adventurer's guild,

185
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,291
is reporting to someone,

186
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,000
only one person from
E-Rantell comes to mind.

187
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,041
Allow me to introduce myself.

188
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,583
My name is Osk,
I'm just a humble merchant.

189
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,792
It's truly an honor to meet you.

190
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,083
[AINS]
As you have surmised,

191
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,667
I am the Sorcerer King,
Ains Ooal Gown.

192
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,500
In all your glory!
But I'm shocked!

193
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,375
What could someone
such as me provide

194
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,125
to a ruler of such
extraordinary influence?

195
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,166
[AINS]
I would like to battle

196
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,583
the Warrior King
in the colosseum.

197
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,000
Funny joke, sir. A knee slapper.

198
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:21,834
[AINS]
I'm serious.

199
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,375
Do correct me if I'm wrong,

200
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,375
but are you not the
ruler of a country?

201
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,959
[AINS]
I am.

202
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,917
Apologies. Please understand,
the complications are too many.

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,792
[AINS]
Do not fret.

204
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,208
No matter what happens to me,

205
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,125
I promise it won't
cause you any trouble.

206
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,458
I can put it in writing,
if you like.

207
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,583
Let me confirm something then.
I gather a lot of information,

208
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,542
especially about the
warriors and monsters

209
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,000
I plan to have appear
in the colosseum.

210
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,333
Among the rumors, one in
particular concerned you.

211
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,333
Is it true that you annihilated
tens of thousands of people

212
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,208
from the Kingdom
using a single magic spell?

213
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,875
[AINS]
Uh, yes.

214
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,542
That spell is... Oh, right!

215
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,500
That magic is more like a trump
card I rarely like to use.

216
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,458
It was Master Jircniv's wish,
so I had no choice

217
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,709
but to use a major
spell like that.

218
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,250
It's one I can only cast
once every ten years.

219
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,959
To use it again would take
at least a decade.

220
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,208
Ah. Are you sure it's okay
you divulged that detail

221
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,709
with someone like me?

222
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,875
In a way, you revealed a weak
point to me, Your Majesty.

223
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,125
[AINS]
Please.

224
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,125
It's not as if all
my magic is incapacitated.

225
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,625
Fair enough, I s'pose!

226
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,125
One last question then.

227
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,917
Why would a powerful ruler
of a country, such as yourself,

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,208
want to fight against
the Warrior King?

229
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,792
[AINS] Well, the rumor is,
he was someone strong,

230
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,083
so it piqued my curiosity.

231
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,375
I'd like to find out

232
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,500
if he is stronger than
Gazef Stronoff, for one.

233
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,375
Then I understand.

234
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,333
I shall prepare a match
with the Warrior King

235
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,041
right away for you, sir.

236
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,959
But King or no King,
there are certain rules

237
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,792
you'll have to follow
in the colosseum.

238
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,125
[AINS]
That's reasonable.

239
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,959
For instance, we will want
you to fight him with

240
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,583
only weapons and zero
magic, Your Majesty.

241
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,750
But the king is clearly
a magic caster!

242
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,500
[AINS]
That's fine by me.

243
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
[AINZACH, OSK gasp]

244
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,000
[AINS] I swear upon my name,
Ains Ooal Gown,

245
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,000
that I will not use magic
when fighting the Warrior King.

246
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,750
You have my word.

247
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,792
[OSK]
Headhunter Rabbit.

248
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,542
Yes, sir?

249
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,959
What's your honest opinion on
His Majesty, the Sorcerer King?

250
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,834
One glance and I wanted
to run for my life.

251
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,542
[RABBIT] What are you
gawking at, you creep?

252
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,792
I just noticed
your lovely hands.

253
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,542
Don't take it the wrong way.

254
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,375
Besides, I'm more interested
in someone like Gargaran,

255
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,625
the warrior from Blue Rose.

256
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,417
If you had a little more height
and meat on you, then maybe.

257
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,166
I guess I won't be renewing
my contract next year.

258
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,542
That aside, could Lord Ains win?

259
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,291
Honestly.

260
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,542
It's gonna be an
absolute bloodbath.

261
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,291
[ANNOUNCER 3A] Now, our
next challenger is a name

I'm sure you'll recognize!

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,083
King of the Sorcerer Kingdom...

264

[OSK] How are we feeling,
Warrior King?

265
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,792
[WARRIOR KING]
I'm feeling grateful.

266
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,750
Thanks to you
keeping your promises,

267
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,041
I've become as
strong as I am now.

I'm in tip-top condition.

The highest-class of undead.

In other words, an Overlord.

281
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,166
[WARRIOR KING]
I see.

282
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,125
Then I will fight you
with all my might!

283
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,125
[AINS] Oh? You're not going
to make fun of my name?

284
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,125
I thought that your race found
long names to be ostentatious.

285
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,834
[WARRIOR KING]
Ah, didn't expect that.

286
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,750
I see you're quite familiar
with war trolls.

287
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:12,417
However, I would never mock
the name of the strong!

288
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,750
[AINS]
My mistake.

289
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,083
I suppose that means I
should readjust how I think

290
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,000
when it comes to your people.

291
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,208
[WARRIOR KING laughs]
Not necessary.

292
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm an outlier.

293
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,542
Besides, regardless of race,

294
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,041
there's always a
diversity of thought.

295

[AINS laughs]
Right you are.

296
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,125
I'm starting to grow
fond of you, Warrior King.

297
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,417
Will you join my side
should I win?

298
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,959
[WARRIOR KING] Sure. If I
lose, I'll pledge my loyalty.

However, should I claim victory,
I wish to eat you.

Huh?

00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,583
[WARRIOR KING]
Until now, I've never met anyone

302
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,291
worth killing
and devouring.

303
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,583
But you're more powerful
than I am, so if I eat you,

304
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,083
I can absorb your essence
and become even stronger.

That's fine by me.

the other's life in their hands.

[JIRCNIV] You got this!
Let's see some blood!

314
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,959
[AINS laughs]
You're an interesting one.

315
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,083
I do question
that stance though.

316
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,750
Are you inviting me to strike?

317
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,667
I'd be obliged!

318
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,792
[WARRIOR KING groans]

319
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,709
[AINS] As expected,
he's distracted by fire.

320
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:58,125
It does inhibit a war troll's
healing capabilities, after all.

321
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,333
However...

322
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,125
[JIRCNIV] You've got him
in a good position!

323
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,375
[MOMONGA]
Our countries are supposed to be

324
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,041
in an alliance, you jerk!

325
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,000
As an allied king,
you could at least

326
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,792
show a little concern for me!

327
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,083
[AINS] I can emit negative
energy and impart it to you

328
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,041
with a mere touch.

329
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,166
[WARRIOR KING]
This--This isn't poison?

330
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,875
[AINS]
No, because you would be able

331
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,250
to recover from that with
your regeneration powers.

332
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,500
As I'm sure you've noticed,
my powers have weakened

333
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,083
your strength and agility.

334
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,208
While trolls can
easily heal injuries,

335
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,750
I doubt you can heal
your loss of ability.

336
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:37,959
In this battle, we are
prohibited from using magic.

337
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:42,166
However, that did not include
the use of magic items.

338
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,000
I didn't want to give myself
too big of an advantage,

339
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,041
so I limited what I brought.

340
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,583
[AINS] This is a weapon
I borrowed from Momon.

341
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,291
Now, shall we continue?

342
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,667
[WARRIOR KING yells]

343
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,208
[WARRIOR KING]
Again?

344
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,583
[WARRIOR KING]
Hide Reinforcement!

345
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,750
Greater Hide Reinforcement!

346
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:07,667
[AINS]
Activate!

347
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,208
[WARRIOR KING groans]

348
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,875
[MOMONGA]
That's weird.

349
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,667
I'd hoped more people would
be cheering for me by now.

350
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,583
[AINS] I suppose it's tough
being the away team.

351
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,917
Let's wrap this up.

352
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,458
Next, I'm killing you.

353
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:31,250
If you admit defeat,
we avoid that, of course.

354
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,166
[WARRIOR KING]
No. I'm still the Warrior King!

355
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,166
When I claimed that title,
this became my resting place.

356
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,542
[AINS] Then take off that helmet
and show me your face.

357
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,875
[AINS]
Those eyes. Determined.

358
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:54,542
Let me ask you.
Can you make a comeback?

359
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,000
What techniques do you
have left to beat me?

360
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,500
None, but it's not over!

361
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,458
Beat me proper!

362
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:06,500
[AINS]
Then, come at me, Warrior King!

363
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,917
[roars]

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,542
[AINS]
You have speed, but that's all.

365
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,250
Aura of Despair. Level 1!

366
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:17,291
Strong Strike!
Divine Skill, Single Flash!

367
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,291
Flow Acceleration!

368
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,000
[yells]

369
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,458
[WARRIOR KING]
Dammit!

370
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,750
[AINS] No techniques left
to defeat me, huh?

371
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:31,709
I was tricked.

372
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,166
Punitto Moe would scold me.

373
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,917
Hurry up! You can
still win, Warrior King!

374
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,959
[AINS]
Jeez, he's loud.

375
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,083
[MOMONGA]
Jircniv, what the hell?

376
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,333
I hear you clear
as day, you know!

377
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,709
[AINS] Though you are
the better fighter,

378
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,750
there is one insurmountable
difference between.

379
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,625
[WARRIOR KING yells]

380
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,250
[WARRIOR KING groans]

381
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,667
[AINS]
Unlike you, I am level 100.

382
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,500
My HP will long outlast yours.

383
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:15,000
[AINS]
Hm. Dropping his excess weight

384
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,000
so that he can
attack more quickly?

385
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,166
A dangerous gamble.

386
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,667
Tell me, Your Majesty.
Would you say that I am weak?

387
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,709
I know you haven't been
fighting me seriously today.

388
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,625
You're at ease and have
pulled back on every attack.

389
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:33,375
Am I truly that feeble to you?

390
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,875
Just tell me, I'd much rather
die knowing the truth.

391
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,000
[AINS]
To be honest, in this duel,

392
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,542
I've made all sorts
of magic items off-limits

393
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,250
and prohibited myself
from relying on

394
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,875
many of my normal abilities.

395
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,917
[WARRIOR KING]
Is that because

396
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,709
you'd win in an
instant, otherwise?

397
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:52,375
[AINS]
Yes, but don't feel too bad.

398
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,792
If you're the toughest
in the Empire,

399
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,709
then I'm most likely one of
the strongest in the world.

400
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,208
That's understandable.

401
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,583
It's been fun--
motivational, too--

402
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,750
knowing that there's always
someone stronger out there.

403
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:08,875
[AINS]
I can appreciate that sentiment.

404
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,875
[MOMONGA]
Touch.

405
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,000
Hear me, Sorcerer King
Ains Ooal Gown!

406
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,458
I would like to
witness true power!

407
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:20,083
No matter how briefly.
I want to feel it at its peak!

408
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,959
So, please show me the
extent of what you can do!

409
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,417
[AINS]
Very well!

410
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,583
I'd be happy to demonstrate
the pinnacle of strength!

411
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:32,333
High Tiered Physical
Nullification, release.

412
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,834

[panting]

415
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,000
[AINS]
Activate.

416
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,583
[CROWD gasps]

417
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,208
[AINS]
People of the Empire!

418
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,542
I am currently
forming an institution

419
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,166
for supporting adventurers.

420
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,667
Many are tasked with surviving

421
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,375
on their abilities alone,

422
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,792
and I believe that training
and cultivating them

423
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,750
will benefit my kingdom greatly!

424
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:26,834
But do not fear, I don't plan
to use these adventurers

425
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,417
as pawns of war.
As you have seen,

426
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,291
my offensive capabilities
leave nothing to be desired.

427
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,792
What I seek are people who want
to go on true adventures!

428
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,709
If you dream about discovering
the unknown, join me!

429
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:44,083
[AINS] Your endeavors will be
backed by my unimaginable power,

430
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,291
which I shall demonstrate here.

431
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,583
Death is the end,
but I can overcome it!

432
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,125
Behold!

433
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,083
[WARRIOR KING groans]

434
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,333
[AINS] Normally only
high-ranking priests

435
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,000
can use Resurrection
magic. But for me?

436
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,709
This is child's play!

437
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:08,000
Come to my kingdom and know
an adventure like none other!

438
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,041
[silence]

439
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,750
[AINS]
Fly.

440
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,458
[AINS]
Apologies about before.

441
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,625
As expected of Master Gown.

442
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:20,959
You defeated the strongest
warrior in the Empire.

443
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,166
That was quite
an impressive feat.

444
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,542
[AINS]
It was a good fight.

445
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:29,667
Either of us could have won,
but luck was on my side.

446
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,458
With that, I shall
take my leave.

447
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:35,000
[JIRCNIV]
One moment! I have a request!

448
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,083
Sorcerer King.

449
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,458
I pledge my full support to you.

450
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,417
Therefore, the Baharuth Empire

451
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,917
shall gladly become
your vassal state!

452
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,750
What?

453
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:44,583
Huh?

454
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,041
Seriously?

455
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,667
--Think this through!
--[NIMBLE] Are you sure, sir?

456
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,834
[AINS] There is much to consider
in becoming a vassal state.

457
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,709
[MOMONGA]
Like, what even is that?

458
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:56,333
[AINS] I'm afraid I can't offer
a response immediately,

459
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,542
so if I could at least get
that in writing from you.

460
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,000
Of course!

461
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,917
If that's what you want,
I'll send something right away!

462
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,542
[AINS]
Perfect. Draw up the document

463
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,542
explaining the Empire's proposed
relationship to my kingdom

464
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,917
and I shall respond accordingly.

465
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,792
Your Highness.

466
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,792
Know why I made the decision?

467
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,959
I hate to admit it, but his
cunning surpasses my own.

468
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:21,041
He's seen through our plans,
so we can't win anymore.

469
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,125
More importantly, why the hell
did he outright reject

470
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,291
my offer to become
a vassal state?

471
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,291
He shouldn't have any
reason to refuse me.

472
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,834
It must have been something that
went against his original plans.

473
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:35,583
Perhaps he's plotting to conduct
a terrible experiment on us!

474
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,041
Or perhaps, it has to
do with the adventurers

475
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,333
that he tried to recruit!

476
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,083
Maybe he's not
a plotting kinda guy?

477
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,959
There is no chance in hell!

478
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,125
But don't worry.

479
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,333
There are many types
of vassal states.

480
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:48,750
I'll do everything
I can to retain

481
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,750
some level of sovereignty.

482
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:53,834
Your Highness, aren't you
concerned about your own safety?

483
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,417
Well, of course.

484
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,000
But as grim as it sounds, the
best I can do is convince him

485
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,125
that I'm worth more
alive than dead.

486
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,667
I hope that's enough to save me.

487
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,291
I might be the unluckiest man
in the world right now.

488
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,875
Can you believe it?
