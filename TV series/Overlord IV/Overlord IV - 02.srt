1
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,291
[AINS]
How shall I forge this kingdom?

2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,875
[MOMONGA]
What did Ulbert used to say?

3
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,959
Something about an
iron-fisted dictatorship

4
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,083
being the way to go?

5
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,583
That certainly is
the kind of leadership

6
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:27,542
Albedo and Demiurge favor,
and if nothing else,

7
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,959
they're very good at their jobs.

8
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,834
I don't share their passion
for world domination,

9
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:36,125
but I don't reject
the idea, either.

10
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,875
I've let them do as they wished.

11
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,250
[FITH whimpers]

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,500
[MOMONGA] But now
I want something more,

13
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,667
something for myself.

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,542
I want this kingdom to be
a haven for all races,

15
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,208
where all of them
are treated equally.

16
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,959
Then, even if I can't
see my friends again,

17
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,792
I can at least relive our
glory days, or that's the idea.

18
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,166
--[AINS sighs]
--[FITH yelps]

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,625
[MOMONGA] But if I tell Albedo
and the others my feelings,

20
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,667
it might upset
their current plans.

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,625
They might not even agree.

22
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:07,667
Maybe I should do things
on my own for now.

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,542
[FITH]
Please forgive me, My Lord!

24
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,625
[AINS]
Hm?

25
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:11,959
[FITH]
To think that you would let out

26
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,166
such a deep sigh on my watch!

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,542
I don't know how
I've failed you,

28
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,417
but such a crime can only
be punishable by death!

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,959
[AINS]
What? No! Why?

30
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,750
[RENNER] And so, the brave
knight defeated the dragon

31
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,333
and saved the princess from
its villainous clutches.

32
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,333
Then,

33
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:01,583
they lived happily ever after.

34
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,750
[GIRL 402A]
Oh, yay!

35
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,083
[GIRL 402B]
She deserved a happy ending!

36
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,917
--[BOY 402A] That was fun!
--[RENNER] Yes, I agree.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,291
[EVILEYE]
Hey, the brat's here for you.

38
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,625
I tried to wait till
the story was done.

39
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,458
It's time to return
to the royal palace.

40
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,834
You gotta go
already, Princess?

41
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:16,959
Don't worry, I'll be back soon

42
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,208
and we'll cook
something delicious!

43
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,792
[CHILDREN chattering]

44
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,291
[EVILEYE]
That was quite an impressive

45
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,250
orphanage you
started. Expensive?

46
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,542
My brother understood the
necessity and payed for it

47
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,583
as soon as I asked.

48
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,667
The Sorcerer King
caused many deaths

49
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,125
and that means many children
were left without parents.

50
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,834
[EVILEYE] I'm afraid I don't see
the value in this investment.

51
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:46,041
The weak are destined to perish.

52
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,667
Then what good is my power?

53
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,041
It is the duty of the strong
to protect the weak.

54
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,375
We can't leave them to die!

55
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:56,417
This isn't a burden at all--
those children are my treasures.

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,792
Uh--

57
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,500
I will ensure that
they don't wander

58
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,083
from the path of righteousness.

59
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,458
The future of the
kingdom is at stake.

60
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,458
That's quite the
wise perspective.

61
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:09,709
[EVILEYE] Not everyone can
be strong, like Rigrit said.

62
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,000
He told me the same thing.

63
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,625
Guess it must be
his catchphrase.

64
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,125
[EVILEYE]
Maybe.

65
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,375
Anyway, children without parents
do have a higher tendency

66
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,834
to get involved in crime.

67
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,917
We need to nurture
the children's talents,

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
so they become an
asset to the kingdom.

69
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,000
Then other nobles will
start to copy the idea.

70
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,375
[EVILEYE]
That's pretty clever.

71
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,333
No one does charity without
expecting something in return.

72
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,834
[TINA] You only think that
'cause your heart is twisted.

73
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,208
[EVILEYE] Oh, come on,
like you're any different!

74
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,875
My heart is pure.

75
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,041
You're the only
tainted one here.

76
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,417
[EVILEYE sighs]

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,166
To be honest, the orphanage
idea came from Brain.

78
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,125
He wants to find children that
have a talent for swordsmanship,

79
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,625
but I'm looking for more.

80
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,834
You were there.
Maybe you can help!

81
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:51,417
Did you sense anything?

82
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,291
Did any of the orphans you saw
seem to have a hidden talent?

83
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,375
I don't know,
I was standing outside.

84
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,834
Did you catch anything?

85
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,834
[EVILEYE] I can't tell if
a kid has magical potential

86
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:02,041
just by looking at them.

87
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,625
That's a pity.

88
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:06,500
Do the two of you have hidden
talents? Just out of curiosity.

89
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,750
It's a secret.

90
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:08,917
[EVILEYE] I don't even
know how to answer that.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,375
Why do you care?

92
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:14,041
Perhaps because most people
I know are so untalented.

93
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,375
[EVILEYE]
Not all of them.

94
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,250
You do have a talent!

95
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,291
Tell me!

96
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,917
Have you known since
you were young?

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,917
I know you think it's silly,
but please indulge me!

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,959
[EVILEYE sighs] I like
to keep this a secret, okay?

99
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,792
So, I'll whisper it to you.

100
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,041
Thank you!

101
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,417
[EVILEYE] A talent is an
adventurer's trump card.

102
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
Of course.

103
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,709
[EVILEYE] So, you really think
I'm gonna tell you just for fun?

104
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:38,917
[CLIMB yelps]

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,917
That was terribly cruel!
My ears are ringing!

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,542
[CLIMB]
Poor princess!

107
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,166
Lady Evileye, please
show her some mercy.

108
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,417
[EVILEYE]
Don't blame me!

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,250
She's like that because
you coddle her so much!

110
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,083
Ah--! I do no such thing!

111
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,542
[RENNER]
I agree!

112
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,125
But if you're going
to get accused of it,

113
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,041
you might as well
coddle me more!

114
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,417
It's good you brought up
this issue, Evil Eye.

115
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,792
[EVILEYE]
You really twisted that around.

116
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,125
I have some suggestions
to get us started.

117
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,125
For example, we can
take naps together

118
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,333
like when we were children!

119
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,667
[CLIMB]
Princess, no.

120
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,875
[EVILEYE sighs]
Fine, we can talk about talents!

121
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,125
I keep mine a secret, but let's
just say it's really dangerous.

122
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,625
Strong enough to level
an entire city,

123
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,000
like if Lakyus's sword
went on a rampage.

124
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,458
It's a last resort.

125
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:22,583
Her sword is that
strong? Really?

126
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,875
[EVILEYE]
According to her, at least.

127
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,583
She says she has to
channel her own power

128
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,667
just to keep it
at bay sometimes.

129
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,125
Our boss keeps that to herself

130
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,792
'cause she doesn't
want to worry you.

131
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,792
So, pretend you
never heard this.

132
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:36,750
--Of course, you have my word.
--[CLIMB] Um, Princess Renner?

133
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,000
[RENNER]
Oh my! How careless!

134
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,834
[CLIMB] Speaking of which,
where's Lady Aindra right now?

135
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,709
I haven't seen her in a while.

136
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,291
She's helping train
Gagaran and Tia.

137
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,500
[EVILEYE] They were revived
after Jaldabaoth killed them,

138
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,000
but they lost a lot of
life force in the process.

139
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,542
They're engaging
in intensive training

140
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,625
to strengthen themselves.

141
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,959
They have to get back
to their former power.

142
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,667
If that demon attacked now,

143
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,917
we wouldn't be able
to buy enough time.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,500
Buy time for what?

145
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,166
Oh, you're thinking your hero
will come to the rescue, huh?

146
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,250
[EVILEYE]
That's right!

147
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,625
Lord Momon will
save the day for sure!

148
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,083
Haven't you heard?

149
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,917
He's so strong, he can swing
a giant sword like a twig!

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,959
He's the best warrior
on the continent,

151
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,500
maybe in the whole world!

152
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,208
We wouldn't have to worry about
Jaldabaoth with him around,

153
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,542
or the Sorcerer King!

154
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,834
He can beat anyone!

155
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,000
Uh--

156
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,417
You just remembered, huh?

157
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,709
He can't beat the Sorcerer King
'cause he works for him.

158
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,250
[EVILEYE]
Why, Lord Momon?

159
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,000
What are you thinking?

160
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,792
You reminded me.
I have a question.

161
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,291
One-on-one.

162
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,083
How well do you think you'd do
against the Sorcerer King?

163
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,667
[EVILEYE] Not well at all, if
the rumors about him are true.

164
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,750
I would be dead in an instant.

165
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,166
I'm pretty sure Lord Momon
is the only person

166
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,417
who might be able
to stand up to him.

167
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,625
So, the Sorcerer King
recruited the only man

168
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,041
capable of fighting against him.

169
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,750
Now we have two
invincible enemies.

170
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,542
[MILITARY AFFAIRS]
The adventurers are continuing

171
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,542
their search for Prince Barbro,
but they haven't found

172
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,792
so much as a hint
of his whereabouts.

173
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,792
It's been quite some time.

174
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,208
There's little hope
that he's still alive.

175
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,333
Keep searching for him
all the same.

176
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,917
It shall be done, Prince.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,458
Really now, Brother, must you
be a nuisance to the very end?

178
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:24,709
There's one more thing.

179
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:25,875
Go ahead.

180
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,583
[MILITARY AFFAIRS]
How is Marquis Raeven?

181
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,667
I haven't heard a
single word from him.

182
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,583
He's retreated to his private
territory and shut himself in.

183
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,041
His encounter with
those monsters

184
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,250
must've given him
quite the fright.

185
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,208
[knocking]

186
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,875
What is it?

187
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,792
[MAID 402A]
Princess Renner has returned.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,125
[ZANAC] I was hoping that I
could rely on Marquis Raeven's

189
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,333
expert guidance, but I fear
he may never return.

190
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,125
Well, that's a problem
for another day.

191
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,625
Right now, as next
in line for the throne,

192
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:59,583
I need to decide how to deal
with the Sorcerer Kingdom.

193
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,959
[gasps]

194
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,458
[ZANAC]
I should send them a tribute,

195
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,208
if only to keep them at bay.

196
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,750
My concern is that our nobles

197
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,417
and the neighboring
countries may see it

198
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,250
as a sign of submission.

199
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,875
They're just looking
for someone to blame.

200
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,417
Thank you for coming
out to meet me.

201
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
I hope you're well.

202
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,625
All things considered, I'm fine.

203
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,125
Shall we take a little walk?

204
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,583
I'd be delighted.

205
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:32,625
A representative of the Sorcerer
Kingdom will arrive soon.

206
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,750
If you were planning
to offer them a tribute,

207
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,417
now is your chance.

208
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,333
I would double the
amount, and give it

209
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,834
to their representative
in honor of their visit.

210
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,500
Even the nobles would struggle
to find fault in that.

211
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,000
[SOLDIER 402A]
My prince, we have been notified

212
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:55,208
that a delegation from the
Sorcerer Kingdom has arrived.

213
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,375
Then I shall greet them.

214
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,625
[SOLDIER 402A]
Understood.

215
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,542
If I become king,
I'll give you domain

216
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,417
in some remote area,
far away from all of this.

217
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,583
You can live out
your days in peace.

218
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,333
That's very kind of you.
I'm grateful.

219
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:16,417
Though frankly, it's not a
very appealing suggestion,

220
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,834
and it's far too late
for that now.

221
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,166
[BRAIN]
Six Fold Flash of Light!

222
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,875
Impressive work.

223
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,041
[VESTURE]
You've changed. I can tell.

224
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,291
You think so?

225
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,125
[VESTURE] You had such
a sour look on your face

226
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,750
when you lost in
the last tournament.

227
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,542
[BRAIN] I thought I could stand
amongst the strong back then.

228
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,834
You might say I learned
a valuable lesson.

229
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:00,834
One must "seek life
when facing death."

230
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,750
You cannot defeat a monster
without betting it all.

231
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:07,083
You must offer your life for
even a small chance of victory.

232
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,959
My measly life
would be a bargain

233
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,917
for a victory against him.

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,208
[VESTURE] Is the Sorcerer King
truly that powerful?

235
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,417
He is. For one, he defeated
your prize student

236
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,208
Gazef in the blink of an eye.

237
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,083
I wouldn't call him my student.

238
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,208
I just showed him
a trick or two.

239
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,542
A "trick," huh?

240
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,250
Funny you say that,
since I heard you taught him

241
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,208
your strongest Martial Art.

242
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,917
Vesture Kloff Di Laufen's
famous technique.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,041
The legacy of an
adamantite adventurer.

244
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,083
And while we're
talking about legacy.

245
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,166
I'm looking for someone to
take up Gazef's former job,

246
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,500
but for a commoner with
no connections, it's not easy.

247
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,208
You could be chief
warrior yourself.

248
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,333
[BRAIN]
I'm not fit for it.

249
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,375
That's why I'm looking
to the next generation.

250
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,917
There are some kids
with good potential,

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,417
but I'll have to wait a while
for them to grow up.

252
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,333
It seems that you're quite
committed to this endeavor.

253
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:59,417
This land needs strong warriors,
and the more the better.

254
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,959
Our enemy is the
Sorcerer King, after all.

255
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,500
[ZANAC] I assume this weather
is the work of their magic.

256
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,875
Here they come.

257
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,583
[gasps]

[DEATH CAVALIER] Apologies for
speaking to you from my mount!

We are the delegation

[DEATH CAVALIER]
Very well.

265
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,834
Pardon the lack of introduction.

266
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:52,125
We have no individual names.

267
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:56,333
You may address me by
my race: "Death Cavalier."

268
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:58,625
As you wish, then, Sir Cavalier.

269
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,500
But before we proceed,
might I be allowed

270
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,458
to greet the leader of
your honored delegation?

271
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:06,750
[DEATH CAVALIER]
I shall fetch them.

272
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,375
Brace yourselves, everyone.

273
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,291
And don't do anything
that could offend them.

[SOLDIERS]

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,458
[DEATH CAVALIER]
Pardon the wait.

276
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,792
Allow me to introduce the
leader of our delegation.

277
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:23,542
She is the closest aide to the
Sorcerer King, Ains Ooal Gown.

278
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,291
Lady Albedo.

279
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,709
[PHILIP] Look at you,
with your fancy clothes.

280
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:42,250
You probably think
I'm not worth a damn.

281
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,542
I have my father
to thank for that.

282
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,500
He's a failure as a noble.

283
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,750
But that's all right.
Once I'm in charge,

284
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,709
I'll turn this family around.

285
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,875
I'll show all these
bumbling lords and ladies

286
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,291
what a real noble looks like.

287
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,333
[OFFICER 402A] Everyone,
your attention, please!

288
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,375
I would like to introduce

289
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,750

She's gorgeous.

292
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,750
[PHILIP]
This is it.

293
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:26,667
I can't let this
chance go to waste.

294
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,750
[PHILIP chuckles]
I'm so lucky!

295
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,875
No, it's more than that.

296
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,166
I'm a genius!

297
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,458
I'll show you how it's done.

298
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,000
If you wanna make
a change in this world,

299
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,291
you've got to bet it all!

300
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,875
Lady Albedo.

301
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,333
[PHILIP] My name's Philip
Dayton L'Eyre Montserrat.

302
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:51,542
I am the sole heir of
the Montserrat Barony.

303
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,583
Call me Philip.

304
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,417
It's such an honor to meet you.

305
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,542
[PHILIP'S FATHER] What are
you thinking, you fool?

306
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,500
Do you know how many
strings I had to pull

307
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,667
just to get you
invited to that party?

308
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,291
This was a chance to have
you recognized as my heir!

309
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,000
You need to be strengthening
your relationship

310
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,125
with the other nobles,
not inviting some monster

311
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,375
from the Sorcerer
Kingdom to a ball!

312
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,291
Where are you going to hold it?
Certainly not here!

313
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,917
But it's too late
to back out now.

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,583
Calm down, Father. This'll
be an excellent opportunity,

315
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,917
just trust me.

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
You realize our
situation, right?

317
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,125
Where's our domain located?

318
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,583
We're between the capital
and the Sorcerer Kingdom!

319
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,041
So that means we
need to strengthen

320
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,333
our relationship with them.

321
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:28,750
That would be treason!

322
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,542
Why would you join forces
with the Sorcerer Kingdom

323
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,333
when they killed
your own brother?

324
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,166
If you put it that way,
they did me a favor,

325
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,917
seeing as I'm the sole heir
to the domain now.

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,125
How could you say that?

327
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,291
You've gone mad!

328
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,834
This is all for our sake!

329
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,875
To protect our domain
and its people!

330
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,875
What happens when the Sorcerer
Kingdom decides to invade?

331
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,208
It's better to be on
the winner's side, I say!

332
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,834
[PHILIP'S FATHER]
And leave the others to die?

333
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,041
I was the first to
approach the envoy.

334
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,375
What happens to everyone
else is their problem.

335
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,375
[PHILIP'S FATHER] Won't that
antagonize our neighbors?

336
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,208
What if they turn on us?

337
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,166
Even if they're angry, it's not
like they would attack us.

338
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,542
Their men died
in the war too, y'know.

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,291
As you said, many died.
Production will suffer for it.

340
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,125
The domains have to
work together closely

341
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,166
to share their resources. But
we only have a single village,

342
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,417
with little to offer them.

343
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,750
We still need their support!

344
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,500
If that's the case,
the Sorcerer Kingdom

345
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,250
can provide so much more!

346
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,166
We're a village
in an enemy nation.

347
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,000
Would you aid us if you
were the Sorcerer Kingdom?

348
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,959
It shows character, of course!

349
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,959
Their new king needs
to improve his public image

350
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,417
and that would be
an easy way, right?

351
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,333
[PHILIP'S FATHER]
That's the only reason?

352
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,959
Well, it's enough reason for me!

353
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,667
Try to be more
open-minded, father.

354
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,208
As long as we use
our brains a bit,

355
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,667
the Sorcerer King is
nothing to be afraid of.

356
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,083
He's just another tool
to help forge my future--

357
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,667
or, the future of
our family, I mean.

358
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,792
If that's how you feel, I have
nothing left to say to you.

359
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,917
Actually, sir, there's
one more problem.

360
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,667
We never settled the
issue with the ball.

361
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,500
Ah, yes, as I was going to say,

362
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,667
we have no venue suitable
for such an esteemed guest.

363
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,333
That's already settled.

364
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:04,709
There's a lady
I met in the capital

365
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,166
with a house
she'll let me borrow.

366
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,166
And how much is this
going to cost us?

367
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,041
[PHILIP]
It's free.

368
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,542
And it isn't a scam?

369
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,458
Don't worry, it's fine.
She said she saw my potential

370
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,709
and wanted to invest
in me. It's that easy.

371
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:20,083
Which house is this lady from?
Surely, I would know her.

372
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,375
She's just a commoner,
judging from her name.

373
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,333
But she's a very
wealthy commoner.

374
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:29,375
Hilma Cygnaeus.
Does that name ring a bell?

375
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,750
[NOBLES chattering, laughing]

376
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,458
I'm the host tonight, not you.

377

[NOBLE 402B]
Thank you for the invitation!

378
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,583
I'm delighted!

379
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,083
[NOBLE 402C]
Lady Hilma!

380
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,083
Why are all the guests
greeting her instead of me?

381
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,959
You seem displeased,
Lord Philip, what is the matter?

382
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,417
Nothing, I was deep
in thought, that's all.

383
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,083
Remember, I'm your
willing partner.

384
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,500
One that wants to share in
the taste of your sweet success.

385
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,917
There's no benefit in hiding
the truth from me.

386
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,333
As you asked, I left
the invitations to you,

387
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,166
but I feel like many of our
guests are unqualified.

388
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,834
[HILMA] There aren't
many influential figures

389
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,667
in the traditional sense, no.

390
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,625
I mostly chose to
invite heirs who were

391
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,000
newly appointed after
the war, like you.

392
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,750
Will I be able to create a new
faction with these people?

393
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,959
They're mostly powerless.

394
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,667
But that's the whole point!

395
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,500
Because they'll grow in power
under your expert leadership.

396
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,542
Yes, a fine point.

397
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,917
[PHILIP]
This is good.

398
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,625
All I have to do
is show the way,

399
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:38,250
and those fools will
fall in line soon enough.

400
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,125
[PHILIP] She's truly the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen,

401
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,542
and she smells lovely, too!

402
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,667
Tonight, I have gathered
nobles who wish to become

403
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,625
closer with the
Sorcerer Kingdom.

greatly looking forward

to meeting you, Lady Albedo!

Thank you for all your
support, Lord Philip.

do you happen to be
married, Lady Albedo?

What an interesting
question to ask.

412
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:12,208
Unfortunately, I'm single.
And a bit lonely, I must say.

Let's proceed! They're waiting!

in a first-class venue,

look at the stupid grins
on their faces.

422

They have no clue
this is a feeding ground.

423
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,250
Hilma, seems Lady Albedo
would like to rest a bit.

424
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,375
The whole ball's
lined up to talk to her.

425

Anyone would be
exhausted after all that.

You can get back to mingling.

427

I'll escort her to the
sitting room for you.

428
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,542
Actually, I'll come along, too.

429
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,834
I don't think that
would be a good idea.

430
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:02,875
And why not?

431

I'm the host of
the ball, aren't I?

432
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,458
It's not proper for a man
to accompany a lady

to the sitting room
unless he's her husband.

434

Oh, right. That makes sense.

Speaking of which.

If I were to court Lady Albedo,

how do you think I should
I go about that?

[gasps]

439
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,625
I managed to bring all of
these nobles together, didn't I?

440
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,667
And while the Sorcerer Kingdom
has a strong army,

441
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,583
they only possess a single city.

442
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,208
So, my social status
is comparable to hers.

delivered immediately.

467
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,834
[SMUGGLING LEADER 402A]
Understood.

468
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,667
We will assemble
a proper tribute.

469
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,417
[ALBEDO]
No. That's not what I meant.

470
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Sell the items for
a reasonable price,

471
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,667
and with the money you make,

472
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,166
prepare countermeasures
for the kingdom's

473
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,166
inevitable food shortage.

474
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,542
Now, how is your magic
item research going?

475
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,417
[ALBEDO]
You may raise your head.

476
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,583
[RENNER]
Thank you.

477
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:45,792
Oh, my.

478
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,458
Lord Ains is quite
satisfied with your work.

479
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:54,166
He's prepared a fitting
reward I think you'll enjoy.

480
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,083
I'm so happy.

481
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,709
Thank you, Lady Albedo.

482
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,959
And please give my
regards to His Majesty.

483
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,291
I owe Lord Ains
my deepest gratitude.

484
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,000
What lovely manners!

485
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,000
I assume we don't need to
discuss your other request?

486
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,917
You understand the conditions?

487
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,417
Oh, yes, I do.

488
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,291
Nothing in the world
would make me happier

489
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,417
than to receive such
a kindness from you.

490
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,792
After the proper price
is paid, of course.

491
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:20,166
That box will grant your wish,
but will you be able to open it?

492
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,792
Yes. I've already
begun preparations.

493
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,250
I see.

494
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,458
Just make sure everything's
ready before the invasion.

495
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sure you're capable.

496
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:33,583
[RENNER]
Understood, Your Greatness.

497
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,542
I think that's enough
formal discussion for now.

498
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,041
The night's young.

499
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,583
While I'm here, why don't you
tell me a little bit more

500
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:40,959
about your puppy?

501
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,917
I'd love to, Lady Albedo.

502
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,041
And could you tell me
more about Lord Ains?

503
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,083
I'm sure you have all sorts
of charming stories

504
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,875
about His Majesty to share!
