1
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,860
May I please speak
with Lord Ains?

2
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,400
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's out at the moment.

3
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,410
Well now, that just won't do.

4
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,780
I wanted to get authorization
to enter the final stages

5
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,740
of our project
concerning the Theocracy.

6
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,750
Suppose I'll have
to keep myself busy.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll be on the seventh level

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,130
prepping other work
until his return.

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,880
If you're truly in a hurry,
you can always

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,170
send a message to the Lord.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,090
I thought you were
a loyal servant.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,720
Doesn't that include conveying
important messages promptly?

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,970
[DEMIURGE] It's really not
that urgent, forget it.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,930
Now I'm curious.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,100
I would like him to praise me
for the work I've done is all.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,060
It's rather trivial
to contact him for this.

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,440
So where has Lord Ains
gone off to?

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,070
To the Dwarven Kingdom.

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,570
[DEMIURGE]
That's surprising.

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,030
What business could
he possibly have

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,160
in a remote place like that?

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
You know as well as I
that one cannot fathom

23
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,790
the thoughts of a supreme
being such as him.

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,830
It's true: every decision
he makes is weaved

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,500
into a tapestry of schemes.

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,920
I may never see
the entire picture.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,380
Even so. We are
his loyal servants.

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,840
We must strive to understand
as best we can,

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,670
so we're ready
to meet his needs.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,880
Not to change the subject,

31
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,890
but he brings you up sometimes,

32
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,470
not in a positive
context, though.

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,600
[ALBEDO]
He says things like,

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,100
"Have you heard from
Demiurge lately?"

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,100
And he seems to be
hinting that your plans

36
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,770
don't sit right with him.

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,320
Why am I only hearing this now?

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,150
There's one thing I'd like
for you to confirm first.

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,530
Was there a method discussed

40
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,490
to make the Empire a vassal
state of the Kingdom?

41
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,910
[DEMIURGE] It was considered,
but that would have required

42
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,450
Lord Ains' personal involvement,

43
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,790
which I could not ask
for as a servant.

44
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,500
Not to mention, that plan
itself would have taken

45
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,920
over a month's time.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,580
Take a look.

47
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,300
[DEMIURGE]
It can't be!

48
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,220
The Empire has officially
requested to become

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,550
a vassal state of
the Sorcerer Kingdom.

50
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,090
[DEMIURGE]
But how?

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,470
[ALBEDO] I was in the
kingdom at the time,

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,930
so I don't know the details.

53
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,520
This all came about
after Lord Ains

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,640
visited the Empire
of his own accord.

55
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,730
Seems it only took three days.

56
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,230
Don't you have
something to say?

57
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,110
Pull it together.
We have work to do.

58
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,400
Lord Ains has ordered us
to handle the specifics

59
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,990
of the Empire's request.

60
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,870
Are you sure? You said
he had doubts about me.

61
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,290
Perhaps, but this shows
that he still trusts you.

62
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,450
[gasps]

63
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,830
[ALBEDO] I believe
he made the first move,

64
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,750
because he thought that
you were being too reserved.

65
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,500
He was likely
setting an example.

66
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,380
He's dropping a hint that
you shouldn't hold back

67
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,380
in future endeavors.
Read between the lines.

68
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,220
So it's my methods, not me.

69
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,630
In order to meet
his expectations,

70
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,640
I'll further improve
my performance.

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,260
[ALBEDO]
Yes, don't disappoint him.

72
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,310
He must have gone in person
to the Dwarven Kingdom

73
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,310
because his plan
is deeply intricate.

74
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,980
He'll be quite busy.

75
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,060
[AINS chuckles]

76
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,200
[COCYTUS] Do you plan to travel
to the Dwarven Kingdom

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,030
yourself, Lord Ains?

78
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,540
[AINS]
Yes.

79
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,330
[COCYTUS] I'll prepare our
troops for immediate departure.

80
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,500
[AINS]
No need.

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,960
I would like to take
a friendly approach

82
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,960
before resorting to bloodshed.

83
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,000
Above all else, I hope to
acquire dwarven rune technology,

84
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,760
including their knowledge
of ores and weapon forging.

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,550
Let's strive to establish
a diplomatic relationship.

86
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,010
[COCYTUS]
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,060
[AINS] I'll have Aura accompany
me as my main bodyguard,

88
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,600
with Shalltear and her
brood as our support.

89
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,940
I stopped by this village
to speak with a Lizard Man

90
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,520
who spent some time
in the Dwarven Kingdom.

91
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,150
Is he present?

92
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,190
[COCYTUS] I've brough him
at your request, My Lord.

93
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,610
His name is Zenberu.

94
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,860
Hello.

95
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,700
[AINS] I'm determined
to visit the dwarves.

96
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,740
Can you guide us to their home?

97
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,120
Your Majesty.

98
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,330
What's the purpose of
your visit, if I might ask?

99
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,290
Is it friendly?

100
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,370
[COCYTUS]
You dare question his motives?

101
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,580
That's awfully rude!

102
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,000
[AINS]
It's fine, Cocytus.

103
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,130
Zenberu hasn't done anything
to offend me yet.

104
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,380
[COCYTUS]
Right.

105
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,180
[AINS] Now, I truly mean
what I'm about to say.

106
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,680
I have no intention
of harming the Dwarves.

107
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,720
However, it goes without saying
that conflict could arise

108
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,230
depending on how they
react to my presence.

109
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,230
I 'spose that's
all right, then.

110
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,690
I've got a history with 'em.

111
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,650
In fact, they've
helped me out a lot.

112
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,980
I don't want to return their
kindness with malice.

113
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,400
[AINS] Understandable.
You have my word.

114
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,490
Will you take us to them?

115
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,320
Sure thing!

116
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,320
[COCYTUS growls]

117
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,780
[AINS]
Cocytus!

118
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,450
I wish to learn
as much as possible

119
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,910
about the dwarven culture
before we arrive.

120
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,000
I'd like to know everything
from the mundane,

121
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,170
to their way of life,
to what gifts they fancy.

122
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,130
[COCYTUS]
Lord Ains.

123
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,000
I'd be happy to share,
but before we get into that,

124
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,710
would you like
to take a seat first?

125
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,220
[AINS]
Sure.

126
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,550
[COCYTUS yells]

127
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,800
[AINS]
What is the meaning of this?

128
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,260
[COCYTUS] Shalltear did this
for you once, yes?

129
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,930
I would like to offer
the same courtesy.

130
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,060
[AINS]
That was punishment.

131
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,350
No need for you to do it.

132
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,690
[COCYTUS] But the
Lizard Man I brought to you

133
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,110
was awfully rude, sir!
It's the least I can do.

134
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,940
[AINS] I told you that
it didn't bother me.

135
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,490
[COCYTUS]
I insist!

136
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,950
[AINS]
Fine! Have it your way!

137
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,070
[MOMONGA]
This is awkward.

138
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,580
[COCYTUS]
Tell me honestly, Lord Ains!

139
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,910
How am I?

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
[AINS]
Hm. You're rather comfortable.

141
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,210
[COCYTUS] So, between
Shalltear and myself,

142
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,960
which one of us do you
find more ergonomic?

143
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,340
[AINS]
Wh-Why do you need to know

144
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,590
something like that, exactly?

145
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,340
[COCYTUS] Well, I wanted
an honest opinion.

146
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,260
I worry I may require
training for those

147
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,760
who will mount me in the future!

148
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,760
[AINS]
Huh?

149
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,770
[MOMONGA]
Takemikazuchi, why?

150
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,270
[AURA] Looks like everything
on the list is accounted for.

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,320
And now with that,
we're ready to go!

152
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,730
Relax.

153
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,030
We haven't even left and
you're getting way too excited.

154
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,530
You better not be thinking
about meddling with me!

155
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,410
I have huge plans underway!

156
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,870
Now's my chance to make up for
my mistake and show everyone

157
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,160
that, I, Shalltear Bloodfallen
am worth having around!

158
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,920
Have I made that clear?

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,630
I can't afford to
mess anything up!

160
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,500
Lately, I've only been
tasked with grunt work,

161
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,840
like managing
teleportation gates!

162
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,880
I bet that Demiurge
and Albedo think of me

163
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,550
as a mere incompetent child!

164
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,220
I'm certain that
Lord Ains does, as well!

165
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,510
[SHALLTEAR sobs]

166
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,640
[AINS] Aura, I'd like
for you to accompany me

167
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,640
to the Dwarven Kingdom
and provide security.

168
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,360
[AURA]
I'm honored, sir!

169
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,690
[AINS] Shalltear will be joining
us on our journey, also.

170
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,240
You think we need her?

171
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,820
Oh, wait.

172
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,030
We must be going on a mission
to destroy the Dwarven Kingdom.

173
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,410
[AINS]
Certainly not!

174
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,120
Although I am inviting
her for her strength,

175
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,410
the intention isn't to leverage
that against the dwarfs.

176
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,910
[AURA]
Huh?

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,670
[AINS] Shalltear is one of our
strongest floor guardians

178
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,080
created in Nazarick.

179
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,460
However, being labeled
as such can be detrimental

180
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,250
to one's growth,
if not challenged.

181
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,380
She has even greater potential.

182
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,970
I would like for her
to continue to grow.

183
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,720
This is a fine opportunity
to push those limits,

184
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,510
as she will have plenty of
allies around to support her.

185
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,230
Lord Ains has never felt
that way about you.

186
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,940
He told me he wanted
you to come so you could

187
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,480
gain more experience
and broaden your horizons.

188
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,730
Did he really tell you that?

189
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,440
Said you're real strong, too!

190
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,240
But he also brought you
on this mission with him

191
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,820
to look out for you.

192
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,740
Learn what you can from him
while you have the chance!

193
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,490
That's a good point.
Maybe I should.

194
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,200
Although, I'm not sure
how to do that exactly.

195
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,040
[AURA]
Oh, Shalltear.

196
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,410
[MOMONGA] They really
are the spitting image

197
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,290
of Bukubuku Chagama
and Peroroncino.

198
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,500
They're always bickering,
but they're still good friends.

199
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,220
Preparations are complete,
Your Majesty.

200
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,470
[AINS]
Good.

201
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,800
[MOMONGA] Don't look at me like
I'm gonna steal your baby.

202
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,640
I mean, it is pretty special.

203
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,890
Maybe if you had
a few to spare, sure.

204
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,770
I'm all ready to go, Lord Ains!

205
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,560
Everything's in ship shape!

206
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,900
[AINS]
Splendid!

207
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,320
Then, it's time
for our departure!

208
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,640
[ZENBERU] We covered so much
ground in just one day!

209
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,060
Not bad!

210
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,850
[AINS]
Let us rest here for the night.

211
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,770
Huh?

212
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,940
[AINS]
This area should do nicely.

213
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,940
Create Fortress!

214
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,290
[AINS] Everyone, please
make yourselves at home.

215
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,000
Find your assigned rooms,
and settle in for the evening.

216
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,180
[AINS] An unknown land,
an unknown technology.

217
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,430
[MOMONGA]
Some places in this world

218
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,390
seem to have knowledge
from Yggdrasil.

219
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,180
I wonder how the Dwarves
learned about runes?

220
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,350
Could it have been
a player who taught them?

221
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,270
It's risky for a person
of my stature to enter

222
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,520
a place like this,
but I want to create

223
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,070
a friendly relationship.

224
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,400
Coming personally
shows my sincerity.

225
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,160
Best of all, Demiurge and
Albedo can figure out

226
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,450
that whole mess with the
Empire while I'm far, far away.

227
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,750
What was Jircniv
thinking anyway?

228
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,370
I hardly said a word to him

229
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,960
and he wants to be our
vassal all of a sudden?

230
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,090
Wait, did Demiurge pull some
strings behind the scenes?

231
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,590
[AINS]
No matter.

232
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm sure things will turn out
just fine in their hands.

233
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,840
[AURA]
So, which room you want?

234
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,050
The one to the left?
Or to the right?

235
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,100
[SHALLTEAR]
They're the same to me.

236
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,850
You're my superior anyway,

237
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,060
so if you have a
preference, then take it.

238
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,560
I thought I'd ask at least.
What are you doing exactly?

239
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,190
Just writing down some notes.

240
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,940
I'm taking this seriously
and don't want to forget

241
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,650
a single thing Lord Ains says.

242
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,240
[AURA]
Whoa, impressive! Lemme see!

243
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,200
[SHALLTEAR] I've documented
every statement, motion,

244
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,830
and decision he's made
down to the last detail!

245
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,950
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

246
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,000
Keeping track of wise
words is one thing,

247
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,830
but that's not what
you're doing here.

248
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,710
Like, most of this stuff
isn't even relevant.

249
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,960
Huh?

250
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,750
Only jot down
the important parts.

251
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,670
Or things that apply
to you, at least.

252
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,470
Advice you can use when
you need to make a tough call.

253
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,600
Can you do that with the
mess of notes you've taken?

254
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,100
Well, I would most
certainly hope so.

255
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,100
[sighs] I'll take
your word for it.

256
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,440
You should go to your room
and study your notes.

257
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,940
Imagine what Lord Ains
was thinking

258
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,820
while he said those things.

259
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,990
Then consider what you would do
if you were in his situation.

260
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,740
So re-read the notes, you say?

261
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,990
I spelled it out, didn't I?

262
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,660
Honestly. She's
always like this.

263
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,370
It feels like I'm caring
for a helpless little sister.

264
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,330
I'm at my wit's end with her.

265
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Well, now I know how
Lady Bukubuku Chagama felt.

266
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,460
Lord Peroroncino was
her little brother,

267
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,670
and he could
certainly be a pain.

268
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,680
[ZENBERU]
Here we go! This should be it!

269
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,730
The crack here is the entrance.

270
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,600
Wonder why I don't see any
guards on duty, though.

271
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,980
[AINS]
Hanzo.

272
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,610
[HANZO LEADER]
Present, sir.

273
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,360
[AINS] Sneak inside and
see what's going on.

274
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,400
[HANZO]
Sir!

275
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,540
[HANZO LEADER]
Lord Ains.

276
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,580
We found no evidence
of life in the city.

277
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,840
However, we did confirm
the sounds of mining

278
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,050
echoing deep within the tunnels.

279
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,550
[AINS]
Hm.

280
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:28,520
[thudding]

281
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,770
[AURA]
Hey there! Whatcha doin', pal?

282
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,020
[screams]

283
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,610
Invisibility, huh?

284
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,280
[GONDO]
A-Are you a dark elf?

285
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,610
What are you doing
in a place like this?

286
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,030
Answer me!

287
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,200
[AURA] Actually, I was looking
for the Dwarven Kingdom,

288
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,740
but there was no one in sight.

289
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,160
I was hoping someone could
tell me what happened.

290
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,620
[GONDO]
I-I see. Well, sorry.

291
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,290
Feo Raidho is empty now.

292
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,250
In fact, they left
three years ago.

293
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,540
It's just me.

294
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,630
Huh. Why don't
you show yourself?

295
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,960
I promise I'm not here
to cause you any trouble.

296
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,720
[gasps] Fair enough.

297
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,050
Seems like you can see through
the enchantment anyway.

298
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,140
Then let me start over.
Nice to meet you!

299
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,730
My name is Aura Bella Fiora

300
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,810
and I'm a representative
of the Sorcerer Kingdom.

301
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,310
Sorcerer what?

302
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,190
Sorry. I'm afraid
I haven't heard of it.

303
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,940
Oops! Where are my manners?

304
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,240
My name is Gondo Firebeard
of the Dwarven Kingdom.

305
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,820
It's nice to meetcha.

306
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,450
Pleasure's all mine.

307
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,410
[AURA]
So, Where did all the dwarves

308
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,750
who used to live here go?

309
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,880
Everybody moved to
a city called Feo Jera.

310
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,130
It's about six days
north from here.

311
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,510
Aren't you a little young
to be on your own?

312
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,380
Did you come here by yourself?

313
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,380
I'm with a party, but we
thought it would be rude

314
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,800
to barge in with
a lot of people,

315
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,560
so they're waiting
at the tunnel entrance.

316
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,890
Very well.

317
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,020
In that case, let me walk
you back to your party.

318
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,560
I need to give them
a piece of my mind

319
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,150
for sending you here alone.

320
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,730
Who throws a kid
into an uncharted cave?

321
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,940
[AINS]
A wise man, as it turns out.

322
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,150
Gondo, please allow me
to introduce myself.

323
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,200
[screams] Oh no!

324
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,740
It's a monster! Run!

325
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,080
[AINS]
Please, calm yourself.

326
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,080
[GONDO] You're an undead?
That's not offensive, right?

327
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,790
I'm just shocked you're ruling
over a kingdom of humans.

328
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
[AINS] All are welcome
in my Kingdom.

329
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,420
I've come here today
in hopes of creating

330
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,010
a friendly relationship
with the dwarves.

331
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,220
Don't worry, harming your people
is the last thing I want.

332
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,930
My interest lies with
your rune technology.

333
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,520
Really? What would
you like to know?

334
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,230
[AINS] Your culture's runes
caught my interest

335
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,360
because they look
a bit different

336
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,270
from the ones
I am familiar with.

337
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,650
What runes do you mean?
Can you show me?

338
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,030
[AINS]
Of course.

339
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,490
Like these.

340
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,780
Ah. That character's
called Lagu

341
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,160
and it's one of
the mid-tier runes.

342
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,160
That's good!

343
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,000
Do you know any
others by chance?

344
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,290
[AINS] Some, but what
I'm interested in

345
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,840
is magical weapons
inscribed with these.

346
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,300
Do you still produce them?

347
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,090
Until 100 years ago,
I heard such magic items

348
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,680
were common in the Empire.

349
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,390
What caused their disappearance?

350
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,850
It's simple, really.

351
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,010
There are no runesmiths
left working their craft.

352
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,560
A damn shame.

353
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,060
It's a long story though;
I'll tell you as we walk.

354
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,860
For starters, I should
prob'ly say I'm from

355
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,240
a famous runesmithing family.

356
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,450
[AINS]
I see.

357
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,070
Once all the magic items
my people crafted

358
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,030
were inscribed
with these runes.

359
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
But that ended about
200 years ago.

360
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,450
People found a way to
enchant items with magic

361
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,370
and our methods were soon
considered outdated.

362
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,880
Rune carving is
time consuming in comparison

363
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,210
to performing an enchantment.

364
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,840
And because of that,
many dwarves just gave up.

365
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,130
They believed it would be better

366
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,720
to become magic casters
than runesmiths.

367
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,300
[AINS] So that's how
the traditional craft

368
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,800
began to die out.

369
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,060
[GONDO]
Exactly.

370
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,140
However, runecrafting
has some good points!

371
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,440
Mainly, it's cheaper
to produce things!

372
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,600
[AINS]
That's wonderful.

373
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,150
It takes a lot of
expensive ingredients

374
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,070
to create a high-quality
magic item.

375
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,690
[GONDO]
No one sees it that way!

376
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,570
But imagine if we revived the
artform and created something

377
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,280
that only runes could make?

378
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,700
Then people would
change their tune.

379
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,080
[AINS]
Absolutely.

380
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,740
Is that the reason you never
gave up on your craft?

381
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,790
But I can't do it myself.

382
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,290
[AINS]
Hm.

383
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,920
I don't have what it takes
to be a master artisan at all.

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,380
I didn't inherit the talents
of my esteemed father.

385
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,670
But that doesn't matter.

386
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,670
I still believe in the
potential of our craft

387
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,590
and I want to fight for it.

388
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,260
The other crafters
have given up.

389
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,640
They drink their days away,

390
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,100
but they still possess the
skills of our ancestors!

391
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,270
There's only so much
I can do alone,

392
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,940
but I know the end goal
is still possible!

393
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,860
Most importantly, I want
to continue passing down

394
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,440
this craft to my children.

395
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,400
I won't let my father's great
name fade away into history

396
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,070
because of the
negligence of my people!

397
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,950
[AINS]
Seems we have much in common.

398
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,370
I have a legacy I'm
fighting to protect as well.

399
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,210
So, allow me--or rather,
allow my kingdom--

400
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,920
to support you financially.

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,500
[gasps] Huh?

402
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,170
[AINS] We will be your patron
and assist your plan.

403
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,590
I'll gather all the runesmiths
from the Dwarven Kingdom

404
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,390
to aid your research.
Let's do this together.

405
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,970
I trust that's enough?

406
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,220
Can you accomplish your research
with that sort of support?

407
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,140
Though, I will expect
absolute loyalty in return.

408
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,940
Gondo, are you prepared
to sell your soul to me

409
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,440
for the sake of your art?

410
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,190
[GONDO] If my soul alone is
enough to satisfy you,

411
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,570
it's a small price to pay

412
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,530
in order to preserve
my people's rich heritage.

413
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,990
I'm ready!

414
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,250
What's this about?

415
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,500
My apologies. I know
you just returned,

416
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,550
but there are pressing
matters at hand.

417
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,880
[AINS]
Go on.

418
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,840
[SHALLTEAR] Well, some
creatures have invaded.

419
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,050
I took the liberty of
sending the Hanzos out

420
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,470
to assess their numbers
and monitor them.

421
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,680
[AINS] And excellent
judgment call, Shalltear.

422
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,390
You did as I would have
done in that situation.

423
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,940
I wonder if those
creatures are Quagoa.

424
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,480
[AURA]
Never heard of 'em.

425
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,650
They're the reason my people
abandoned this city years ago.

426
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,820
From an early age,
the Quagoa consume the ore

427
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,200
in these tunnels.
The fur covering their body

428
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,660
is tougher than any kind
of crafted metal armor.

429
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,370
Be especially wary of
the ones with colored tufts.

430
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,000
They're the strongest
ones in the pack.

431
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,090
[AINS]
Understood.

432
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,630
Shalltear, I want you
to capture all the Quagoa.

433
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,010
Can you do it?

434
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,590
[SHALLTEAR] If that is your
will, it shall be done.

435
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,010
[AINS]
Before you go.

436
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,550
Do you know why I gave
that specific order?

437
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,310
To extract information
from them.

438
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,520
And also, to avoid them
leaving with any intel on us.

439
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,770
[AINS] That's correct.
Good luck, Shalltear.

440
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,520
Bring me back good news!

441
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,770
Sir!

442
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,070
[SHALLTEAR] Today will be the
day that I redeem myself!

443
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,240
What is the best
course of action here?

444
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,330
If I'm not mistaken,

445
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,960
that building is
connected to a tunnel.

446
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,540
--Hanzo.
--[HANZO LEADER] Yes!

447
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,460
I want to ensure that none of
them are able to make an escape.

448
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,670
Can we stop them?

449
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,210
[HANZO LEADER]
Not a problem.

450
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Well, let's begin, shall we?

451
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,220
I think we're under attack!

452
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,220
You sure? Those things
aren't dwarves!

453
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,270
Stay alert! There aren't many!

454
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,640
Just hold your ground for now!

455
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,190
[QUAGOA roar]

456
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,360
[SHALLTEAR] I think I figured
out which one's the leader!

457
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,940
Mass Hold Species!

458
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,990
Mass Hold Species!

459
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,280
Mass Hold Species!

460
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,870
Now go, tighten the enclosure!

461
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,500
[QUAGOA 5D]
Wh-What is this?

462
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,210
[QUAGOA roar]

463
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,130
They can't harm me. Lovely!

464
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,340
Mass Hold Species!

465
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,300
[SHALLTEAR] So are these all
the Quagoa who ran away?

466
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,880
You've searched
everywhere, right?

467
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,300
[HANZO LEADER]
Yes.

468
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,970
[AINS]
Well done, Shalltear.

469
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,850
[giggles] I am glad I didn't
disappoint you, sir!

470
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,890
[AINS] Now then,
I have your next order.

471
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,270
Gather information
from these creatures.

472
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,230
[SHALLTEAR]
Understood.

473
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,110
Huh! Well, I ain't talking.

474
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,230
I swear on the
honor of our tribe!

475
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,110
I have other ways
of doing this.

476
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,860
Charm Species.

477
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,240
Hi, pal! How can I help you?

478
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,410
Now I know me and you
are good friends n'all.

479
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,580
But can we trust them?
That's a shady bunch.

480
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,500
'Specially that undead goon.

481
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,250
Oh, wait, are you
controlling it?

482
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,760
--I will kill you!
--[AINS] That's correct.

483
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,260
That woman is my master.

484
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,380
Oh. Of course! Shoulda guessed!

485
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,510
Wow, you're cool!

486
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,850
Th-Thanks a lot, pal.

487
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,560
So, why did you come to this
city, and in such large numbers?

488
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,560
We're just proud warriors
carrying out the orders

489
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,690
of the great Clan Lord Riyuro!

490
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,980
Gonna trash the
dwarven city to the north!

491
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,320
Like totally destroy it.

492
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,570
[GONDO]
You what?

493
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,150
[QUAGOA LEADER]
We're a separate unit, though.

494
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,990
Our orders were
to kill any dwarves

495
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,950
that tried to
escape through here.

496
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,620
You heard that, ugly?

497
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,120
That weak-ass fortress you
have protecting the bridge

498
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,950
is going down after today!

499
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,460
We've found a sweet little route

500
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,380
that will bypass
the Great Chasm.

501
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,920
Our main force will be
slaughtering all those

502
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,050
pathetic little dwarves
any minute now!
