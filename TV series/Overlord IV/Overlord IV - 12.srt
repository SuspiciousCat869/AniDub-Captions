1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,850
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
So then I bowed down and said,

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,970
"Please, I beg of you!
Just a moment of your time!"

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,180
And it worked splendidly.
He stopped dead in his tracks.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,600
[ALBEDO]
May I interject?

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,310
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
What is it?

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,230
You were posing as
Lord Ains--the Sorcerer King

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,030
and absolute ruler of
the Tomb of Nazarick.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,610
And yet you dropped
to your hands and knees.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,070
Is that appropriate?

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,660
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Oh, you're right.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,620
I don't suppose the real Lord
Ains would ever do such a thing.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,790
[AINS] No, I think that
was a fine choice.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,500
If that's all it takes to make
an enemy drop their guard,

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,590
then feel free to debase
yourself all you like.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,720
My dignity is not so flimsy
as to be shaken by such a thing.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,510
In addition to taking
him off guard,

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,310
I'm certain that it led him
to underestimate me.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,100
You've poisoned his
mind quite skillfully.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,730
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Thank you.

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,360
[AINS] But we still don't
have enough information.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,860
Some of his powers are still
a bit of a mystery to me.

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,190
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Like the barrier, you mean?

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,110
[AINS] Since Albedo was carrying
Ginnungagap and she was

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
the only one who could
break through the barrier,

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,250
we can assume it was
created using a world item.

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,750
It likely functions the same as
the world item I gave to Aura--

27
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,710
Depiction of Nature and Society.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
I'm not so certain, My Lord.

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,670
I noticed something peculiar.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,430
When he spoke the words
"World Isolation Barrier,"

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,180
his HP dropped. Perhaps
it was actually a skill?

32
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,180
[AINS]
Yes. Although some world items

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,720
have an activation cost,

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,600
I've never heard of one
that takes your HP.

35
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,190
And you said that
his HP dropped

36
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,150
when he used other skills
as well, is that correct?

37
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,650
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Yes, even
for things like teleportation.

38
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,110
His HP would drop
upon activation.

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,740
[AINS] One world item
with multiple functions?

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,450
Such things do exist,
like my orb here.

41
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,830
But the ability to strengthen
weapons and armor,

42
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,120
teleport, and create barriers?

43
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,040
Those abilities are far too
different from one another.

44
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,380
As things stand,
we cannot say for certain

45
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,470
that his skills are
the work of a world item.

46
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,590
It seems we need to lose
another battle with this

47
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,260
Riku fellow if we
want to find out.

48
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,560
[BOTH gasp]

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,140
[AINS] Naturally,
I don't like losing, either,

50
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,520
but we must know everything
possible about our opponent.

51
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,400
That will ensure
an absolute victory.

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,860
[ALBEDO, PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Yes, sir!

53
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,320
[MOMONGA] I've confirmed that
NPCs can be resurrected,

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,940
and that goes for people
from this world, too.

55
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,070
But if I die, who knows?
Not really something I can test.

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,540
Well, actually, thinking
about the history here.

57
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,870
The Six Great Gods
and the Eight Greed Kings

58
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,210
were probably players like me.

59
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,920
Without exception, all of their
stories end with their deaths.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,260
That means my odds aren't good.

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,550
I have to keep that in mind

62
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,760
with every decision
that I make going forward.

63
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,800
Anything that's lost
can be regained,

64
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,850
as long as I'm still alive.

65
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,600
Better to suffer a strategic
loss and live to tell the tale.

66
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,520
[AINS] Well, then,
Cocytus and the others

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,810
should be attacking the
royal capital about now.

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,440
I'll head there, as well.

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,110
I need to close the curtain
on this tale personally.

70
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,070
[ALBEDO] It's such a
trivial matter, My Lord.

71
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,990
Are you certain it's
worthy of your attention,

72
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,950
when I could take
care of it for you?

73
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,450
[AINS laughs]
When I'm playing the villain,

74
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,580
I have standards to uphold.

75
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,040
Though I'm not quite as
extravagant about it as Ulbert.

76
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,920
Oh, is that why?
Well, fair enough then.

77
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,880
[AINS] Yes, that is
exactly why, Albedo.

78
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,220
It's good that you understand.

79
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,060
[CARETAKER 412A] I know this
is a strange time to say this.

80
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,730
But the children look
forward to your visits

81
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,860
more than anything else.

82
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,530
They always love your stew.

83
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,650
It's been difficult to get some
ingredients because of the war,

84
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,280
but with your help today,
the children will finally

85
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,540
be able to eat their fill.

86
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,290
Well, I hope you're able to have
a bit of stew yourselves.

87
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,120
You've been saving food
for the children,

88
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,880
so I'm sure you haven't
been eating properly.

89
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,010
[CARETAKER 412B sobs]
You're so kind, princess.

90
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,560
Pathetic, isn't it?

91
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,060
[gasps]

92
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,180
Can you believe it?

93
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,730
Our kingdom's on
the brink of ruin,

94
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,730
and feeding orphans
is all I can do.

95
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,110
It's only a matter of time

96
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,570
before the Sorcerer
Kingdom arrives.

97
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,070
Then, all of the people here
in the capital will die.

98
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,070
Please don't say that.

99
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,410
No matter what happens next,

100
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,070
the children are
happy right now.

101
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,450
That wouldn't be
the case without you.

102
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,950
[gasps]

103
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,420
[laughs] I...

104
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,130
I'm sorry, I said too much.

105
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,710
That was insolent of me.

106
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,000
[giggles]

107
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,300
I'm sure you must be busy,

108
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,930
so thank you for
meeting with me.

109
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,930
I apologize for
making you wait.

110
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,270
[LAKYUS]
That's perfectly fine.

111
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,350
You probably have plenty
to take care of, yourself.

112
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,980
Oh. I don't need tea.

113
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,860
I'm afraid we can't stay long.

114
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,150
[EVILEYE]
Come on, Lakyus.

115
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,990
How long could it take
to drink one cup of tea?

116
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,660
Were all of you
looking forward to it?

117
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,700
[EVILEYE] The princess extends
us such a kind offer

118
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,790
in this trying time and you turn
it down without a thought?

119
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,290
How cold of you.

120
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,710
Hey, muscle-head.

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,880
[EVILEYE] Don't ignore me.
Who do you think I'm talking to?

122
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,420
Miss "I'd sink in the
water like a rock."

123
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,380
[EVILEYE sighs]
Hey, Gagaran.

124
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,180
Yes? What is it?

125
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,510
[EVILEYE] Wouldn't you like
to have a spot of tea?

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,890
More than just a spot.

127
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,890
I could chug the stuff
by the gallon.

128
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,140
My poor throat has
never been so parched.

129
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,480
[EVILEYE]
So there you have it, Boss.

130
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,770
Tea for everyone.
With your permission.

131
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,650
If it means that much to you.
But you'll be drinking, as well?

132
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,030
[TIA] We'll pour the
cups. Don't worry.

133
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,400
Uh--

134
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,070
You can have a nice chat
with the princess

135
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,450
in the meantime, okay?

136
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,160
Though fair warning,
I like my tea extremely bitter.

137
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,620
That's not necessary.
There's some in the pot.

138
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,630
Oops, there's not enough.

139
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,800
Oh, no. That won't do at all!

140
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,930
Especially since we have
someone who could, quote:

141
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,880
"chug the stuff
by the gallon."

142
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,800
People will start to think
the princess can't even

143
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,760
offer tea to her
distinguished guests!

144
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,260
Stop it, you're being rude!

145
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,350
[RENNER]
Lakyus.

146
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,940
This is probably the last time
we'll see each other.

147
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,020
Your friends are only trying
to buy us some time.

148
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,320
[gasps]

149
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,730
[TINA]
Hey, Brain.

150
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,070
[TIA] Show us where
we can boil more water.

151
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,780
All right. Straight ahead.

152
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,870
So should I leave
the room, as well?

153
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,950
[EVILEYE]
Don't worry about it.

154
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,450
You're fine. They didn't
leave with Brain

155
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,160
just to give the
princess privacy.

156
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,250
Let's relax.

157
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,540
Your friends were
so considerate.

158
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,500
Fair enough. There's no harm.

159
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,050
We can chat until the
tea gets here at least.

160
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,260
I agree!

161
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,850
I don't sense anyone nearby.
Guess they've all run away.

162
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,440
Your tea.

163
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,820
[LAKYUS]
Where are Sir Unglaus and Tina?

164
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,150
[TIA]
Looking for dessert.

165
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,450
[LAKYUS]
You're serious?

166
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,860
Here, slave-driver.

167
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,530
You're about to taste the first
tea that I've ever made.

168
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,450
Quite the honor, right?

169
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,330
Such a strong aroma.
I can't wait.

170
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,330
Drink it. In one gulp.

171
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,170
You should find it
quite refreshing,

172
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,960
since you're a demon.

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,090
I'll humor you this time,

174
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,220
but only because
it's your first try.

175
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,260
Delicious?

176
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,140
I think that might be a stretch.

177
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,930
It's very bitter.

178
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,650
[gasps]

179
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,490
[TIA]
All right. One more!

180
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,610
[screams]

181
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,490
Princess, stay behind me!

182
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,830
What's going on here?

183
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,200
[EVILEYE]
You move and I cast a spell.

184
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,500
Don't bother.
You're not our target.

185
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,960
Besides, this will
all be over soon.

186
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,460
[LAKYUS groans]

187
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,670
But why?

188
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,720
I've been watching you
for a long time.

189
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,350
Figuring out what it would
take to bring you down.

190
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,220
It's your turn, Evileye.

191
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,100
[EVILEYE]
Right. Resist Weakening.

192
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,810
Nope. Blocked it.

193
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,650
Why don't you justgive up?

194
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,400
[EVILEYE]
Resist Weakening.

195
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,990
[EVILEYE]
Now it worked.

196
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,660
Charm Person.

197
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,750
Good. Got her.

198
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,080
All right!

199
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,000
[EVILEYE] Lakyus, be a good girl
and heal your wounds.

200
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,710
Right. As you wish.

201
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,050
Uh--

202
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,340
[RENNER] Mind control
is truly frightening.

203
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,180
[EVILEYE] Look at you!
Not shaken up one bit!

204
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,100
You may act girly, but I
always knew you were tough.

205
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,430
I've never thought of
myself that way at all.

206
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,060
I just had faith. Or rather,
I knew you wouldn't

207
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,980
do something like this
without a reason.

208
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,570
On that note.

209
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,780
Can you tell me why you poisoned
and mind-controlled your friend?

210
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,490
[EVILEYE]
It's nothing complicated.

211
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,620
This might sound callous,
but the truth is,

212
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,990
we care more about Lakyus than
we care about the kingdom.

213
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,700
Our fiendish boss
was the only one

214
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,660
who wanted to protect
the royal capital.

215
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,380
The rest of our group was
secretly against that plan.

216
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,840
But there was no point
in arguing with her about it.

217
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,380
She'd stay behind on her own
and tell us that we should go.

218
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,050
The only solution we thought
of was to catch her off-guard

219
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,010
and take her out of
the capital by force,

220
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,350
but I'm sorry you
had to see this.

221
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,850
[EVILEYE] We had to make sure
she didn't have her magic items,

222
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,770
then we used five
different poisons

223
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,480
and cast weakening spells.

224
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,360
Even then, getting Charm Person
to work was a gamble.

225
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,570
[EVILEYE]
That's that!

226
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,650
As soon as Tina comes back,

227
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,400
we'll teleport
out of the capital.

228
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,740
Do you two want to come with us?

229
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,870
Could we?

230
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,740
Before I can answer,
I have to know,

231
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,250
where are you planning
to run off to?

232
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,830
[EVILEYE] Tough call.
Somewhere southeast?

233
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,750
There's a kingdom there that
fell to ruin a long time ago.

234
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,420
In short, it's someplace far,

235
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,260
far away that you've
never heard of.

236
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,220
Is that so?

237
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,550
Thank you for the offer. But no.

238
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,970
I believe I'll stay here.

239
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,180
[EVILEYE]
Very well.

240
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,350
[knocking]

241
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,390
[TINA] Good news!
We found some dessert.

242
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,400
It took us forever, because she
couldn't pick out just one.

243
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,690
Huh? What happened?

244
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,440
You wanna explain
all the blood?

245
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,700
Everything's fine.

246
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,030
It's nothing to
concern yourself with.

247
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,580
All right, then.

248
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,830
I guess I'll just
leave it at that.

249
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,580
[EVILEYE]
Here's a question, Brain.

250
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,460
Do you want to escape with us?

251
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,750
Is Princess Renner
going as well?

252
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,420
I see. In that case, I'll pass.

253
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,930
That works out just fine for me.
I'm tired of running away.

254
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,140
[EVILEYE]
Of course.

255
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,260
How did I know that's
what you'd say?

256
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,140
Well, so long, then.

257
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,640

258
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,520
Uh, Princess.

259
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,150
[BRAIN]
All right, it's time.

260
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,700
This is yours. I'll be
heading out on my own.

261
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,240
To what end?

262
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,080
I'll hunt down the Sorcerer King
and challenge him to a duel.

263
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,410
Though I admit, that's
probably a tall order,

264
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,340
since he's got a whole army
out there protecting him.

265
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,340
[CLIMB]
Wait a second!

266
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,170
This sword was
left in your care!

267
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,130
That was Sir Stronoff's
wish before he was killed!

268
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,470
Too bad, then.

269
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
I already told you, didn't I?

270
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,350
I have no intentions
of respecting his wishes.

271
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,020
I'm sorry, but could you return
that sword to the king for me?

272
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,980
[RENNER]
As you wish.

273
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,480
But, Princess!

274
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,810
It's fine.

275
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,730
We should respect
Sir Brain's decision.

276
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,110
You always impress, Princess.
You're a lady worth serving.

277
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,780
Not that I know
much about ladies,

278
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,870
if I'm being totally honest.

279
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,620
We've had some
good times, Princess.

280
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,950
And Climb.

281
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,750
I still remember when I met
you and Lord Sebas.

282
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,250
It brought me back to life.

283
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,750
This is probably our farewell,
but hey, I've got no regrets.

284
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,640
Why did everything
have to fall apart?

285
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,730
No, it was destroyed
by the Sorcerer King!

286
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,060
[RENNER]
Climb. Let's go.

287
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,610
I still have to fulfill
my royal duty.

288
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,820
That sword is our
kingdom's treasure.

289
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,440
I'd like to deliver
it to my father

290
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,030
while that's still possible.

291
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,660
Yes. Of course.

292
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,370
But before we get to that.

293
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,250
Indulge me.

294
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,410
Just for a moment, let me
hold the sword, myself.

295
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,710
Huh? Sure. Be careful.

296
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,630
My goodness, it's quite heavy.

297
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,770
I suppose it doesn't
suit me much.

298
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,770
Actually, I'm not sure
I would say that, Princess.

299
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,150
In fact, you'd probably
surpass me easily

300
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,650
with a bit of training.

301
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,820
You don't always
have to flatter me.

302
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,740
Either way, I don't think
I'll have the chance

303
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,410
to wield a sword ever again.

304
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,160
Uh...

305
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
All right.

306
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,120
I need to make
a few preparations.

307
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,620
Then we'll see Father.

308
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,650
[AURA] Hey, guys!
Nobody try to stop me, 'kay?

309
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,160
Nailed it!

310
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,500
I'll only say this
one more time.

311
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,340
Don't try to stop me.
I'm real busy.

312
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:07,010
Hm... That's there so, this way?

313
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,510
Hey! Don't ignore me!

314
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,640
Come on, guys.

315
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,300
I'm not the only enemy here.

316
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,140
Can you afford to get distracted
at a time like this?

317
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,640
My friends are coming!

318
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,860
[SOLDIERS gasp, yelp]

319
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,110
Don't bother with them.

320
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,190
The troops aren't
my responsibility.

321
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,240
Okay. First stop is
the magician's guild.

322
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,740
Oooh! I found it!

323
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,830
[screams]

324
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,460
[SOLDIERS groan]

325
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,250
[AURA sighs]

326
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,290
It's okay.

327
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,540
Iri just got a
little too excited.

328
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,760
But I'm not mad.
You don't have to bully him.

329
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,130
You ready?

330
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,680
Who wants to help me destroy
a couple of buildings?

331
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,220
But this is precision work.

332
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,890
Iri's too big.

333
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,430
Don't be sad.

334
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,020
I have a special mission
just for you!

335
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,650
Go stomp around the city walls.

336
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,110
And squish everyone you
see under your feet!

337
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,240
Okay, the rest
of you, follow me.

338
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,870
[AURA giggles]

339
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,540
[BRAIN]
Let's see.

340
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,010
If I were the Sorcerer King,
then where would I be?

341
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,470
Maybe I should hide in
a building and wait for him.

342
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,050
Seems they haven't
started the attack yet.

343
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,640
The civilians either couldn't
escape or they were too scared.

344
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,930
Don't they realize they're
just waiting to die?

345
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,520
If they all came out to fight at
once, it'd be a hell of a show.

346
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,190
Would things have been
different if he was here,

347
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,940
instead of me?

348
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,820
Well, no point in
wondering that now.

349
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,240
It feels cold.

350
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,090
I'll try it. Why not?

351
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,580
Just waltzed right up.
No backing down now.

352
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,670
[BRAIN] Actually,
I'm surprised he stopped.

353
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,630
I'm nothing more than an ant
in his path, after all.

354
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,880
And he'll be crushing plenty of
ants today, seeing as there's

355
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,300
hardly anyone willing or able
to defend the capital.

356
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,640
En garde! I am Brain Unglaus!

357
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,940
[COCYTUS]
And I am Cocytus.

358
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,360
A servant of the Supreme Being,
the Sorcerer King,

359
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,820
Ains Ooal Gown.

360
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,700
Well met, swordsman.

361
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,950
[gasps]

362
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,960
Thank you for this.

363
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,290
[COCYTUS]
No need.

364
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,880
[COCYTUS]
God Slaying Emperor Blade.

365
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,300
Heh.

366
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,240
"Seek life when facing
death," he said.

367
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,950
Good advice.

368
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,200
I can't survive a
single strike of his.

369
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,120
My only hope is to move so fast

370
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,660
that I take out his arms
before he attacks.

371
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,830
This is it!

372
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,710
Time for Ability Boost!

373
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,050
[BRAIN]
And Greater Ability Boost!

374
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,350
[BRAIN]
True Nail Clipper!

375
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,230
[BRAIN groans]

376
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,450
[COCYTUS] I wasn't told that
there were any men of merit

377
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,830
left in this land.

378
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,000
He might have become a
great asset had he joined us,

379
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,960
and yet, I cut him down.

380
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,300
I must respect the
resolve of a warrior

381
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,340
the moment he draws his sword.

382
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,510
I am certain that Lord Warrior
Takemikazuchi would accept

383
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,140
my decision, if he were here.

384
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,730
[COCYTUS]
I will take this as a trophy.

385
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,320
[COCYTUS]
Preserve his body in ice.

386
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
We shall continue our advance.

387
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,500
[COCYTUS]
Hm.
