I'll be right with you.

Oh, hi, Kashimura.

166
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,958
Haven't seen you in a while.

[ZOROKU]
A pack of the usual, please.

You should really quit.

Yeah, yeah.

Hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

172
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm worried about
that little girl over there.

173
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,041
I don't know what
to do about her.

174
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,958
[CHEN] She's been sitting
like that for three hours.

175
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,166
The Red Light
District isn't really

176
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,125
the best place for a child.

177
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,500
[ZOROKU]
Tell the police.

178
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,666
[CHEN sighs] I called,
but they won't do anything.

179
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,625
They never deal with foreigners.

180
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,250
[ZOROKU]
So talk to the shop owner.

181
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,500
I can't! He won't get
involved with the police.

182
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,250
Plus, I'm pretty sure
he's been stealing money

183
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,833
from the donation box.
Not really a stand-up guy.

don't you let me take you home?

Uh. You seem familiar.

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,500
Have we met before?

00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,291
[SANA]
Your name is Zoroku Kashimura.

193
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,416
You were born on
June 19th, 1943.

194
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,416
You have one granddaughter
whose name is Sanae.

195
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,375
She's been at training camp
for her high school club

196
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,666
since yesterday.

197
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,166
The first parts make sense,

198
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,291
but I have no idea what a
"club" or a "training camp" is.

199
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,125
I guess we haven't met.

200
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,333
Still, you don't
seem like a bad person.

201
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,583
That settles it.

202
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,708
I think you and I should
come to an arrangement.

203
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,875
And what would that be?

204
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:03,958
It's simple!

If you help me,
I'll grant you any wish!

206

What is this, kid?
Something from a comic book?

207

Well, sorry, but I don't know
much about that stuff.

Uh. If you don't want
to help me, then fine!

Just say no! You don't
have to make fun of me!

I'm not making
fun of you at all.

vanished into thin air!

There's no choice.

seems to be incidental.

He simply got caught up in
events that were beyond him.

at least, let's prioritize

you'd want to ditch it.

00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,708
[ZOROKU]
Hey, it's me.

474
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,875
I won't get into all of it,
but some stuff came up

475
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,375
that I had to deal with.

476
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,416
[ZOROKU] Sorry, but I need
you two to handle things

477
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,541
without me today.
Give me a call if you need to.

478
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,875
I'm just going to grab some food
and then head home.

479
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,166
[WAITER A]
Welcome!

480
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,625
I'll take a beer,
mutton stir-fry,

481
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:38,916
and fried bread on the side.

482
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,875
[WAITER A]
Got it.

483
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,416
[ZOROKU]
Can I use this ashtray?

484
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,666
[WAITER A]
Yeah, go ahead.

485
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,750
[WAITER A]
Here you go.

486
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,000
Great, thank you.

487
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,291
[SANA]
Do they have any cream puffs?

488
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,416
[ZOROKU grunts]

489
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,416
You pop up whenever
you feel like it, huh?

490
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,125
Where'd you come from this time?

491
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,125
That's a big drink.
Can I have some?

492
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,916
No, you can't.
It's not for kids.

493
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,458
Hey. Can I get an orange juice?

494
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,166
[WAITER A]
Sure. Comin' right up.

495
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:34,791
[ZOROKU]
Well? What do you want?

496
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,541
This part of the city is for
grown-ups, not lost little kids.

497
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,500
I don't need any
more trouble today.

498
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:42,916
[SANA]
Dreams of Alice.

499
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,375
Are we back to
the comic book thing again?

500
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,833
That's what the
people like me are called.

501
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,416
It's hard to explain,
but basically,

502
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,208
we've got
supernatural abilities.

503
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:54,791
[SANA] I don't know where
our powers came from

504
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,291
or why have them
and others don't.

505
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,875
--[ZOROKU gasps]
--[SANA] See this?

506
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,291
It's a vision called
a Mirror Gate.

507
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:04,083
We use these as intermediaries.

508
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,666
When we summon them, we have
to ability to materialize

509
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,541
any one thing we can imagine.

510
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,458
[SANA] Like a chain,
or a bow and arrows.

511
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,500
Some people can fix things, too.

512
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,291
And I suppose
this power of yours is how

513
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,166
you were able to drive my car?

514
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,791
[SANA]
That's right!

515
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,666
I'd never actually
driven before that,

516
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,375
but it wasn't very difficult
to get the hang of it.

517
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,791
[WAITER A]
Here ya go. One orange juice.

518
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:31,166
Mutton stir-fry with Chinese
onions, and fried bread.

--[ZOROKU] Are you done talking?

If so, then

Don't want my food getting cold.

No! I'm not done, thank you!

524

I've officially
decided that I like you!

525
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,833
I'm gonna give you the honor
of becoming my servant,

You may show your gratitude now.

Ow, ow, ow!

528
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:57,458
Your feet belong
on the floor, not on the chair.

529
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,708
And when you're in a restaurant,

530
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,666
you will keep your voice
to a reasonable level.

Y-Yes, sir.

Ah...

In the store,
you were staring at the meals.

It's... been about three days.

Um... I can really eat this?

545
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,083
I don't have any
money to pay for it.

546
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,583
Yeah? It's a good thing I do.

Wow, check that out!

an eating competition
or something?

550
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:41,333
[SANA] I had no clue food was
so good in the outside world!

551
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:43,416
If you eat much
more you'll to explode.

[SANA] It's not something
I can control.

Activating the Mirror Gate takes
a tremendous amount of energy.

554
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,125
I need a lot of food to refuel.

Okay...

So that's why those girls were
eating when they attacked us.

know how to use them?

Gimme a break.

It's my first time outside
the research facility.

the two of us making a deal.

you want from me?

Yes, and there are many
other Dreams of Alice there,

with abilities like I have.

570

They're locked up,
and the things that happen

571
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,583
to them are terrible.

Come on, we don't
want to get separated.

You need to stick close to me.

How many times do I have
to tell you that this area isn't

I don't give free rides,

so while you're with me,
you'll help with my work.

No work equals no food,
do you understand?

00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,166
[SANA]
Okay! It's a deal!

I knew I'd get you
to come around!

If you wanna stay with me,

633
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,000
you better learn to be
respectful, you hear?!

I don't want you using
that weird power anymore.

I was serious about
granting you a wish.

641
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:44,208
But to do that,
I need to use my power.

642
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,708
[ZOROKU] Earlier, you said
you looked inside my mind.

Is that how you knew all
those things about me?

You're impossible.

You really don't
understand, do you?

650
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,833
[ZOROKU] You said you can do
anything you can imagine, right?

651
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:10,583
That's right.

652
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,291
And what if you used
that special power

653
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,708
of yours right here?

654
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,666
What, like now?

655
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,041
[ZOROKU]
You could do it, right?

656
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,583
Summon a big chain
or a wrecking ball?

657
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:23,666
You could cover
this whole place in blood.

658
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:27,416
[ZOROKU]
Get it now?

659
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,208
You mentioned a family member
I hadn't even spoke of,

660
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,208
and demanded that
I make a deal with you.

661
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:35,458
Then I found out you had this
potentially destructive power.

662
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,000
They've got a word
for that kind of thing--

663
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,333
it's blackmail.

664
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:42,041
[SANA] Wait, you've got it
wrong! I didn't mean to!

00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,250
[ZOROKU] Whether you
meant to or not is irrelevant.

666
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,375
The threat in your words
remains the same.

667
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,041
I have no interest
in making a deal

668
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,000
or getting a wish granted.

669
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,833
It's more important to focus
on the people close to you,

670
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,291
than dream about things
that are out of reach.

You understand?

672
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:03,083
What you do is cheating,
and I hate crooked stuff.

Listen.

That research facility,
whatever they do there--

Those are problems
for grown-ups.

676
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,166
What you should
focus on is changing

677
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,750
that twisted
temperament of yours.

678
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,541
If you want
to help your friends,

679

figure out how to
help yourself first.

It's the children's playground,
a paradise brought to life

695

by randomly rewriting
the space's reality.

As improbable
as it seems, they are.

They're amalgamations.

There's still
much that's unclear.

706
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,625
The space inside
Wonderland is distorted.

00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,375
It is now many thousands
of times its original size,

708
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,416
and it's still growing now.

[BUSINESSMAN E] And?
How do you intend to proceed?

713
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,500
[KITO]
There are two problems.

714
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,750
Our first concern:
the person who possesses

715
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,916
this immense power is a
child who knows nothing

716
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,458
of the outside world.

717
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:27,583
If she remains unsupervised
in her current psychologically

718
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:30,333
unstable state, the existence
of the research facility

719
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,083
could possibly become
public knowledge.

720
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:35,625
The other problem is the
potential loss of the Red Queen

721
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,333
herself as a valuable
sample of this ability.

722
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:41,583
As such a loss would be
a massive detriment.

723
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:44,208
Not just to us,
but to the entire country.

724
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:47,458
[BUSINESSMAN A] And how do you
mean to address these problems?

725
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:50,541
Her capture will be conducted
with utmost discretion.

726
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,958
However, should something
happen that brings this incident

727
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,583
and the research facility itself
to the public's attention--

[ZOROKU] You're not
the one doing the walking.

784
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,958
[SANA sighs]

785
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,291
[ZOROKU]
You're not sleeping there.

786
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,958
Come upstairs.

787
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,000
[SANA groans]

788
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,875
[ZOROKU]
Take off your shoes.

789
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:59,958
[ZOROKU] I'm not using this
room for anything right now.

790
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,208
It's a little bit dusty,
but I think you'll survive.

791
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,666
Here's some fresh bedding.

792
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,000
I'll get you a clean
change of clothes.

793
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:12,416
'Kay... Thank you...

794
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,875
They're my granddaughter's,

795
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:19,000
so they'll be
pretty big, but you--

796
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,250
[ZOROKU]
Hmm...

797
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:47,708
Zoroku... Cream puffs...

798
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,125
[SANA]
