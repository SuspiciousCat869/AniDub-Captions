00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,458
I'll be exponentially
more motivated to find it!

Stop being ridiculous!

Are you okay?!

[ICHIJO growls]

169

Yamada. Keep looking!

Oh, right!

Stay calm. Stay calm.

[NORIKO gasps]
I found her!

173
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,666
[NORIKO] Three o'clock,
the seventh row of containers.

Man, am I a genius, or what?

[ICHIJO grunts, yells]

Now, then.

Let's finish this.

178
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,166
I was trying to play nice.

179
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,250
But you're giving me no choice.

I hate the single digits.

They're difficult to control.

00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,375
I can't pull my
punches with them

191

What are you? A monster?

All right! Let's do it!

[MINNIE grunts]

202
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
[ICHIJO]
I warned you I can't hold back.

203
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,041
[ICHIJO]
You should've listened.

204
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,250
Former Lieutenant
Minnie C. Tachibana.

205
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,208
I am placing you under arrest.

206
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,166
Charges: Abduction of
a minor and assault.

207
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,458
[ICHIJO] There was an anime
about a maid who used

208
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,083
a magic storeroom
just like this one.

209
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,791
One night I fell asleep watching
TV, and the storeroom appeared,

210
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,208
as if it had come
straight from the show.

211
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,916
Six hundred,
sixty-six weapons

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,541
and 13 grimoires
are stored inside.

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,583
I'm like a human arsenal.

214
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,166
But I didn't ask for this.

215
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,875
Whatever these powers are,
I don't believe they are

216
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,041
given to us for the purpose
of granting our wishes.

217
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,791
[MINNIE]
No use. I'm out of energy.

218
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,083
[MINNIE]
I'm alone.

219
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,291
I've been alone for so long.

220
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,833
Somewhere along the way,
I realized that the gears

221
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,333
had slipped off-track,
that I was broken.

222
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,250
But still, I'm unable to stop.

223
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,375
What am I to do?

224
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,541
It feels so wrong
that I must go on living..

225
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:56,666
Tomorrow,
the next day, and beyond...

226
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,250
My darling... forgive me...

227
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,541
I'm sorry that I still live
and you do not...

228
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,083
[MINNIE]
I'm sorry...!

229
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,958
So I've been thinking.

230
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,541
About what?

231
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,500
[SANA] It's just that,
whether I mean to or not,

232
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,291
I'm pretty sure I'm going
to cause more trouble

233
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,791
just by existing in
the outside world.

234
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,541
Even if it's nothing serious,

235
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,750
I'm sure I'm still going
to make a lot of mistakes.

236
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,916
I don't know
why I look like this.

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,583
Why I was given
the form of a young girl.

238
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,291
But for whatever reason,

239
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,666
somebody chose
to make me this way.

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,791
[SANA] And that makes me think
that perhaps there is something

241
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,041
I'm meant to accomplish
in human form.

242
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,083
Silly, I know.

243
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,166
But someday, I want to be human!

244
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,875
Or if not human,
at least something more real

245
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,583
than what I am.

246
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,291
There's so much I want to learn.
About everything.

247
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,625
About humanity.

248
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,083
About you and Sanae.

249
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,333
About all the amazing
things in this world.

250
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,541
There are still so
many foods I haven't tried!

251
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,833
[SANA] I think that with
each new thing I learn,

252
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,416
I'll become more real.

253
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,916
And one day, I'll figure out why
I was made and given this form.

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,583
Maybe I'll even learn
what I truly am.

255

[stomach growls]

256
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,125
I need to eat something.

257
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,750
I'm sure you'll
figure it out someday.

258
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,083
Yeah.

259
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,666
[ZOROKU]
Hmm.

00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,041
My hair.

261
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,625
I can take care of it on my own,
but I'd like Sanae to.

262
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,208
Then you can ask
her to do it when we get back.

263
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,500
Right!

264
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,041
[ZOROKU gasps]

265
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,375
[ZOROKU]
Quite a view. Pretty amazing.

266
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,583
I know! I can do
anything, remember?

Thank you very much.

Yes, that's right.

Yes, that's me.

Sorry to interrupt,
but I'm with the Yotsuya police.

[NAITO] Ah. I really am sorry
about this, old man.

276
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,208
The situation ended up
getting pretty messy.

277
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,833
It's safe to say you
can expect life to be

278
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,375
a bit noisy for a while.

279
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,666
Might as well give up
and just accept it.

Hmph.

All right. Enjoy yourselves.

Just do me a favor and try
not to let people see you.

00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,458
It'd make my life hell.

Hear that, Sana?

Oh! Hey, wait, but-- I'm
trying to get us back home.

290
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,500
What do you want me to do?

291
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,666
Well. I guess it's not so bad.

It isn't every day you have a
chance to fly through the sky.

I don't like it.

you're in a good mood.

Tough luck.

00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,458
You'll just have
to deal with it.

After all, I got a new
granddaughter today.

298
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,333
Sanae must be happy, too.

Of course I'm happy!

[NAITO]
Heh...

302
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,666
[SANA]
So, um... Zoroku?

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,250
[ZOROKU]
Yeah?

304
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,833
[SANA] The thing is, well, about
knocking those vases over.

305
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,500
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,583
You should
have apologized earlier.

307
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,708
Yeah.

308
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,500
Let's go.

'Kay.

311
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,708
[SANAE] And that's how, over
the course of just a few days,

312
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,666
our family of two become
a family of three.

313
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,583
[SANAE] According to Ichijo,
the organization that

314
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,583
held Sana prisoner
was dismantled shortly

315

after her escape and
the battle at the port.

316
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,791
[SANAE] After the incident,
the government faction

317
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,000
that had opposed Naito and
his boss quieted down.
