I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,291
A "frazzling meanie"?

Yeah, that's right!

And, if you know what's good for
you, you'll tell me who you are!

00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,750
Um. My name is Ayumu Miho.

How did you bring us here?

I don't think you're ready
to hear the answer,

This... is Wonderland!

00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,875
I opened a door here
so I could catch you.

Everything that happens here,
happens because I want it to.

In Wonderland, I do whatever
I want, and no one can beat me.

Did you create this place

That's enough questions.

I've got you now, and I'm
not letting you leave here

until you apologize. Understand?

I'll apologize, I really will.

I've got that
frazzled feeling again!

56
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,125
It's your fault because you had
to open your big, dumb mouth

and say stuff instead
of just shutting up!

I told you to shut up!

It means you're basically
inside my tummy!

I could crush you like

have hurt people.

She wouldn't have turned Zoroku

She's cute and friendly.

be more like her.

you wanted to make me pay.

00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,250
[LAB WOMAN A] Dreams of Alice
are popping up everywhere!

321
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,416
[LAB MAN C] Let's get
an exact count, if we can.

322
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,250
Ichijo, hey,
something is going on!

323
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,958
Wonderland is expanding!

324
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,291
We don't have
all the details yet,

325
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,000
but we've never seen
something like this!

326
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,208
[AYUMU] Kashimura said she
was going to Hatori's house.

327
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,916
If she's there to help,
Hatori won't mind, right?

328
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,750
[phone vibrates]

329
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,083
Yeah, hey, Mom. What's up?

330
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,750
Is something wrong?
I'm not far from home.

331
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,125
[AYUMU] Hatori, why?
What do you mean she's gone?

332
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,500
[SANAE] How does it look?!
Any sign of Sana yet?

333
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,458
[ZOROKU grunting]

334
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,708
[ZOROKU sighs]

335
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,291
You going somewhere?

336
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,458
[ZOROKU]
I want to take a look around.

337
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,666
[door opens, slams]

338
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,750
Huh? Mm.

339
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,541
Hey, Dad. Long day?

340
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,750
Yeah. Where's your mother?

341
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,291
Not here.

342
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,583
Hatori's gone missing,
so Mom went with her mother

343
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,541
to look for her.

344
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,083
[AYUMU'S DAD]
I see.

345
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,333
[AYUMU'S DAD] I got a call
about Hatori earlier, too.

346
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,833
I'll go out and help
them look for her.

347
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,458
[AYUMU'S DAD]
Where's Daiki?

348
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,125
He already had dinner
and went to bed.

349
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,291
[AYUMU'S DAD]
Hm.

350
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,125
[AYUMU'S DAD]
I want you to do the same, Ayu.

351
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,791
Understand?

352
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:08,791
[AYUMU]
Can't I--

353
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:09,958
[AYUMU'S DAD]
No.

354
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,541
I know you're worried
about your friend,

355
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,666
but you're much too young
to be out at this time of night.

356
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,625
[AYUMU exhales]

357
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,125
It'll be all right.

358
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,333
Hatori's got a good head
on her shoulders.

359
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,250
She'll turn up soon.

360
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,875
[door opens]

361
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,166
[door slams]

362
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,583
Who's this evil girl
Sana's gone after?

363
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,750
The research facility was shut
down, so no one from there.

364
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:51,791
[door opens]

365
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,208
[SANAE]
How'd it go?

366
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,083
Any sign of her?

367
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,541
[ZOROKU]
No.

368
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,041
There's never any telling
where she'll wander off to.

369
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,541
You know Sana.

370
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,583
Do you think she's okay?

371
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,750
[ZOROKU]
Well, if nothing else,

372
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,708
she'll come home
when she gets hungry.

373
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,750
--[phone vibrates]
--[gasps]

374
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,791
[ZOROKU]
Yes, hello?

375
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,833
You've got
perfect timing, Ichijo.

376
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,250
Yeah, something's come up.

377
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,583
Yes, right. She's been
gone for a while now.

378
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,791
[ICHIJO]
I suspected as much.

379
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,291
[ZOROKU]
What's going on?

380
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,875
I don't have all
the details yet,

381
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,708
but a few hours ago, something
strange happened in Wonderland.

382
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,000
We're having a hard time
accessing it right now,

383
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,666
so all we have at the
moment is speculation.

384
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,916
But I'm fairly certain that
Sana is trapped inside.

385
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,791
[BOTH gasp]

386
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,041
What's more--

387
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,666
it appears that she's
not alone inside there.

388
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,583
Someone else is with her.

389
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,500
I'm about to enter into
Wonderland myself. I'd--

390
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,458
[ZOROKU] In that case,
I'm coming with you.

391
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,958
[ICHIJO]
You don't understand!

392
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,166
Wonderland is expanding.
It's very dangerous right now.

393
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,541
[ZOROKU]
All the more reason I should go.

394
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,500
My granddaughter's trapped
someplace, and is in danger.

395
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,375
It's my job to go after her and
bring her back home safely.

396
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,625
[gasping]

00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,583
[SANA]
Is anybody out there? Help!

401
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,583
[gasps]

402
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,500
Not such a big,
scary grownup now.

403
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,500
[SANA]
You shut up!

404
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm stuck in here.
It won't open.

405
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,958
[HATORI]
Asking for my help?

406
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,375
I shouldn't need it.

407
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,375
Just thinking about getting out
of here would normally

408
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,583
be enough for me. I'm serious!

409
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,833
It works. Well, usually.

410

[HATORI]
This girl sure is stubborn.

414
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,541
Why doesn't she
just ask me for help?

415
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,666
And I wonder what
she'd do if I gave it.

416

[HATORI screams]

418

[HATORI]
That was easier than I expected.

419
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,875
I've never been that strong--
not nearly as strong as Ayu.

420
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,125
Is she just really weak?

421
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,375
[HATORI]
Hey. Do you know where we are?

422
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,583
I know you don't like me,

423
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,833
but I really need
to get back home.

424
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,916
You've shown me how powerful you
are and proven you can beat me.

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,125
I'll apologize,
if you want me to.

426
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,958
Just please, let me go home.

427
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,583
[SANA]
Yeah, see, well...

428
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,708
[SANA] The thing is,
I'm not sure, but...

430
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:12,708
