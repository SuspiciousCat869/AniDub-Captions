she became an evil witch.

[SANAE] Your friends

so they wanted to wait here

Yeah, well...

I'll go ahead and start cooking.

00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,125
Yeah. I'm feeling
a lot better now.

No. Why would you think
we'd be fighting?

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,291
Well, we're not. I swear!

164
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,333
And I haven't used
my power, either.

00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,333
Mm-hm! Yeah, I ate plenty.

166
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,458
And don't worry, I'll brush
my teeth before bed!

Oh, whatever.

[ASAHI sighs]
You know, uh, it's late.

173
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,541
We should quiet down.
Get some sleep, maybe.

174
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,833
The whole point of a slumber
party is to have fun.

But we could get in trouble!

It's strange not being able

I was terrified.

It was so awful,
what she did to everyone.

She's been at it a while.
Most of the day, I think.

[NAITO] This is the girl
we're here to see.

326
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,208
Hatori Shikishima,
age nine, in third grade.

327
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,666
She's an only child
living with both parents.

328
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,416
The security cameras made
it easy to identify her,

329
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,250
but it's still hard to believe.

330
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:35,916
[HATORI'S MOM]
Yes?

331
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
[BOTH]
Uh!

332
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,000
This is Yamada.
We spoke on the phone.

333
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,375
[HATORI'S MOM]
We did?

334
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:45,500
Uh! I'm sorry, are you
Hatori Shikishima's mother?

335
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,208
I'd like to speak with
you about something

336
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,291
concerning your daughter
if you have a moment.

337
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,000
[HATORI gasps]

338
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,375
[NORIKO]
Is Hatori home?

339
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,708
Maybe we can talk to you both.

340
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,916
[NORIKO]
Um, hello?

341
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,166
[HATORI'S MOM]
What's this about?

342
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,958
Is my daughter in
trouble or something?

343
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,041
No, ma'am.

344
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,083
We just wanted to talk.

345
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,416
[NAITO] Well, glad we
got that taken care of.

346
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,250
I guess it's time to head back.

347
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:16,875
Let's go.

348
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,166
Uh! Wait.

349
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,875
What did we get "taken care of"?

350
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:25,375
Uh. You know, it was
that thing we had to do.

351
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,833
Yeah, right, that thing.

352
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,416
Let's get some food.
I'm starvin', here.

353
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,750
[NORIKO] Fine. But I don't
want beef bowls again.

354
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,666
Really, would it kill you to let
me choose where we eat for once?

355
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,583
It's only fair.

356
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,416
[NAITO]
Yeah, sure, whatever.

357
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,625
[NORIKO yelps]

358
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,833
[NAITO grunts]

359
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,000
Aw... Give a girl some
warning, would you?

360
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,250
Why'd ya stop like that?

361
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,083
[NAITO grunts]

362
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,458
[NORIKO]
Ah...

363
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,416
This is the fifth time. Damn.

364
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,166
Hey, I think we've
been had, Yamada.

365
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,500
Huh?

366
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:57,750
[gasps]

367
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,916
That girl's really something.

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,458
She got us good.

369
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,916
The only people who can
get inside that house

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,666
are the ones she allows.
She's the gatekeeper.

371
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,875
The power to control others.

372
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,333
So it's really true, then.

373
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,875
If she'd only
let us talk to her,

374
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,541
we might be able
to help her out.

375
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,791
And this girl's
going to need help.

376
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,125
With that kinda power,

377
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,541
there's no way she can get
through this on her own.

378
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,708
[AYUMU]
Who was that girl the other day?

379
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,666
The magic she used
looked just like Hatori's.

380
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,708
[inaudible]

381
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,708
[AYUMU] If I can find her and
convince her to talk to me,

382
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,625
maybe she can help.

383
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,791
[AYUMU] Hatori's magic had
never been broken before,

384
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,750
but somehow that
girl managed it.

385
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,750
Where did this power come from?

386
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:58,958
Will she ever be rid of it?
If I could only find that girl.

387
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,291
I'm sorry, Ayu, I really am.

388
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,291
But please don't
ever come back here.

389
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,833
You're kidding me!

390
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,333
It has to be this way.

391
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,875
If you came back,
I might end up hurting you.

392
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,041
[AYUMU]
I don't believe that!

393
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,416
You would never hurt me!

394
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,708
I trust you, Hatori.
I'm not afraid!

395
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,958
[HATORI]
Don't you see? I'm like a bear.

396
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,166
A bear?

397
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,666
If a bear leaves its home--

398
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,291
if it attacks somebody--then
it can never be returned

399
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,083
to the mountains
where it belongs.

400
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,583
The bear has to be killed.

401
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,166
When I was little, I thought it
was cruel to punish an animal

402
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,750
just for doing what
was in its nature.

403
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,541
But now I understand.

404
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,916
You see? The same
is true for me.

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,708
I can't be among people anymore.

406
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,166
I'm sorry. I really am.

407
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,291
But don't come back.

408
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,458
[AYUMU grunts]

409

lookin' for a foreign girl?

much of a description.

413
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,083

Maybe this was a stupid idea.

417
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,000
Tons of people live around here,

418
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,958
and it's not like I can
ask for her by name.

something new today.

used her power like that.
