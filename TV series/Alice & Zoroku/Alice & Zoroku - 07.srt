00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,833
You should
eat before it gets cold.

327
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,583
[SANA growls]

328
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,000
[ASAHI]
Uh... Okay...

329
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,166
[YONAGA]
I guess...

330
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,333
This is tasty!

331
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,916
Super tasty!

332
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,958
[SANA]
So good, right?

333
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,333
[ASAHI]
Yeah, it's delicious!

334
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,458
[YONAGA]
Mm-hm!

335
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,708
[TWINS gasp]

336
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,291
[ICHIJO]
Hmm.

337
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,916
[YONAGA]
Um... Hey, Sana?

338
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,208
[SANA]
Ah?

339
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,833
Well, it's just. your hair.
I see you cut it.

340
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,208
Oh. Yeah.

341
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,166
It's so short, at first
I didn't even recognize you.

342
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,333
But I think it looks good.

343
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,875
Really good.

344
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,708
[SANA chuckles]
Maybe you should get a bob, too.

345
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,333
[ASAHI]
Um, get a what?

346
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,916
What's a bob?

347
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,416
So they were being held captive
by the same people who had Sana?

348
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,458
That's right.

349
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,333
[ZOROKU]
Hmm?

350
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,250
[ASAHI]
Errors?

351
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,583
[SANA]
Yeah.

352
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,750
Sometimes my power just
activates itself randomly,

353
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,625
like it did earlier.

354
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,041
It doesn't always produce
something when it happens,

355
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,416
but when it does,
I never know what it'll be.

356
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,750
So it's dangerous.

357
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,333
That sounds like
something you should probably

358
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,458
get checked out
sooner than later.

359
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,291
[SANA] Ichijo's looking into it,
but she hasn't had any luck.

360
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,375
[YONAGA]
Hey, um... Sana?

361
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,708
[SANA]
Huh?

362
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,083
[YONAGA] We wanna say sorry
about earlier today.

363
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,583
For running away.

364
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,833
The truth is...

365
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,250
...since everything
that's happened,

366
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,291
we've really missed you.

367
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,166
[YONAGA] More than anything, we
wanted to tell you we're sorry.

368
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,541
You're sorry? But what for?

369
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,958
[ASAHI]
The thing is...

370
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,750
...before we came
to the facility,

371
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,000
some pretty awful stuff
happened to us.

372
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,500
[ASAHI]
We were scared.

373
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,500
That's why we didn't want you
going out into the world.

374
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,750
They've had a rough life.

375
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,416
Those girls were in
police custody before

376
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
the research facility
took them in.

377
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,958
Why the police?

378
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,791
They were being
abused by their father.

379
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,000
It was horrific.

380
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,083
[ZOROKU]
Hmm...

381
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,625
[YONAGA pants]

382
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,375
[ASAHI whimpers]

383
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,000
Get away from her right now!

384
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,583
I mean it!

385
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,708
[thud]

386
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,958
[ICHIJO] Back then,
their thoughts and feelings

387
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,750
were so completely intertwined,

388
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,166
they had trouble telling
themselves apart.

389
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,500
Take a good look.

390
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,500
Starting today, this is going to
be your new home.

391
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,083
Pretty big place, isn't it?
The air's nice, too.

392
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,000
Unfortunately, I can't let you
go outside whenever you want to,

393
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,875
but you'll have lots of
studying to do,

394
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,625
And somewhere to play.
I think you'll like it.

395
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,208
Where would you like to sleep?

396
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,625
We can give you
separate rooms if you want.

397
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,166
[TWINS]
We want to stay together.

398
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,625
[laughs]
Got it.

399
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,500
You're in perfect sync, huh?

400
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,583
That reminds me.
You'll need these.

401
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,875
I'm sorry, but it's very
difficult to tell you apart,

402
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,208
so could you remind me
who is who, again?

403
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,541
I want to make sure
I give you the right ID cards.

404
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:35,208
Tell me, which of you is older
and which is younger?

405
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,625
[TWINS]
Hmm.

406
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,833
[KITO]
Hmm?

407
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,000
[ASAH] All right, then.
Looks like I'm the older sister.

408
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,500
[YONAGA] Oh. That makes
me the younger one, then.

409
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,958
So, my name's Yonaga. Right?

410
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,375
[ASAHI]
That was our new life.

411
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,791
Never leaving the facility,
living there together,

412
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,166
just the two of us.

413
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,958
But then things changed.

414
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,291
[YONAGA]
Because, one day, we met you.

415
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,708
We played with you,
and it was fun.

416
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,083
We gave you a name, and taught
you most of what we knew.

417
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,625
But not all.

418
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,916
We never told you there was
a world outside the facility.

419
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,541
That's why we're sorry.

420
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,916
[ASAHI]
We did a terrible thing to you.

421
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,583
You deserved to know more.

422
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,958
It wasn't as if
you were our doll.

423
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,916
[YONAGA]
But then you left anyway.

424
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,375
And just like that, our world
was turned upside down.

425
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,541
We never thought everything we
had could disappear so quickly.

426
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,166
But in the blink of an eye,
it was gone.

427
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,458
[ASAHI]
Things are different now.

428
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,250
We've started going to
this American school

429
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,000
that's in Yokosuka.

430
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,083
All of us from the research
facility have been placed

431
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,375
in new homes.

432
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:56,041
[ASAHI] Ours has a really nice
dorm mother, so that's good.

433
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,333
The language is still
a bit difficult for us,

434
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,583
but we're making friends.
We've even joined clubs.

435
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,875
That's right.
I'm in the badminton club,

436
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,500
and Asahi joined the art club.

437
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,166
[SANA]
Is going to school a lot of fun?

438
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,416
[ASAHI]
Yeah, I guess so.

439
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,958
We're always doing new things,
so that's cool.

440
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,166
[SANA]
Okay, good.

441
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,375
I was worried it would
be dumb and boring.

442
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,375
[YONAGA]
Hey, Sana.

443
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,375
I know a lot has happened,
and things have changed.

444
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,208
But you were the first
real friend we had.

445
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,125
That won't change. Not ever.

446
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,000
[ASAHI]
We're very sorry, Sana.

447
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,291
For everything.

448
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,541
Please forgive us.

449
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,500
[SANA]
Sure!

450
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,166
[ZOROKU]
Hmm.

451
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,000
[SANA]
Okay, we've made up now!

452
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,375
[TWINS]
Hey, hold on!

453
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,583
[SANAE]
Oh, really? That's so nice!

454
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,458
What else did the three
of you talk about?

455
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,875
All different stuff.

456
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,250
Apparently, they've both
joined clubs at their school.

457
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,041
[SANAE]
Yeah, I know.

458
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,041
You already told me that, silly.

459
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,500
[SANA]
Mm. Oh, right.

460
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,750
I did, huh?

461
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,750
Sorry, it's all kind of
a blur right now.

462
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,375
[SANAE]
You must've been really happy.

463
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,750
[SANA]
Yeah, I guess so.

464
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,041
[SANAE]
I'm glad.

465
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,125
It's great you got to see
your friends again.

466
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,208
[SANA]
Hmm...

467
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,666
[SANA groans]

468
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,791
[SANA sobbing]

469
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,875
[SANAE]
Hmm?

470
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,500
[SANA whimpers]

471
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,583
[SANAE]
Are you okay?

472
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,458
[SANA sobs]

473
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,583
[SANAE]
Ah...

474
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,791
[SANA]
Sanae!

475
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,708
[SANAE]
Oh, Sana! What's wrong?

476
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,666
[SANAE]
You wanna talk?

477
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,333
[SANA] It's just--
Suddenly, I feel like

478
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,083
I don't understand anything.

479
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,708
[SANAE]
Yeah, that's rough.

480
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,416
You know, back
when I was little,

481
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,166
sometimes I'd suddenly
get really sad

482
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,375
in the middle of the night,

483
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,833
so I'd go and crawl
into Grandpa's futon.

484
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,750
[SANA] The thing is...
I'm not sad or anything.

485
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,166
'Least I don't think.

486
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,791
[SANAE]
Well, that's good.

487
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,083
Earlier, you were so happy
after talking to your friends.

488
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,083
[SANA]
It's hard to explain.

489
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,791
Since I left the research
facility, I felt so weird,

490
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,125
almost like I'm not
myself anymore.

491
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,958
[SANA]
I'm frazzled all the time.

492
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,000
Like somewhere inside,
there's this confused person

493
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,041
who isn't me but
still kind of is.

494
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,625
And that other person
is taking over,

495
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,666
erasing everything I thought
I knew and replacing it

496
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,208
with things that are
fuzzy and unclear.

497
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,250
I want to make it stop,
but I don't know how.

498
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,375
[SANAE]
Hmm.

499
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,000
[SANA]
It was like that today.

500
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,333
The moment I saw the twins,
I felt frazzled,

501
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,791
and I couldn't think
about anything else.

502
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,833
When that happens, I snap
and lose control of myself.

503
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,166
Even my power is acting weird.

504
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,375
[SANA] The outside world
is doing this to me.

505
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,916
I don't know if I can take it!

506
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,541
[SANAE]
I see.

507
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,375
You're starting to understand a
lot of things, little by little,

508
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,875
and that's hard to take in.

509
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,250
[SANA] Hold on. What
are you talking about?

510
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,666
I just told you I don't
understand anything.

511
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,083
[SANAE]
Yeah, I know.

512
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,125
But maybe what you have
to understand is that it's okay

513
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,166
for you not to understand stuff.

514
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,375
[SANA]
Huh?

515
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,333
[SANAE]
Frazzle, frazzle!

516
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,916
[SANA] Hey! Stop that!
What are you doing?

517
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,166
Quit it!

518
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,250
[SANAE]
I love you a whole lot, Sana.

519
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,625
You understand that, don't you?

520
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,916
[SANA]
Get off! And stop teasing me!

521
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,333
I'm serious about
being frazzled!

522
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,125
It's the worst feeling ever.

523
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,541
[SANAE]
I'll tell you what.

524
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,375
I know you're upset,
but it's late.

525
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,875
So why don't you come
and stay in my room

526
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,083
for the rest of the night?

527
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,541
[SANA]
I can do that?

528
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,041
[SANAE]
We'll talk more if you want.

529
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,333
You can tell me all about
how frazzled you feel,

530
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,125
and I'll help you if I can.

531
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,625
[ASAHI]
Good morning, Yonaga.

532
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,625
[YONAGA] Morning, Sis.
Guess it's time to get up.

533
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,000
--[ASAHI]
--[YONAGA] Hey!

534
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,041
Take a look at this!
We received an email from Sana!

535
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,333
[ASAHI]
Huh?!

536
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,333
[YONAGA] You must be
pretty relieved, huh, Sis?

537
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,583
[ASAHI]
What? What do you mean?

538
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,291
You were the one who
was worried about her!

539
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,250
[YONAGA]
So were you, and you know it.

540
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,583
[SANA] Is it done?
Did you send the email?

541
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,458
[SANAE] Sure did.
Do you still feel frazzled?

542
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,833
[SANA]
Mm... Let me see.

543
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,916
I think maybe not
so much anymore.

544
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,208
Good, I'm glad.

545
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,708
[laughs]

546
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,208
[SANA] "Sorry I left
the research facility.

547
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,916
You two are my friends."

548
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,583
[SANA] "Let's play together
again. Sana Kashimura."

549
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,625
[SANA]
"The Evil Witch."
