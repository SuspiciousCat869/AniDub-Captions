[HERSCHEL]
Looking good so far.

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,833
I'm not seeing any
hemorrhaging or ischemia.

3
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,291
There haven't been any major
changes in red blood cells,

4
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,791
white blood cells,
or hematocrit either.

However, your pulse
is on the rapid side.

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,041
Are you under any sort of stress
that I should know about?

7
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,583
No, not really.

8
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,125
[HERSCHEL] Are you starting
to get tired of all these exams?

9
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,791
Most people do.

10
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,791
[MINNIE] No. My husband
always enjoyed exams, too.

11
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,583
I think he got a kick out of
all the different machines.

12
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,541
[HERSCHEL]
Heh. Good, I'm glad to hear it.

13
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,541
Okay, next up we'll--

14

[cell phone vibrates]

15
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,708
[HERSCHEL]
Excuse me.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
[HERSCHEL]
We'll finish up another time.

17
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,750
[MINNIE]
Hmm?

18
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,833
Kito wants to see you,
so we'll cut this short.

19
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,166

[MALE DRIVER B]
Is something wrong?

22
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,750
[MINNIE] No. I was just
thinking of how beautiful

23
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,541
Mount Fuji looks.

24
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,958
[MALE DRIVER B]
Ah. Yes, it does.

25
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,166
It reminds me of
the first day I came here.

26
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,916
[KITO] You know,
I confess I was worried

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,791
when I learned you were coming.

28
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,041
A former second lieutenant
for the US Marine Corps

29
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,583
sounded intimidating.

30
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,000
You're not as scary
as I imagined, though.

31
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,291
You seem like a nice
woman, Ms. Tachibana.

32
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,916
I'm glad they sent you.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,791
No need to be formal,
you can call me Minnie C.

34
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,875
That's what my husband
always used to call me,

35
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,791
and it's the name
I prefer to go by now.

36
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,000
[KITO]
Then that's the one I'll use.

37
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,875
So, Minnie C.
You look wonderful in a kimono.

38
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,208
Are you a frequent
visitor of Japan?

39
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,583
I'm not.

40
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,583
But I still remember the
first time I saw Mount Fuji,

41
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,833
flying over it on our honeymoon.
My husband was so excited!

42
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,291
Was he?

43
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,625
He loved Japanese culture--

44
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,833
was fascinated by
every aspect of it.

45
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,291
When I wear a kimono,
it's almost like

46
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,541
I can feel him
beside me again.

47
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,333

Here. Drink up.

50
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,875
Wow, this is really good.

51
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,166
I want more.

52
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,250
Then I'll go buy another.

53
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,166
But first, maybe
we can chat a bit.

54
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,458
Okay, Sana?

55
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,166
[SANA]
Hmm? Do I know you?

56
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,541
Are you the lady who
talked to me at the facility?

57
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,958
No, I'm not.

58
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,875
But you and I have run
into one another recently.

59
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,375
You don't remember?

00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,833
[SANA]
Uh...

61
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,541
[MAN A]
Pardon me.

62
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,125
We were sent here for the pigs.

63
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,083
[ICHIRO]
Great. They're right over there.

64
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,500
[SANA] What are those men going
to do with the pigs?

65
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,125
They'll be taken
to a special facility,

66
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,875
where they'll be looked after.

67
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,333
The people there will probably
do a few tests on them,

68
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,416
but the animals
won't be harmed at all.

69
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,666
They'll be studied...?

70
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,833
Yeah.

71
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,666
You realize these
are no ordinary pigs,

72
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,958
since they were created
using your power?

73
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,333
You know about me,
about what I can do?

74
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,416
[ICHIJO]
Yes.

75
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,458
[SANAE]
Hmm?

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,291
I created this,
but where'd it come from?

[ICHIJO]
Huh?

78
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,541
This pig is alive because
I willed it to be.

79
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,000
What would happen if I
used my power to get rid of it?

80
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,583
Where would it go?

00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,041
[SANAE sighs]

82
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,583
Do you want
to get rid of it like that?

83
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,833

Right, I'd like to get nine
of those if possible.

Great. I'll send my assistants
over to get them now.

00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,833
So, what, those like
vases or something?

Yeah. Hey, Chinatsu, Ichiro!

Coming.

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,250
Huh, I guess I never realized

98
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,333
those were
provided by the florist.

00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,625
Can't you use something else?
That you've got in stock?

100

When a customer orders,
they specify what they want.

I can't just change
things around.

Yeah? What's up, boss?

103

to Sakaki's place in Kokubunji

and pick up some last-minute
items I ordered.

No problem.

of those pigs, okay?

00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,750
Slowly, so far.

This ability-user
has a complex signal.

112
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,333
She has a name.

113
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,375
Ah?

114
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,958
[ICHIJO]
We should call her by name.

115
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,125
It's Sana.

116
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,541
Heh. Roger that.

117
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,791
I'll keep analyzing
Sana's pattern, then.

118
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,708
[MAN B] Y'know,
I never realized it before,

on purpose isn't the issue here.

for you to manage?! Huh?!

to do anything wrong

didn't mean any harm by it,

she is still responsible.

Hey, I'm not
done talking to her!

161
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,625
Come on, let it go, Roku.

162
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,000
Now, listen carefully.

163
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,750
There are some people
who're after those bad guys

164
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,500
who were holding you prisoner,
and I'm one of them.

165
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,416
So that means I'm on your side.

166
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,333
Now, part of our job
is also making sure that

nothing bad happens to you.

168
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,250
So there's a little favor
I need to ask, okay?

169
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,708
Um, okay.

170
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,875
The thing is, we don't know
when those guys might try

171
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,833
to take you back to
the scary place again.

172

So to be sure we always
know where you are,

we'd like for you
to wear a tracking device.

You seem like you're
a nice enough guy, I guess.

Fine, I'll wear it.

I'm a nice enough guy, huh?

to me when we met.

I can send someone

We can do that.

you moving so quickly.

she'll be joining our group.

Okay. I don't like her.

I think she's very nice.

She's always smiling, isn't she?

219
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,750
If someone
is smiling all the time,

00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,625
how is it different
than never smiling?

Huh. Very perceptive.
I'm impressed.

222
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,333
[KITO]
So, it happened in Iraq?

That's correct, he died
while defusing a bomb.

224
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,625
She was grief-stricken
after her husband's loss

225
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,416
and suffered from
terrible insomnia.

226
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,083
She was on the verge
of being discharged.

227
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,708
Then something changed.

228
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,625
She had a dream of being
embraced by her husband's arms,

229
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,208
and her condition
stabilized immediately.

at which she became

Yes, precisely.

be an intriguing sample

Now, now, take it easy.
I know it wouldn't be simple.

You'd have to make all
kinds of arrangements,

and new bedding.

do you want from me?

arrange for bodyguards

What this girl really
needs is a family.

A warm home where she
can eat plenty of food

and sleep safely at night.

291
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,875
She's never known that
kind of ordinary happiness.

deserves the chance?

get so sentimental?

for me, will you?

00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,125
And you will die.

477
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,791
Is that clear enough?

478
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,583
[JOE] Until I met you,
dying wasn't something

479
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:07,541
I'd ever been afraid of.
It's different now.

480
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,250
[MINNIE] If it meant
seeing his face again.

481
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,666
I would do absolutely anything.

482
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,125
[MINNIE]
Remember that, Red Queen.

483
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,416
[SANA]
"Something Not Human."
