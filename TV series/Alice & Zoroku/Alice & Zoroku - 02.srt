someone's tummy growl

00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,416
while they were eating before!

164
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,916
[SANA] So, are you really
Zoroku's granddaughter?

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,250
I sure am.

166

[SANA]
You're nothing like him.

Oh, you don't think so?

Hmm... Let's see, maybe...

you understand?"

Nice try.

Hey, Sanae, are there any left?

172
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,625

Okay, wait just a bit.

00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,583

I was so hungry
I forgot making food

that way doesn't work.
It's too inefficient.

Yeah, sure! "Night."

I take care of breakfast,

[SANAE] That one doesn't
open up until the sun goes down.

lighting is kinda dark.

like the other place.

All the other people acted nice,

Who do you mean?

236
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,333
The people
at the research facility.

237
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,875
[SANA]
The earliest memories I have

238
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,333
are of the research facility.

239
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,541
I may have come
from someplace else,

240
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,500
but if so, I don't remember it.

241
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,541
[SANA]
One day, I was simply there.

242
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,666
[SANA]
The first thing I knew was

243
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,833
the gnawing pain of hunger.

244
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,458
[SANA]
They gave me food, and I ate it.

245
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,791
[SANA] They poked
and prodded at me

246
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,083
with metal instruments,
and I let them.

247
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,500
[muffled]
Now, face the other way.

248
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,625
[SANA]
I didn't understand language,

249
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,833
but that didn't matter,
because I didn't need it.

250
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,791
I could merge into other
people's consciousness

251
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,541
and become one with them.

252
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,375
[SANA] The line between
myself and others was blurry,

253
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,291
a vague boundary that
I couldn't fully grasp.

254
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,708
But then one day,

255
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,875
two people who looked
identical appeared.

256
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,041
[SANA] At first, I tried
to become one with them,

257
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,583
as I usually did.

258
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,125
[TWINS]
You can't.

259
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,750
[TWINS] You are not us.
We are separate beings.

260
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,458
Because I am me.

261
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,958
And you are you.

262
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,333
[SANA]
Because... I am me...

263
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,041
[SANA] That was when I
learned what language was.

264
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,791
Because for the first time,
I needed it.

265
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,791
And you... are you...

266
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,125
[TWINS]
Yes.

267
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,541
There is a boundary
between yourself and others.

268
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,708
Now that you know,
you'll learn to recognize it.

269
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,125
I am Yonaga Hinagiri.
I am the younger twin.

270
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,625
And I'm Asahi Hinagiri,
the older twin.

271
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,708
[TWINS]
What is your name?

272
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,375
I don't know.

273
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,666
[ASAHI] All right, then we'll
just have to give you a name.

274
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,458
[YONAGA] Don't worry,
we'll think of something good.

275
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,750
I think I have an idea.

276
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,958
Because the
Red Queen loves fish...

277
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,916
...your name will now be Sana.

278
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,416
[SANA]
Sana...

279
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,375
[SANA]
That's how I got my name.

280
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,625
How I became Sana.

281
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,125
I learned many things
from the twins.

282
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,791
They dressed me in cute clothes,

283
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,875
and taught me the intricacies
of language and math.

284
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,916
They sang songs for me, and
showed me storybooks and poems.

285
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,875
[SANA] I was happy
in the wonderful world

286
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,708
the twins and I shared.

287
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,958
[SANA]
But then, I saw it...

288
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,166
Huh...?

289
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,708
[SANA] It was underground, far
beneath the research facility.

290
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,583
[SANA] What they did
to that person down there.

291
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,000
They turned them
into something inhuman.

292
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,458
I was scared. So scared.

293
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,833
And then, I ran
from the facility.

294
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,166
Except, the outside
world was scary, too.

295
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,208
I didn't know anything...

296
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,333
I was so lost...

297
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,500

298
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,541
[SANA]
Uh...

299
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,208
[SANAE]
You're right, Sana.

300
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,333
The world can be a truly
scary place sometimes.

301
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,333
We really are alike, you and I.

302
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,833
Our names?

303
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,750
[SANAE]
It's okay. It'll be okay.

304
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,791
[ICHIJO]
Be more careful, Naito.

305
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,916
You're making a mess.

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,791
[NAITO]
So what if I am?

307
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,500
I'm starving here.

308
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,125
[ICHIJO] Well, at least try
not to get it on the seats.

309
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,916
I'm the one who'll hear
about it from the director

310
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,291
if they get stained.

311
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,708
[NAITO] Man, are you always
this uptight, Ichijo?

312
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,166
How old are you, anyway, 80?

313
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,375
[ICHIJO]
I'm 26.

314
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,125
Oh, really? That young, huh?

315
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,000
You had better
not be hitting on me.

316
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,416
[NAITO]
Of course not!

317
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,166
My point was, you're probably
too young to know

anything about <i>takenoko</i> - <i>zoku</i> .

319
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,458
The dance groups that
were popular a few decades ago?

320
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:51,041
Yeah. Buncha kids
dancing on the sidewalk.

321
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:55,583
Well, back then, I was still the
low man on the totem pole.

322
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,375
On weekends,
I got stuck working security

323
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,416
in pedestrian-only zones.

324
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,208
And one day, I saw
this grown man arguing with

325
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,166
a group of dancers, shouting
something about how

326
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,958
he "hated crooked stuff."

327
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,125
I thought to myself,
"This guy might be crazy,

328
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,583
but he's a lot less annoying
than those kids are."

329
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,958
Yeah?

330
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,625
[NAITO] Somehow or another
we got to talking.

331
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,625
That was 30 years ago, and
we've been buddies ever since.

332
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,375
Though I haven't seen him
in the last five years.

333
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,708
Well, this is a first.

334
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,291
I've never heard you talk
about a friend before.

335
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,750
'Least I don't think so.

336
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,750
It sounds like the two of
you must be pretty close.

337
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,708
Nah, not at all.

338
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,875
He's an uptight, stubborn
old stick in the mud.

339
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,083
We couldn't be more
different if we tried!

340
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,208
Hey, look at this.

341
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,000
It's the homepage
for his company.

342
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,750
He's a "flower coordinator."
Fancy, huh?

343
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,708
[ICHIJO] Sounds to me
like you really are close.

[SANA sighs]
That was great, thank you!

345
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,750
Hey, I know.
Let's go to the facility!

346
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,333
What?

347
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,958
I've got plenty of energy now
after eating all those pancakes.

348
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,958
Let's go and destroy it!

00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,125
Believe it! Just pack up
some food and come with me.

352
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,791
Oh, yeah. Where
is Zoroku, anyway?

353
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,208
I think he's
at his shop, working.

354
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,125
Oh, right. His shop.
I knew that!

355
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,541
[SANAE] Wow. Some sleep
and a million pancakes,

356
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,708
and she's bouncing
off the walls.

Nothing.

Sana. Do you think
you can wait for a bit?

360
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,416
I just need to clean up.

361
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,333
Nope. Let's go get him.
