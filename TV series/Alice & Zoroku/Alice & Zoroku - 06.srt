Huh? What is?

165
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,125
[ZOROKU]
Careful not to trip on it.

00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,375
[SANA]
Uh...

167
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,666
Maybe you should
think about getting a haircut.

168
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,958
Uh...

169
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,791
[CHINATSU]
Sana! It's frozen over.

00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,208
Come and look, there's ice.

171

Ooh, really?

Okay!

00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,625
[ZOROKU]
Finished.

00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,666
It's so beautiful
I could almost cry!

176
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,166
There are so many flowers!

177
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,666
[ZOROKU]
Hmm?

178
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,916
Hey, what're these called?

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,916
[ZOROKU]
They're lilies.

--These are, too?
--[ZOROKU] Yeah.

--And these, right?
--[ZOROKU] That's right.

00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,083
I'll go outside with her
to help clean up, cool?

184
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,708
Good. Thank you.

185
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,500
[CHINATSU]
Hey, Sana! Wait for me.

186
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,250
How's it going, Kashimura?

187
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,291
Coming along?

188
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,041
We just finished
setting the room up.

Do you see any changes
you'd like to make?

Wow, it's fantastic!

Everything's so pretty!

[SAWAKI chuckles]

[gasps]

194
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,125
[ZOROKU] Your fiancée
seems to be awfully young.

195
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,166
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

196
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,666
What about you, Kashimura?

197
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,833
I didn't know you had such a
young granddaughter.

198
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,250
Yeah, well, that's
a long story, too.

199
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,041
[CHIKA]
Oh, how pretty!

200
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,583
Hey, what are you doing?

201
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:48,875
Me? Well, I'm having
my engagement party here.

202
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,500
An engagement?

203
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,250
That's a promise to get married!
I learned that today.

204
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,541
[CHIKA giggles]

205
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,208
But what's
"getting married" mean?

206
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,458
Huh? That's sort of
a tough question.

207
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:04,708
Let's see here.
What is marriage?

208
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,666
It's when you and
someone you love become family.

209
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,458
[SANA]
Oh...

210
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,208
Ah! What am I saying?

211
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,958
That's so embarrassing!

212
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,250
Are you okay?

213
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,500
Come on, Sana. It's time to go.

214
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,083
--[SANA] Mm!
--Is he your grandpa?

215

Uh-huh! You can tell 'cause
he's really, really old!

216
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,541
Well, bye!

[SANA] One, two, three,
four, five, one hundred!

00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,666
Why not wait until
I'm finished washing?

219
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,208
We can chat.

220
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,375
[SANA groans]

221
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,750
So, how was work today?

222
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,291
--We set up for a fancy party.
--Fun!

223
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,416
And I learned what
getting engaged means.

224
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,791
It's when people make
a promise to get married.

225
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,041
You're learning so much, Sana!

226
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,000
[SANA]
Hmph! That's not all!

227
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,083
Getting married means
you and someone you love

228
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,500
become, uh, family!

229
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,833
[SANAE giggles]
Wow!

230
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,916
What's a "family," though?

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,166
[SANAE]
Uh...

232
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,666
[giggles]

233
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,958
[SANA yelps]

234
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,333
That's an easy one to answer.

235
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,125
You're my family, Sana!

236
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,250
[SANA]
Hey, get off!

237
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,041
Got it.

238
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,375
This family thing's confusing.

239
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,458
Sanae says she's my family.
That's good to know.

240
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,583
What about Zoroku?
Is he my family, too?

241
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,833
And what exactly is family?

242
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,625
Now I'm all frazzled!

243
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,291
[ZOROKU]
Hmm...

244
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,416
[SANAE]
What?!

245
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,083
You're not really going to
cut your hair, are you?

246
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,416
[SANA]
Yeah.

247
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,708
It's so long she trips
over it five times a day.

248
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,333
Aw, man, I look forward
to doing it every morning.

249
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,833
It's one of the
best parts of my day.

250
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,791
Don't worry.
It won't be forever.

251
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,041
Hair grows fast,
just like weeds.

252
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,750
When it grows back,
you can do it again.

253
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,708
Oh! Yeah? Really?

254
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,583
You'll see,
it'll grow back in no time!

00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,083
Hooray!

256
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,041
So, where will she get it cut?

257
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,333
You aren't going to
do it for her, are you?

258
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,875
[ZOROKU]
No.

259
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,625
[SANA]
Huh? He can't cut it?

260
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,625
A florist only cuts flowers.

261
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,208
If you need somebody
to cut your hair,

262
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,875
you have to go to a beautician.

263
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,416
[ZOROKU]
Don't be snarky.

264
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,583
[SANAE]
Mm!

00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,458
Where do we find a beautician?

What is that?!

00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,291
It's a beauty salon.

[ZOROKU] How long will
the appointment take?

278
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,916
[STYLIST A]
Since she's just getting a cut

279

and not doing any color,

280
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,666
I don't think it should
take more than an hour.

to leave for a bit.

Hmm. Nothing much.

Let's talk style.

going with a bob.

exactly easy, either.

Yeah. Thanks a lot.

thanking you, though.
