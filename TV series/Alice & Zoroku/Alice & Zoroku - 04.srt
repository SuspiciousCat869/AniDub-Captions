00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,125
[NAITO]
I'm sorry. I was careless.

00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,333
I had our people watching your
house and the surrounding area,

3
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,125
but it was stupid of me not to
make certain that

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,416
this place was secure, too.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,041
I mean, it's not
like I expected them

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,250
to take her while she
was in the bathroom.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,833
But I should have
been more careful.

8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,333
My fault...

00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm the one who brought Sana
here and put her in danger.

[NAITO]
Don't say that. It's okay.

This isn't your fault, I swear.

12

Ichijo and our colleague Yamada
are on their trail right now.

They'll find her
before too long.

You're sure? Really?

15

Calm down. Panicking won't help.

He's right about that.

00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,416
She should be safe enough.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,583
She's valuable to
the people who took her.

22
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,208
I don't think they'll
be quick to harm her.

But you don't know.

Yes. We can leave the rest

I have to admit,
I expected much more from you.

You once commanded the
principles of space itself.

57

If this is all you can do
in the outside world,

58
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,500
you truly are no
more than a child.

00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,375
[MINNIE] You managed to
obtain a body, learn language,

and acquire emotions.

00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,625
Then you fled the facility
for the outside world,

where you could
pretend to be human.

And yet, do you see how easily I
was able to render you helpless?

Pretend to be human?

you're a real human girl?

[ZOROKU] Will you tell me
why they want her so badly?

72
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,041
I called you because
she was obviously being

73
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,000
mistreated at
this facility place,

74
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,833
and I thought that you'd
be able to help her.

75
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,750
But now, it's clear that
something big is going on here

Gotcha, I'm only kidding.

Think of it as something
of a territorial dispute.

81
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,666
There are two officials high-up
in the government who have

82
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,500
differing opinions
on a particular matter.

83
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,541
I work for one of them, so I was
sent in my official capacity.

00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,833
I know you're
not telling me everything.

Like who the girl
actually is, for example.

I'm not sure you'll
believe me when I tell you.

88
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,916
But you see, the fact is,
in all likelihood--

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,541
Sana's not a little girl, or
even human for that matter.

You're not human.

93
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,166
In fact, 13 years ago,

94
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,958
when you first appeared
beneath the research facility,

95
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,166
you couldn't even be
considered a living thing.

You were just an
unknown entity absorbing

00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,125
the thoughts and reactions of
the living beings around you.

99
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,666
You took what you read in others
and turned it into reality.

100
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,250
Everything you seem
to be now--your appearance,

101
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,208
your ego, your
emotions, your speech--

102
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,500
Those were all cards that an
ownerless Mirror Gate

103
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,291
created by copying
them from humans.

Have you forgotten that?

105
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,250
[SANA]
That's a lie!

I'm Sana. I'm real!

[MINNIE] Do you see now
why you must not leave

108
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,291
the research facility?

109
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,541
You can't live in the outside
world with real people.

110
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,041
It's better for
everybody involved this way.

111
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,708
Wonderland is the
only place you belong.

112
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,791
Now, quiet down.
It's time to take you back home.

113
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,875
[NAITO] Sana and the others
who have similar powers

114
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,083
are referred to as
Dreams of Alice.

115
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,000
We have reason to believe
that, before long,

116
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,958
many more people will
have abilities like theirs.

Hmm...

[NAITO] This might
all sound like something

119
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,833
out of a storybook,
but the ethical challenges

120
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,291
it poses are real.

121
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,333
We may have to reconsider
our definition of humanity.

122
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,958
Can our society learn
to accept beings like her,

123
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,916
who possess near infinite power?

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,291
That's a question
we'll be faced with soon.

125
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,458
The people I work with believe
such acceptance is possible.

126
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,500
However, those on
the other side disagree.

127
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,708
So, does that help clear
things up for you a little?

128
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,166
I suppose it does.

129
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,500
[NAITO] We've been
working behind the scenes

130
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,833
for a while now,
doing what we can.

131
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,625
But then we learned that the
girl who's at the center

132
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,458
of all this had ended
up with none other

133
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,208
than my old buddy Roku.

134
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,291
And I would have been
a complete idiot not to make use

135
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,083
of that opportunity.

136
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,958
Oh, yeah? How?

137
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,208
Well, to determine
whether regular humans

138
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,291
can coexist with
somebody like Sana.

139
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,833
It sounded like a good idea.

140
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,708
[ZOROKU] You never have
been one to worry too much

141
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,208
about how your actions
affect other people.

142
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,750
Heh. Sorry.

143
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,875
[ZOROKU] Hmph. You and I can
talk some more about that later.

144
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,375
First, we need to get
the girl back home.

145
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,625
Sanae.

146
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,000
The two of you get along
pretty well, don't you?

147
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,666
[SANAE]
Yes. We do.

148
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,666
Okay. She can
stay with us, then.

149
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,208
I... Well, uh-- I
don't mind if she stays.

150
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,083
[SANAE] But Grandpa,
I wish you wouldn't do that.

151
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,375
You always make
decisions this way.

152
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,208
On your own,
without talking to me.

153
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,666
Like before, y'know.

154
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,166
When you told me
Sana was at our place.

155
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,291
It was fine, but I wish you had
given me a say in the matter.

156
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,500
I do like Sana, but...

157
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,500
...you tend to do things without
asking how I feel about them.

158
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,166
I do?

Uh-huh, all the time.

It makes me feel unimportant.

Please, Grandpa.
Just talk to me more.

162

That's especially important
if we're going to be

163
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,666

Hmm...

Please try.

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,708
Yeah. Sure. I will.

Thanks, Grandpa.

[NAITO]
Hmm.

[MINNIE] Nice as it's been,
our chat's over.

We still have a ways to go.

171
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,625
And I would prefer
to have you quiet.

[SANA whimpers]

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,416
[SANA] Is she right about
me not being human?

174
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,333
Is that why I wasn't allowed
in the outside world?

175
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,125
Why they kept me locked up
in the research facility?

176
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,875
[SANA]
Because... I'm a monster?

177
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,666
I'm not, though. I'm not!

178
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,041
Right?

179
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,541
This stuff will slow down
your mind and your body.

We don't want to
knock you out altogether.

Unlike most people,
you're more dangerous

182

when you're completely
unconscious.

183
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,916
Ah... Disgusting.

[WOMAN]
Hello. What are you doing here?

185
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,083
It's sort of against
the rules, you see.

186
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,666
For us to be talking.

187
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,500
[SANA] I feel like I've met you,
but I'm not sure when.

Who are you?

00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,166
Who am I? Hmm. Let's see...

190
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,166
Why don't you think of me
as a really cool lady

192
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,291
Huh? You have talked
to me before, though.

193
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,208
At the research facility.

194
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,041
Oh? Are you sure about that?

195
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,583
Heh. You're flat.

You're a grown up,

but Sanae has
bigger boobs than you.

I hope you don't ever
forget you said that.

You'll find it less funny later.

--[SANA] Hey.
--[WOMAN] Hmm?

202

I just found out I may not be
a human like I thought I was.

I think I may be monster.

Don't worry, you're not
the only one confused.

I'm still searching
for that answer.

208
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,750
I probably shouldn't
tell you this,

209
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,541
but I was actually very lucky
when I was younger.

210
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,958
I had people around me
who were wiser than I was

211
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,250
and were willing to help me.

212
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,875
I'm sure you have someone, too.

213

do now is call their name.

granddaughter who's in

317
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,500
her second year of high school.

318
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,625
You know a lot about me, huh?

319
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,291
I'm afraid I'll need
you to accompany us

320
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,750
for a while, preferably quietly.

321
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,250
[ZOROKU] How about
you tell me who you are?

322
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,750
[MINNIE]
My name is Miriam C. Tachibana.

323
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,416
I'm a special consultant
on a state project.

324
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,250
One the Japanese and
American governments

325
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,875
are working on together.

326
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,750
[ZOROKU] A project involving
the Dreams of Alice, right?

327
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,833
[MINNIE]
Aren't you well-informed?

328
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,916
Yes, we're studying the
Dreams of Alice with the goal

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,166
of developing a way to
artificially reproduce

330
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,958
their powers. Ultimately,
our intention is to

331
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,541
use what we learn to build
a new energy system.

332
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,166
If it's successful,
our project will

333
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,000
benefit all of humanity.

334
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,500
[ZOROKU] You think you can
justify locking up a child,

335
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,958
testing her, dissecting her,
who knows what else,

336
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,500
because in the end,
it's a benefit to humanity?

337
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,083
[chuckles] Oh, a fan of
science fiction, are you?

338
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,416
No, we're not
going to dissect her.

339
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,708
However, you should know
that she is not a human,

340
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,250
let alone the innocent child
you suppose her to be.

341
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,708
[ZOROKU growls]

342
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,041
[MINNIE] The Red Queen
is something else entirely.

343
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,875
Not a person,
but an unknown being

344
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,666
with the ability to
mimic humanity.

345
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,166
[ZOROKU] Hah. None of that
makes any sense.

346
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,000
She looks like
an ordinary little girl.

347
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,708
[MINNIE] Imagine a weapon
of mass destruction

348
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,708
adopted an
artificial personality

349
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,333
and the form of a young girl.

350
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,541
[SANA groans]

351
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,000
Knowing that,
would you be so eager

352
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,166
--to leap to its defense?
--Huh?

353
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,333
A monster of untold power
is attempting

354
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,583
to insinuate itself into
our society in disguise.

355
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,583
What?

356
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,166
[MINNIE]
Tell me.

357
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,291
Once she came into your lives,
have you or your granddaughter

358
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,583
found yourselves
in mortal danger?

359
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,250
Sana! You don't
have to listen to her!

360
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,250
Lady, everything
you're saying is ridicu--

361
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,750
[SANA]
That's enough!

362
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,500
Please, Zoroku, that's enough...

363
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,666
I think the things she
said might be true.

364
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,458
I really am a monster.

365
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,458
It would explain a lot
of things about me.

366
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,666
--Sana...
--I'm ready to accept it now.

367
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,750
But I don't want you
to see what I really am.

368
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,375
It would probably
make you hate me.

369
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,541
Well, that's if you
don't hate me already.

370
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,416
[chuckles weakly]

371
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,958
I'll be okay.

372
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,166
I don't want you or Sanae
to end up in danger again

373
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,000
because of me.

374
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,416
Don't say that.

375
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,750
[SANA] All this happened
because I wanted to be human.

376
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,000
That's not fair to you.

377
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,708
It'll be better for you
if I'm not around.

378
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,041
I'm so sorry, for everything.

379
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,208
Really. I'll go back
to the research facility.

380
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,625
Thank you so much, though.
The food was really yummy.

381
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,041
Ichijo, I've got a helicopter
ready. You coming?

382
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,166
[ICHIJO]
I'll go on my own.

383
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,083
It'll be faster that way.

384
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:57,875
[NORIKO] Oh, wow! You're,
like, seriously amazing!

385
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,833
My contact was able to
find out which boat they're on.

386
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,583
Ichijo will have them back safe
and sound in no time.

387
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,166
Oh. Good.

388
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,666
[NAITO]
It'll all work out.

389
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,583
I bet your grandpa's lecturing
the kidnapper as we speak.

390
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,833
The first words out of
his mouth were probably,

391
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,083
"I hate crooked stuff!"

392
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,916
[laughs]

393
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,333
That memory.

394
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,625
[ZOROKU]
What're you making there?

395
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,416
Can't you tell? They're graves.

396
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
[SANAE] I've thought back
to that conversation a lot

397
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,916
over the years, but I've
never been able to recall

398
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,791
exactly what he said.

399
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,208
Till now.

400
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,625
[NAITO]
Hmm?

401
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,583
Before, when
he was talking about

402
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,958
how Sana might become
a part of our family.

403
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,958
I had this feeling.

404
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,833
It was strange
but familiar, too.

405
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,791
like something
tightening in my chest.

406
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,958
You know?

407
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,541
[NAITO]
Hmm.

408
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,375
[SANAE] I think that's what
helped me remember.

409
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,375
Suddenly, Grandpa's words
started coming back to me.

410
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:07,375
What he said after my parents'
funeral was so comforting.

411
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,000
I felt like everything
would be okay.

412
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,583
It's okay.

413
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,791
Listen, even if it
turns out she's right,

414
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,000
and you're not human,
what does it matter?

415
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,250
Don't give up on yourself, Sana.

416
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,458
[SANA whimpers]

417
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,708
We're going to go
home and figure everything out.

418
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,041
[SANA]
Huh...?

419
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,458
[ZOROKU]
Your name is Miriam, right?

420
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,083
You want me to
believe this little girl

421
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,291
isn't a human being,

422
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,333
but what the hell do you
know about humanity?

423
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,583
You shot a child without
a second thought.

424
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,333
Are you human?

425
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,500
I did what I had to.

426
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,166
That's not the issue here.

427
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,750
You're right
about her being dangerous,

428
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,250
I'll give you that.

429
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,000
The second I take my eyes
off her, she's causing trouble.

430
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,541
At her best,
she's still a nuisance.

431
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,791
That's okay.

432
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,833
Everybody's got flaws,
and she's no different.

433
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,750
But she knows she's not perfect,

434
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:02,083
and she's trying to improve.
That's what matters.

435
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,833
She's no monster.

436
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,916
She can be nice
if she's well fed.

437
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,541
In her own clumsy way,
she worries about others,

438
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,458
and she's
surprisingly intuitive.

439
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,041
And while she has
caused ten kinds of trouble,

440
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,125
she's never once done
something with malicious intent.

441
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:20,416
Whoever or whatever Sana is,
she's got a good heart.

442
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,000
That's sweet.

443
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,666
But your personal feelings about
her are completely irrelevant.

444
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,000
You're unqualified to
understand a being like her,

445

--much less do anything--
--[ZOROKU] Stop right there.

I've heard enough from you.

00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,458
If there's
one thing I know for sure,

448
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,875
it's that nobody in

this girl is some kind of

unknown life form like you say,
that doesn't mean she has

455
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,666
to be locked up like a criminal.

456
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,541
Do you honestly believe
coexistence isn't possible?

What if I am a monster?

00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,791
You can't really want
someone like me around.

I'll cause trouble,

You left to see
the outside world

473
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:35,125
and find help for your friends.
Then that's what you should do.

474
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,916
Stay away from these people.

475
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,166
They're crooked.

476
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,083
And you know how much
I hate crooked stuff.

Maybe.

Sorry it took me so long.

484
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,083
I came as fast as I could.

If you're all finished up

to come with me.
