I was in the area,
so I thought I'd drop by

you can be cut away.

But how did you know?

41

You said we'd go together.

to get out of here

You can meet my best friend,

met her, remember?

You mean Ayumu.
We actually talked for a while.

she was in the

[ZOROKU]
Wonderland is strange to us,

242
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,083

it must be the outside world

[ZOROKU]
From the moment she left here,

245
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,458
she's been bombarded with

246
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,333
one unfamiliar
experience after another.

247
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,375
For her, everything is a first.

248
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,333
She used each new experience
that came her way

249
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,416
to learn how to
interact with people

that's not very different from
how I've always lived my life.

And if there's one thing
I've learned,

254
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,791
it's that you won't get very far
without the help of others.

That's something you
helped teach me, too.

And when you receive something,

257
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,250
you should always
give back in kind.

the announcement I just

We are in the process

the Dreams of Alice--
familiar, yet extraordinary.

425
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,333
The important thing
to remember is this:

426
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,375
we all have the potential to
become a Dream of Alice.

427

That is to say, this unlikely
power doesn't discriminate.

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,333
No one from any walk
of life is more likely

than anyone else.

it's for the better.

things will work out.

If the kids in it
are happy and healthy,

the world can't be
too bad a place.

When she grows up,

00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,541
what sort of woman
will this girl become?

449
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,375
As time passes, will she be able
to hold on to the innocence

450
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,791
and carefree joy of childhood?

451
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,333
[SANA] These are the things
that Alice's older sister

452
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,083
wondered about.

453
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,708
[SANA] When Alice gets older,
she will surely tell of the many

454
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,416
strange and fanciful
stories she knows.

455
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,208
She will pass them on to small
children who look just like

456
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,916
she once did, and who see
the world through similar eyes.

457
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,166
Among those tales,

458
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,000
perhaps she might tell
one particular story.

459
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,791
[SANA]
The story of a wondrous land.

460
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,541

dreamed of, long ago.
