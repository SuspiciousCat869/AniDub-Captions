1
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,333
[ZOROKU]
Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,208
Sorry for calling
you in so late.

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,416
Nah, don't worry about it, Boss.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
We don't mind.

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,333
So, what's up?
Is something wrong?

6
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,833
Actually, there are a few
things I wanted to tell you.

7
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,791
[ICHIJO]
Wow, you brought a lot of stuff.

8
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:36,958
I did.

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,000
I figured Sana would
probably be hungry,

10
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,875
so I wanted to make sure we had
plenty of her favorite snacks.

11
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,875
That's good thinking.

12
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,125
[ZOROKU] I've already let our
clients know that I'll be away

13
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,250
for a bit, but I'll need the
two of you to keep an eye

14
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,041
on the shop while I'm gone,
if you think you're up for it.

15
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,083
[CHINATSU]
Yeah, totally.

16
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,458
[ICHIRO]
We've got it covered.

17
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,833
Thank you.

18
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:57,583
[BOTH gasp]

19
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,291
[SANAE]
He's heading back.

20
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,958
[BOTH]
All right!

21
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,791
[HATORI]
No good. There's no service.

22
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,000
[SANA]
"No service"?

23
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,833
Like, when you go
through a tunnel?

24
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,208
[HATORI]
Yeah.

25
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,416
It's never actually happened
with my phone before.

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
[SANA]
We're probably really far down.

27
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,750
I think we're in the deepest
part of Wonderland.

28
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,000
[HATORI]
It happened so fast,

29
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,125
but we fell from
up there, right?

30
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,375
I think so.

31
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,791
Okay. Then all we have
to do is find a way up

32
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,666
and get back to that door.

33
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,083
[SANA]
I don't know.

34
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,583
I don't believe you!

35
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,000
You have to know!

36
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,208
You're just saying that to be
mean to me, aren't you?

37
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,708
No, I'm just as
confused as you are!

38
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,916
I don't know what's going on,

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,208
but I can't use my
power like normal.

40
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,083
And I've never been to
this part of Wonderland,

41
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,500
so I don't know my way around.

42
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,458
[gasps] Where are you going?

43
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,541
[HATORI]
Where do you think?

44
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,583
To look for a way out.

45
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,125
I'm not really sure
that's a good idea.

46
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,750
Hey! You don't
know how far it is.

47
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,875
You could get tired!

48
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,583
Uh! Hold on, I'm coming!

49
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,125
[gasps, yelps]

50
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,041
[SANA]
Hey!

51
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,125
Wait for me.

52
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,541
[ZOROKU] I thought they
deserved to know everything.

53
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,708
[SANAE]
Huh?

54
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,791
I told them about
where Sana came from.

55
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,208
About her power,
and what she can do with it.

56
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,583
It seemed only fair.

57
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,041
Sorry.

58
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,458
I know Naito told us to keep
this as quiet as possible.

59
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,125
Well, given the situation,
you didn't have much choice.

60
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,458
I'm guessing they were
pretty surprised about it all?

61
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,791
[ZOROKU]
Nah, they already knew

62
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,791
something was
different about her.

63
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,458
[ICHIJO]
So, what did they say?

64
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,500
[ZOROKU chuckles]
Hardly anything.

65
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,583
"Well, Sana's still Sana,
right?" That was it.

66
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,500
[ICHIJO] Ah. I'm sure Sana
would be happy to hear that.

67
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,166
[SANA groaning]

68
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,000
Uh?

69
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:05,791
[SANA sighs]
Hey! It's never gonna work!

70
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,833
[ICHIJO] Despite the fact that
Sana was born in Wonderland,

71
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,666
we still don't know
very much about it.

72
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,083
I want you both to be careful
while we're in there.

73
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,583
Oh.

74
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,250
I thought the name made it
sound like an amusement park.

75
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,541
Huh?

76
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,875
Are you worried?

77
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,416
[ZOROKU]
Hm? Why? Are you?

78
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,250
[SANAE]
Mm...

79
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,625
I was really scared when
those people took Sana before.

80
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,500
I hated thinking that she
might never come back.

81
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,000
But in the end, it all
worked out, didn't it?

82
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:46,333
So, I've officially decided it
will be okay this time, too.

83
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,416
You think so?

84
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,750
[SANAE]
Of course!

85
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,625
I'm the alien of happy
endings, so it has to be!

86
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,541
[gasps] Naito was the one
driving last time.

87
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,125
I hope that doesn't matter.

88
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,458
[ICHIJO] Are you saying you'd
rather have Naito here instead?

89
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,541
[SANAE]
No, I think you'll do just fine.

90
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,250
[ICHIJO]
That's a relief.

91
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:25,083
[SANA grunting]

92
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,291
[HATORI laughs]

93
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,333
I'm back!

94
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,750
[HATORI]
Nothing...

95
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,458
[SANA]
I told you, it wouldn't work.

96
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:04,375
I think when my power
disappeared, the exit did, too.

97
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,625
I'm pretty sure we're stuck.

98
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,166
We can't be stuck!

99
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,625
I have to get back home to my
mom, she needs me with her.

100
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,166
Send me home right now!

101
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,416
I... I want to go home, too!

102
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,375
I'm not lying!

103
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:23,416
[SANA] Hey, I don't
think anyone's there.

104
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,041
Are you ever gonna
believe anything I say?

105
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,416
[whines]

106
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,208
[NORIKO] Our theory is
that the person with Sana is

107
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,791
the girl responsible for
the Harajuku incident.

108
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,666
There's no cell signal
where they are,

109
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,958
so we can't get
any specific intel.

110
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,125
The thing is,

111
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,916
Wonderland is in a
constant state of flux.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,208
But aside from confirming
both girls are in there,

113
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,791
we're shut out now.

114
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,500
We haven't been able learn
anything that's going on inside.

115
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,125
There's no telling what kind of
dangers you might encounter.

Please keep your
guards up at all times.

[LAB MAN A]
We still can't see it?

118
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,500
[LAB MAN B]
We can verify there's a signal,

119
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,916
but that's all.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,583
[LAB MAN C] The energy
coming from inside is stronger.

121
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,916
[LAB MAN A]
Does that mean it's expanding?

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,041
[LAB MAN B]
Most likely, yes.

123
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,291
[LAB MAN A]
Will it affect this world?

124
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,625

Calculating that now.

This is the place

129
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,666
The girls are lost
in here somewhere,

130
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,916
and we need to find them.

what your job is here?

Provide backup if you need it,

and collect as much data on

00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,333
If we follow that pig,
it will lead us to Sana!

160
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,458
No offense, but isn't
that kind of random?

161
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,541
No, I don't think it is.

162
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,208
I don't have any better ideas.

163
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:55,833
[gasps]

164
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,041
Right, let's go!

165
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,000
[ICHIJO] Maybe we should
think this through.

166
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,375
Kashimura?

167
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,833
Kashimura!

168
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,958
[ZOROKU] Is this this something
from another of Sana's memories?

169
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,666
I can't really tell.

170
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,125
I'll take a look at
it from up above.

171
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,333
Number 41.

172
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,208
[gasps]

[SANAE]
Ichijo!

Mommy...

176
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,500
[SANA]
I'm sorry.

177

[HATORI grunting]

178
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,333
I was only trying to get
you back for what happened.

179
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,791
I had no idea we'd end up
stuck in Wonderland.

180
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,166
It's my fault.

181
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,000
I got us into this whole mess.

182
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,333
I'm really sorry.

183
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,666
It's okay.

184
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,583
I'm partially to blame, too.

185
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,333
[SANAE]
Ichijo just disappeared.

186
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,125
Do you think she's
going to be okay?

187
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,166
[ZOROKU] Maybe we should ask
the alien of happy endings.

188
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,083
[SANAE gasps]

189
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,250
What would she have to say?

190
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,916
[SANAE] She'd say that
Ichijo is really strong.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,041
[ZOROKU]
Yeah. She'll be fine.

192
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,208

--[ZOROKU groans]
--[SANAE screams]

195
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,541
What was that?

196
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,250
It's starting to feel like
somebody is mocking us.

197
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,541
When we're all finished here,

198
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,416
I'm gonna have to give
this Wonderland place

199
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,625
a good talking to.

200
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,000
Totally!

201
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,041
Wonderland could definitely
use a Grandpa lecture!

202
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,750
[HATORI]
Hey, what's going on out there?

203
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,250
[SANA] I could be wrong,
but I think it's practicing.

204
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,833
I don't understand.
What is it practicing?

205
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,208
[SANA]
Things it's learned.

206
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,375
[HATORI]
I still don't get it.

207
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,541
[SANA]
Wonderland is always curious.

208
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,041
It wants to know what
the world is made of.

209
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,750
You know, things
like colors, shapes,

210
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,833
smells, and flavors.
But it's more than that, too.

211
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,791
I think it wants to
know about the rules

212
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,666
that control the world.

213
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,958
It wants to understand
what makes plants grow

214
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,541
and why the sun shines.

215
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,875
How humans see the world, and
why they do the things they do.

216
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,375
What life is--
where it comes from.

217
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,708
Why it exists.

218
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,500
I think it gathers
things from our world

219
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,625
and imitates them here,
trying to understand.

220
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,833
I wonder if that's what
the Mirror Gates are.

221
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,083
If they're like peepholes
Wonderland uses.

222
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:49,583
A way for it to
spy on our world.

223
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,708
It wasn't always
like this, you know.

224
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,125
In the beginning, Wonderland
was only a little bigger

225
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,916
than the room
we're in right now.

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Eventually, I think it will
be a whole universe.

227
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,333
[HATORI]
It's strange.

228
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,000
Uh?

229
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,875
I'm listening to you talk,

230
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,000
and everything you're
saying is so out there,

231
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,833
it's impossible to believe.

232
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:14,250
But for some reason,
I think I believe it all anyway.

233
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,416
You're a mysterious girl,
you know that?

234
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,458
I'm not some weirdo!

235
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,666
I didn't call you a weirdo.

236
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,166
[SANA]
I'm not lying!

237
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,083
I didn't say you were
lying, either.

238
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,041
You're so funny.

239
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,708
[SANA]
I am not funny!

240
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,083
You know,

241
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,833
it would be nice to be able
to transform yourself

242
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,708
whenever you want,
like this place does.

243
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,083
Uh...?

244
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,083
[HATORI]
This world is very strange.

245
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,833
And I can't pretend
to understand it.

246
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,875
But it's beautiful.

247
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,250
[HATORI] If you're right--
if Wonderland is eventually

248
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,875
going to become
its own universe,

249
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,458
maybe I could just
live here forever

250
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,541
instead of going back home.

251
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,416
[HATORI]
I didn't mean to,

252
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,166
but it looks like I've
run away, after all.

253
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,250
[SANA]
I don't know.

254
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,416
Are you sure about that?

255
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Sure about what?

256
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,416
[SANA]
Uh, I-I just mean...

257
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,458
If you stay here forever,
you'll probably get bored.

258
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,833
And didn't you say you needed
to go back home to your mom?

259
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,041
[HATORI]
Leave me alone.

260
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,041
You wouldn't understand.

261
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,583
Uh.

262
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,833
[HATORI]
Sorry.

263
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:28,916
[gasps]

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,291
I shouldn't have said that.

265
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,083
It was mean.

266
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,875
This is difficult.
I'm not sure where to start.

267
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,291
[SANA]
Uh...

268
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,333
My mom hates me.

269
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,500
That's what it comes down to.

270
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,875
The word "mom" is a shorter
version of "mother," right?

271
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,375
[HATORI]
Yeah, that's right.

272
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,833
I thought so.

273
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,791
My Sanae also had a mother.

274
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,041
Her mother's father is Zoroku,
her grandpa.

275
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,833
I never had a mother or father,
so I don't really get it.

276
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,208
You don't have parents?

277
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,875
[SANA]
Nope.

278
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:09,291
[HATORI]
Hey. Can I tell you something?

279
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,250
[SANA]
Sure.

280
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,166
My parents are unhappy.

281
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,958
It's hard to remember
a time when they weren't

282
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,708
always fighting
with each other.

283
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,208
Why do they fight?

284
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,041
Because I failed my elementary
school entrance exam.

285
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,708
My mom was
so disappointed in me.

286
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,291
[SANA]
Hm?

287
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,458
I'm such a pathetic
excuse for a daughter,

288
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,083
she can't even look
me in the eye anymore.

289
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:34,083
That's why it's probably better
for me not to be there.

290
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,500
If I'm gone, then Mom and
Dad won't have anything

291
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:40,458
to fight about, and they
can go back to being happy.

292
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,291
Things are really bad now.

293
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,833
But it wasn't always like this.

294
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,000
Lately, it's like my mom
is a different person,

295
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,875
looking out at the world from
a dark universe of her own.

296
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,791
When she looks
at me like that,

297
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,750
it breaks my heart.

298
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,958
I love my mother,
and I always will.

299
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,666
But I hate seeing her in pain

300
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,750
and knowing that
it's because of me...

301
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,208
That she would
probably be happy

302
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,625
if only she didn't have
me for a daughter.

303
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,750
[cries]

304
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:16,541
[HATORI]
I... don't want to go home.

305
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,791
I'm useless.

306
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,416
I should never have existed!

307
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,916
[HATORI sobs]

308
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,375
[SANA]
Hey. I'm sorry.

309
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,750
You might not like
hearing this from me, but...

310
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,500
For what it's worth,

311
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,625
I think it's okay
that you exist.

312
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,541
[gasps]

313
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,541
Thanks for saying that.

314
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,708
[SANA]
Not just you.

315
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,000
I think there's nobody
who should exist,

316

and nobody who
shouldn't, either.

317
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,125
Because if that were true,
then I wouldn't be here.

318
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,583
It scares me to think about
these kinds of things.

319
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,375
It makes me feel so... small.

320
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,916
You wanna know
a secret about me?

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,583
I was actually born here.

322
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,291
Huh?

323
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,291
[SANA] I know I look like
a human, but I'm not one.

324
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:15,750
In fact, I think
I'm Wonderland itself.

Thanks, Coach!

328
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:26,916

The number you have dialed

your call at another time.

[AYUMU]
Where are you?

335
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,416
[HATORI]
You're not human?

336
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,291
[SANA]
Mm-mm.

337
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,916
Huh? Wha...?

338
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,958
Hey, wait.

339
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,375
Uh, what are you doing?

340
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,291
Um... Honestly,

341
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,458
I was told never to
tell anyone this stuff,

342
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,541
but it feels kinda
good to talk about it.

343
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,333
When I was born here,
I was something else.

344
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,125
Something I can't explain,
and don't really understand.

345
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,583
I didn't look like this then.

346
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,583
I wasn't even shaped
like a human at that point.

347
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,833
Then, before I knew it,
everything changed.

348
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:11,541
Suddenly, I had eyes and hands--
a normal-looking human body.

349
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,083
It's hard to remember it all,

350
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,750
but I'm pretty sure I was
part of Wonderland.

351
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,708
You don't believe me, huh?

352
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,750
No. I'm just surprised.

353
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,166
I figured it out after
I saw you that day.

354
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,916
You and I were similar, and it
made me feel all frazzled.

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,500
I've thought about it,

356
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,291
and I'm pretty sure I'm still
connected to this place somehow.

357
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,625
The outside world and
real humans are what Wonderland

358
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,083
wants to know about.

359
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,916
So, I'm just like some sort
of communication device.

360
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,666
A way for it to get the
answers it's looking for.

361
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,083
Except, if that's true,

362
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,375
then there are plenty of others
who could take my place.

363
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,166
And that would mean
I don't actually matter.

364
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,625
There's no good reason
for me to even exist.

365
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,958
[HATORI gasps]

366
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,333
[SANA] I guess what I'm saying
is that I kinda know how

367
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,125
you feel, because
sometimes I wonder

368
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,208
if I'm really
supposed to be here.

369
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,250
If I deserve to have
anyone care about me.

[cries]

371
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,208
Oh, um... I'm sorry,
did I say something wrong?

372
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,125
I don't have a mom,
so I probably shouldn't

373
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,750
compare myself to you.

374
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay, well, maybe I
could wipe your tears?

375
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,583
[HATORI]
No.

376
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,000
You know, life's different
since I left Wonderland.

377
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:31,791
I've found lots of new things
that make me happy.

378
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,583
I've met so many people,
tasted yummy food,

379
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,083
played fun games.
Had exciting adventures.

380
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,250
Of course, there's been
annoying stuff, too--

381
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,000
things that make
me feel frazzled.

382
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,500
And at first, I thought
that stuff was wrong.

383
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,791
I mean, if it made me feel bad,
how could I need it in my life?

384
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,000
I'd be better off
without it, right?

385
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,916
But now, I don't
think that's true.

386
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,458
That stuff--the things
that frazzle me--

387
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,250
I need them as much as I need
the things that make me happy.

388
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,666
What I mean is,

389
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,041
you said it'd be better
if you weren't around,

390
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,083
but I think you're
wrong about that.

391
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,666
Yeah, sure, you frazzle me,
a whole bunch--

392
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,708
[HATORI laughs]

393
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,958
Uh?

394
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:10,958
[HATORI]
I was right.

395
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,750
You really are
a mysterious girl.

396
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,458
It's kinda cool.

397
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,291
You really think I'm mysterious?

398
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,791
Stop that. What are you doing?

399
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,125
My Sanae does this to me when
I'm upset about something.

400
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,291
"Your Sanae"?

401
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,875
[SANA]
Yeah.

402
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,958
All the people I know are big.
They treat me like a little kid.

403
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,291
When I talk about
stuff like this,

404
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,416
I feel like they're not
really listening.

405
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,375
I try to tell them how
frustrated and confused I am,

406
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,583
but they just say
I'm doing great

407
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,083
or I'll understand
when I'm older.

00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,125
So, how old are you, then?

00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,125
[SANA]
Uh, I don't know.

412
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,666
Between eight and ten?

413
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,958
Well.

414
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,541
That means we're probably
around the same age.

415
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,208
[SANA] Maybe, but I'm pretty
sure I'm older than you are.

416
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,416
I don't think so.
I'm totally older than you.

417
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,083
No, I'm older!

[SANA gasps]

419
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,500
[HATORI] Can I stay
like this for a little bit?

420
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:08,541
[HATORI] When I was little,
my mom held me like this a lot.

421
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,541
[HATORI] I walked in
and introduced myself,

422
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,833
but all the other kids
started laughing at me

423
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,958
and saying I was weird.

424
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,750
When the teacher told me I
didn't have to introduce myself

425
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,416
when I entered
the classroom,

426
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,166
they all just laughed
at me again.

427
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,208
[HATORI'S MOM] Don't worry
about the other kids, dear.

428
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,458
You did fine.

429
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,916
You introduced yourself
just like I told you to,

430
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,125
and I'm very proud.

431
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,416
[HATORI'S MOM]
It'll be all right, little one.

432
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,625
Mommy's got you. You're okay.

433
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,125
[HATORI]
Do you remember that day, Mom?

434
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:42,833
I was so sad, but at the same
time, I was happy, too.

435
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,791
You made me feel safe.

436
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,416
I felt lucky to have
a mom like you.

437
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,875
It's just like back then.

So, listen.

I've decided I do want
to see my mom again.
