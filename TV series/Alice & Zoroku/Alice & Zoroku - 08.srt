00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,416
[HATORI] Our story begins
long ago in a faraway land,

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,083
where there lived an
unfortunate girl.

3
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,166
Little did she know
that the real trouble

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,333
was only beginning.

5
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,458
[CLERK A]
I'm very sorry, ma'am,

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,041
but I'm afraid at
this point in March,

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,750
these are all we have available.

8
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,583
[HATORI'S MOM]
Thank you. I understand.

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,916
I'm sorry, Hatori.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,291
You'll have to choose one
of these, alright?

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,833
[HATORI]
Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,958
Here, Mom. I want this one.

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:48,625
[HATORI'S MOM]
Oh?

14
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,666
[HATORI'S MOM]
Right here.

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,958
This is where the school
insignia would normally go.

16
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,916
[HATORI]
I'm sorry, Mom.

17
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,541
[HATORI'S DAD]
You're bringing that up again?

18
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,916
It happened over two years ago.

19
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,250
[HATORI'S DAD]
Hatori is a smart girl.

20
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,500
She'll get another shot with the
middle school entrance exams.

21
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,625
[HATORI'S MOM]
This is what you always do.

22
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,208
Try to postpone the issue
like that'll make it go away.

23
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,000
[HATORI'S MOM]
Sending her to public school

24
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,000
for three more years.

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,583
[HATORI'S DAD] It was your
idea to not have her test

26
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,041
for a backup school.

27
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,916
[HATORI'S MOM] I thought
narrowing the options

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,750
would force her to work
that much harder.

29
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,666
[sighs]
Sure turned out well.

30
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,958
Don't give me that!

31
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,208
What about you?

32
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,291
What have you done
to help these past years?

33
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,000
You've never taken
her entrance exams seriously!

34
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,291
You wouldn't listen
to any of my concerns.

35
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm the one who
got her extra lessons.

36
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,708
I'm the one who
researched all the schools!

37
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,333
[HATORI]
Are you listening, God?

38
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:42,250
The thing is, Mom and Dad
don't like each other anymore,

39
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:46,125
and it's my fault for being
such a useless daughter.

40
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,333
I don't need any
presents for my birthday,

41
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,958
or Christmas either.

42
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,583
I promise I'll study hard.
I'll do anything.

43
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,625
But please, please, God.

44
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,708
Make Mom and Dad
be nice to each other

45
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,750
and start getting along again!

46
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,875
[DAIKI, AYUMU]
Time to eat!

47
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,750
[AYUMU'S DAD]
Ayumu.

48
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,916
Stop gulping
your food like that.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,750
You know Daiki will copy you.

50
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,708
Sure, Dad.

51
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,791
Well, dear.

52
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,500
We'll be at your
match today, as usual.

53
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,083
[AYUMU]
Okay, Mom, sounds good.

54
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,000
See you then!

55
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:24,875
Good luck out there!

56
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,250
[DAIKI]
I'll cheer for you!

57
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,166
[cell phone vibrates]

58
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,791
Oh, the match!

59
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,875
Good morning!

60
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,041
I, uh...

61
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,958
[HATORI]
Are we having breakfast?

62
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:01,583
Anyway, Ayumu's
playing a match later today.

63
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,375
Want to go cheer for her,
like we used to do?

64
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,000
The three of us together?

65
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,041
[gasps]

66
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,291
[HATORI'S MOM]
That's a great idea!

67
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,291
What?

68
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,333
Who's Ayumu?

69
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,833
She's one of
Hatori's good friends,

70
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,208
a real lively young girl.

71
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,375
Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,166
She's the one with
the short hair, right?

73
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,666
Let's go to the match.
It's been too long!

74
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,166
[HATORI'S MOM] I'll go get some
lunches packed for us, then.

75
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,958
[HATORI'S DAD] We can just
pick up food somewhere.

76
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,666
[gasps]

77
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,625
[HATORI] One day, a good
witch appeared before

78
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,166
the unfortunate little girl
and looked down at her

79
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,708
with kind eyes.

80
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,333
"What is your wish?"
the good witch asked.

81
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,291
And the little girl
said to her,

82
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,500
"I wish everybody would be nice
to each other all the time!"

83
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,916
[HATORI] Then the witch
smiled and said, "Very well.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,666
Listen, and I will teach
you some magic words."

85
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,833
[HATORI]
But the girl was confused.

86
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:57,333
She didn't know how to use
the words the witch gave her.

87
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,875
You shouldn't walk
till the signal tells you to.

88
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,333
[BOTH gasp]

89
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,750
[BOY A]
Hey! Hurry up, already!

90
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,500
[BOY B] I hope the
basketball court is open!

91
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,458
[BOY C] The guys from the other
class might've beaten us there.

92
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,125
[HATORI] You aren't
supposed to run in the halls.

93
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,291
[gasps]

94
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,458
Do you see that, too?

95
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,458
[BOYS]
Huh?

96
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,625
[BOY D]
Come on, guys!

97
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,500
--[BOY B] Yeah, let's go!
--[HATORI] That was weird.

98
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,333
I wonder what just happened.

99
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,583
[AYUMU] I've never
seen anything like it.

100
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,000
Hmm.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,500
[AYUMU] Do you think maybe...
it was magic?

102
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,875
It must be.

103
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,208
Yeah, remember that guy
crossing the street before?

104
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,041
[gasps]

105
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,208
He stopped.

106
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,250
I bet you made him
do it using your magic.

107
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,750
Ah.

108
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,250
You've obviously
got some kind of superpower!

109
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,333
No, that's crazy.

110
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,291
Well. why
don't you try it again?

111
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,041
What?

112
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,833
Test out your magic.

113
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,125
[HATORI]
Um... I dunno.

114
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,500
Whatever this is,
I think it's real.

115
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,541
You've used it twice already
without even meaning to!

116
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,250
I guess it can't hurt to try.

117
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,625
[gasps]

118
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,750
Stop moving.

119
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,500
[gasps]
Wow, it worked!

120
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,208
Did you see?
[gasps]

121
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,500
Ayumu?

122
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,416
Hey! Wake up!

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,416
Hmm? Something wrong?

124
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,750
You look worried.

125
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,500
[AYUMU]
Whoa! Look!

126
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:03,041
The experiment worked!
You really can do magic!

127
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,333
[HATORI] You think
that's what this is?

128
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,041
[AYUMU] Yeah, I do!
What else could it be?

129
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,250
It's like...

130
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,416
...I've turned into
a witch or something.

131
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,416
[AYUMU]
Yeah, but you're a good witch!

132
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,416
Huh...?

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,666
[AYUMU]
Try it again.

134
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,375
[gasps]

135
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,875
Come on! Do more!

136
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,750
Go for a walk.

137
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,500
I want to see them dance.

138
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,833
[AYUMU]
Oh, wow.

139
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,500
They do what I say, too!

140
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,791
Okay, one more. Don't move!

141
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,000
[HATORI]
Ayumu.

142
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,041
[AYUMU]
Hmm?

143
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,833
Are you afraid of me now?

144
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,833
Please, there's no way
I could ever be afraid of you.

145
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,500
'Kay? I'll always
be by your side.

146
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,166
[HATORI] "Listen, and I will
teach you some magic words.

147
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,333
Use them, and you can grant
yourself any wish.

148
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,583
Everybody around you will do
whatever you tell them to."

149
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:10,166
[HATORI] "However, you must
only use the words for good.

150
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,041
Do that, and you will
become a good witch.

151
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,500
But if you use
the words for evil,

152
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:20,250
then you will surely
become an evil witch."

153
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,291
But the little girl
was far too excited about

154
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,166
her new power to listen
to the good witch.

155
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,041
You know, your mom
is really pretty, Hatori.

156
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,000
And she always seems so happy.

157
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,750
Maybe sometime,
she could give my mom

158
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,833
a little fashion advice.

159
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:35,875
[HATORI giggles]

00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,333
So, has she
always been this cool?

161
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:42,000
At the beginning of the term,
she seemed, I dunno, kinda...

162
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,333
...intimidating?

163
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,333
[GIRL C] It's like
she's a different person now.

[HATORI gasps]
Mom? Dad?

168
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,666
Hey!

169
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,041
[HATORI]
Just look at them.

170
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,833
[HATORI] "If you use
the words for evil,

171
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,500
then you will surely
become an evil witch."

172
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,583
[HATORI]
Some part of me knew.

00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,250
[AYUMU sighs]

174
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,791
[HATORI] It didn't make
sense that Mom and Dad

175
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:55,375
were suddenly getting along.
That they were happy again.

176
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,041
I knew it was just
because of the magic.

177
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:05,041
[HATORI] But I guess I didn't
want to accept the truth.

178
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,291
[HATORI] I didn't know
God was so cruel.

179
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,416
What good is having this power
if it can't fix anything?

180
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,791
[HATORI]
So, what do I do now?

181
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,333
[HATORI]
As long as I'm here,

182
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,541
I'll be forcing
my parents to live a lie.

00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,958
[AYUMU]
I don't know.

184
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,583
I have to leave them.

185
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,791
[AYUMU]
Okay, then.

186
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,083
I'm coming with you.

187
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,583
What? But why?

188
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,375
Because... I used your magic.

189
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,166
I did bad things with it,
just like you.

190
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,666
So, we're the same.

Hey, what time is it?

I hate to tell ya,
but it's 10:46.

194
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,708
So, about two minutes since
the last time you asked.

195
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,458
Oh. is that all?

196
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,666
Sorry.

197
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,125
I guess you're really
excited about seeing

198
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,250
your friends again, huh?

[SANA]
Mm-hmm!

200
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,458
These friends of
yours are twins, correct?

201
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,791
That's right! Asahi and Yonaga.

202

[ZOROKU]
Sana.

203
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,083
Will you throw out
those things in the back?

Uh, you know
they're green and soft.

00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,250
Nope, you've lost me.

Wait! I know!
The squishy things.

208
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,041
Yeah, right, those.

209
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,375
Sure, no problem.

210
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,708

then I'm gonna throw you away!

so many new things.

so far ahead of me.

Don't worry about it!

It'll be easy to find
our way around

you're reading it
correctly, Sis?

Yeah, okay.
Cut me some slack.

Let's see here.

Hey, look where we are!

233
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,458

00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,416

[YONAGA]
Yeah?

00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,416
[ASAHI] How long would it
take us to get to Urahara?

Oh, no! Sana's waiting for us!

You don't want to
let her down, do you?

240
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,541
[ASAHI] Of course not,
but there's still so much

241
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,958
we haven't gotten to see!
I thought, just for a bit.

242
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:49,875
Maybe?

243
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,291
Well, we could always ask Sana

00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,458
if she would come
explore the city with us.

245

[ASAHI gasps]
That's a perfect idea!

246
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,958
Let's ask her!

247
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,625
That way, we can go sightseeing
and hang out with her

248
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,000
at the same time!

Uh-huh.

Sana and see if she'll

00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,666
come play with us!

252
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,875
[YONAGA]
Yeah!

00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,791
[HATORI]
This is an order.

254
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,958
Stop.

255
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,083
[SANA] The green things
are taken care of.

256
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,875
So what's up next?

257
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,750
[SANA]
Uh, what are you doing?

258
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,208
Hey. What's going on, Zoroku?

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,958
[SANA]
Talk to me.

260
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,208
Is this a weird joke
or something?

261
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,208
Zoroku?

262
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,500
Zoroku?

263
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,541
Zoroku!

264
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,625
Your arm will tire
if you leave it up like that.

265
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,958
You should put it down.

266
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,958
And don't stand around
yelling and blocking the street

267
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,750
like a couple of children.

268
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,291
It isn't polite.

269
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,833
[HATORI]
This is an order.

270
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,125
Move out of my way.

271
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,125
So, what do you want?

272
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,125
Oh, uh. I don't know.

273
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,666
The one with
strawberries, maybe.

274
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,875
Looks yummy.

275
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,916
[HATORI] And one kiwi
with whipped cream.

276
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,833
[AYUMU] So, what
are we going to do now?

277
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,416
[HATORI]
I'm not sure.

278
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,875
I guess we just do whatever we
want until we're out of money,

279
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,208
and then we can get
a job if we need to.

280
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,125
[HATORI] I figure, you've got
magic, you can get a job,

281
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,625
--no matter how old you are.
--[AYUMU] Yeah...

282
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,208
[HATORI] We'll go somewhere
nobody knows us and find work.

283
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,208
When we've been there a
while and saved up enough,

284
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,500
we'll move on to the next place.
It'll be an adventure.

285
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,750
[AYUMU]
Hmm...

286
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,416
Why don't we check out
the city from up there?

287
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,625
[AYUMU]
Sure.

288
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,416
[AYUMU] It's smaller than it
seems on the ground.

289
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,041
[HATORI]
Yeah, it is.

290
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,916
This is a nice view, huh?

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,416
I guess there are some
benefits to having magic.

292
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,375
[AYUMU]
It's so quiet.

293
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,041
Like everyone else
has disappeared,

294
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,375
and you and I are
the only ones left.

295
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,500
[HATORI]
Yep.

296
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,083
[HATORI]
Are you sure?

297
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,416
[AYUMU]
Hmm?

298
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,791
[HATORI]
About coming with me.

299
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,333
You don't have to do it.

300
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,458
[AYUMU]
Why? Don't you want me with you?

301
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,791
[HATORI]
Yeah, of course.

302
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,791
I didn't mean it like that.

303
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,916
It's just that this whole
mess is my fault, not yours.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,208
It was my stupid magic that
screwed everything up.

305
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,541
With me there, home
would never be normal.

306
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,166
I didn't have any choice.

307
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,041
Leaving my parents
was my only option.

308
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,916
You've still got a home you
can go back to, though.

309
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,666
I promised you,
remember?

310
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,458
That I'd stay by your side.

311
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,416
Witch or not,
you're still Hatori to me.

312
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,916
Thank you so much!

313
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,833
[HATORI]
Ayumu. I love you!

314
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,208
You're such a hot guy!

315
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,125
