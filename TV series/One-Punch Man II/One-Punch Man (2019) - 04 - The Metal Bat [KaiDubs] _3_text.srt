00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,154
( Boy sighs ) Aww, man.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,089
That lame theme song
means justice man is here.

10
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,160
Just when it's getting good,
the hero always butts in.

11
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,094
- ( Punches whacking )
- Hang in there!

12
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,363
Don't give up, devil Earl!

13
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,165
Kick justice man's butt!

14
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,567
Justice man: Justice punch!

15
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,568
Devil Earl: Nyaah!

16
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,236
Boy: Darn it!

17
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,573
He got beat again.
It's not fair!

18
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,510
Why doesn't any monster have
a chance against justice man?

19
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,711
What?

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,581
Heroes never lose? Really?

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,117
Why not? Why does good
always have to win?

22
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,119
That's totally not fair!

23
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,255
Monsters have things
they want, too.

24
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:01,326
And monsters try.
They try really hard.

25
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,263
So why do they always end up
losing and getting killed?

26
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,865
I root for them.

27
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,201
What about what I think?

28
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,137
I mean, monsters are cool, too.

29
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,206
Why should the popular win

30
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,607
- while the hated lose?
- Garou: While the hated lose?

31
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,942
Both: It's tragic!

32
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,345
Garou: If that's
how the world works,

33
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,015
then I will become
the strongest monster,

34
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,050
and I'll lose to no one.

What the hell am I doing here?

38
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,502
What happened last night?

39
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,504

it was almost
certainly the work

just targeting heroes now.

It's the entire association!

57

Man #3: He was able to defeat
tank top master quite easily,

58
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,093

will not dispel fear.

Man #1: Executives should
remain indoors if possible.

62
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,770
When going out, they must be
accompanied by a class-s hero.

63

Man #2: Is that realistic?

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,574
Class s has been

Metal bat: Really? This is what
they call a critical assignment?

81
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,613
Executive: It seems
association executives

82
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,148
are targets, too,
now apparently,

83
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,683
but my boy here simply insisted

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,226
Our tab won't even
be 10,000 yen.

89

What an amusing experience
this is,

trying to make their inferior
cuisine more fun to eat.

They need these plates
to tally your bill.

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,242
Executive: Come, now.
It's only good manners

97
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,710
to return one's plate.

98
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,782
Metal bat: Pretty sure I just
told you not to put them back.

99
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,783
Executive: Is this sea urchin?

100
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,185
The color is off-putting.

101
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,453
Perhaps they have caviar.

102
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,254
Boy: Medium fatty tuna?

103
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,591
Is any kind other than
extra fatty tuna even edible?

104
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,259
Metal bat: Stop doing that!

105
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,529

and this bat tastes blood.

Metal bat:
It's my little sister!

110
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,306
Uh, hang tight for a sec.
I'll be right back.

An important assignment
came up out of nowhere.

114
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,281
I'll take you shopping
another time. I promise.

115
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,484
Huh? Where am I now?

116
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,819
Nezumi Sushi.

117
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,821
( Gasps ) No, that's not it!

118
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,823
This really is an assignment.

119
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,424
Oh, come on. Please don't cry.

120
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,493
I'll explain everything later.

121
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,294
( Gasps ) Gotta go.

122
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,763
I'll call back soon.

123
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm the one
who should be crying.

124
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,636
Last time I do a favor
for some executive douche bags.

Oh, crap! Is it garou?!

127
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:10,775
Boy: Papa!

128
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,245
Metal bat: Pretty sure
that bug's not him.

129
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,581
Executive: Save my son!
That monster has him!

130
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,316
Centipede: That's

131
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,518
executive, all right.

132
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,386
Plant: Then that
must be his kid.

133
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,455
Perfect!
Let's take the runt and bail!

134
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,491
Metal bat: I don't think so.

135
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,129
Neither one of 'em
is going anywhere. Understand?

136
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,064
( Spits )

137
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,467
They haven't
paid their bill yet.

138
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,936
Saitama:
Charanko said he signed up

139
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,139
for this "super fight"
tournament thing on a whim.

140
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,741
What a knucklehead.

141
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,543
But this might do.

142
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,747
There could be some
seriously strong fighters here.

143
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,550
Worker: What name
did you register under?

144
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,352
Saitama: Oh. Uh, charanko.

145
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,889
Worker: All right. Please
write in your fighting style.

146
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,492
Saitama: Fighting style?
Huh. What was it again?

147
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,062
I feel like it's...

148
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,365
Let's see how the tournament
bracket turned out.

149
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,366
Oh.

150
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,502
Some fighters got seeded

151
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,905
this bakuzan guy must be tough.

152
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,506
In the opposite bracket,

153
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,076
looks like suiryu
is the top seed.

154
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,511
Man: What's up?

155
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,513
You're charanko
from the dojo, right?

156
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,315
Saitama: Oh, crap!
Someone who knows charanko!

157
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,849
Man: Hey, what's the matter?

158
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,986
Surely you haven't
forgotten me already, have you?

159
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,054
"Fist of seltzer water
on the rocks"?

160
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,456
Quite the jokester.

161
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,926
Well, I don't blame you
for being nervous.

162
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,895
After all, you never
could beat me, could you?

163
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,866
Charanko: Aww, man.

164
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,571
That jerk better not
be competing in my place.

165
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,274
Nah, he wouldn't
be that stupid.

166
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,409
Oh, actually,

167
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,811
saitama does tend
to be pretty stupid.

168
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,946
- Mumen rider: Saitama?
- Charanko: Huh?

169
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,481
Hey, do I know you, or...

170
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,618
Mumen rider: Tell me,
are you friends with saitama?

171
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,487
Man: Now, I bet you're
thinking to yourself,

172
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,889
"why's a guy like sourface
entering the tournament?"

173
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,491
( Saitama thinking )
Don't know. Don't care.

174
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,627
Just hurry up,
and go somewhere else.

175
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,562
Sourface:
I've got myself two reasons.

176
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,031
The first,
this super fight is ideal

177
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,501
for making a name for myself
as a big-time martial artist.

178
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,571
Master bang was the champion
once, and just look at him.

179
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,908
The second reason, the incident
at the last tournament.

180
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,980
A masked fighter named wolfman
won the championship,

181
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:32,250
but afterwards the real wolfman
was found unconscious.

182
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,452
The winner was a fake.

183
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,455
And, because of that,
registration under an alias

184
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,058
and use of headwear
was strictly prohibited.

185
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,661
Saitama: Headwear? Wait. Like...

186
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,129
Sourface: You've already lied
about your fighting style,

187
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,666
but that might be
a bit of a gray area.

188
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,868
Saitama: What happens
if they find out?

189
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,604
Sourface: At the very least,
you'd be banned for life.

190
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,139
Who knows?
They might even follow that up

191
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,609
with a heavy fine and a lawsuit,

192
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,944
maybe even have you arrested.

193
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,414
Saitama: Oh, really?

194
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,748
Sourface: Huh?
What's the matter?

195
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,484
No way.

196
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,887
You... ( Chuckles )

197
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,423
Know exactly
who the fake wolfman was, too!

198
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,558
Saitama: I'm safe.

199
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,495
Sourface: I studied his
fighting technique in a video.

200
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,497
There's no doubt.

201
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,232
The fake wolfman was...

202
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,633
Garou.

203
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,769
( Garou chuckles )
So we meet again.

204
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,039
Boy: Huh? Oh, hey, mister!

205
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,507
You out patrolling again?

206
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,843
Garou: I told you
not to call me "mister."

207
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,444
Now lend me that book.

208
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,179
Boy: I told you to get your own.

209
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,647
Garou: Huh?

210
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,850
Boy: Hey, I know.
Let's read it together.

211
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,652
( Garou sighs )

212
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:41,920
Ah...

213
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,589
Saitama: Garou, huh?

214
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,658
That name keeps popping up.

215
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,861
Sourface: It was six months ago,

216
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,664
right after it went down
and he was expelled.

217
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,997
It had to be him.

218
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,533
Saitama: What went down?

219
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,468
Sourface: You were
skipping classes then,

220
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,736
so you wouldn't know.

221
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,372
It was on a day
when master bang was out.

222
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,008
( Students grunting )

223
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,544
Sourface: Hmm?

224
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,679
- Garou: I'm finished.
- Sourface: Huh?

225
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,748
Garou: There's nothing left
for me to learn here.

226
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,349
It's a waste of time.

227
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,252
Let's fight for real.

228
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,488
Sourface: He'd hidden
his true nature

229
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,290
as he sharpened his fangs.

230
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,493
If it hadn't been for him,

231
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,428
we wouldn't have
had to leave the dojo.

232
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,563
Damn that arrogant bastard!

233
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,765
That's why I'm here today,

234
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,800
to win this tournament...

235
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,636
And get my mojo back.

236
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:35,440
I have to prove to myself that I
can hold my own against garou.

237
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,377
( Laughs ) But look at you.

238
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,245
I never imagined
master bang's runt

239
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,714
would enter
the super fight tourney.

240
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,048
You think a lot of yourself,

241
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,651
calling yourself
the top disciple.

242
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,388
I'd pump the brakes
if I were you.

243
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,590
Mumen rider: I see.

244
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,258
So you think saitama

245
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,794
might enter this competition
in your place, then?

246
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,862
Charanko: Yeah. An amateur

247
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,265
wouldn't stand a chance
in this tournament.

248
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,666
He'd likely
get himself killed.

249
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,534
Mumen rider:
There's nothing to fear.

250
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,668
Charanko: Huh?

251
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,903
Mumen rider: You're forgetting.

252
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,940
He's a hero.

253
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,874
Sourface: It's so annoying!

254
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,411
If I'd have known
that garou would be expelled,

255
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,613
then I'd never
have left the dojo.

256
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,080
And, if that were the case,

257
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,483
you know who master bang's
top disciple would be.

258
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,152
All sourface, baby.

259
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,821
What you think?
Wanna relive old times

260
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,391
and practice choke-holds
'til you black out again?

261
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,893
Saitama: You left
the dojo, right?

262
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,562
Sourface: So what?

263
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,031
Sourface: Well,
I took on garou by myself.

264
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,568
That's why I'm here,
to get rid of that guy for good.

265
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,971
And if he keeps up
his hero hunting,

266
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,705
we're gonna meet one day.

267
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,842
What I'm trying to say here
is someone who runs off

268
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,710
shouldn't be acting
like a big shot.

269
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,780
( Sourface growls )

270
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,115
You're gonna eat those words.
You hear me?

271
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:53,585
The super fight
is a one-day tournament.

272
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,721
If by some miraculous chance
you win and move up,

273
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,923
then we'll meet in the ring.

274
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:02,126
When we do, you're
gonna learn a hard lesson.

275
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:06,131
You'll find out what it's like
to be in a real fight.

276
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:06,665
( Door slams )

277
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,438
Saitama: A real fight, huh?

278
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,811
I honestly don't remember
what they're like.

279
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,150
Boy: Did you see that, papa?!

280
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,086
He sure showed those monsters!

281
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,955
Executive: Let me snap a pic,
as the kids say.

282
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,624
Metal bat:
Hey, it's still dangerous.

283
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,792
I gotta get you back.

284
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,561
Centipede:
Venus peopletrap and I

285
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,896
were no match for you,

286
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:41,834
but we knew that before
the fighting ever started.

287
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:46,104
You are truly a class-s hero,
metal bat. No doubt about it.

288
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,307
Yet the strong
often become delusional

289
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,843
and mistakenly believe

290
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,178
they're at the top
of the food chain.

291
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,048
I believed that myself once.

292
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,716
Metal bat: You sure do die slow.

293
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,852
Want me to finish you off?

294
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,187
Centipede:
When centisempai appeared,

295
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:05,057
I knew how wrong I was.

296
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,497
( Rubble crashing )

297
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,401
- Metal bat: Another one of you?
- ( Both whimper )

298
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,071
Centisempai:
Rest now, little one.

299
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,974
I will avenge you.

300
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,009
( Boy yelps )

301
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,811
That thing is so gross!

302
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,881
Metal bat: This one
won't be as easy to squash.

303
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,150
( Executive gasps )

304
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,952
What's that odor?

305
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,987
( Gags )

306
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,690
( Metal bat gasps )

307
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,792
¶

308
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,036
Looks like these things
have nothing to do with garou.

309
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,640
Whatever!
No use thinking about it!

310
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:00,044
Just smash 'em
and be done with it!

311
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,180
Mumen rider: That's right!
No matter what terror he faces,

312
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,648
he stands up and fights!

313
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:04,917
- Charanko: Uh...
- Mumen rider: That's why

314
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,319
you don't have
to worry about saitama.

315
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,720
Charanko: Uh...

316
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,054
Mumen rider: He's not like that.

317
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,856
He'd never use a false identity

318
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,992
and break the rules.
He's a hero!

319
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,193
Charanko: Uh, well,

320
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,330
I guess I'll take
your word for it.

321
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,999
Mumen rider: Good call!

322
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,134
( Saitama sneezes )

323
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,602

I hate killing time.

326
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,145
Boy: And this one
is watchdog man.

327
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,879
- Cute, isn't he?
- ( Garou chuckles )

328
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,415
Just looks like a guy
in a dog suit to me.

329
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,751
So is he tough?

330
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,085
Boy: Well, of course he is.

331
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,887
He's a class-s hero.

332
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,023
Garou: Class s, rank 12, huh?

333
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,159
Boy: He keeps watch over city q

334
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,694
from his lookout
in watchdog Plaza.

335
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,230
You can always find him
hanging out there.

is currently
engaging the monster.

to move indoors quickly.

Hurry up, and get home.

359
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,293
Centisempai: No wonder
he could beat centikohai.

360
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,830
Metal bat: What are
you disgusting bugs after?

361
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,165
What could they
possibly be worth to you?

362

( Lafreshidon chuckles )

363
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,168
How about this?

364
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,704
Defeat us, and we may tell you.

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,089
Gah!

Did he just hit himself?

377
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,879
Centisempai: Huh?

378
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,247
He's out of his mind!

( Gasps )

380
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,153
Metal bat: There!

381
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,354
That cleared my head.

382

( Centisempai gasps )

383
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,758
He's become even more powerful?

384
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,493
Lafreshidon: How was he able

385
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:04,162
to clear
the sedative so quickly?!

386
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,030
It's not possible!

387
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
Metal bat:
Once my fighting spirit's up,

388
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,101
I can take almost anything.

389
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,168
( Both gasp )

390
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,704
Metal bat:
You know, you really

391
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,872
slapped the hell
out of me just now.

392
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,242
But I'm nice,
so I'll let you two

393
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,043
off the hook easy!

394
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,044
( Lafreshidon screams )

395
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:21,380
Metal bat: Just one whack each,

396
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,315
and we'll call it even!

397

It's been a while
since I had to try that hard.

400
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,466
( Gasps ) Ah, crap!

401
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:44,002
I forgot to find out
what they were after!

402
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,671
Way to space on that one.

403
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,006
- ( Both snoring )
- Metal bat: Doesn't look

404
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,407
like the nimrods were hurt.

405
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,276
Wake up, you two!

406
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,345
Maybe a good smack'll
get you moving.

407
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,346
Hmm?

408
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,814
Hero: We're here to help!

409
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,883
Hero #2: We'll fight
those monsters with you!

410

Metal bat: Sorry,
but you missed the party.

411
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,622
( Both gasp ) What?!

412
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,157
( Man sighs )

413
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,760
Crisis averted.
Thank you, metal bat.

414
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,629
The director and his son
are safe and sound. Hmm?

415
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,498
- What? Something wrong?
- Man #2: I don't like this.

416
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:17,235
Centisempai and centikohai
appeared so close together,

417
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,303
which can only mean--

418
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,438
man #1: No, it can't be!

419
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,173
Man #2: How long has it been?

420
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,907
Two years? Maybe less?

421
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:25,243
- If he appears again--
- man #1: Right.

422
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,912
A few heroes
would never stand a chance.

423
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:29,314
The entire city
will be leveled.

Pineapple: Wait. Is that--

426
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,793
it's the giant bug monster,
centichoro!

427
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:44,663
That thing
is threat level dragon!

428
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,465
Metal bat: Dragon, huh?

429
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,600
Mohican: I'll request
some class-s assistance.

430
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:50,268
Let's wait for backup.

431
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,404
Metal bat: The bastard's here
for those two.

432
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:55,174
Get them to safety
while I keep this creep busy.

433
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,609
Get a move on!

434
00:17:57,678 --> 00:17:58,943
Mohican: You got it!

435
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:00,479
Metal bat: Now, then...

436
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,114
How do you wanna do this?

437
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,484
Pineapple: Did he see us?!
I can't really tell!

Centichoro: You won't escape!

439
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:11,757
Metal bat:
Get the hell out of here!

440
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,161
Mohican: Don't look back!
Just keep going!

( Metal bat sighs )

447
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,516
Full-swing hit, and it
didn't even scratch him,

448
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,453
but the bastard protected
his face-thing when I went in.

449
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,256
That's where I need to bash it.

Fighting spirit...

457
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,945
Dragon pummeling!

Mohican: Screw this!
Level dragon's insane!

463

Mankind was never meant

Let's get out of here!

473
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:48,120
Garou: Well, well.
Everyone's all excited.

474
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,255
Threat level dragon
gets announced,

475
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:52,190
and, boom,
suddenly it's a party.

476
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,127
I wonder if metal bat
will still be alive

477
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,395
by the time I find him.

478
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:58,530
Huh?

479
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:02,601
Metal bat?

480
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,137
How'd he--

481
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,739
oh, that's how.

482
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:08,407
( Scoffs )

483
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,610
So some other monster
got to beat up a class-s, huh?

484
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,478
- I wasted my time.
- ( Metal bat groans )

485
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,347
Back to the grind.

486
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,617
( Garou stammers )
Metal bat, hold up!

487
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,485
- You're not dead yet?
- Metal bat: Huh?

00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:23,221
Garou: You being alive
changes things.

489
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,823
( Laughs )

490
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,225
My second class-s hero.

491
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,694
From here on, you face me.

492
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,763
I'm hunting you.

493
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,631
Metal bat: Huh?
Get real, dipshit.

494
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,100
Can't you see that centipede?

495
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:36,268
Get your ass--

496

497
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,643
now I see. You're that guy
who's been running around,

498
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,511
calling himself a hero hunter.

499
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,780
Garou: Damn right.

500
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,448
This monster won't fall to you.

501
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,383
( Chuckles )

502
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,786
Metal bat: You can see
I'm busy here.

503
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:56,855
But, sure,
I can spare a little time

504
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,425
and crack you wide open.

505
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,361
( Singing in Japanese )

506

is at threat level dragon.

507
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,235
Woman #2: Think everyone'll
be okay there?

508
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,438
Man: Ladies, pardon me.
Got a question for you.

509
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:48,573
Headed to super fight?

510
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,642
If so, would you mind
if I tag along?

511
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,244
Woman #2: Wait. Aren't you--

512
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,245
woman #1: It's him!
