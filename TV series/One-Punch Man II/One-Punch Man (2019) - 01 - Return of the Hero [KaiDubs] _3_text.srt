2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,804
Genos: Master...

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,005
Where should we go next?

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,941
Saitama: Uh, let's see.

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,675
We got the hot-pot ingredients,

6
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,811
so I guess that leaves
the toilet paper

7
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,313
and sham...Poo.

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,583
Uh...

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:19,952
Wow.

10
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,887
I guess popularity
gets you places.

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,889
His own action figure.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,558
Must be awesome.

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,961
Genos: I will contact
the toy companies.

14
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,963
Saitama: Nah.
This is a "don't call us,

15
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,765
we'll call you" situation.

16
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,432
Let's roll.

17
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,700
Genos: Right!

18
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,702
But, master, where to, exactly?

19
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,437
- ( Woman screams )
- ( Crowd gasping )

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,373
- Man: What the hell is that?!
- ( Monster chuckles )

21
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,841
( Growls )

22
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,777
My obsession with reptiles

23
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,645
ended up turning me into one.

24
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,647
Feast your eyes
upon the great tongue-stretcher!

25
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:49,714
- ( Woman whimpers )
- ( Tongue-stretcher laughs )

26
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,450
Man: It's a monster! Run!

27
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,386
Tongue-stretcher: All you pretty
young things are mine now.

28
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,721
You're gonna bear my brood!

29
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,058
- ( Woman whimpers )
- ( Tongue-stretcher babbles )

30
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,463
¶

31
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,930
where the hell
did you come from?!

32
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,800
( Loud thumping )

33
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,469
Whoa. What's that aura?

34
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,305
( Gasps ) And that face!

35
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,876
H-He's no ordinary man.

36
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,411
King: Not again.

37
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,480
I'm so tired of being a hero.

38
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:22,747
Man #2: That hero's
supposed to be

39
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,282
the strongest man on earth!

40
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,950
- He'll save us for sure!
- Man #3: It's king!

41
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,552
Tongue-stretcher:
No wonder he looks familiar!

42
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:28,887
This dude's a living legend!

43
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,622
Man #4: He'll take you out
with one punch!

44
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,824
Woman #2: Can I
have your autograph?!

45
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,157
Man #3: King! King!

46
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,427
Crowd: King! King! King!

47
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,961
- ( Tongue-stretcher whimpers )
- King! King!

48
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,964
King! King! King!

49
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,500
Tongue-stretcher:
I'm so, so sorry

50
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,101
for what I've done, Mr. King!

51
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,503
Man #5: Way to go, king!

52
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,038
Woman #3: Gross pervert.

53
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,039
Women: Super gross.

54
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,973
Man #6: Teach him
a lesson, king!

55
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,975
King: How did it come to this?

56
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,111
Man #7: That's right! Get on
your knees, and apologize!

57
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,047
- Man #8: King's the real deal!
- Man #9: Are you here

58
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,849
because you sensed
the monster's presence, king?

59
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,917
King: No. I was just
out shopping, and I happened--

60
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,586
Man #10: Hey, hold up!
Who are you to question king?

61
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,922
- You better back off!
- King: It's okay. I don't--

62
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,257
Man #11: May I shake your hand?

63
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,393
King: I have things to do.

64
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,928
Would you mind
letting me through?

65
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,463
Man #11: Ooh, we're so sorry.

66
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,666
Man #9: Make way!
Give him some room!

67
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,470
Clerk: Enjoy your new game!

68
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,405
King: Finally got a copy.

69
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,542
"Heartbeat hottie sisters 2,"
limited edition.

70
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,810
Nothing like that feeling
on the walk home

71
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,480
after you buy a game
you've been waiting for.

72
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,416
Can't wait to get back home
and play it.

73
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,351
( Chuckles )

74
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,556
Genos: Master,
that man appears to be king.

75
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,424
Saitama: Who?

76
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,627
Genos: One of the heroes
from the class-s meeting.

77
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,763
King: I've been
waiting three years

78
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,931
for this sequel.

79
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,535
My body is ready!

80
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,773
Genos: King.

81
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,109
He managed to outrank you
quickly, master,

82
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,444
and claimed the title
of strongest hero.

83
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,713
Saitama: Huh.

84
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,447
Genos: It is strange.

85
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,449
I wonder what brings him
to this part of town.

86
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,517
( Woman screams )

87
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,719
It's a monster!

88
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,453
- ( Saitama grunts )
- ( Crowd yelling )

89
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,588
Genos: Another monster.

90
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,589
Master, we should--

91
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,857
no, wait.

92
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,661
This might be a good opportunity
to observe king's capabilities.

93
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,230
We shall see what he does.

94
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,001
G-4: My moniker is g-4,

95
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,537
a machine god
created by the organization.

96
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,673
You are class-s hero king.

97
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,475
Prepare to be liquidated.

98
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,611
Man: Look! Over there!
King'll save us!

99
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,547
King: You seem to know
my rank and hero class,

100
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,018
yet you still choose to face
the man who's seventh ranked?

101
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,957
G-4: Killing you
is the reason I've come.

102
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,094
( Loud thumping )

103
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,630
( Man #2 gasps )
What the heck is that sound?

104
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,832
Man #3: You don't know
about the king engine?

105
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:57,035
It's the sound you hear
when king goes into battle.

106
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,703
They say there's
not a single monster

107
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,372
who's heard it and survived.

108
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,707
G-4: Our battle
will serve as a live test

109
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,709
of my combat a.I. Systems.

110
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,712
To collect accurate data,
I expect your full strength.

111
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,982
( King thinking )
So this thing is a robot?

112
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,384
Built by "the organization"?

113
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,518
What's he talking about?

114
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,920
( Aloud ) Very well,

115
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,990
but I'm gonna have
to drop a deuce first.

116
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,792
When I have to hold it in,

117
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,527
I can only exert
50% of my power,

118
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,364
and that would throw off
your data, wouldn't it?

119
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,400
G-4: I will wait ten minutes.

120
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,737
For every minute beyond that,
ten humans will die.

121
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,539
- Understood?
- ( Crowd screaming )

122
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,409
Saitama: That's
one tough-looking monster.

123
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,744
Genos: Actually, master,
that is a robot,

124
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,814
quite a powerful one, too,

125
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,017
possibly more capable than me,

126
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,085
a troublesome foe
that I would estimate

127
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,488
at threat level demon, at least.

128
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,558
What will king's strategy be
against such a formidable enemy?

129
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,495
King: So you've come
to kill me, have you?

130
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,629
( Whimpers )

131
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,498
( Panting )

132
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,966
Why is this happening to me?!

133
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,903
I'm scared! Scared, damn it!

134
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,438
I'm not a strong hero!

135
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,575
I'm just an unemployed
29-year-old otaku loser!

136
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,712
The whole king engine thing
is just my heart pounding!

137
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,713
I'm a coward, okay?!

138
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,483
Twice--no, ten times over!

139
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,585
Rampaging monsters just show up

140
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,255
wherever I go! Then,
while I look the other way,

141
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,590
someone else defeats them!

142
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,761
And somehow this keeps
happening over and over!

143
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,864
That's all it is!

144
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,999
Before I knew it, I was sent
a class-s hero certificate,

145
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,536
and they were calling me
the "strongest new hero."

146
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,937
- What a joke.
- ( Stomach gurgling )

147
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,940
It's my bad for not denying it
from the get-go,

148
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,876
but I never dreamed
it'd come to this.

149
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,611
( Shuddering )

150
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,746
( Gags )

151
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:49,548
I'm so screwed.

152
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,749
I'm no hero.

153
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,017
( Boom )

154
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,953
( Gasps, whimpers )

155
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,890
- Here it comes.
- ( Rattling )

156
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,825
Think! There's gotta
be a way out of this!

157
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,826
( Boom )

158
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,562
There's no way out of this!

159
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,963
No robot's afraid of my name!

160
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,765
If I fight, I'm a dead man!

161
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:07,766
- ( Boom )

Hey, genos,
you need a hand, or...

170
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,739
Genos: No! You gave me a goal

171
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,409
to be one of the top 10 heroes
in class s!

He is mine!

that I'm a class-s hero,
aren't you?

213
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,766
Saitama: Yeah, totally.
I mean, you're king, right?

Hmm. You know,
you don't exactly seem

like the type that would
play this sort of game.

Looks like a fun one.

00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,587
King: Huh?
Oh, that's a cool action game!

224

Saitama: Do you control a robot?

225

- King: Yeah, exactly!
- Saitama: Oh.

226

King: That's actually
my kind of game.

I thought this was
an action title, too,

but it turned out to be
a stupid romance game.

Damn, I bought the wrong one!

230
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,467
Saitama: It says "heartbeat

King: I thought it said
"heartblood hatred slayers"!

Oh, I've been scammed!
I'm tossing it!

play this one.

That one's way better!

Wait. What? You actually
want to play with me?

You've got nothing to do, right?

I mean, I outrank him by a lot.

239
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,620
He's pretty pushy
for a class-b hero.

Why'd you hotfoot it
away from that robot monster?

That's why I initially
followed you here, to ask,

265
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,957
but then you were
playing games, so...

Are you bored
of fighting monsters?

00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,310
( Crumbling )

322
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,113
Saitama: You are gonna
fight this thing, right?

323
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,647
King: You've got it wrong!

324
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,383
The king the public adores
isn't me at all!

325
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,520
There's no choice.
I have to tell him!

326
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,588
If I don't...

327
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,323
( Wails )

328
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,325
Listen. I'm--

329
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,527
( monster roaring )

330
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,003
Saitama: Wait. Really?

331
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,272
Your reputation
and record as a hero

332
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,342
- is just a bunch of lies?
- ( King gasps )

333
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,144
Saitama: So when
you wet your pants

334
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,414
after the bird appeared,
that was for real?

335
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,349
King: How's he
still standing there?

336
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,350
Where's the bird?

337
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,418
D-Did he--huh?!

338
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,553
Saitama: You okay, man?

339
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,088
( King gasps )

340
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,656
( Crowd screaming )

341
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,229
( Young king screaming )

342
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,698
- Help! Somebody, please!
- Saitama: Hey, easy there.

343
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,233
I took care of that monster.

344
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,836
- ( King shrieking )
- Saitama: Is your eye okay?

345
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:58,971
Try to open it.

346
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,640
( King sighs )

347
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,441
- Saitama: Can you see?
- King: Huh?

348
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,111
Who are you?

349
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,046
Saitama: Me?

350
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:12,184
Well, you know, just someone
trying to be a hero for fun.

351
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,519
( King gasps )
You've been wounded.

352
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,255
Saitama: Nah,
it's not as bad as it looks.

353
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,059
( Laughs ) Plus,
victory takes the sting off.

354
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,195
King: Wait a minute.

355
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,664
It's...you.

356
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:30,202
( Sobbing )

357
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:33,005
Saitama: Hey, what's the matter?

358
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,207
King: I'm so sorry!

359
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,609
( Weeping )

360
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,612
Saitama: Is it fun for you
or something,

361
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,816
telling lies about being a hero
and running away?

362
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,750
King: No, not at all.

363
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,286
Saitama: Well, it's none
of my business, really.

364
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,288
I'm not gonna lecture you
or anything.

365
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,756
King: Um...

366
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,358
I might have gotten some credit

367
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,161
that should have
actually gone to you.

368
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,096
Saitama: The issue here
isn't about who gets the credit.

369
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,166
You're everyone's hero now,
understand?

370
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,501
King: No, I'm just a nobody.

371
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,503
Saitama: How that came to be
doesn't matter.

372
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:07,506
Everyone thinks you're
the strongest hero there is.

373
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,708
So tell me,

374
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,776
are you gonna
keep lying about it

375
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,111
or quit being a hero?

376
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,714
King: I can't find
the courage to decide.

377
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,783
Saitama: Well, I mean,
why don't you just get strong?

378
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,386
- King: Huh?
- Saitama: I'm heading out.

379
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,387
See ya.

380
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,389
King: Hold on a second.

381
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,557
So you're not angry?

382
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,594
You worked so hard
to become a hero,

383
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,329
while I just...

384
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,166
Saitama: I'll drop by again
to play games. Cool?

385
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,135
King: Hey!

386
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,103
Yeah...

387
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,809
Sure.

388
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,078
Genos: Dr. Kuseno...

389
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:49,347
This came from a machine god
called g-4.

390
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:53,085
It possessed incredible power
and a highly advanced a.I.

391
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,087
If any of its components
are compatible,

392
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,821
please install them on me.

393
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,356
Dr. Kuseno: But this is a--

394
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,826
genos, how did you
obtain this thing?

395
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,963
Genos: Listen. I have
to become stronger, doctor.

396
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:08,567
Dr. Kuseno: Very well, then,
Genos. I'll look into it.

397
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,970
There are still places
where we can improve you.

398
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,171
Genos: I appreciate it.

399
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,574
Dr. Kuseno:
Now you listen to me.

400
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:18,310
I know you became a cyborg
to pursue justice,

401
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,712
but you mustn't
take it too far.

402
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,248
Genos: No. Pushing my limits
comes with the job.

403
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:27,586
My current goal is to make it
to the top 10 of class s.

404
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,254
Dr. Kuseno:
Yes, the reckless goal

405
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,190
set by your mentor,
if I recall correctly.

406
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,226
I had a feeling
that you would mention it.

407
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,997
We'll discuss that later,
but, speaking of cyborgs,

408
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,133
have you been able
to find any clues

409
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,735
concerning the one
that destroyed your hometown?

410
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,736
( Genos sighs )

411
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,605
Dr. Kuseno: It seems lately

412
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,274
you've been more focused
on being a hero.

413
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,210
Genos: No, sir. No clues
regarding that incident.

414
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,746
Dr. Kuseno: How unfortunate.

415
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,149
- Even so--
- Genos: I have not forgotten.

416
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,351
That rogue cyborg
has attacked several towns

417
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,153
and killed many people.

418
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,555
No matter what,
I will find him

419
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,691
and tear him apart
with my own hands,

420
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,093
whatever it takes. I swear it.

421
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,564
Dr. Kuseno: He has become a hero
and found a mentor,

422
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,833
yet the relentless hatred
remains.

423
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:19,171
I only ask because
I'm worried about you, genos.

424
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,707
I am on the trail
of that murderous cyborg as well

425
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,778
and painfully aware
of how dangerous he can be.

426
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,714
If you should encounter him,
just don't do anything rash.

427
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,250
Instead, you should
contact me immediately.

428
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,920
You are coolheaded
and quite intelligent,

429
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:39,124
but the passions of youth
can lead one to ruin.

430
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,126
Do not try to fight him alone.

431
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:44,329
Genos: I understand
and will obey.

432
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,466
That battle,
we must fight together.

433
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:51,269
Sitch: I lead
the hero association

434
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,139
earthdoom prophecy
emergency response team.

435
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,274
You can call me sitch.
Pleasure to meet you.

436
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,344
Let me begin
by thanking all of you,

437
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,279
the members
of the criminal underworld,

438
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,482
for answering
our call to be here today.

439
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,750
As I mentioned
in the invitation,

440
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,753
nothing of your nefarious pasts,
records, or activities

441
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:09,954
will be discussed here.

442
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,691
This is not a trap of any sort.

443
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,627
The heroes beside me
are only here for my protection.

444
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,562
Criminal: Did he say, "heroes"?

445
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,964
Criminal #2: Sounds like fun.
We'll kill 'em dead.

446
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,633
Sitch: They will take no actions

447
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,369
unless you decide
to do something foolish.

448
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:28,907
Criminal #3: Like take over your
little hq here? ( Chuckles )

449
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,176
Hero: I see wanted men
with bounties on their heads,

450
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,111
top assassins, and fugitives

451
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,980
I don't understand.
Why would sitch invite

452
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,183
such wretched scum
into our sacred hq?

453
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,984
Hero #2: To be perfectly honest,

454
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,986
I don't give a damn
why they're here,

455
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,989
but seeing these dirtbags
laugh it up is pissing me off.

456
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,592
Hero #3: At the first sign
of trouble, I'm letting loose.

457
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:48,927
They'll get no mercy.

458
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:51,864
Sitch: I have three
class-a heroes as protection,

459
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,599
each with class-s combat skills.

460
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:55,934
With them here, I doubt anyone

461
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,803
would be stupid enough
to try anything.

462
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:01,005
Okay, let's get this meeting
under way, shall we?

463
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,274
- Criminal #4 :Hold it.
- Sitch: Huh?

464
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:05,210
Criminal #4: Where is
the hero called Saitama?

465
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,612
Doesn't he live in this building
with the other heroes?

466
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,082
Sitch: Hmm?
And who might you be?

467
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:13,818
Either way, please save
unrelated topics for later.

468
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:15,688
What I have to say is important.

469
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,489
Criminal #4:
So he won't be here.

470
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:18,823
Guess I'll be leaving, then.

471
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:19,892
Blue fire: Think you can leave

472
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,626
without hearing
what we have to say?

473
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,896
You came, so you're
staying 'til this is over.

474
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,699
Criminal #4: "Occurrences
of tiger-level threats and above

475
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,767
"are increasing in frequency.

476
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,035
"This month, levels
are six times the average

00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,750
So that's why
you called us here?

498
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,219
You can count me out.

499
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,288
Sitch: Wh-why, that--

500
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,824
I didn't hand those out yet.
How did he--

501
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,760
Sonic: If I had to sit around

502
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,228
and play hero
with you do-gooders,

503
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,631
I'd puke my guts out for sure.

( Sitch growls )

505
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,971
Sonic: Damn.
What a complete waste of time.

506
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,572
It was a good opportunity

507
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,841
for an outsider
to slip into hero hq,

508
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:45,043
but that doesn't help
when all I know

509
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:49,314
is his name, face,
and that he's class b, rank 33.

510
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,049
Man: This guy? For real?

511
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,652
Man #2: I don't believe it.

512
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,320
Blizzard: It's true.

513
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,990
Don't let that goofy
profile picture fool you.

514
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,126
His scores were the highest ever
recorded on the physical tests.

515
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,661
Men: Miss blizzard!

516

no further notable reports

of achievements in the field,

518
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:09,001
he Rose from class c
to class b,

519
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:10,869
and so soon after his debut.

520
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:13,605
There's something
about this man.

521
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,141
Sonic: He has to be
hiding something,

522
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,610
a secret to his strength.

523
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:23,615
Blizzard: The first thing
we'll need to do is locate him.

524
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,949
Men: Right!

525
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,285
Sonic: I'll make sure
I find him,

526
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:28,821
and then he'll regret

527
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,156
making a fool
of speed-o'-sound Sonic.

528
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,891
He'll pay double
for doing it twice.

529
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:35,093
Blizzard: We're coming
for you, Saitama.

530
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,829
Sonic: You're a dead man.

531
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,598
Both: Just you wait!

532
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,103
Saitama: Hey, why are you
taking all the items?

533
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:46,771
Quit hoarding everything.

534
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,707
King: Hey, if you snooze,
you're gonna lose, dude.

535
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:49,842
Saitama: This is
co-op play, dumb-ass.

536
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,376
I haven't gotten
one power-up yet.

537
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,111
We can't beat the boss
like this.

538
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:55,180
King: I'm pretty sure
I can handle him without you.

539
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,181
( Crunch )

540
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,916
Saitama: Eh...

541
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,784
Uh, the controller broke.

542
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:00,619
King: What?!
