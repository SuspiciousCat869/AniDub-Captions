I'm here to answer it.

00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,612

You fought hard on your own.

You, little man?! ( Laughs )

00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,602
You've gotta be shitting me!

25
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,872
( Laughs ) More like a puny runt
out to make a name for himself.

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,475
Pathetic! You have no idea

27
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,477
how outclassed you are,
chrome-dome!

This time around,

00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,358
bakuzan the monster
will be the victor!

Bakuzan: I can't believe
you're still standing.

00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,510
Impressive,
but, after that blow,

41
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,912
you've seen the unimaginable
difference in our strength.

42
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,216
Bear killer mid-kick!

43

Suiryu: Is he
protecting the injured?

44
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,253
He'll be slaughtered.

45

Hey! You gotta

Must have gone into shock
or something.

52
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,471
Time to end this.

53
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,407
I'll get rid of all of you
in one fell swoop!

Meh.

61
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,827
really sucked for you
after winning the tournament.

62
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,029
Well, maybe, next time,

63
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,899
there'll be
less monsters around.

64
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,701
Suiryu: Uh, yeah,

65
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,770
and thanks for saving me
and everything.

66
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,706
Tell me, who are you,
I mean, really?

67
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,042
Saitama: I'm saitama.
I'm a hero.

68
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,645
Suiryu: Saitama? So...

69
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,047
That means charanko
was just an alias, wasn't it?

70
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,583
Saitama: Uh, crap.

71
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,586
Suiryu: I don't get it.
What were you doing here?

72
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,455
Some undercover mission
for the hero association?

73
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,925
Saitama: No. I wanted
to experience martial arts

74
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,793
and bag that prize money.

75
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,330
There's this guy
calling himself a hero hunter.

76
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,333
They say
he's a martial arts master,

77
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,535
so it kinda piqued my interest,
you know?

78
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,605
Suiryu: I see. You were looking
for ways to counter him.

79
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,341
Saitama: Well, I wouldn't
exactly say that was the reason.

80
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,477
I just happened upon
an entry ticket.

81
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,813
And, to be completely honest...

82
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,150
- ( Music stops )
- I was bored.

83
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,884
Suiryu:
You've gotta be kidding me.

84
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,422
Still,
it's thanks to you I'm alive.

85
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,690
Saitama: Sorry I
didn't get here sooner.

86
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,026
- Suiryu: Wait! Saitama...
- Saitama: Huh?

87
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,028
Suiryu: Please,
you shouldn't go out there.

88
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,830
There's this group raising hell.

89
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,498
They call themselves
the monster association,

90
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,566
and they're bad news.

91
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,368
- Saitama: For real?
- Suiryu: Yeah.

92
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,436
And what's worse
is that they have the ability

93
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,038
to transform humans
into monsters, too.

94
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,641
That guy you just beat
was one of them.

95
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,843
Remember bakuzan,
your second match?

96
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,979
Saitama: Oh,
so that's who he was.

97
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,513
I mean, it's hard for me

98
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,715
to remember
every opponent I punch.

99
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,718
Suiryu: The point is, it's
dangerous out there right now.

100
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,587
I think it's best if we lay low.

101
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,656
Goketsu's out there.
We should avoid him.

102
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,591
Saitama: Goketsu?

103
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,527
Suiryu: Another monster
that used to be human.

104
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,063
I threw everything I had at him,

105
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,665
but it didn't do a damn thing.

106
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,668
That strength, it was horrific.

107
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,804
( Rotors whirring )

108
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,738
Genos: When my repairs are done,

109
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,073
I must return at once.

110
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,941
Even if he caught me off-guard,

111
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,478
a monster that can beat me
with one punch

112
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,613
must not be allowed to survive.

113
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,082
I need to assemble
the class-s heroes

114
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,752
with master saitama,
then strike together.

115
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,154
Saitama: So this guy's
pretty strong, huh?

116
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,557
Suiryu: Even with
the most meticulous preparation,

117
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,159
I'm not sure
if anyone can beat him.

118
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,160
Saitama: I see.

119
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,163
So where did this monster go?

120
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,432
Suiryu: Um, through that wall.

121
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,700
Saitama: Ah.

122
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,635
So all that noise earlier
was him, huh?

123
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,504
I'll check it out.

124
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,706
Suiryu: No!
Weren't you listening to me?

125
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,042
I told you! He's unstoppable!

126
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,844
Saitama: I heard you. No prob.

127
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,778
Suiryu: You still
don't get it, do you?!

128
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:17,516
Goketsu was once a famous
and exceptional martial artist.

129
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,784
He's dangerous.
You'll be killed for sure!

130
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,521
Saitama: Whoa.
A martial arts master, huh?

131
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,989
Perfect. It might help
my indigestion.

132
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,725
- ( Suiryu groans )
- Saitama: Uh...

133
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,594
Hey, you're injured.
Take it easy.

134
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,063
Suiryu: I'm not letting go.

135
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,366
I won't let you throw away
your life when I owe you mine!

136
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,937
( Groaning )

137

139
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:55,620
( Grunts )
I just couldn't stop him.

140
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,056
( Sighs )

141
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,024
( Boom )

142
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,026
- I think I get it now.
- ( Booming continues )

143
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:06,030
I finally understand
what it means to be a true hero!

144
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,166
And now he's going
to throw his life away.

145
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,834
What a waste.

146
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,705
Saitama was destined
to save so many more people.

147
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,239
( Crying )

148
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,607
( Gasps )

149
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,984
Saitama: Oh, by the way,

150
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,120
there's something
I forgot to mention earlier.

151
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,123
That thing about me lying
to get into the tournament,

152
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,524
( whispering )
Could we keep it a secret?

153
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,859
Suiryu: Uh...

154
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,130
So was goketsu
tough to take down?

155
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,865
Saitama: Well, when they
only take one punch,

156
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,667
it's kinda hard to compare.

157
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,937
Suiryu: There's something else
I want to ask you.

158
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,538
Saitama: What's up?

159
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,807
Suiryu: I don't know
if I could overcome my fear,

160
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,009
but I'd like to try,
and, if I did,

161
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,146
do you think
I can become a hero?

162
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,748
- Saitama: I don't know.
- Suiryu: Huh?

163
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,551
Saitama: But, you know,
if I became one,

164
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,953
then I think maybe anybody can.

165
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:04,222
It's natural
to be afraid at the start.

166
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,226
I mean, before I got too strong,
I was scared, too.

167
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,028
Suiryu: A hero who's too strong?

168
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,631
Not bad. Not bad.

169
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,101
Oh! Can I ask you
another question, saitama?

170
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,770
- Saitama: Sure.
- ( Suiryu chuckles )

171
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,104
Could I be your disciple?

172
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,105
( Saitama chuckles )

173
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,575
Absolutely not.

174
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,243
¶

175
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,779
puri-puri prisoner: Damn it.

176
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,181
His whole body's
covered in spikes.

177
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,583
How do I fight him?

178
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,251
Man: Prisoner!
Don't use your hands on him!

179
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Man 2: Use your ball and chain
to pound him senseless!

180
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,121
Man 1: Yeah!
Make him hug your ball!

181
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,991
Puri-puri prisoner:
Hmm? I thank you

182
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,993
for your words
of encouragement, gentlemen.

183
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,127
You'll get kisses
of gratitude later,

184
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,997
but, for now,
I must insist that you flee!

185
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,932
Man 3: No use.
He can't hear a word.

186
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:50,803
Man 1: So, does he have
to fight completely naked, or...

187
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,271
Puri-puri prisoner:
You fresh-faced boys so bravely

188
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,209
cheering me on like this,
your love will not be forgotten!

189
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,144
Love! ( Gasps )

190
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,681
That's it. That's the answer.

191
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,950
I can accept the pain
with love so deep

192
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,754
there will be
nothing left to fear!

193
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,223
( Monster groans )

194
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,291
Puri-puri prisoner: Angel hug!

195
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,860
- ( Cracking )
- ( Monster screaming )

196
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:19,832
Puri-puri prisoner: Love!

197
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,766
Man 4: He keeps staring at us...

198
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,035
Bloody and naked.

199
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,302
( Cell phone buzzing )

200
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,104
Puri-puri prisoner: Yes, hello.

201
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,239
You've got puri-puri.

202
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,174
What?

203
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:33,111
It broke into my comfy,
cozy home and stole my honeys?

204
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,614
- ( Crack )
- And where is this monster now?

205
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,784
- Saitama: They're gone?
- Hero: Yeah.

206
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:43,121
They all left together
about 30 minutes ago.

207
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,789
Saitama: So they
arrived as a group,

208
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,392
went crazy,
and then left all at once?

209
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,128
What were they up to?

210
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:54,666
Damn it. How did I miss
such a huge disaster?

211
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,669
The other heroes
were out here fighting.

212
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,404
Man, what was I thinking?

213
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,407
Crushing monsters
is my job, right?

214
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,209
( Grunts ) Wait a second.

215
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,280
I don't fight monsters
just because I wanted a job.

216
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,148
That's not it at all.

217
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,218
I might have forgotten
something important,

218
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,820
like the reason I became a hero
in the first place

219
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,758
I mean, I started out
just having fun,

220
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,227
but, since joining
the hero association,

221
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:25,029
I've been bored out of my mind.

222
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,233
That hero-hunter guy
got me curious again.

223
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,769
That's the reason I entered
the martial arts tournament.

224
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,774
But, against suiryu
and the others,

225
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,177
even against a monster
who was a master martial artist,

226
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,114
I didn't really feel anything.

227
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,982
I didn't get
anything out of it.

228
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,719
- ( Brakes squeal )
- King: Saitama. Hey.

229
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,720
Saitama: Hmm?

230
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,389
Hey, king.

231
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,924
( Wind blowing )

232
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,326
Are you sure
it's safe to be out here?

233
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,729
King: Well, I heard
all those alarms going off,

234
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,464
but it seems to be
pretty quiet now.

235
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,267
What's wrong?
You look kinda bummed.

236
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,870
Saitama: I, uh--
I got a lot on my mind.

237
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,073
King: I get it,
but, hey, you're still young.

238
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,875
- Don't go giving up yet.
- Saitama: Thanks, man.

239
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,877
King: I mean,
there's still a decent chance

240
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,079
it might grow back. Plus, uh,
there are treatments--

241
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,281
saitama: Whoa, whoa! Wait a sec!

242
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,482
That's not
what I'm talking about!

243
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,352
It's more
of a big-picture thing.

244
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,820
King: Ah, gotcha.

245
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,155
But being down isn't like you.

246
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,889
You're always so strong.

247
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,891
Saitama: Well, I'm not
gonna be getting any stronger.

248
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,094
- I know that much.
- King: What?

249
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:32,030
Saitama: I'm saying
I've become too strong.

250
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,833
No matter who I fight,
I don't feel anything.

251
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,835
I gain nothing from it.

252
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,436
There's nothing
I can learn from anyone,

253
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,372
- so what's the point?
- King: I don't know, man.

254
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,374
This is just me talking,
but isn't having

255
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,842
that much strength
kind of awesome?

256
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,377
Saitama: Maybe, but...

257
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:47,512
Not having any room
to learn and grow

258
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,113
means there's no way for me

259
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,249
to enjoy the process
of learning and growing.

260
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,386
No matter
how many enemies I face

261
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:58,824
or monsters I defeat,
I'm just bored out of my mind.

262
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,862
I never thought being a hero
could be so lonesome.

263
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,198
King: So you feel lonely,
saitama?

264
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,000
Saitama: Guess I do.

265
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,802
King: There's a ballroom
dance school near the station

266
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,470
you could check out,
if you want.

267
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,138
Saitama: Why would I do that?

268
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,474
King: If you're lonely,
you could make some new friends.

269
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,477
Saitama: No, that's not
exactly what I'm talking about.

270
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,878
King: What, then?

271
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,346
Saitama: It's kinda
hard to explain.

272
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,147
I'm not interested,

273
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,283
and I don't have
much time these days.

274
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,551
King: Well,
once things settle down,

275
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,553
how about taking a trip
for a change of pace?

276
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,490
Saitama: A trip? Hmm.

277
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,291
There's not really
anywhere I wanna go.

278
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,427
( King sighs )
Good grief, dude.

279
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:38,497
You say you're bored and you're
looking for some excitement,

280
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,433
but then you won't take on
any new challenges or anything.

281
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,102
There was a time
I felt that way, too.

282
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,238
- ( Saitama gasps )
- King: Listen to me.

283
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,973
Life is simply
a journey to nowhere.

284
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,309
If you want a change of scenery,

285
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,512
you need to get there
your own way.

286
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,247
Saitama: This is
starting to sound hokey.

287
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,450
King: It seems to me
you've got this all wrong.

288
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,854
You think being strong means
you've reached your destination.

289
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,189
I doubt the path
to becoming a hero

290
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,925
comes to an end with such
a cut-and-dried finish line.

291
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,528
( Saitama groans )
Are you trying to lecture me?

292
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,329
It's not like
you're some veteran hero.

293
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,066
King: It's inherently wrong
to go into a fight

294
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,268
seeking satisfaction
from the fight itself.

295
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,072
Battling with great courage,
working to benefit society,

296
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,607
isn't that what it means
to be a hero?

297
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,409
Saitama:
What's with the philosophy?

298
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,946
King: If that ideal
is your goal, you've just begun.

299
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,214
There's a long road to walk

300
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,482
before you become
the strongest hero.

301
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,551
( Saitama gasps ) That's true.

302
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,219
King: Which means
that the pursuit

303
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,354
of that ideal still remains.

304
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,622
Within you, saitama,

305
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,292
there is a great deal
of unrealized potential.

306
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,628
If that's true, to say
that you've already reached

307
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,298
the limit of your growth,
well, that starts to sound

308
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,966
shallow and arrogant,
now, doesn't it?

309
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,368
Saitama: That's deep.

310
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,369
( King clears throat )

311
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,306
What does it actually take
to be the ultimate hero?

312
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,041
Is it an unwavering
sense of justice?

313
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,511
The courage
to face any hardship?

314
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,114
Until you've found the answer
to that question,

315
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,649
how can you say you feel bored?

316
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:08,320
Those are
my thoughts on it, anyway.

317
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,054
Plus I read it in a manga.

318
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,257
Saitama: Wow.
You just blew my mind

319
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,660
the "ultimate hero."

320
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,331
Maybe I should be thinking
about what that truly means.

321
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,400
Honestly, that might
make me even more bored.

322
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,602
King: If you're
really that bored,

323
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,404
then wanna come over
and play some games?

324
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,673
Saitama: Nah, that's totally
not what I'm feeling right now.

325
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,943
I'm numb, and nothing's
gonna change that.

326
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,411
King: Come on. It'll take
your mind off things, dude.

327
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,213
Sometimes you wanna lose, right?

328
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,615
So I'll let you lose.

329
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,416
Saitama: Ha ha!
You can't trick me.

330
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,752
Besides, it's not
like I'd get upset

331
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,087
just because I lost some game.

332
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,158
Yep, I feel totally
emptied out right now.

333
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,226
King: Yeah? Tell you what.

334
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,094
Just to keep things fair,

335
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,164
how 'bout I play
with one finger from each hand?

336
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,498
Saitama: That's it, jerk-off!

337
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,367
I'm gonna crush your ass
this time!

338
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,570
¶

339
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,639
garou: I never thought
he'd be the one to beat me.

340
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,178
His speed and power
were exceptional.

341
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,180
It was far more
than I'd bargained for.

342
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,915
I was lucky just to get away.

343
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,718
Martial arts
designed for human opponents

344
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,455
were a poor match against
his four-legged fighting style.

345
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,391
That was a good lesson.

346
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,126
( Chuckles )

347
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,328
This is the freaking best.

348
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,730
I know I can become
so much stronger.

349
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,199
¶

350
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,034
huh? Is that...

351
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,336
Yeah, it's him.

352
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:34,339
I won't get a second chance.

353
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,475
My body can handle it.

354
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,010
The pain is gone.

355
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,746
In fact, I'm so stoked,
I'm drowning in power.

356
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:45,350
King, prepare to be hunted!

357
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,085
What will his first move be?

358
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,620
I can't wait to find out!

359
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,156
Here goes! Get ready to die!

360
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,057
King: Huh?

361
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,093
( Rubble falling )

362
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,762
Saitama: That dude was trying
to attack you. You know him?

363
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,764
King: Nope.
Never seen that guy before.

364
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:02,300
Saitama: Fighting monsters
is bad enough.

365
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,037
Now we gotta fight hoodlums,
too? Give me a break.

366
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:08,773
That reminds me, have you
heard about everything going on?

367
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,042
King: What are
you talking about?

368
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,510
Saitama: I don't know
all the details,

369
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,112
but monsters
are rampaging like crazy,

370
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:17,582
and there's some guy out there
calling himself a hero hunter?

371
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,451
It's been pretty busy lately.

372
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,785
King: Sounds like it.

373
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:22,654
Saitama: That hero-hunter dude

374
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,123
- does have me kinda curious
- king: Yeah?

375
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:28,060
Saitama: As far as I know,
there's never been a human

376
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,662
who calls himself
a monster before.

377
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,596
Reminds me of my early days,

378
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,599
when I was calling myself a hero
and doing my own thing.

379
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,670
So I'm hoping
he lives up to his claim.

380
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:40,672
He might even
be stronger than me, you know?

381
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:43,509
King: Might be.
Hope you run into him soon.

382
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,119
¶

383
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,189
Sonic: Show yourself.

384
00:15:58,626 --> 00:15:59,558
Who are y--

385
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:02,361
two of them.

386
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:05,431
You fools came and attacked me,

387
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,900
so I assume you're ready to die!

388
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:14,773
Man: "Attacked"?

389
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:17,509
That sounds so unfriendly.

390
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,378
Man 2: Wouldn't you agree,
speed-o'-sound Sonic,

391
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,715
last surviving member
of the final 44?

392
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:26,184
( Sonic gasps )
Wait. You're from the village?

393
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,720
Man 2: We're of the golden 37.

394
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,188
I am tempest wind.

395
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,324
Man 1: I am hellfire flame.

396
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,660
Sonic:
What's your business with me?

397
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:35,794
Tempest wind: To recruit you.

398
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:38,396
Interested in doing
something big?

399
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:39,665
Sonic: How big are you talking?

400
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,333
Tempest wind: Listen.

401
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,669
We're planning on taking over
this little planet.

402
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,738
We'll conquer it as monsters
who transcend mankind.

403
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:49,074
Hellfire flame: There's
a new group for monsters only.

404
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,609
It's called
the monster association.

405
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,545
Tempest wind and I are members.

406
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,281
We plan on flipping
this entire world on its head.

407
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,485
Sonic: Sounds like
a bunch of horseshit to me.

408
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,419
Where would I fit in
to all this?

409
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,688
Tempest wind:
We want to be certain

410
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:06,224
that we can take down
flashy flash. You could help.

411
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,693
Sonic: Sure I could,

412
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,362
but I'm not interested
in helping or your stupid games.

413
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,565
Get lost,
unless you prefer to die.

414
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,567
Tempest wind: Let's give him
a taste of what we can do.

415
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,837
Hellfire flame: We said,
"monster association," remember?

416
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:20,105
That's because...

417
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,640
Tempest wind: We are monsters!

418
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:25,643
You can be a monster, too.

419
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,779
Hellfire flame: It is better
than any enhancement drug

420
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,247
or mere implant.

421
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,716
( Sonic shuddering )

422
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,185
Tempest wind: The thought
of getting stronger

423
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,452
tempts you, doesn't it?

424
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,654
This is a monster cell.

425
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,391
All you have to do to transform
is ingest it.

426
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,194
Here. You can have this one.

427
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:45,030
The monster association awaits.

428
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,603
Sonic: No matter
how hard I train,

429
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,540
I see no path
that ends in me beating him.

430
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:57,475
I'd pay any price
to defeat saitama,

431
00:17:57,545 --> 00:18:01,880
but now that price
is giving up my humanity.

432
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,149
When I lost to him,
I felt as if

433
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,817
there were no difference
between life and death,

434
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:10,422
and I have no attachments
to my human self.

435
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,759
Saitama, I've decided
to be a monster.

436
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,628
Woman: A few monsters
remain in some areas,

437
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,898
so we can't lift
the evacuation order just yet.

438
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,167
Man: It has been
one hell of a day.

439
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,903
Woman: The toughest of those
remaining is martial gorilla.

440
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:27,373
He seems obsessed
with his own threat level

441
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,376
and declares he'll keep fighting
until he's raised to demon.

442
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,644
Man: City w, huh?

443
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,913
Have the heroes nearby
surround the city.

444
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,248
- Zombieman: No need.
- Man: Huh?

445
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,849
Zombieman:
Don't bother sending in

446
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,718
a bunch of fresh meat.
It's a waste of resources.

447
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,254
Man: Zombieman?!

448
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,521
Zombieman: Just leave
everything to me.

449
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:45,457
Man: R-Roger!

450
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,925
Zombieman: Time to get to work.

451
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:49,327
Martial gorilla: Hey!
Now where the hell did all...

452
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,662
Zombieman: If I'm reading
this situation right

453
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:54,866
these attacks were masterminded
by something organized.

454
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,335
He's not paying attention.

455
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,537
Perhaps I could track him
back to his lair

456
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,672
martial gorilla: Hmm?

457
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:03,475
Well, there's
a sturdy-looking fellow.

458
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,278
Zombieman: Drat.
He's going after a citizen.

459
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,480
Martial gorilla:
Are you a pro hero, big guy?

460
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,615
Armored gorilla: Sorry?

461
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,216
Martial gorilla:
Holy crap! A gorilla!

462
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:13,819
Armored gorilla: Yeah,
and you're a gorilla, too.

463
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,353
Martial gorilla:
What are you, anyway,

464
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,755
some freelance monster?

465
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,824
Armored gorilla: What the hell
are you talking about?

466
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,426
I'm just out running errands
and buying groceries.

467
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,828
Martial gorilla:
You're out shopping?

468
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,497
What kind of monster
pretends to live like a human?

469
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,299
You're a disgrace
to gorilla monsters.

470
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,835
Armored gorilla: Uh, I'm not
sure what I should say here.

471
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,837
Martial gorilla:
I see you as a potential enemy,

472
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:35,373
so you have to die! ( Gasps )

473
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,708
( Groans )

474
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:39,345
Armored gorilla: Take
your weird issues elsewhere.

475
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,580
Zombieman: Changing target.

476
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,782
I'm following him instead

477
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,453
bomb: We've been
searching all day,

478
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,254
but, in the end,
all we accomplished

479
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,589
was disposing of some monsters,

480
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,992
though I do understand
that's your day job, of course.

481
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,662
A question for you--

482
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,397
in the midst of all
this panic and chaos,

483
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,600
is it possible some hero
or monster got to garou?

484
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,936
Bang: No, that's not
what happened, brother.

485
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:08,340
Garou is many things,
but weak is not one of them.

486
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,608
- ( Bomb sighs )
- Bang: I trained him.

487
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:14,012
That's why it's
my responsibility to defeat him.

488
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:16,281
Garou...

489
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,018
Do you know what it means
to become a monster?

490
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,620
If you're going down
into darkness,

491
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,290
at least let it be at my hands.

492
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:31,697
Bomb: It seems
the sun will be setting soon.

493
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,766
Man: We've received a vital
report from drive knight.

494
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:36,768
It concerns
this monster association.

495
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,704
They are our new enemy.

496
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,173
While their objectives
are uncertain,

497
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,042
they're clearly positioning
themselves as our rivals,

498
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,845
implementing a method for
turning humans into monsters.

499
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,848
Their leader is known
as the "monster king," orochi.

500
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,384
We've also received
the approximate location

501
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,921
of their lair. It's city z's
abandoned ghost town.

502
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,056
Man 2: The area
that was taken by the monsters.

503
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,726
Man 3: This monster association
went through a lot of trouble

504
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,460
to kidnap an executive's son.

505
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,796
Perhaps it means
they want to negotiate.

506
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:06,732
Man 4: Yes.
It's their way of saying,

507
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,401
"don't try anything stupid."
Perhaps they're hoping

508
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,403
they can talk their way
out of extermination.

509
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,339
Anything's possible.

510
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:15,673
Man 3: There's a thought.
If the ghost town monsters

511
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:18,476
formed some sort of coalition,
that would add up.

512
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,812
Sitch: The kidnapping,
the riots, the chaos,

513
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:22,614
everything that happened
could have been

514
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,416
their way of staging a protest.

515
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,352
These aren't random acts.

516
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,619
These monsters possess

517
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:28,754
the intellect and will

518
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:30,622
to act as a group.

519
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,891
I feel the likelihood
that they will reach out to us

520
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:34,025
is extremely high.

521
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:36,895
Man 2: That's not
a bad strategy.

522
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:38,030
We could end this,

523
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:40,032
approach them as a ruse,
then wipe them out.

524
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,768
Woman: Let's hear
what they have to say first.

525
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:46,037
Our primary objective remains
the safe return of the hostage.

526
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:48,506
Man 5: Correct.
Esteemed advisor narinki

527
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:50,576
is by far one of our top donors.

528
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:54,112
If anything happened to his son,
he would surely cut us off.

529
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:56,382
The boy must be rescued. Hmm?

530
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,717
Man 6: We've received a message
from the monster association!

531
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,388
We've received a message
from the monster association!

532
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:03,721
Sitch: What is it?

533
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:04,722
Man 6: We've received
a message...

534
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,392
Man 4: Tell us!

535
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,126
Man 5: I think
something's wrong with him.

536
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,527
Man 6: We've received a message

537
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,597
from the monster association.

538
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,933
We've received a message--
( Screams )

539
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,868
Monster: I said
we've received a message

540
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:19,004
from the monster association.

541
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:23,909
( Sizzling )

542
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:25,377
¶

543
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:33,751
Sonic: I'm sure it was the right
call to cook this thing.

544
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,020
Common sense says it's not safe

545
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:37,756
to eat meat like this
while it's still raw.

546
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:40,959
I'll try not to think about it.

547
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,028
( Laughs )

548
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:45,163
I'm coming for you, saitama.

549
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,032
Watch your back.

550
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,071
