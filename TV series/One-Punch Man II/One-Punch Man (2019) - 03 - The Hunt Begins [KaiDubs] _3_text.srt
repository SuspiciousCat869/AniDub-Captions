have you learned nothing

When first
I made you my disciple,

00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,348
I said to train
like your life depended on it.

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,952
I don't think your skills
will ever improve.

You've no talent
for the martial arts!

You are hereby

Charanko: That's right.

00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,668
He changed my training
to full-contact, and he--

27

he beat me mercilessly.

He'd been so kindhearted before.

There's something going on.

And I was hoping
you guys would know

what that something might be.

32

00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,319
but we're kinda trying
to play games here.

Charanko:
I guess the group has grown.

37
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,359
Genos: However,
I can make an educated guess.

38
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,960
It probably
has to do with garou.

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,696
Charanko: Garou?!

40
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,964
The guy who was
kicked out of our dojo?

41
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:40,965
What'd he do?

42
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,234
Genos: I see.

43
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,569
So you have not heard,
I take it?

44
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,771
Garou is now known
as a criminal.

45
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,973
He has been added
to the association's wanted list

46
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,375
as a violent monster.

47
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,577
Bang himself has volunteered
to take him down.

48
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,646
Charanko: A monster?! Garou?!

49
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,716
Genos: Apparently
there was an incident at hq.

50
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,252
The association has been
keeping it under wraps,

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,254
but, should
a violent battle ensue,

52
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,256
it could quickly
spin out of control.

53
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,925
Perhaps that is the reason
why bang pushed you away.

54
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,262
Charanko: I had no idea.

55
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,930
So master bang...

56
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,432
Considers me a burden?

57
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,001
Genos: But that is
simply my hypothesis.

58
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,002
Your thoughts, master?

59
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,404
Saitama: I don't know, man.

60
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,273
I mean, it's not like
I know the old dude

61
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,275

"Silverfang"...

63
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,546
Now, that's a cool hero name.

64
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,749
How'd I get stuck
with caped baldy?

65
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,619
There's still one thing
bothering me, though.

68
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,022
Genos: Charanko, a pissant

69
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,425
who is bang's
current top disciple, master.

70
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,426
You two have met.

71
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,662
Saitama: Huh? For real?

72
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,902
Charanko: I just can't
allow myself to be a burden.

73
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,971
For the sake of my master,
I need to stop garou.

74
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,376
But it's not like he's
gonna pop up right next to me.

( Groans )

76
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,780
And even if I did manage
to find him, I'd only--

77
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,415
- ( bicycle brakes squeal )
- Garou: Hey, numb-nuts.

78
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,852
You're a hero, right?

79
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:08,853
Mumen rider: Yes, indeed.

80
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,455
I'm called mumen rider.

81
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,657
- Garou: Time to hunt.
- Mumen rider: Hunt?

82
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,459
What on earth
are you talking about?

83
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,661
This entire discussion
is a bit odd.

84
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,464
Garou: To complete my evolution
into a monster,

85
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,466
I need prey like you.

86
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,935
( Tank top vegetarian growls )
There you are.

87
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,002
Garou: Huh?

88
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,870
Hero: You sure this is the guy?

89
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,005
Vegetarian: Oh, I'm sure.

90
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,508

00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,345

tank top vegetarian?

93
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,949
I left you
within an inch of your life,

94
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,550
and now you
throw that life away?

95
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,885
That's some next-level stupid.

96
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,622
Your musclehead friends
won't be leaving alive, either.

You got lucky, freak!

I'll have you know

123
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,630
I bid farewell

125
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,502
to come

126
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,504
and, for that,
you have my thanks.

Bomb: Well, if we don't stop
that garou fellow,

128
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,976
he'll come after my dojo
soon enough.

129
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,645
Of course I came!

130
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,780
Bang: We must be careful
with this one, brother.

131
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,050
You cannot imagine
how fierce and powerful

132
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,718
that wretch
may have become by now.

133
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,121
Bomb: Certainly fierce enough
to call for my assistance.

134
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,457
Tank top tiger: Yeah!
Another tank top punch!

135
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,659
- How'd you like that?!
- Tank top blackhole: Whew!

136
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,993
When he survived
master's tackle,

137
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,529
I was scared for a second!

138
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,597
Hero #1: This won't
take long at all! Get him!

139
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,533
Tank top master:
One thing's for certain.

140
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,468
He is human.

141
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,205
But then, why?

142
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,475
Why are my senses telling me
to kill him here and now?

143
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,210
( Garou gags )

144
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,679
Tank top master: Enough.

145
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,813
- Garou: Huh?
- Tank top master: Time to die!

146
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,884
Mumen rider: No! Stop!

147
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,218
( Gags )

148
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,487
Tank top master:
Why'd you stop me?

149
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,022
( Mumen rider gasps )
Have you forgotten who you are?

150
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,692
A class-s hero on the verge
of killing a human?

151
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,026
You already won the fight!

152
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,028
We're supposed
to protect people!

153
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,698
Tank top tiger:
This bastard attacked a hero!

154
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,700
- It's his own damn fault!
- Blackhole: Stay out of it!

155
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,501
We'll teach him
not to mess with the tank tops.

156
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,769
Tank top master:
Pipe down. That's enough.

157
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,105
What he says is true.

158
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,508
I didn't earn the right
to wear the tank top of a hero

159
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,577
so I could do harm to humans.

160
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,579
Listen up.

161
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,949
Let this be a lesson
to never harm others again.

162
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,051
Garou: Yeah, all right.

163
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,053
I'm leaving.

164
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,955
Sorry for the trouble.

165
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,858
Like hell!

166
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,528
I'm gonna slaughter
every last one of you bitches!

167
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,931
Tank top master:
That's too bad, but expected.

168
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,866
You die right here, right now!

169
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,603
- ( Gags )
- Garou: Damn.

170
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,204
Looks like it slipped out.

171
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,874
I try to avoid using
the old geezer's style.

172
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:50,676
Eh, whatevs.

173
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,619
Tank top master: No way.

174
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,021
He was hiding his true strength?

175
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,756
Garou: Imagine that.

176
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,759
A class-s hero
down on his knees.

177
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,894
Tank top master:
Don't think you've won.

178
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,696
You caught me off guard is all.

179
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,831
- ( Groans )
- ( Garou laughs )

180
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,833
Shut up,
and stay right where you are.

181
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,969
You got a front-row seat

182
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,571
to see garou the monster
murder all your bros.

183
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,974
Tank top master: Garou? Oh, no!

184
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,777
He's that human
who calls himself a monster!

185
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,780
No, please! Don't do it!

186
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:28,781
Leave them alone!

187
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,715
Mumen rider: Justice crash!

188
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,785
♫

189
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,522
( gagging )

190
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,260
Garou: Now...

191
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,796
Which one of you is next?

192
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:44,797
( Heroes gasping )

193
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,700
( Tank top master roars )

194
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,337
Garou: That fighting style
of yours is pretty predictable.

195
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,206
( Tank top master gasps )

196
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,209
Garou: You're all done,
tank top master.

197
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:01,145
Right. All that's left
is a little cleanup.

198
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,881
Hero #1: You cocky scumbag!

199
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,651
Let's see how you do against
a whole legion of tank tops!

200
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,024
Hero #3: Damn you!

201
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,762
- ( Heroes gasp )
- ( Garou chuckles )

202
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,698
- ( Heroes gagging )
- ( Blows striking )

203
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,841
( Hero shrieks )

204
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,575
Charanko: That's enough, garou!

205
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,245
You're a disgrace to the dojo!

206
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,779
Take this!

207
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:35,781
Fist of flowing water crush...

208
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,058
Bang: It seems
we have arrived too late.

209
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,727
Bomb: Truly a horrible sight
to behold.

210
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,262
So tell me,

211
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,033
do you have any idea
what garou's next move might be?

212
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,002
What's wrong?

213
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,508
Bang: Charanko.

214
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,010
Hero: I heard a rumor
that the hero hunter

215
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,812
took down tank top master.

216
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,415
Hero #2: No way.
He defeated a class-s hero?

217
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,350
Hero #1: I heard
tank top's disciples

218
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,887
and mumen rider
were all beat to hell, too.

219
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,223
Hero #2: So he's hunting heroes
from class s and class c?

220
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,758
What are we supposed to do?

221
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,760
Hero #3: Come on. Show
a little backbone, will you?

222
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,027
How about the three of us

223
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,029
capture this "hero hunter"
ourselves?

224
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,098
Hero #2: Yeah, right.

225
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,900
Hero #1: He beat
a class-s, remember?

226
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,768
Hero #3: Yeah,
but think about it.

227
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,704
This dude
isn't some scary monster.

228
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,772
He's just a tough human being.

229
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,308
Hero #2: Yeah, but he learned
how to fight from silverfang.

230
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,111
Hero #3: Well, I happen to know
a little martial arts myself.

231
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,379
If an opponent comes at you
like this, deflect!

232
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,116
Attack from the front?
First you dodge, then punch!

233
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,385
And if he managed
to drop in on you from above,

234
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,320
- kapo--
- ( Hero #2 whimpers )

235
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,454
Hero #1: Hi, sir!

236
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,123
Mumen rider: I can't believe

237
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,925
you came all this way
to see me.

238
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,127
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

239
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,662
Saitama: Sure. Picked up
some bananas on the way.

240
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,131
Mumen rider:
Ah, that sounds great.

241
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,401
Oh, they're for you, then.

242
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,137
Saitama: I read about
everything that happened

243
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,606
in the hero association
newsletter.

244
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,941
Mmm.

245
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,743
It said that dozens of heroes

246
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,145
were beaten by a single
butt-kicking monster.

247
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,813
Lucky you survived, huh?

248
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,414
Here. Have a banana.

249
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,283
Mumen rider:
It was a human that did it.

250
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,618
Saitama: What?

251
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,886
Mumen rider:
But he called himself a monster,

252
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,223
and he was tough as hell,
scary strong for a human being.

253
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,159
Saitama: Was he stronger
than that fish-monster thing

254
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,294
- we faced before?
- Mumen rider: Huh.

255
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,030
While deep sea king
was insanely tough,

256
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,032
this guy was different somehow.

257
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,033
Saitama: Oh?

258
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,835
Tank top master: His moves,

259
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,037
they're sophisticated
martial arts techniques.

260
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,440
It seems silverfang
raised a true monster

261
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,642
when he trained
that freakin' guy.

262
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,311
Saitama: Uh, who's this guy

263
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,781
that butted in
to our conversation?

264
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,849
Mumen rider: What?
That's tank top master,

265
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,451
- the class-s hero.
- Saitama: Oh, right!

266
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,186
He was in the newspaper.

267
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,054
It said he took
the worst beating of all.

268
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,389
( Tank top master scoffs )
At least say

269
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,924
that I put up
the best fight! Damn.

270
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:02,461
I never imagined
I'd lose to a punk like him.

271
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,797
Those martial arts he used
were brutal as hell.

272
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,331
Saitama: Martial arts?

273
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,266
- How 'bout a banana?
- Tank top master: Huh?

274
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,135
Uh, okay.

275
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,270
Saitama: So, this monster guy,

276
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,073
think maybe
you could give me the deets?

277
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,177
( Wind blows )

278
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,014
- Garou: Hey there, kid.
- Boy: Huh?

279
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,016
Garou: That's
an interesting-looking book

280
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:24,983
you got there.

281
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:29,822
( Heroes groaning )

282
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,824
Boy: This blonde guy is king.

283
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:32,957
He's a class-s hero.

284
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,493
He's the strongest ever.

285
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,962
And this is lightning genji,
a class-a hero.

286
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,499
I see him patrolling around
my neighborhood all the time.

287
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,434
I got his autograph. See?

288
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,903
( Garou laughs )
Yeah, so you did.

289
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,372
I want his autograph, too.

290
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,307
You think maybe
you could help me find him?

291
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,843
Boy: For sure.

292
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,911
So you're into heroes,
too, mister?

293
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,914
Garou: That hero almanac
is pretty cool.

294
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,517
Say, you think I could
borrow it for a week or so?

295
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,720
Boy: No way!
Get your own if you want one.

296
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,790
Garou: Don't be all stingy!
What's with these kids?

297
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,195
Whoa! Look at that!

298
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:13,131
It lists all the monsters, too.
Now, that's exciting.

299
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,868
Boy: What?
You like the monster pages?

300
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,070
But they're so scary. Uh...

301
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,205
Garou: The scarier, the better.

302
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,940
These guys are way cooler.

303
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,275
Boy: You're kidding.

304
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,210
That's some weird taste, mister.

305
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,478
Garou: Aw, man.

306
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,214
I wish I were listed
in this book.

307
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,482
Boy: You wanna be a hero?

308
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,417
Me, too. Same here,

309
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,486
but I suck at sports and stuff.

310
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,889
Garou: That's probably
for the best.

311
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,957
Boy: That really
wasn't very nice.

312
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,094
Garou: Well, it's patrol time.

313
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,428
I better get going.

314
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,365
According to that almanac,
golden ball from class a

315
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,301
shows up at his usual pub
around this time.

316
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,103
Catch you later, turd.

317
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,439
Boy: Be careful on patrol,
mister. See you.

318
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,374
Garou: I will. By the way,

319
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,910
don't call me "mister." Got it?

320
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,912
I'm not some old grandpa.

321
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,180
Boy: Huh? Sorry.
You say something, mister?

322
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,250
Garou: It's like that, huh?
Go home, runt.

323
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,786
Tank top master: He was fast.
He parried, sidestepped,

324
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,922
or slipped through
every attack I threw at him,

325
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,323
and he was able to read

326
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,391
any attempt I made
at throws and counters.

327
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,929
His moves reflect his opponent's
power back at double strength.

328
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,532
They target pressure points
and joints, any weaknesses.

329
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:24,068
Where he strikes, you suffer
a loss of physical function.

330
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,539
Most monsters rely on
their immense strength and size,

331
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,541
which they unleash
with extreme violence,

332
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,543
but garou is different.

333
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:35,280
His techniques are devised
for breaking humans.

334
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:37,015
In other words,

335
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,084
he's built for the sole purpose
of defeating heroes.

336
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,420
Saitama: Huh.

337
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,323
?

338
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,192
Saitama: Yeah.
Just feeling curious.

339
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,326
Thought I'd give it a shot.

340
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,596
Know anybody good? Uh, was it...

341
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,130
Chumpo?

342
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,131
Charanko:
It's charanko, damn it!

343
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,199
Saitama: Have a banana.

344
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,001
No hard feelings, okay?

345
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,603
Charanko: That's
a terrible place to put it!

346
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,272
( Sighs ) If you want help
learning martial arts,

347
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,940
you should ask master bang.

348
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,875
He seems to have
taken a liking to you, so--

349
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,877
saitama: Nah. I mean,

350
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,146
the old dude
might strain himself.

351
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,481
Charanko:
That's ageist and rude!

352
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,483
You can't just waltz
into a tournament

353
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,018
and challenge professionals.

354
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,220
First, you master
the basic forms.

355
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,555
No, may be best
to build stamina.

356
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,225
Running up and down a couple
hundred stairs would help.

357
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,094
Actually the dojo
could use a good cleaning.

358
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,430
Saitama: Look, if you don't
know anyone, just forget it.

359
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,763
Charanko: No! Wait a second!

360
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,565
- Saitama: Huh?
- Charanko: Just wait, okay?

361
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:31,102
There's a mixed-martial-arts
tournament I signed up for.

362
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,104
I'm pretty sure I still
have the admission ticket.

363
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,039
Here.

364
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,441
Saitama: It's all crumpled up.

365
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,375
Charanko: I registered to fight,

366
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,445
but I'm gonna have
to forfeit my spot.

367
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,113
This'll get you inside, though,

368
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,449
so take it,
and go watch the matches.

369
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,452
You'll get to observe
lots of fighting styles.

370
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,453
Saitama: Cool, man. Thanks.

371
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:49,121
( Echoing ) Staring.

372
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,456
You said you're
gonna forfeit, right?

373
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,923
Charanko: Well, yeah.
I'm injured.

374
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,460
Saitama: It says
the top prize is three million.

375
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,528
Charanko: Yeah.
I mean, it's a big tournament.

376
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,664
Saitama: Three million
is a nice chunk o' change.

377
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,132
Charanko: Just to be clear,

378
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,400
you can't enter
in someone else's place.

379
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,336
Hey. Are you listening?

380
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,473
Garou: You're the class-a hero,
golden ball, right?

381
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,074
Golden ball: Huh?

382
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,209
Garou: I'd like a word
with you, outside.

383
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,878
Golden ball:
I'm kinda drinking here.

384
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,412
Kick rocks.

385
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,613
What in the hell?!

386
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,215
Aw, man, you wasted it.

387
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,084
( Garou chuckles )

388
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,418
( Golden ball chuckles )

389
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,287
All right, then, tough guy.

390
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,223
There's a parking lot nearby.
We'll do it there.

391
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,093
- ( Footsteps shuffling )
- I've seen your kind before,

392
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:31,096
dweebs looking to take on
a professional hero.

393
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:32,564
( Groans )

394
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,632
If it's liquid courage
giving you brass balls,

395
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:35,834
better step off now.

396
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,103
While you can still walk,
that is.

397
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,172
Garou: Quiet down.
I'm not drunk.

398
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,074
But you're--

399
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:44,510
( gasps )

400
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,444
Bastard.

401
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:48,180
Golden ball:
Not too sharp, are you?

402
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,448
Some hero hunter.

403
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:53,785
How did tank top master lose
to a jerk-off like you?

404
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:56,588
See, I ain't too bad
at hunting, myself,

405
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,390
so I'll lay you out quick

406
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,992
and get me another beer!

407
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,528
Huh? ( Scoffs )

408
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,263
He read the trajectory
from my hand movement.

409
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,133
In that case,
try this on for size!

410
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,468
Rebound shot!

411
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,470
- ( Garou groans )
- Golden ball: Whoopsie.

412
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,540
You're lucky
nothing vital got hit.

413
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:17,275
So what do you think?
Ain't heroes incredible?

414
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,677
Garou: You think
that was just luck?

415
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,079
I'd say it's about
your coordination

416
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,281
being off
'cause you're hammered.

417
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,351
You're gonna wish you'd
finished me with that shot,

418
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,553
- 'cause now you're a dead man.
- Golden ball: Don't worry.

419
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:29,354
I got plenty of balls
left for you,

420
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,423
shape memory golden bullets!

421
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,291
Mode, multishot!

422
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,692
Killer move...

423
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,029
Golden breakout!

424
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:43,569
He's dodging all that
with minimal movement.

425
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:44,670
This guy's on another level.

426
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,706
Still, I got one last shot.

427
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,275
Better make it count!

428
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,546
( Gasps )

429
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,454
Garou: So what do you think?

430
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,989
Ain't monsters incredible?

431
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:06,124
It's over now.

432
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,325
Die.

433
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,693
Golden ball: Huh?

434
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,629
♫

435
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,403
Spring mustachio:
I didn't see you

436
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,137
in the pub for our rendezvous,

437
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,073
so I thought perhaps
you'd forgotten about our drink.

438
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,209
Garou: Class-a hero
spring mustachio. ( Scoffs )

439
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,344
Spring mustachio:
How kind of you to know.

440
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,814
And I presume you are
the much-rumored hero hunter.

441
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,748
Garou: We have a winner!

442
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,419
And your prize is that
you're gonna get crushed, too.

443
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,821
Golden ball: I managed
to injure his right leg,

444
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,490
so he'll be a little slow
on his footwork.

445
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,625
Spring mustachio: I see it.

446
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,226
Thank you
for the helpful information.

447
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:44,162
( Garou scoffs )
These are pretty tight quarters

448
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,897
for that pointy stick
you're waving around.

449
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,634
Spring mustachio:
Let's find out, shall we?

450
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:50,402
( Yelling )

451
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,241
Checkmate, old sport.

452
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,575
Hyah!

453
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,244
Tomboy!

454
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:05,717
Garou: Oh, yeah?

455
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,486
I think not!

456
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,056
( Spring mustachio groans )

457
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,258
- ( Gasping )
- Garou: Didn't you know?

458
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:17,162
Your fancy moves
are listed in the hero almanac.

459
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,799
Once I've got that info,
it's over.

460
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,336
Golden ball:
Listen up, you cocky dirtbag.

461
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,072
You've got the upper hand,
but even we managed to hurt you.

462
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,406
( Garou scoffs )

463
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,476
Oh, I'll be getting
much stronger.

464
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:33,278
If you think
you can take me down, go for it.

465
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,547
Until then,
I'll be as cocky as I want.

466
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
Woman: So the hero association

467
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,552
- makes lots of money, right?
- Man: Not true.

468
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,554
Don't talk nonsense, my dear.

469
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,491
It takes a lot of capital
to maintain peace around here.

470
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,359
We're not a for-profit company.

471
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,494
Woman: Then how were you able

472
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,295
- to buy me this?
- Man: Huh?

473
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:52,498
Woman #2: And you always
spend so much on us.

474
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,366
Man: Those are
just gestures for peace.

475
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,568
As a director
of the hero association,

476
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,171
having fun with you
is a necessary expenditure.

477
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,573
People like me who fight evil
on the front lines

478
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,441
must take every chance we get
to relax

479
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,843
if we're going to do our best.

480
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:06,378
Woman #1: "Relax," huh?

481
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,380
Do you need to "relax"
every day?

482
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:09,715
Man: Yes, I do.

483
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,783
Maybe next time,
I'll bring amai mask along.

484
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:13,185
- Woman #2: What?
- Woman #1: Are you serious?!

485
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,586
Woman #2: I'm, like,
his biggest fan!

486
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,588
Man: I'll introduce you
for a kiss on the cheek.

487
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,790
Woman #1: I don't know.
That seems kind of fishy.

488
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,592
Woman #2:
You really, really mean it?

489
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,394
Garou: Introduce him to me, too.

490
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:26,264
I'd be happy
to put a kiss on your cheek.

491
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,333
- ( Punch thumps )
- Woman #1: Come on. Just relax.

492
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,935
- ( Garou scoffs )
- Woman #2: It's for peace.

493
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,337
Garou: I was pumped after
hunting down those class as.

494
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,206
Now I feel
like I stepped in shit.

495
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,474
"Fighting evil
on the front line"?

496
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,675
What a load of crap.

497
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,477
Saitama: Oh, good. Finally.

498
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,946
- Garou: Hmm?
- Saitama: I've looked all day.

499
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,749
Garou: Was he tailing me?
Is he a hero, too?

500
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:46,418
Never seen that face before.

501
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,686
Probably some nobody
trying to climb the ranks

502
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,756
by catching a big fish like me.

503
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,558
But tables turn!

504
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,159
Saitama: Huh?

505
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:56,562
( Rumbling )

506
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,764
What's the big idea?

507
00:19:58,832 --> 00:19:59,965
Tryin' to rob me?

508
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,699
Who do you think you are?

509
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,770
Don't bother me
when I'm shopping.

510
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,172
( Garou groans )

511
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,776
Saitama: Excuse me.
I'd like this one.

512
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,444
Clerk: 3,000 yen, please.

513
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,646
Saitama: Kinda steep,
don't you think?

514
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,582
( Singing in japanese )

515
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,452
♫

516
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,855
( wig rustles )

517
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:02,628
- Saitama: Not too shabby.
- Genos: Master...

518
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,630
- ( Saitama gasps )
- Genos: Has it come to that?

519
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,298
Saitama: Hey,
it's not like that!

520
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,565
I'm not planning to wear a wig

521
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:08,767
the rest of my life
or anything!

522
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,502
Genos: Hello, doctor?
Genos here.

523
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,304
There is an emergency.

524
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,573
No. It has to do with
master saitama's condition.

525
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,776
Those reinforced
artificial hair fibers,

526
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,578
is it possible for them
to be grafted into living skin?

527
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,914
Yes. It appears
necessary after all.

528
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,183
Black hair-fibers
are available, correct?

529
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,518
How soon would you be able

530
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,986
to perform
the implant procedure?

531
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,456
I see. Wednesday next week?

532
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,858
All right, then.
Yes, I, too, will be there.

533
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:35,461
Understood. Begin preparations.

534
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,395
Thank you, doctor.

535
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:38,730
Master saitama!

536
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,332
Are you available
anytime next wednesday?

537
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,600
Saitama: Look, you can't
transplant hair fibers

538
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,069
into someone's head
without asking.

539
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:46,805
I'm using this to enter
a fighting tournament...

540
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,474
As charanko.

541
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,608
( Genos gasps ) This is today.

542
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,410
Saitama: Yep!

543
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,012
Just kinda curious.

544
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,882
Gonna see what's up with all
this martial-arts stuff.
