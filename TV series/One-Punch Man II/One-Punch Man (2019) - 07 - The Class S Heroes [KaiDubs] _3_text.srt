00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,601
Gyoro-gyoro:
The hero association

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,270
has been greatly weakened
by our onslaught,

3
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:07,739
yet our greatest weapons

4
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,208
still await
their turn to participate.

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,345
The monster association's
overwhelming victory

6
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:17,682
is imminent,
o monster king orochi!

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,486
The question is,
now that they are off-balance,

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:26,158
how will
the hero association respond?

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,332
I'm gonna pound the true spirit
of martial arts into you.

23

Come at me!

24

Announcer: Oww! What can I say?!

25
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,471
Single-blow charanko!

26
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,474
Our four semifinalists
are now set!

27
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,609
Which one will take home
the championship?

28
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,679
- ( Wig rustles )
- ( Saitama sighs )

29
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,215
Wearing this thing
makes my head all itchy.

Sourface: What are you doing?!
You're up!

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,219
Huh?

32
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,355
Why are you holding
your head like that?

33
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,691
- You nervous or something?
- Saitama: Oh. Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,426
Sourface: Well,
if I hadn't dropped my guard

35
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,495
during our bout,
then I'd be the one

36
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,497
trying to keep from trembling
before the finals.

37
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,766
The semifinal you just missed
was incredible.

38
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,436
Suiryu won again,
and with a single kick!

39
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,639
And now you have
another dangerous guy to face.

40
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,708
He's the dark horse
of this whole tournament,

41
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,443
if you ask me.

42
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,846
Watch yourself
out there, charanko.

43
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,382
Saitama: He's acting
like a good mentor to me now,

44
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,784
but I'm not who he thinks I am.

A group of monsters
is attacking watchdog plaza!

51
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:15,267
Man 2: They're what?!

52
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,735
Man 3: Other cities
are reporting in

53

as well, sir!

54

It's party time!

56
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,609
Amai mask: Hmm.

57
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,811
Hero: Stop!
Release those heroes!

58
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,947
Now you will face dogman!

60
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,354
is that all your poison can do?

61

Monster: Oh. So you're
not a living creature.

62
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,825
Dogman: Well, now that
you've figured that out...

63
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,928
- Monster: Huh?
- Dogman: Self-destruct!

64

( Monster laughs )

65
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,568
The pup's pilot must be nearby.

66
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,571
Man 2: Where's
the antivenom serum for city y?

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,306
Man 1: There's still
no word on it yet, sir.

68
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,707
Man 2: Damn it.

69
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,442
Man 4: It'll be okay.

70
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,644

Drive knight: Monsters are
appearing simultaneously

74
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,857
in cities across the country.

75
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,793
The hero association
lacks intel.

76
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,467
- Choose.
- ( Monster whimpers )

77
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,603
Drive knight: My tactical
transformations cause your death

78
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,671
by maximum excruciation,

79
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,908
or you die quickly and easily
by revealing all you know.

80
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,879
Amai mask: You had the gall
to interrupt my concert.

81
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,949
Now you die.

82
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:44,356
- Monster: I found you.

Monster: Sssso you're the one
controlling the robots.

84
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,029
Child emperor:
The toxin analysis is complete,

85

Child emperor: Pig god!

89
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,510
Pig god: I heard explosions

90
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,512
and figured
I'd see if I could help.

91

Child emperor: No!
She's poisonous!

94
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,919
I can cure it!

95
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,920

Eh...

99
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,930
Wait! The venom could still--

100
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,066
( pig god slurps ) Huh?

101
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,068
No problem. Tasty.

- ( Belches )
- Child emperor: Uh...

103
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,408
Man 1: Child emperor has sent
the antivenom formula!

104
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,610
Man 4: Good. Now we can help
those who need it most.

105
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:42,547
Man 2: Those class-s heroes
are truly miracle workers.

106
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,748
Announcer: It's now time

107
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,884
for the second round
of our semi-finals!

108
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,020
This is a must-see matchup--

109
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,822
choze, whose relentless attacks

110
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,825
have demolished
every opponent he's faced,

111
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,895
versus charanko, who has won
every match with a single blow!

112
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,030
Choze: Who cares?

113
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,899
Anyone can finish an opponent
with one hit.

114
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,169
I execute my opponents
at a leisurely pace

115
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,971
to showcase
my infinite superiority.

116
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,441
My infallible genes
have been passed down to me

117
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,177
by the countless
generations of my bloodline.

118
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:16,181
I am their culmination,
a genetic masterpiece!

119
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,919
I exist as a superior breed
beyond mere homo sapiens.

120
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,722
Here, I declare my dominance
for all to see,

121
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,791
but ultimately
this world is mine to rule!

122
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,461
Saitama: You sure
are a chatterbox.

123
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,796
So you're kinda like
g.M.O. Corn or something?

124
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,066
Choze: I will murder you.

125
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,601
Your pain will be exquisite,

126
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:37,802
your eyes filled with tears,

127
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:39,538
your mouth contorted in pain!

128
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:40,939
Referee: Begin!

129
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,007
- ( Saitama yawns )
- Announcer: Unbelievable!

130
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,544
Another single-hit knockout!

131
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,948
With that, charanko advances
unscathed to the finals!

132
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,750
Saitama: The tournament's
already over?

133
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,687
Announcer: His power
seems to know no bounds!

( Jet engine roaring )

135

the class-a heroes in city I!

136
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,695
Man 2: Get them backup!
Summon a class-s hero to--

- hero: Hold it!
- Man 2: Hmm?

138
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,900
Hero: I've been hiding
under the rubble...

139
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,238
Waiting for some reinforcements
to arrive.

140
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,574
Some class-a heroes
are now on the scene.

141
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,910
With these numbers,
we can handle this.

- Flashy flash: No. You'll fail.
- ( Heroes gasp )

Flashy flash: To fight a foe
with inadequate force

only heightens the damage
done to one's self.

Hero: Are you saying
we're inadequate?

this is causing

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,053
Hero 1: That's terrible tornado!

165
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,189
( Woman vocalizing )

166
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,223
( Tornado chuckles )

167
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,067
( Heroes scream )

168
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,604
¶

169
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,807
tornado: Hey! You there!

170
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,275
Why are you all standing around
like a bunch of idiots

171
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,211
when we're
so obviously shorthanded?!

172
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,013
Smile man: We were fighting
the octopus when--

173
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,747
tornado: I don't wanna hear it!

174
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,749
You especially, flashy flash.

175
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,351
I thought you were
supposed to be class s,

176
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,620
but now I'm not so sure!

177
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,754
Flashy flash: Hmm.

178
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,490
Tornado: Useless morons.

179
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,093
Flashy flash: Tough talk
from the airheaded woman

180
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,761
who dropped in
to steal my kill!

181
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,363
- Yeah, that's right.
- ( Smile man wailing )

182
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,899
- Flashy flash: You better run.
- Hero 3: What if she hears you?

183
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,301
You're gonna get
all of us in trouble!

184
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,969
( Flashy flash scoffs )

185
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,071
You forget yourself.

186
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,709
Hero 1: We couldn't
do a damn thing.

187
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,712
Gyoro-gyoro: As I predicted,

188
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,915
these class-s heroes
are most troublesome.

189
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,250
Orochi: It matters not.

190
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:42,121
We can make
any number of monsters.

191
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,027
Atomic samurai:
I'm sure you're all aware

192
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,829
of why I asked you to come.

193
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,698
It involves garou,
the hero hunter.

194
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,967
A search is under way.

195
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,104
Silverfang is
pursuing him, but...

196
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,174
It's possible garou
might defeat the old man.

197
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:07,112
Granted, silverfang
is highly skilled,

198
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,248
but he's facing
a former student.

199
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,450
He might go easy on the boy.

200
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,719
Therefore, we of
the holy order of the sword

201
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,188
will find garou first
and kill him.

202
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:19,925
We need numbers
to make that happen.

203
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,727
I am asking for your help.

204
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,996
You four are among the strongest
swordsmen in the order.

205
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,265
Swordsman: He must
be quite a threat

206
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,799
for you to ask such a thing

207
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,401
very well.

208
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,936
I'll send out my disciples.

209
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,137
Atomic samurai: Amahare.

210
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,872
Swordsman:
You were right to come to us.

211
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,074
- I will lend my blade.
- Atomic samurai: Zanbai.

212
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,477
Swordsman: You can consider it
as good as done.

213
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,478
Atomic samurai: Nichirin.

214
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,745
Thank you all.

215
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,147
I appreciate everyone's--hmm?

216
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,349
( Swordsman laughs )

217
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:48,019
You want the holy order
of the sword on crime watch?

218
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,754
Atomic samurai: Haragiri.

219
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,357
Haragiri: Our aim
is to achieve true skill.

220
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,025
Improving our art
is the only thing

221
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,760
that concerns the holy order.

222
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,762
Nichirin: I think you've had
quite too much to drink.

223
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,030
- Let's--
- haragiri: Silence.

224
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,232
I wasn't done
speaking my mind yet.

225
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,968
I've brought something special

226
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,971
( all gasp )

227
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,039
Haragiri: Monster cells.

228
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,241
By incorporating them
into your body,

229
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:13,044
you obtain power
beyond human limitations!

230
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,179
( All gasp )

231
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,982
Haragiri: Now we can
be monsters ourselves.

232
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,183
Zanbai: He's gone insane.

233
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,451
Amahare: Where'd you get these?

234
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,786
Haragiri: The monsters
have joined together

235
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,123
and formed
their very own association,

236
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,857
and they approached me
with an offer.

237
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:29,328
By surrendering my humanity,
I was allowed to join them

238
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,263
and was given strength
beyond the limits of this flesh.

239
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,865
Atomic samurai:
Oh, tell me you didn't.

240
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,266
Haragiri: I did!

241
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,935
I am no longer a mere human.

242
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:40,139
The power flowing through me
is incredible!

243
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,874
Now you all
must become monsters as well!

244
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,275
( Swordsmen gasp )

245
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:46,211
Atomic samurai:
You've lost your way, haragiri.

246
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,147
( Haragiri laughs )

247
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,414
With my quick draw talent,

248
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,818
you know I could behead
all four of you at once!

249
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,720
Anyone who refuses will die.

250
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,889
Atomic samurai: Unfortunate.

251
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,492
Haragiri: It is unfortunate,
atomic samurai,

252
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,829
for I was instructed
to kill you, regardless.

253
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:07,833
You have three seconds. Join me!
Devour the monster cells!

254
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,002
3, 2, 1...

255
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,904
Atomic samurai: Think not.

256
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,340
The rest of us
aren't fools like you.

257
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:22,014
( Birds chirping )

258
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,053
We're going.

259
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,189
But we have a new target,

260
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,324
the monster association.

261
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,926
Announcer: It's time!

262
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,262
Welcome to the super fight
final match!

263
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,066
The seedings had charanko
as an overwhelming underdog,

264
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,601
but from what we've seen,

265
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,537
we might have an incredible
upset on our hands!

266
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:48,874
( Crowd cheering )

267
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,076
Announcer: By the sound of it,
the fans in the stadium

268
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,212
know they're in
for something special here,

269
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,548
but this man's determination
remains unfazed!

270
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:59,350
It seems unthinkable that he'd
struggle against anyone!

271
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,020
Suiryu
of the dark corporeal fist

272
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,489
versus the underdog charanko!

273
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,624
Saitama: Why's he staring?

274
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,158
Does he know this is a rug?

275
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:10,095
Announcer: Who will
emerge victorious?

276
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,031
Ooh! Look at suiryu's smirk!

277
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,434
Has he sensed his opponent
is outclassed?

278
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,903
Charanko seems to be trying
to hide his nervousness

279
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,305
by looking like
a complete doofus!

280
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,973
Saitama: This is
how I always look.

281
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,242
Referee: Get ready!

282
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,244
Suiryu: Charanko,
let's have fun.

283
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,046
- Saitama: Huh?
- Referee: Begin!

284
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,448
Announcer: Here we go,
fight fans!

285
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,982
Saitama: Hey!

286
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,253
Announcer: Suiryu takes
an early offensive,

287
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:37,489
but, for some reason,
he stops just short of contact!

288
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,661
Announcer: He's attacking
with incredible speed!

289
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:46,064
Saitama: Since it's the finals,
I wanted to see his moves,

290
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,400
but that wind is a pain.

291
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:50,269
Is he doing that on purpose?

292
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,372
Suiryu: What's the matter?
I know you can see it coming.

293
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,207
Announcer: A flurry of kicks,

294
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:59,077
but he's stopping just short
every time!

295
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,480
All charanko can seem to do
is guard his head.

296
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,282
Has he already lost
the will to fight?

297
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,485
Suiryu: The ring announcer
is clueless.

298
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,487
I was just getting warmed up.

299
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,889
Hey, you're strong.

300
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,224
I can tell.
We're cut from the same cloth.

301
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,493
Saitama: Hmm?

302
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,628
So he's not just trying
to blow the wig off?

303
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:18,029
Suiryu: It's your eyes.

304
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:20,299
They don't seek rank or glory.

305
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,168
Your eyes are looking
for something fun.

306
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,103
Saitama: Well...

307
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,170
You might be right.

308
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,505
Suiryu: So, what was it

309
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,373
that brought you
to enter this tournament?

310
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,909
I'm in it to bag
that prize money.

311
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,644
Saitama:
That's what I want, too.

312
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,179
Suiryu: And one more reason.

313
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,247
I'm always on the lookout

314
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,517
for challenging opponents
to go up against.

315
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,252
Of course, in the end,
I am gonna win,

316
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:42,721
but the process
is still fun, you know?

317
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,590
Saitama: Fun, you say? Huh.

318
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,592
Suiryu: Yeah.
It's fun being strong.

319
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,328
Saitama: I see.

320
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,329
Suiryu: Hmm?

321
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,663
Saitama: I came here,

322
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:54,265
because I wanted
to experience martial arts.

323
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,335
I heard the fighters here
were strong,

324
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,003
but if I fought back,

325
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,071
even a little,
the match was over.

326
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:02,073
Zakkos: They've been
chitchatting for a while.

327
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,409
Sourface: They're probably
talking about the long hard road

328
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,211
they each took to get here.

329
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,015
Saitama: I was starting to think
coming here was a waste of time,

330
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,083
but thankfully
you seem different.

331
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,685
( Suiryu chuckles )

332
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,020
I see.

333
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,356
Then, how about
we do it this way?

334
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,624
I will provide
your martial arts experience,

335
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,627
and you simply do your best
to make our match fun for me.

336
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,563
Saitama: Oh! Now we're talking.

337
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,565
Suiryu: Okay, then.

338
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,200
Shall we begin?

339
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,369
Here goes!

340
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,237
¶

341
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,107
announcer: That was
even faster than before!

342
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,179
Suiryu is getting serious
about this match!

343
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,047
Suiryu: I won't let up!

344
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,250
Announcer:
Charanko's been launched!

345
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,557
Saitama: Still on.

346
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,127
Announcer: Ouch! Down he goes!

347
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,463
What an incredibly
brutal attack!

348
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:00,665
Will charanko be able
to stand up after that?

349
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,667
Sourface: Charanko, no!

350
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,136
Zakkos: Too late.
He never stood a chance.

351
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,472
Suiryu: Did I go
too hard on you?

352
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,541
Saitama: I'll admit
that last one had me scared.

353
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,076
Suiryu: Eh?

354
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,478
Saitama: I thought for sure
my wig was coming off.

355
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,680
( Suiryu chuckles ) All right.

356
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,283
This is the fight
I've been waiting for!

357
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,685
Sourface: Man,
he's really hanging in there!

358
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,154
If he keeps this up,
he might have a chance.

359
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:24,489
- Lightning Max: No.
- Sourface: Hmm?

360
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,091
Lightning Max:
Take a closer look at suiryu.

361
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,560
He's only been using
leg techniques.

362
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:31,362
Snek: He's holding back
and just toying with his prey.

363
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:32,764
Sourface: Are you saying...

364
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,566
Lightning Max: This match
is about to get real ugly.

365
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,102
Suiryu: Your weapon
is that punch of yours, right?

366
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,303
Let me have it!

367
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,339
You said you'd
make it fun for me.

368
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,442
( Saitama gasps )

369
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:48,247
Suiryu: He read that I was
going for a countermove.

370
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,716
He may be a white belt, but he
has real fight experience.

371
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,254
Protecting his head like that
shows sharp instincts.

372
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,257
Tell me, what do you do
for your day job?

373
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,791
Saitama: My job?

374
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,192
Uh, I go for walks,

375
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,461
defeat monsters,
stuff like that.

376
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,131
Suiryu: What?
You're out fighting monsters?

377
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,800
That sounds a lot like
the kind of thing heroes do.

378
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,202
Saitama: Well, I figured
I might be a hero someday,

379
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:12,738
so it's kind of like research.

380
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,075
( Suiryu sighs ) Another one
aiming to become a hero.

381
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,278
Doesn't seem like a job
for a quality fighter.

382
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,282
I fought
a few class-a heroes earlier,

383
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,817
but it was underwhelming.
They were so weak.

384
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:28,353
They're heroes in name only.

385
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,290
They just flaunt
virtue and justice

386
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,293
to make people feel
protected and grateful.

387
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,096
At their level,
no matter how hard they try,

388
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,431
they're not
gonna save the world.

389
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,300
These fine intentions,

390
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,569
noble thoughts, lofty morals,

391
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:46,237
and heroic justice

392
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:49,374
only serve
as a layer of impurities,

393
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,243
creating boredom
in the life of fun that I seek.

394
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,445
You're obviously strong like me,

395
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,381
so why not live
the free and easy life

396
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,083
and not worry about that crap?

397
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,786
Huh? What'd I say?

398
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,323
I offer advice because I see
you're one of the strong,

399
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,125
but--( Grunts )

400
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,792
Announcer: A clean hit!

401
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:08,627
Uh, what?

402
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,797
Saitama: Impurities?

403
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,333
What's that got to do with it?

404
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,202
You're not the only one
doing what he wants to do.

405
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,203
Suiryu, was it?

406
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,273
Here's a little advice from me.

407
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,876
If you just wanna have fun,

408
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:27,046
I suggest you don't get
any stronger.

409
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,485
( Crowd gasps )

410
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,821
Saitama: Aww, man,
why do I keep doing that?

411
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,289
I almost ended it
too quick again.

412
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,359
( Suiryu gasps )

413
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,693
Man: Did you see that?!

414
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:43,695
Announcer:
Wh-what the heck happened?!

415
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,296
I-I can't believe this!

416
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:48,167
Charanko is at the center
of a shocking development!

417
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:52,504
In the middle of the match,
he was outed as wearing a wig!

418
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,440
The referee is conferring
with the judges.

419
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,441
What could this mean?

420
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,377
Referee: Uh, we have a ruling.

421
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,245
After the wolfman incident

422
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,780
that occurred
in the last tournament,

423
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,383
a new mandate was written
that went into effect

424
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,984
at the start
of this competition.

425
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:09,588
Masks and other head coverings
are strictly prohibited.

426
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,857
His wig has been ruled
a head covering.

427
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,594
Therefore,
charanko is disqualified!

428
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,662
Announcer: Whoa!
And, just like that,

429
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:19,264
the match has been decided!

430
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,332
Suiryu is our champion!

431
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,667
- ( Crowd murmuring )
- Man 2: What a joke!

432
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:23,802
Man 3: Let 'em fight!

433
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,271
Sourface: Charanko.
All this time,

434
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,407
you've been hiding away
your shameful condition.

435
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,941
Zakkos: Actually,
he's an imposter.

436
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,277
Snek: Saitama? Why is he here?

437
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,279
Lightning Max: Wait.
Do you know this guy?

438
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:37,282
Referee: We'll confirm later
that you're who you claim to be.

439
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,683
Saitama: Time to go.

440
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,018
- Suiryu: Playtime's over.
- Saitama: Eh?

441
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,687
Suiryu: Now it's time
to fight for real.

442
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,289
( Joints crack )

443
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,490
Referee: Huh?!

444
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,026
¶

445
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:49,828
suiryu: I'm not stopping!

446
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:52,398
I haven't shown you
what I can really do!

447
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,638
Announcer:
The ring split in two!

448
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,507
Suiryu: You're not
going anywhere!

449
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:07,846
Announcer: Wh-wh-what?!

450
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:11,183
The two of them
are still fighting!

451
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,920
Saitama: Weren't we
having fun, though?

452
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,789
Suiryu: There's nothing fun
about losing!

453
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,391
Man 4: Whoo! Hell, yeah!
That's right! Keep going!

454
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:22,527
Announcer: And the crowd
just cannot get enough of this!

455
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:25,931
Suiryu is attacking
like a man possessed!

456
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,267
I've never seen him
like this before!

457
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,602
Suiryu: Now you will understand.

458
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,671
This is martial arts!

459
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,407
Dark body flying dragon fist!

460
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,409
Announcer: He's kicking!
He's punching,

461
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,413
unleashing pure fury!
There's no stopping him!

462
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:43,682
Suiryu: What the hell?
I'm not getting to him.

463
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:49,421
Announcer: The ring cracked!

464
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,290
Lightning Max:
That power stance.

465
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,291
He's gonna kill him.

466
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,492
Sourface: Get away!

467
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,393
( Suiryu yells )

468
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,033
What? No way!

469
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,770
Saitama: I think
I'm finally beginning to get it.

470
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,371
Suiryu: How was that?

471
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,373
Understand what martial arts
are all about now?

472
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,776
Saitama: Yes, I believe I do.

473
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:14,346
They're fighting moves
that make you look awesome.

474
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,117
Suiryu: How...

475
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:19,784
Shallow!

476
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,320
After everything I threw at you,

477
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,854
that's your conclusion?!

478
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,124
Saitama: I might just try
that spinny thing.

479
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,392
Defeating a monster like that
would be totally sweet.

480
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,393
Thanks, dude.

481
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,528
( Suiryu growls )

482
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:30,896
Don't mock me!

483
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,265
Saitama: Oh.

484
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,602
Announcer: And suiryu
gets booted with a hip attack!

485
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,138
- Saitama: Oops.
- ( Crowd laughing )

486
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,539
Saitama: Come on.

487
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,741
That was so not cool-looking.

488
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,810
Referee 2: All right, guys!
Let's grab him!

489
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:45,644
Saitama: Uh-oh.

490
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,415
Security: He's making
a run for it! Stop him!

491
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,482
Security 2:
Block the back exit!

492
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,551
Security 3: Catch him!

493
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,421
Suiryu: For the first time
in my life...

494
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,257
I lost.

495
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,425

496
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,194

498
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:41,934
genos: I was defeated.

499
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,471
I stood no chance.

500
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,475
Among the enemy are monsters
beyond anything seen before

501
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:52,578
( footsteps rumbling )

502
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,584
