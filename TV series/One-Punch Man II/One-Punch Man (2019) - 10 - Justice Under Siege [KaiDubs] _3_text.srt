1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,269
Saitama: You really think
you're hot stuff, don't you?

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,205
But today, I end you.

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,206
( Video game music playing )

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,808
Ora-ora-ora-ora-ora-ora!

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,209
Consecutive low kicks!

6
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,211
It's a cheese attack combo
I discovered!

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,347
- Ora-ora-ora-ora-ora!
- King: Good grief, man.

8
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,282
You just don't get it, do you?

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,618
Here. Let me show you...

10
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,286
Real cheese power.

11
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,487
Lovit rabbit: Hah!

12
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,289
( Both characters grunting )

13
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,962
Lovit rabbit: Take that! Yaah!

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,430
Announcer: K.O.!

15
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,166
Lovit rabbit:
Bunny-bunny hop hop!

16
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,301
- Saitama: I demand a rematch.
- ( King scoffs )

17
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,436
- Announcer: K.O.!
- ( Saitama stammers )

18
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,505
Announcer: K.O.!

19
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,841
- K.o.!
- ( Saitama stammers )

20
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,077
Lovit rabbit: Take that!

21
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,446
Mwah!

22
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,786
- Yaah!
- Announcer: K.O.!

23
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,854
Lovit rabbit:
Bunny-bunny hop hop!

24
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,122
Saitama: Crap game!

25
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,223
What a crap-ass game!

26
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:03,929
Huh? What's this thing?

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,265
King: Oh, that?

28
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,268
They gave those out
to a bunch of heroes recently.

29
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,338
It's still a prototype
or something.

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,074
It requests backup
and sends your location

31
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,142
at the touch of button.

32
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,344
Saitama: Why didn't I get one?

33
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,413
King: Huh? I don't know.

34
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:24,148
Maybe they figured
you'd have trouble using it,

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,018
you know, since it's
got buttons and everything.

36
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:26,985
Saitama: What?

37
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,555
We're going again.

38
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,624
This time, my low kicks
will be so fast,

39
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,026
I'll beat you for sure!

40
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,295
¶

41
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,497

42
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,900

¶ one punch

52
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,930
monster:
We've received a message

53
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,799
from the monster assoc--
( Screams )

54
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:18,270
I said we've received a message
from the monster association.

55
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,671
( Man screams )

56
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,273
Man 2: He's been
taken over by something!

57
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,075
Man 3: Call in
the heroes on security!

58
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,810
Man 4: Emergency! This is west
building, conference room seven!

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,679
- Man 5: Should I fire?
- Man 3: Shoot it! Shoot it!

60
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,947
Sitch: Wait!

61
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,582
Let's hear the message.

62
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:33,952
Gyoro-gyoro:
Ladies and gentlemen

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,689
of the hero association,
greetings.

64
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,358
I am director gyoro-gyoro
of the monster association.

65
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,094
As I'm sure you're aware,

66
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,230
we have the son of one of your
high-ranking executive with us.

67
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,498
Sitch: What is it that you want?

68
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,701
Gyoro-gyoro:
We have but one demand.

69
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,569
We are sick and tired

70
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,305
of being oppressed
because we are monsters.

71
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,975
From this day on,
we wish to be left alone.

72
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,912
Right now, we eke out
a meager existence,

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,847
hiding in an abandoned area
of city z.

74
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,649
We seek nothing audacious.

75
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,652
We don't expect to lead lives
in the outside world.

76
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,322
Our offer is simply
to halt our conflict

77
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,990
with heroes and ordinary humans

78
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,727
and to cease entering areas
where they live.

79
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,463
In exchange for this gesture,
we want you to guarantee us

80
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,799
a safe place
to live out our lives.

81
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,867
All we hope for
is the birth of a society

82
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,271
where humans and monsters
can coexist in harmony.

83
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,741
Sitch: Then, why instigate
this destructive rampage?

84
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,209
Gyoro-gyoro: A tragic,
but necessary decision.

85
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,145
By demonstrating our strength,

86
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,681
we hoped you'd understand
the merit behind our proposal.

87
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:40,419
I'm sure we'd both like
to avoid any further losses.

88
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,354
Man 5: A cease-fire, huh?

89
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,422
That's about what we expected.

90
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,091
Very well.
We pledge that henceforth

91
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,093
the monster association
will not be targeted.

92
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,362
( Sitch gasps )

93
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,498
Man 5: Now release
the hostage immediately.

94
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,968
Enjoy this brief
moment of security,

95
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,303
you bloodsucking vermin.

96
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,906
As soon as that boy is safe,
you will all be extermin--

97
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,441
monster: Oops.

98
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,310
Guess my finger slipped.

99
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,446
Gyoro-gyoro:
Now, now, destrochloridium.

100
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,247
We're still negotiating here.

101
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,850
Destrochloridium:
I am a very, very bad boy.

102
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,918
Man 6: H-he's dead!
You killed him!

103
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,790
Sitch: Bastard! What kind of
negotiation tactic was that?!

104
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:18,923
( Gyoro-gyoro laughs )

105
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,994
Tricking you humans is so fun!

106
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,396
Humans and monsters coexisting?

107
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,731
What a bunch
of gullible morons!

108
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,600
You believed every word.

109
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,670
You're stupider than I thought,
and that's saying something!

110
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,806
Sitch: What will you do
with the hostage?

111
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,540
( Gasps ) Wait a minute.
You haven't--

112
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,343
gyoro-gyoro: I assure you
he's still alive.

113
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,878
The only reason
we took the hostage

114
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,414
was to ensure you cowards
couldn't back out.

115
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,817
We'll give you three days
to retrieve him.

116
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,086
In that time, assemble
the best the hero association

117
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,823
has to offer
to make up the rescue team.

118
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,626
My lord orochi and the members
of the monster association

119
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,363
eagerly await you. ( Laughing )

120
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,834
- Woman: It self-destructed?
- Man 3: But there's still

121
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,302
one left to deal with.
What's keeping the heroes?

122
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,505
Destrochloridium: If we're
all done talking, then...

123
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,508
I think it's time
to get a little freaky!

124
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,576
( Groans )

125
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,577
Blackluster: Hmm? Wait.

126
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,579
Was that guy the emergency?

127
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,648
Man 3: Oh!
Thank you, blackluster.

128
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,984
I'm damn glad we have someone
of your strength defending hq.

129
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,453
Sitch: Wait. Look there!

130
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,855
The other one was just a husk!

131
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,789
The parasite's at your feet!

132
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,725
Destrochloridium:
Slow-witted meat bags!

133
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:31,463
Now this class-s body
is mine for the taking!

134
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,798
Huh?! My feeler drills
are hard as steel!

135
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,534
Why aren't they cutting
straight through you?!

136
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,002
Damn it!

137
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,604
This is living tissue, right?!

138
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:40,873
( Squish )

139
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,875
Blackluster: What kind
of question is that?

140
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:46,478
Everyone knows steel
is no match for a hardened body.

141
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,680
Hmm?

142
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,013
Man 4:
This monster association

143
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,749
is certainly making
some bold moves.

144
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,751
- Man 2: What now?
- Man 7: It's obvious, isn't it?

145
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,953
Rescuing the hostage
is our top priority.

146
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,155
Man 8: But can we
send in s-class heroes

147
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,490
knowing it's a trap?

148
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,892
Blackluster: This is bad.

149
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,760
The monsters' actions
have thrown the executives

150
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,763
into a panic.
They can't think straight.

151
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,831
Better step up.

152
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:08,701
( Clears throat )

153
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,034
Check out this action!

154
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,105
( Grunts )

155
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,439
Well?

156
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,974
Man 2: Uh, "well?"
What, exactly?

157
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,576
Need something?

158
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,043
Blackluster: Did seeing
these sculpted muscles

159
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,712
calm everyone down a little bit?

160
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,714
Man 2: Oh, uh, sure.

161
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,850
Blackluster: We're full
of boldness, just like them!

162
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,054
Finally the time has come
for me to start shining!

163
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,392
Our enemies
will tremble in fear.

164
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,261
I just hope they're tough enough
for me to go all-out!

165
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,798
Monster: Do you think
the heroes will come?

166
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,067
Monster 2: Let 'em come!
We all saw it today.

167
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,668
We're way stronger!

168
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,604
Monster 3:
Taking hostages is pointless.

169
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,872
If we go all-in,
they're good as dead.

170
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,808
Gyoro-gyoro:
Audacity is a virtue,

171
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,612
but rushing in headlong
is a strategy filled with flaws.

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,349
There are freakishly strong ones
among their ranks as well.

173
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,352
If we allow them to get away,
it'll mean trouble later,

174
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,687
so we must lure them all in

175
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,157
and then crush them
with our full force.

176
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,826
Our young hostage
serves as the bait.

177
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,094
Once we've slain
their strongest fighters,

178
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,497
the remainder
will be exterminated with ease.

179
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,633
With no one of power
left to resist us,

180
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,635
nothing will prevent
our victory.

181
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,437
Human civilization will fall.

182
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:22,707
And, when that day comes,
lord orochi will reign supreme,

183
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:25,611
and a new world ruled
by monsters shall be born!

184
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,182
No applause? What's the matter?

185
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,916
Does the idea
of swearing loyalty

186
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,518
to lord orochi upset you?

187
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Monster 4:
I thought we were here

188
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,656
to destroy
the hero association.

189
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,859
Who said anything about loyalty?

190
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,396
Orochi: Hold. Do I sense
weaklings among us?

191
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,664
( Monsters gasp )

192
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,598
( Roach awakening groans )

193
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,600
No! I'm not a weakling!

194
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,669
Gyoro-gyoro:
Is that you, roach awakening?

195
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,738
You have the gall to return here
after your utter failure?

196
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,007
Roach awakening:
Whoa! Wait a second!

197
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,875
All I lost was my legs, okay?!

198
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,076
I can still fight!

199
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,078
Next time--( Whimpers )

200
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,746
I thought we were
on the same team!

201
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,148
Come on! No! Stop it!

202
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,551
Don't do this! Please, stop it!

203
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,786
Stop--

204
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,490
monsters: He ate him.

205
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,826
Gyoro-gyoro:
And what of you, super s?

206
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:14,959
( Super s whimpers )

207
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,829
I'm fine, really.

208
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,031
I'm mostly unscathed.

209
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,499
See? I didn't lose!

210
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,501
Gyoro-gyoro:
Well, she does have

211
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,503
a unique and
useful set of skills.

212
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,839
It might be worth
allowing her to live.

213
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,174
Orochi: Next time, you die.

214
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,909
( Super s panting )

215
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,044
Thank you.

216
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,779
Gyoro-gyoro:
Ah, now where was I?

217
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,582
Anyone who's got a problem
can take it up with lord orochi

218
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,051
once the battle is over.

219
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,919
If you manage to defeat him,

220
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,788
you'll even be the new boss.
No hard feelings.

221
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:44,857
Monster 4: Seems fair.

222
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,725
Orochi: Gyoro-gyoro,

223
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,862
I do not see
goketsu among my beasts.

224
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,664
Gyoro-gyoro: Huh.
Now that you mention it,

225
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,065
he hasn't come back.

226
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,599
( Wings buzzing )

227
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,535
I will check on him immediately.

228
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,870
( Gasps )

229
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,738
¶

230
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,944
goketsu. He's dead.

231
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,012
Who could have done this?

232
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,816
It seems my plans won't
come to fruition so easily.

233
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:12,817
( Garou gasps )

234
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,686
Where am I?

235
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,555
Did I lose a fight or something?

236
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,692
( Groans )

237
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,030
Better get back
to the hideout for now.

238
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,734
Huh? Is that...

239
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,837
There's no doubt about it.

240
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,039
It's class-a death gatling.

241
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:36,040
( Groans )

242
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,642
Damn it.

243
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,644
King roughed me up pretty bad.

244
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,980
My body's at its limit.

245
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,149
I think I'm gonna
have to call it a day.

246
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,226
Everything seems
to be working correctly.

247
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,961
How does it feel, genos?

248
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,363
Genos: It feels great, perfect.

249
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,766
Thank you very much, Dr. Kuseno.

250
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,234
Sorry for the rush.

251
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,635
Dr. Kuseno:
Don't worry about it.

252
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,303
I mean, you did want to get back

253
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,306
to the front lines as soon
as possible, now, didn't you?

254
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,909
I made some simple modifications
and upgrades,

255
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,244
nothing revolutionary,

256
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,646
but they should
certainly make you stronger.

257
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,048
Genos: Understood.
I will not lose again.

258
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,317
Dr. Kuseno:
There's no need to overdo it.

259
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,053
It's okay to lose at times,

260
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,721
as long as you stay alive,
that is.

261
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,324
Seeing the state
you were in yesterday

262
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,660
reminded me of my younger days,

263
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,797
a time when I burned
with a passion for justice

264
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,767
and dove in headfirst
without fear of anything.

265
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,270
Listen, genos.

266
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,273
Don't do anything rash.
You understand?

267
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,108
( Footsteps receding )

268
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,280
Vendor: Monster association
declares war!

269
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,881
Man: Monster association?

270
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,417
Man 2: Is it true
they infiltrated hero hq?

271
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,019
Woman: They killed an executive?

272
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,487
Man 3: What were
the heroes doing?

273
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,822
Reporter: Early this morning,

274
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,024
a group called
the monster association

275
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,627
claimed that they had taken
a young citizen hostage.

276
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,028
They also claimed the captive...

277
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,297
- Zenko: Are we gonna be okay?
- ( Metal bat scoffs )

278
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,366
Zakkos: Seems the hero
and monster associations

279
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,102
are headed for an all-out war.

280
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,104
Sourface: Those damn beasts!
Well, if it's a war they want,

281
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,640
that's what they're gonna get.

282
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,508
Ring-ring: What happens to us
if the heroes lose?

283
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,977
Zakkos: It hurts to admit,
but we would be powerless.

284
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,045
Sourface: Damn it.

285
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:23,048
Ring-ring:
The heroes can win, right?

286
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,782
They just have to.

287
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,917
Child emperor: What do you mean

288
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,385
that doesn't affect
our strategy?

289
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,254
Are you sure you understand

290
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,989
the situation here,
metal knight?

291
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,325
Metal knight: If they
goad us into storming in,

292
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,994
it will only increase
our casualties.

293
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,131
Sacrificing our resources
recklessly makes no sense.

294
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,067
Child emperor: This is no time
to be crunching numbers.

295
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,470
They've taken
a little kid hostage!

296
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,938
Metal knight: All I'm saying
is that that kind of thinking

297
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,340
will only make matters worse.

298
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,343
Once we locate the enemy lair,

299
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,745
we should abandon any plans
to rescue the hostage

300
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,281
and immediately
commence bombing while we can.

301
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,616
I proposed that plan
to the council,

302
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,218
but they rejected it.

303
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,953
It seems they have
decided to prioritize

304
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,690
their own interests
in this matter,

305
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,158
and, if that's the case,

306
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,161
I want no part
of the current suicide mission.

307
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,696
Child emperor: He just really

308
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,166
wants to have everything
his own way.

309
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,502
Woman: The citizens
are keeping a close eye on us

310
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,103
to see what
our next move will be.

311
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,238
Man: The press
are having a field day.

312
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,507
How did this get leaked?

313
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,441
Man 2: Now that the public
has been made aware

314
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:27,279
of our failures, it's time
we take a hard-line approach.

315
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,315
Monster: The monster
association, huh?

316
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,851
It didn't say
where to find them,

317
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,252
but I've got an idea.

318
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,788
They're in city z,

319
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,525
and they're planning
a revolution.

320
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,393
Monster 2:
That message in their demands

321
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,595
wasn't meant for humans only.

322
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,731
Monster 1:
They're talking to us, too.

323
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,933
Monster 3: Let's join
the monster association...

324
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,068
Monsters: And wipe
those bastard heroes

325
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,470
off the face of the planet!

326
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,875
Saitama: Lots of monsters
today, too, huh

327
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,345
were they out looking for me,
or was it just bad luck?

328
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:01,012
But, more importantly,

329
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,147
if I don't hurry,

330
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,782
I'll miss the garbage truck!

331
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,420
Boy: What? Somebody's
in our secret base?

332
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,021
Are you for real?

333
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,357
Boy 2: Yeah.
Some white-haired dude

334
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:14,025
- is in there sleeping.
- Boy 3: Seriously?

335
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:17,362
Hey, go check things out
for us, tareo.

336
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,964
- Tareo: Uh...
- Boy 1: Wake him up,

337
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,832
- and get rid of him!
- Tareo: Um...

338
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,768
I don't know if I can do that.

339
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,970
Boy 1: Quit whining about it,
and get going!

340
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,705
Tareo: That hurt.

341
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,708
( Garou panting )

342
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,846
I can't shake this fever.

343
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,983
I might be out of commission
for a few days.

344
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,517
I don't have time for this.

345
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:41,119
- ( Creak )
- Who's there?!

346
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,254
( Tareo whimpers )

347
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,258
Garou: What are you
sneaking around for?

348
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,927
Tareo: Uh, listen.
This shack is--

349
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:53,331
i-it's our--
it's our secret base, so...

350
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,066
Garou: Hey, wait.

351
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,603
You're that kid
with the hero almanac.

352
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,537
Tareo: Huh? Uh...

353
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,273
Oh! It's you, mister!

354
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,276
Garou: I thought I told you
to stop calling me mister.

355
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,811
Why are you here?

356
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,812
Tareo: Uh, well...

357
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,615
I-I was hoping that...

358
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,083
You could maybe leave our base?

359
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,218
- Garou: What?
- ( Tareo gasps )

360
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,487
Garou: Why are you
telling me to leave?

361
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,088
I'm trying to rest up here.

362
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,825
Tareo: Um, well,
everybody told me

363
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,893
to tell that
to whoever was in here.

364
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,361
Garou: What, like your friends?

365
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,696
Just tell them to buzz off.

366
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,964
Tareo: B-but I...

367
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,433
Garou: Stop your crying.

368
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:28,300
It's annoying.

369
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,970
All right, fine.

370
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,840
I'll move to another place
soon, okay?

371
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,508
If they have
a problem with that,

372
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,111
bring 'em here,
and I'll tell 'em myself.

373
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,379
You got that, you little turd?

374
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,915
( Tareo grunts )

375
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,455
Garou: And let me give you
a piece of advice, kid.

376
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,589
It's about
getting respect from others.

377
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,058
Tareo: Huh?

378
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,526
( Grunts ) What is it?

379
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:56,794
( Boy sighs )

380
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,130
What's taking him so long?

381
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,398
Boy 2: Maybe something
happened to him.

382
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,267
Death gatling:
Stand back, boys.

383
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,536
Boy 1: Whoa! It's death gatling!

384
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,538
Death gatling:
It's dangerous here.

385
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,940
Boy 2: It's smile man
and stinger, too!

386
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,944
Boy 3: Wow! Look!
A bunch of heroes are here!

387
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,480
Smile man:
The hero hunter is wounded

388
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,414
and hiding out
in that shack, huh?

389
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:17,615
Death gatling: That's right.

390
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:21,219
This is it,
garou the hero hunter.

391
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,288
Today, it's your turn
to be hunted.

392
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:26,091
Boy 2: Sir,
is something bad in there?

393
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,495
Hero: There's an evil monster
inside that shack.

394
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,096
Get clear of here right now.

395
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,631
- ( Boys gasp )
- Boy 1: Uh, yes, sir.

396
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,503
Boy 2: Oh, no. We made tareo
go in there all by himself.

397
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:40,506
Boy 1: The heroes are here now.
Uh, he'll be okay.

398
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:41,773
- Boy 2: Right.
- Boy 3: Yeah.

399
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:44,376
Garou: If you want respect,

400
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,245
if you don't
wanna be bossed around...

401
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:49,314
Then you gotta get strong.

402
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,383
- Tareo: What?
- Garou: That's it.

403
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,984
Some pretty good advice, huh?

404
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,587
Tareo: No. I mean,
that's pretty obvious.

405
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,257
( Whimpers )

406
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,659
Garou: Yeah, it is obvious,

407
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,995
so obvious that you
understood it perfectly!

408
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,130
( Laughs )

409
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,399
( Groans )
Damn, even laughing hurts.

410
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,601
Tareo: Are you
all right, mister?

411
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,136
Garou: Don't worry about me.

412
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,005
Listen. You should go on home.

413
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,341
Tareo: Oh. Okay.

414
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,275
( Smile man gasps )

415
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,476
The door's sliding open.

416
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:19,677
Death gatling: Get ready.

417
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,479
As soon as that bastard
shows his face,

418
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,348
we light the place up.

419
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,750
Garou: They're all around us.

420
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,352
- Wait!
- Tareo: Huh?

421
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,954
Garou: In exchange
for that advice I gave you,

422
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,689
let me see the hero almanac,
just a quick peek.

423
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,024
Tareo: Huh?

424
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,627
The hero almanac? But why?

425
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,629
Garou: I just need
to look at something.

426
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,297
Tareo: I guess so.

427
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,033
Here.

428
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,569
Garou: Thanks.
This thing has a bunch

429
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:46,171
of comprehensive information
on the heroes, right?

430
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,375
Tareo: Yup. But it doesn't
cover all of them, so, uh...

431
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,043
Garou: I see.

432
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,718
Out front, four.

433
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,955
In back, two.

434
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,424
And one at each side.

435
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:08,726
Eight in all.

436
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,397
Ordinarily, taking them out
would be a cinch,

437
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,331
but, with these injuries...

438
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,401
Luckily, this almanac
has some useful information.

439
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,136
- ( Gatling gun fires )
- ( Tareo gasps )

440
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,205
- ( Garou grunts )
- Tareo: Hey, mister,

441
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,339
there's someone outside!

442
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,340
Garou: Stop talking.

443
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,476
( Scoffs ) I'm out of time.

444
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,544
( Gatling gun fires )

445
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,648
Death gatling: There's no point
in hiding, hero hunter!

446
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,418
We know you're in there.

447
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,353
Garou: Turd...

448
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,688
Get down on the floor.

449
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:39,557
All right, I'm coming out!

450
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,926
Hold your fire!

451
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:47,165
Listen.
Don't shoot up the place.

452
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,300
Stinger:
Aren't you a sweetheart?

453
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,301
You giving up?

454
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,169
Garou: Don't be stupid.

455
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,439
I just need somewhere
to catch up on some sleep

456
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,240
once I'm done
hunting you bastards down.

457
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,509
Wildhorn:
After you hunt us down?

458
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,845
Death gatling: Don't fall
for his taunting, wildhorn.

459
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,513
He's obviously in bad shape.

460
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,516
We'll take him alive
and bring him back to hq.

461
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,119
We'll get him
to tell us about his motives

462
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,321
and give up any accomplices.

463
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,589
Garou: Typical hero playbook.

464
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,259
Very kind of you to capture me
instead of going for the kill.

465
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,728
Tareo: Wow! Heroes!

466
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,197
And they're
really tough ones, too!

467
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,599
Death gatling:
Oh, you won't get off easy.

468
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,801
You'll have to pay.

469
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,402
Wildhorn: We're going
to make you regret

470
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:26,338
ever calling yourself a monster.

471
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,539
Garou: You've got it backwards.

472
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,009
You'll pay
for calling yourselves heroes.

473
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,479
¶

474
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,485
( inhales )

475
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,153
Time to hunt!

476
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,690
You dipshits are gonna
put me over 100 kills!

477
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:47,092
Blam-blam: This is
the end of the line for you!

478
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,495
Garou: I don't think so.

479
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,729
You're going down first!

480
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,434
Stinger:
He did that airborne? Amazing.

481
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,903
Garou: That was pretty close.

482
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,173
I don't think
he was trying to take me alive.

483
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,108
Arrow rain!

484
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:05,243
Shooter: Arrow rain
is my secret technique.

485
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,444
How'd he know?

486
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:08,646
Garou: Those are poison arrows.

487
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,248
Good thing I read the almanac.

488
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,118
Tareo: I don't get it.
What'd you do?

489
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:14,786
Why are heroes
after you, mister?

490
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:17,655
Chain toad: Despite the odds,
he's not backing down.

491
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:20,325
Is this hero hunter
just a damned fool?

492
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:21,793
Megane: No, chain toad.

493
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,730
Both tank top master
and metal bat were badly beaten.

494
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,333
I assure you, garou's no fool.

495
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,734
Remember what we
discussed about him.

496
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:31,269
Chain toad:
"Never underestimate him."

497
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,470
I'll keep that in mind.

498
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,273
Now let's see how he likes this!

499
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,675
¶

500
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,477
( garou winces )

501
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,682
- ( Chain clinks )
- ( Winces )

502
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,488
Smile man: Those skills.

503
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,690
He was silverfang's
top disciple.

504
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,226
Chain toad: And he's no fool.

505
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,762
His senses
are frighteningly sharp.

506
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,631
Garou: At middle distance,
chain toad and smile man

507
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,734
launch a ceaseless
barrage of attacks

508
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,574
shooter: Got him! Two hits!

509
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,442
Garou: But if I
back off too far,

510
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,378
I'm in shooter
and blam-blam's field of fire,

511
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,846
with death gatling on cleanup.

512
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:17,249
So what's that guy
in the track suit

513
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,917
been up to all this time?

514
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,586
- Megane: Shooter!
- Shooter: Thanks!

515
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,520
Garou: He's here as support.

516
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,924
That explains why he's
keeping his distance from me.

517
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,058
In that case...

518
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:31,263
You're gonna be my meat shield!

519
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,464
- Get back here!
- ( Pistol fires )

520
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:33,799
Damn.

521
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,734
I can't let my guard down
for a second.

522
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:36,635
They're relentless.

523
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,538
Little shit.

524
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:42,674
Megane: Just in case
you were wondering,

525
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,943
it's my job to chase you down
if you try to run.

526
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:48,546
In terms of stamina and
persistence, you won't beat me.

527
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,749
You're wounded and poisoned.

528
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:52,484
You won't hold out much longer.

529
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,187
But the close-up fighting
is a job for the other heroes.

530
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:58,890
Garou:
They've got me surrounded,

531
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,693
and I don't have the legs
to break through 'em.

532
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,028
And, with the shape I'm in,

533
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,830
there's no way
I can even hope to avoid

534
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:08,099
all their bullets, arrows,
and other weapons.

535
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:09,767
Death gatling:
This is the final chance

536
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,037
you're going to get
to surrender, garou!

537
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,906
( Garou panting )

538
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:20,111
¶

539
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,947
( singing in japanese )

540
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,450
