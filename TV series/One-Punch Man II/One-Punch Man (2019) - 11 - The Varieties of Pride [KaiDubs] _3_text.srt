00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:03,035

00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:07,205
¶

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,808
death gatling: This will be your
last chance to surrender, garou,

4
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:11,543
- so take it.
- ( Garou scoffs )

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,879
Death gatling: Not how
you saw this ending, is it?

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,682
Well, that's just too bad,
hero hunter.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,352
Everyone assembled here
is a veteran

8
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,554
who's faced death
countless times.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,556
I personally picked
and brought in

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,825
the heroes I know are the best

11
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:30,362
just to hunt your ass down.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:34,633
Garou: So they're
"the best," huh? ( Laughs )

13
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,301
I'm sure you're proud
of your little squad,

14
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,569
but I call bullshit.

15
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,773
I'm not even seeing
one class s here.

16
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:45,310
Doesn't the hero association
understand how dangerous I am?

17
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,579
These bargain-basement
do-gooders

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,783
in their Halloween costumes
are nothing but a joke.

19
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,584
Death gatling:
So even a criminal like you

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,319
cares only about class s.

21
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,720
Garou: Huh?

22
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,922
The class-s heroes
are worshipped.

23
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,526
They get paid the big bucks
by the hero association,

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,596
and they get let in
on classified information

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,265
that the rest of us
would never be privy to.

26
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,402
We're all heroes,
but we're not equals.

27
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,606
The rankings to decide
who's on top are so subjective.

28
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,677
So many heroes never even
get a chance to be recognized.

29
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,479
They may not be class s,

30
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,482
but this crew
is still tough as hell.

31
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,750
You've managed
to get all this attention

32
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,353
for taking out class-s heroes.

33
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,557
That makes you the perfect
target for proving my point!

34
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,426
( Garou sighs )

35
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,428
That explains
the lack of class s.

36
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,097
You guys are itching
to take all the credit.

37
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,433
Any kid who heard you
would be so let down.

38
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,434
( Gasps )

39
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,837
It's hard to breathe.

40
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,372
I feel dizzy, too.

41
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,307
The poison? ( Chuckles )

42
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,310
I heard there's
some monster association

43
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,978
that's kicking
your hero teeth in.

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,648
You sure a guy like me
should be your priority?

45
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,583
If you didn't know,
there's a hostage out there

46
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,718
that needs rescuing.

47
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,520
Death gatling:
Once we've brought you in,

48
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,655
we'll deal with all that.

49
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,924
Wherever there's
an upstart monster,

50
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,662
we'll be there to face it
head-on and take it out.

51
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,563
Garou: These guys are a test...

52
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,735
Each one a step
on my long and winding path

53
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,271
to becoming a true monster.

54
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,173
I'm not backing down.

55
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,083
Stinger:
The poison's kicking in.

56
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,484
Death gatling: He can't
take much more of this.

57
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,286
( Garou panting )

58
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,421
It takes one step at a time,

59
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,823
just one step.

60

a new attack, justice fire kick!

But know the best part?

76

Boy 2: The way crab demon died!

77
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,672
Boy 3: I know, right!
Remember his face

78
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,275
when justice man saw the egg
he was trying to hide?

Garou: Yeah, but crab demon
almost had him.

When mach woman
and little justice joined in,

82
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,217
it was three on one,
but, even against those odds,

00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,225
You were rooting for crab demon?

87
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,227
Garou: He was only trying
to protect his home,

88
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,829
to stop pollution in the ocean.

89
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:54,232
He was standing up to
the whole world all by himself.

90
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,900
If he'd just been
a little stronger,

91
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,636
I'm sure he would have won.

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,040
I feel so sorry for him.

Garou: You mean
I'm not allowed to have one?

105
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,674
Doesn't seem very fair.

He's been hit in the leg
and poisoned,

109
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,150
but he's still fighting hard!

110
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,219
Smile man: Look out!

111
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,620

00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,500
- ( Screams )
- Shooter: Damn it!

117
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,435
Megane: He may have
figured out our timing,

118
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,504
but he's still wide open
from the front!

119

( Garou chuckles )

120

Smile man: Hey, death gatling,

127
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,865
I think he might
take us all down at this rate.

128
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,400
Let's forget
about taking him alive.

129
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,269
Death gatling: Agreed.

130
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,438
The hero hunter
has made his choice.

131
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,513
Megane: He can still move
at that speed?

132
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,616
He should be
completely worn out by now,

133
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,152
but somehow he just
keeps fighting and winning!

134
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,688
It's unnatural.

135
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,290
It definitely doesn't feel
like we're fighting a human!

136
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,158
Garou: Hey, stinger!

137
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,628
Fight me one-on-one,
you coward!

138
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,098
Stinger: You asked for it!
Leave this guy to me!

139
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,699
Smile man: No chance!
We'll face him together!

140
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,369
Death gatling: I'll turn him
into bone fragments.

Smile man: What the...

142
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,113
Garou: I honestly didn't think

143
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,648
- you'd be as dumb as they say.
- Stinger: You tricked me.

144
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,383
- Death gatling: Out of the way!
- Stinger: Huh?

145
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,451
Death gatling: I'll finish him.

146
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,221
He's too worn out
to dodge this.

( Megane gasps )

148

You're in my line of fire!

Garou: Hey,
what's the matter, buddy?

150
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,136
We were so close a second ago.

151
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,138
It's not neighborly
to run away from me now.

152
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,872
I'm gonna be all lonely.

153
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,408
Megane: I can't shake him!

154
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,543
Death gatling:
Get away from him, megane!

155
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,112
I can't get a shot!

156
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,752
Megane: Our formation's
completely busted.

157
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,220
Does that mean
I'm just holding them back now?

158
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,423
( Panting )

159
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,159
( Eyelashes groans ) The new
guy's just holding us back.

160
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,893
Wild monkey: I don't want
to share the credit

161
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,563
for anything with him.
He sucks, miss blizzard.

162
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,566
Megane: I don't need credit.

163
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,635
You guys take it.

164
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,071
¶

165
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,909
this is it.

166
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,046
I'm gonna be killed.

167
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,216
( Gasps )

168
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,661
I'll never be a hero.

169
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,797
I'm just an ordinary guy,

170
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,265
and I've reached my damn limit!

171
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,667
Saitama: Your limit?

172
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,869
Who decides what your limit is?

173
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,472
¶

174
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,675
instead of overthinking
your setbacks,

175
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,111
just focus on moving forward.

176
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:05,017
Megane: That was the moment
I decided to remake myself,

177
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,152
to be like him.

178
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,421
I won't be used as a cover!

179
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,624
I'd rather fight to my last--

180
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,293
garou: Yeah! That's the spirit!

181
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:18,163
You got lots of stamina,
don't you?

182
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,631
- Stinger: No!
- Death gatling: Don't do it!

183
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,900
- It's a trap!
- Stinger: Maybe so,

184
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,435
but I can't ignore it!

185
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,640
Eat this!
Gigantic drill stinger!

186
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,443
¶

187
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,718
( Megane gags )

188
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,687
( Garou panting )

189
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,593
Death gatling: You took out all
your human shields, dumb-ass.

190
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,329
Now the friendly-fire problem
is no longer an issue.

191
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,233
You're dead, garou the monster!

192
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,804
Garou: There's a kid
inside that shack.

193
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,206
( Tareo gasping )

194
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,209
Garou: He'll get hit
if you open fire on me.

195
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,744
Death gatling:
Trying to talk your way out

196
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,981
with what is
so very obviously a lie?

197
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,551
( Garou inhales )

198
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,685
Watch this, turd!

199
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,621
This is the moment
the monster wins!

200
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,156
( Tareo gasps )

201
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,625
Death gatling:
The winner will be justice.

202
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,027
Time to die.

203
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:24,363
Death shower!

204
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,510
Impossible.

205
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,115
How could he survive that?

206
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,450
( Tareo shuddering )

207
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,053
M-Mister...

208
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:53,725
( Garou chuckles ) Only an idiot
would let loose like that.

209
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,127
( Death gatling grunts )

210
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,661
Garou: Don't bother
with the act.

211
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,330
I know.

212
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,600
That was death shower,
where you use up all your ammo.

213
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,669
Death gatling: He goaded me,
just like all the others.

214
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,871
"It turns monsters
into mincemeat

215
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,673
and obliterates them."

216
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,409
But not every monster, huh?

217
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:11,410
( Laughs )

218
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,146
I'm grateful. Heh.

219
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,215
You helped me prove that I can't
be defeated by guns or bullets.

220
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,483
( Death gatling gasps )

221
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,819
Garou: Not how you
saw this ending, is it?

222
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:24,422
( Laughs ) Too bad.
That's not how foils work.

223
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,359
You should've called in
some class-s heroes

224
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,494
like good little class as.

225
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,430
If even one of them
had joined you,

226
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,366
things might have
turned out differently.

227
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,169
Death gatling:
Class s can screw themselves.

228
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,439
You think the rest of the heroes
are just second string?

229
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,574
Class-s heroes are incredible,

230
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,577
but the rest of us fight through
blood, sweat, and death,

231
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:46,911
same as them!

232
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,713
Look at me!

233
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,915
I cornered the hero hunter,

234
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,153
class-a hero, death gatling!

235
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,921
Garou: Boy, you've got issues.

236
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,457
Death gatling: I will be
the one to put you down!

237
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,594
I'll prove that we
deserve our place!

238
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,130
Garou: Seems the one
most obsessed with rankings...

239
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,599
- ( Death gatling groans )
- Garou: Is you!

240
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,539
( Wind blowing )

241
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,108
You disgust me.

242
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,481
Bunch of idiots.

243
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:24,282
Tareo: M-mister...

244
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:25,517
Garou: Huh?

245
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,420
Oh.

246
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,556
You're still alive.

247
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,325
( Tareo gasping )

248
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,664
( Wailing )

249
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,333
Garou: Hey!

250
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,537
Tareo: Somebody help!

251
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,412
( Garou grunting )

252
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,583
( Panting )

253
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,388
Water.

254
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,125
Huh?

255
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:11,129
Genos: I received
a call for assistance.

256
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,066
From the look of things,
you are that hero hunter.

257
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,701
( Garou gasps )

258
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:17,536
¶

259
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,409
genos: You will be eliminated.

260
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,047
( Wind blowing )

261
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,216
¶

262
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,806
Genos: Machine gun blows!

263
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,811
( Garou hisses )

264
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,647
Fist of flowing water
crushing rock!

265
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,425
( Yells )

266
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,762
( Grunts )

267
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:26,071
Bastard. He let me bury him
to lure me in.

268
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,641
¶

269
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,643
genos: I see.

270
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,381
He defended himself using fist
of flowing water crushing rock.

271
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:37,783
It adds up.

272
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:42,120
This is why
the other heroes struggled.

273
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,256
Saitama: Boom!
Take a look at that!

274
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,324
You've got, like,
a millimeter of health left!

275
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,461
I did it! You're going down
this time for sure! ( Laughs )

276
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,665
Oh? Still got
some fight left, huh?

277
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,067
Take it easy, saitama.
Stay calm.

278
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,669
One more hit, and you win.
It'd take a miracle

279
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,336
for him to come back
at this poi--

280
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,239
announcer: K.O.!

281
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,675
( Saitama screams )

282
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,277
King: Nice.

283
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,680
I set up for a last-gasp,
come-from-behind victory.

284
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,215
Hope you had fun, at least.

285
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,683
I'm not gonna let you win,

286
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,752
but I will let you
get pretty close, though.

287
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,621
I mean, your moves
are always the same, dude.

288
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,357
I gave you a chance,
but all you do is button-mash.

289
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:21,293
I could beat you
with my eyes closed.

290
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:24,162
This puts us at, eh, 81 and o.

291
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,498
I'll loan you the console so
you can practice for next time.

292
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:27,832
( Saitama gasps )

293
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,368
Games stress me the hell out!

294
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:30,903
I am gonna pop!

295
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,438
King: If you ever win,
that'll go away.

296
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,439
Just keep it together.

297
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:35,840
( Buzzer vibrating )

298
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,242
Saitama:
Your buzzer's going off.

299
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,244
King: Huh?
Looks like you're right.

300
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,312
Saitama: Is it monsters?!

301
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,646
- ( Music playing )
- Let's go!

302
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:43,448
I'm ready to crack some skulls!

303
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,785
King: It says other class-s
heroes are already on-site.

304
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,587
- ( Music slowing )
- By the time we get there,

305
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,455
it'll probably be over.

306
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,190
( Saitama sighs )

307
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,192
King: But since we're
talking about monsters,

308
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,662
all the dead ones near my house
kinda freak me out.

309
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,198
It seems pretty unsanitary,
you know?

310
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,600
Saitama: Gross, but fair.

311
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,602
I'll have genos
incinerate them later.

312
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,339
I wonder, why do so many
monsters appear around here?

313
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,740
King: I don't know.

314
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,542
They're why no one lives
in this area anymore.

315
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,544
If monsters
start showing up everywhere

316
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,346
like they did yesterday,

317
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,215
there might end up being
more neighborhoods like mine.

318
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,351
So where is genos, anyway?

319
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,820
Saitama: I don't know. He hasn't
been home since yesterday.

320
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:24,289
King: What? You sure he's okay?

321
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,224
Dude, the monster association
is kind of a thing.

322
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,760
What if they
took him back to their lair

323
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:28,761
or something like that?

324
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,399
Saitama: He's probably fine.
It's genos.

325
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,669
Hmm.

326
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,775
Maybe I'll have a look around.

327
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,844
( Megane groaning )

328
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,613
A class-s showed up.

329
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,182
Thank goodness.

330
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,187
Garou: This one's strong.

331
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,657
His speed is insane, and he's
got tank top master's power.

332
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,393
He fires those incineration
cannons without hesitation.

333
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:05,164
Busted up like this,
it'll take a lot to beat him.

334
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,766
Damn it.

335
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,472
Genos: Surrender.

336
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:15,374
There is no way
that you can escape.

337
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,544
Garou: That's what I need.

338
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,780
Have to remember
the way he moved!

339
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,685
Genos: He has changed his style.

340
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,553
He is moving on all fours.

341
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:31,490
Garou: Gotcha.

342
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,158
You see, I've always had a knack

343
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,427
for taking apart
precision machinery!

344
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,096
Too bad for you!

345
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,232
( Gags )

346
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,571
Genos: Meaningless.

347
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,707
( Garou chuckles )

348
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,775
One hero after another.

349
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,245
I must have really
gotten your attention.

350
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,580
Was there a memo or something?

351
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:57,649
I'm stoked to be this popular.

352
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,985
Genos: The recent appearance
of an evil organization

353
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,188
has thrown the world
as we know it into chaos.

354
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,260
The hero association
must focus its efforts

355
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,663
and work as one
to deal with that threat.

356
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,798
We cannot waste time

357
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:16,201
on insignificant nobodies
like you.

358
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,335
( Garou grunts )

359
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,072
You think I'm a nobody?!

360
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,542
Then help me change that,
demon cyborg!

361
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,611
Once I've beaten you,
the world will know my name,

362
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:28,247
and they will fear me!

363
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,357
¶

364
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:43,095
I want everyone to know.

365
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,564
No hero is a match for me.

366
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,832
A monster stands before you,

367
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,769
stronger than anyone!

368
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:53,539
Such a creature does not exist.

369
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,174
Monster: Now!

370
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,243
- Rescue the hero hunter!
- ( Monsters growl )

371
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,047
Garou: What the...

372
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,317
Monster: The monster
association, at your service.

373
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,253
We're here to bring you back
with us, Mr. Garou.

374
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,256
You're in a pinch, right?
We can help you.

375
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,657
Garou: You guys again, huh?

376
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,460
Monster: Our superiors
say they'll offer you

377
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:19,264
an executive position.
Isn't that wonderful?

378
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,134
Garou: Don't want it.
Now piss off.

379
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,603
Monster: I'm afraid
we can't this time.

380
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,272
We're here
under specific orders.

381
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,574
( Monsters groan )

382
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,243
Monster: Impossible! Whaah!

383
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,549
Genos: I see.
So the hero hunter

384
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,085
is in league
with the monster association.

385
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,155
- Garou: Huh?
- Genos: Yesterday, I lost,

386
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,556
but I learned there are monsters

387
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,691
more powerful
than I could imagine.

388
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,161
Now, no matter what may come,

389
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,296
my guard will never
be down again.

390
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,564
( Garou scoffs )

391
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,099
Genos: Plus,
compared to yesterday,

392
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,301
I am much stronger.

393
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,371
( Garou grunts )

394
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,373
Genos: Master saitama
gave me guidance

395
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,375
and said that I should aim
for a higher level

396
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,043
and train my spirit.

397
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,846
I believe I am beginning
to understand what he meant.

398
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:10,048
I will not be
so easily defeated.

399
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,250
Garou: Master saitama?

400
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,252
Genos: My master is a warrior

401
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:16,721
who no monster
could ever hope to match.

402
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,056
He is a true hero.

403
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,558
( Garou grunts )

404
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,428
Genos: Incinerate.

405
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:28,533
Bang: Genos.

406
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,335
Genos: Bang, why?

407
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:33,472
Bang: Would you mind letting us
handle things from here?

408
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:34,807
( Genos gasps )

409
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,542
( Monster yells )

410
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,045
Bomb: Fist of whirling wind
slashing steel!

412

414
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:49,021
Bomb: Let me deal
with the monsters, bang.

415
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:50,222
You take garou.

416
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,557
Bang: My thanks, big brother.

417
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,059
( Knuckles crack )

418
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,329
Garou...

419
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,499
Face to face once again.

420
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,035
- It's been a while.
- ( Wind blows )

421
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,237
Garou: I know that voice.

422
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,843
So the world's most annoying
geezer finally made it.

423
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:15,113
Bang: I'm not sure what the hell
happened to you, garou,

424
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,049
but I will end it here.

425
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,117
Get up on your feet.

Bang: Hmm?

429
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,542
Sourface: Who's the kid?

430
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:44,443
Kind of rude, isn't he?

431
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,848
( Garou breathing heavily )

432
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,017
Sourface: What the hell?

433
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,253
Should I toss him out, master?

434
00:20:58,893 --> 00:20:59,958
( Bang chuckles )

435
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,626
No.

436
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:04,829
When he wakes up,
give him something to eat,

437
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,698
as much as he likes.
