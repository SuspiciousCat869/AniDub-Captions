( Overlapping chatter,

Blue fire: I can’t believe
what i’m hearing.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,300
We’re here to ask
a bunch of criminals for help?

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,910
There’s no way
the association approved this!

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,280
Sitch: But they have!
We’re in a crisis,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,350
one mankind will never overcome

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,050
unless we band together
and unite as one!

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,520
Our current heroes,
comprised of 390 class cs,

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,220
101 class bs, 38 class as,
and the 17 of class s,

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,690
are clearly not enough!

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,990
No one expects you
to work for free.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,330
You will be compensated

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,530
for every individual monster
you defeat!

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,230
Heavy tank loincloth:
Compensated?! That’s madness!

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,640
The association is putting
their faith in this trash

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,570
to help the world?

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,410
Criminal: And what
makes you so special?

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,110
I’ve killed more people
than you’ve met, Mr. Hero.

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,380
Wanna try me?

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,480
Heavy tank loincloth:
These little wimps...

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,350
( Criminal groans )

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,250

Color me impressed.

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,390
She’s good.
Her prophecy’s spot-on.

26
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,630
She knew a god-level threat

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,200
like no one had ever seen
was on its way.

28
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,300
But meathead there’s
got a point.

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,330
All of these nobodies combined

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,070
wouldn’t be enough
to take me down.

31
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,140
Sitch: Huh?

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,640
Tell me, who are you?

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,370
Garou: The name’s garou.

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,510
Wrecked a ton
of so-called tough guys,

35
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,410
and I guess you could say
i’ve got a thing for monsters.

36
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,980
Want a demonstration?

37
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,980
Come at me,
and i’ll take you all down.

38
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,120
Let’s find out
who’s the strongest in here.

39
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,920
Now don’t make me wait all day.
Bring it on.

40
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,460
- Sitch: Cease this foolishness.
- Garou: Foolishness?

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,190
Sitch: We don’t need you.
Get lost.

42
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,560
Garou: I can’t believe
you treat your guests this way,

43
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,630
Mr. Big shot of justice.

44
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,430
Let me show you how it’s done.

45
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,230
Each and every coward here
is cordially invited

46
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,540
to a little slaughter party.

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,970
Sitch: I’ve got a job
for you three heroes.

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,140
Toss this joker out.

49
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,680

Garou: Tough break, grandpa.

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,160
Looks like you forgot to put
some heart into that punch.

55
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,060
The only thing
that really matters

56
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,400
is that the strong are strong!

57

You showed him!

cheering about?

You’re all gonna die, too.

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,940
Criminal #5: Wait.
What did you just say?!

65
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,180
Criminal #6: We’re supposed
to be on the same side here!

66
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,680
Garou: Not true. Heroes are
always late to the party,

67
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,520
while monsters
take the initiative.

68
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,020
They appear without warning,
out of the blue.

69
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,120
Listen up.
You’re on the humans’ side,

70
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,360
while i’m
on the monsters’ side.

who calls himself a monster?

72
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,000
You’re delusional.

73
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,930

certainly liven things up,

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,310
but once you see through them,
they’re ugly.

That might be
a bit much right now.

Well, i’m sure this pile

Today was
my declaration of war.

In six months,

Saitama: All I really did

116
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,280
was just defeat
whatever monsters I bumped into.

117

That’s a big boost.

118
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,050
Genos: It is because nowadays
monsters appear almost daily.

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,580
You defeat them, but you

120

do not report those victories
to the association.

121
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,260
Since your rank is increasing
despite that fact,

122
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,960
it would appear that multiple
eyewitnesses to those deeds

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,480
He’s gonna be pissed...

163
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,480
Big time.

164
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,650
( Pounding on door )

165
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,450
Huh?

166
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,020
Eyelashes: Class b, rank 7,
saitama, step outside!

167
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,360
Class b, rank one,
hellish blizzard

168
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,160
would like to have
a word with you.

169
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,360
Saitama: Uh, i’ve already
got a vacuum cleaner.

170
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,230
Eyelashes: What?
We are not salesmen!

171
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,140
Each of us
are heroes who outrank you!

172
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,240
Blizzard: How do you do,
class-b hero saitama?

173
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,610
My hero name
is hellish blizzard.

174
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,140
Perhaps you’ve heard of me

175
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,680
saitama: Nope,
not even once. Sorry.

176
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,450
Eyelashes: You’re looking
at the class b, rank one hero.

177
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,620
Saitama: Ah, okay, then.
Keep up the good work.

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,950
We good?

179
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,120
( Wild monkey gasps )
Bastard sure is cocky

180
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,120
eyelashes: You don’t seem like
the type who can take a hint,

181
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,860
so let me make
this crystal clear.

182
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,490
Every hero
who ascends to class b

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,930
must first properly introduce
themselves to hellish blizzard.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,370
Saitama: Like, formally?

185
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,870
( Door creaks )

186
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,140
Fine. Hello.
My name is saitama.

187
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,140
What’s shakin’?

188
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,480
( Blizzard sighs )
I guess that’ll do.

189
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,880
Now, then, are you aware

190
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,650
of the various factions
in the hero business?

191
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,150
Saitama: Factions?

192
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,450
Blizzard: Precisely.
In this industry,

193
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,950
if you aren’t part of a group,
you don’t survive.

194
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,360
Saitama: I don’t get
what you mean.

195
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,260
Blizzard: I’m saying
it’s impossible

196
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,890
- to raise your rank alone.
- Saitama: Why?

197
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,330
- Blizzard: There are obstacles.
- Saitama: Like what?

198
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,560
Blizzard: Like rivals.

199
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,430
Saitama: I’m not
getting this at all,

200
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,130
and i’m kinda busy here, so--

201
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,500
blizzard: I’m not done
talking to you!

202
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,000
Saitama: Hmm?

203
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,400
Blizzard: I want you
to join our little group.

204
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,010
If you do, i’ll ensure you
remain in the top of class b.

205
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,280
Saitama: Uh...

206
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,010
Huh?

207
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,510
I get it!

208
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,180
So what you’re saying is,

209
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,950
if I refuse
to align myself with you,

210
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,220
you’ll stand in my way!

211
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,920
Do you make threats like this

212
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,220
to every new hero in class b,
like a gang leader?

213
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,060
Blizzard: No. I only make offers
to those who catch my eye.

214
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,460
Saitama: Are you afraid that I
might take your rank-one spot?

215
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,600
Look, don’t worry about it.

216
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,900
I’ll make class a pretty soon.

217
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,500
Speaking of, why haven’t you
moved on to class a?

218
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,240
Blizzard: I’m still waiting
for your answer.

219
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,440
Saitama: Obviously
the answer is no.

220
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,140
There shouldn’t be a cliquey
pecking order between heroes.

221
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,480
Blizzard:
Time to teach him a lesson!

222
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,480
Men: Yes!

223
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,880
Blizzard: Rough him up so bad

224
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,510
he never works as a hero again!

225
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,050
Wipe that smirk off his face!

Saitama: You won’t survive
like that, blizzard.

230
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,100
Give it up.

231
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,600
Blizzard: What a shame.

232
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,540
Guess i’ll
have to handle this myself.

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
( Saitama gasps )

234
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,510
Is this...

235
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,350
Telekinesis?

236
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,980
Blizzard: Yes, exactly.

237
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,350
You don’t seem surprised.

238
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,620
Saitama: So are you gonna fight

239
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,520
by flinging
rocks and stuff at me? Bad idea.

240
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,290
Blizzard: I will make you regret
ever choosing to mock me, fool.

241
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,490
I’ll kill you so bad,
you’ll beg for death.

242
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,460
Hellstorm!

243
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,600
Flesh peels away.
Bones crack.

244
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,970
The brutality of it all
breaks your will in an instant.

245
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,540
You did this to yourself.

246
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,040
You deserve it
for thinking you can surpass me.

247
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,310
No one is better than me!

248
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,610
All my enemies tremble befor--

249
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,180
saitama: You know,
for a top-ranker,

250
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,350
you’re kinda sensitive.

251
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,190
Blizzard: I’ll crush you!

252
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,250
Saitama: You don’t get
what it means to be a hero.

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,260
The world is chock-full

254
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,590
of super-strong
and pretty awful people.

255
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,590
Standing up to them
is what heroes do,

256
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,230
even if that means
doing it alone.

257
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,170
This whole act is pathetic.

258
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,900
You surround yourself
with weaklings and kiss-asses

259
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,170
just so you can feel
like you might be strong.

These factions,
crushing the noobs,

that ranking stuff,
none of it matters.

as your latest
newcomer hero to crush.

Even just standing there,

all you’ve got?

Man: Class s, rank 14, genos
and class b, rank 7, saitama.

484
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,780
So then, are we in full
agreement on their hero names?

485
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,880
Group: Aye!

486
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,610
Man: For slaying
numerous monsters

487
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,880
with steadfast resolve
and dauntless courage,

488
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,920
genos’ hero name
will be demon cyborg.

489
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,720
And, based on his appearance,

490
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,090
saitama’s name
will be caped baldy.

491
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,890
Man #2: Every aspiring hero
dreams of having a hero name.

492
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,130
I’m sure they’ll be elated
to hear theirs. ( Chuckles )

493
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,760
Man #3: Demon cyborg
and caped baldy.

494
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,000
I’m confident those two
will work even harder now.

497
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,110
Two hours of chitchat
about some useless nicknames,

498
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,280
while the discussion
on how to deal with garou

499
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,280
ended in 15 minutes.

500
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,210
Damn them
and their Rose-colored glasses.

501
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,250
Man #1: Are you referring
to that crazy fellow

502
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,820
who calls himself a monster?

503
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,690
No need to panic, sitch.

504
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,050
Man #2: Class s,
rank 3, silverfang

505
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,820
is already in pursuit.

506
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,060
I’m confident in his abilities
on matters like this.

507
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,660
Man #3: Yes, I think
we can trust in him.

508
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,130
Man #4: If need be,
tornado and blast can assist.

509
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,100
Man #1: He’s just a man,
sitch, nothing more.

510
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,670
He likely has nothing to do
with the prophecy.

511
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,970
Sitch: Damn it all!

512
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,570
Will they really be enough
to deal with garou?

What the hell?

515
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,150
Who--who the hell are you?

516
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,050
I’m a class-a hero,
not a criminal.

517
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,750
Why did you attack me?

518
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,950
Garou: Class a, rank 9,
tank-top vegetarian.

519
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,120
Because you just happened
to cross my path.

520
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,730
But i’m stunned
by the lack of challenge.

521
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,890
Tank-top vegetarian: Then I
suggest you brace yourself.

522
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,500
This is what happens
when you tangle with a hero.

- ( Groans )

524

Garou: Gotta say,
i’m not impressed.

525
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,240
I look forward to finding one

526
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,110
who can battle
a monster-class hero.
