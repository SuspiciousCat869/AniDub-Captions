rides on a train

a valuable asset.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center

Indeed.

another full-blown event

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center

was unacceptable.

they'd be of some use to me

and ability to take action,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center

they're out of control.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
It's time to cut them loose.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center

let loose on the world,

they're completely
out of our control.

Because Misaka's handwriting

It stands for "Disciplinary

They're a cooperative

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
At least, that's what
they claim to be.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
In actuality, they're
a secret society.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
A pretty nasty one at that.

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] Yes, and they'll

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
what they refer to as "justice."

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.395 position:50% align:center
But that's no shock considering
the group was founded

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center

they have a ton of sympathizers.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
Sympathizers?

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center

so they're taking
measures to eliminate

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
the organization completely.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
Thanks to that,
the atmosphere around DA

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
is even more dangerous
than usual.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
Not to mention the VIP
that kept Anti-Skill

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
from shutting down
the organization

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
is now allowing them to
take action against DA.

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:09.381 position:50% align:center
All I can say is, if you're
planning on getting involved,

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
be extra careful.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] Yeah.
I don't care about any of that.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
What I do care about
is crushing anyone I hate,

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
doesn't matter how high up
or how many there are.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
End of story.

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Sorry about this.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.608 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA] There's nothing
to apologize for.

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
As long as I allocate 60% of my
brain's capacity to this task,

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
I'm able to temporarily
elevate my sense of smell.

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
I've completed my analysis.
Straight ahead.

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
There's no time to waste.
Let's go!

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 04A] The foolish
evildoer has mobilized!

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.754 position:50% align:center
Despite assisting us on
several occasions in the past,

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
Nakimoto apparently
no longer understands

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
our lofty ideals.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
That's a worldly snob for you.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 04B] But...
should we make an enemy

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
out of the governing board?

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 04A]
What are you saying, coward?

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.642 position:50% align:center
Did you or did
you not swear an oath

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
to eliminate any and all
evil for the sake of justice!

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
Fainthearted defeatists
must be purged!

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 04C] Fainthearted
defeatists must be purged!

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 04D] Fainthearted
defeatists must be purged!

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 04B]
No, you're right!

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
We did resolve
to give up our lives

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
for the sake of justice.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
I admit, I was wrong.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 04A]
Doesn't matter.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
We're better equipped
than ever before

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
to take a stand against
the governing board.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:31.046 position:50% align:center
Conditions are ideal for
us to use our powers

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
and combat all forms of evil.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
It's about time we showed
them what the strength

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
of justice is truly capable of.

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
And by doing so,
we'll finally bring peace

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
to Academy City!

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM cheers]

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] These guys need
to get out more, mmm.

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Hmm...

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
That reminds me.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
The idiot who ran out
during the mission

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
brought a hostage
back to the base.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.576 position:50% align:center
I want her.

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.328 position:50% align:center
Think I could have her?

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
[RING-WEARING MAN]
Very well.

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:05.747 position:50% align:center
I'll have her sent to you.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Thanks a ton, mmm.

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
[RING-WEARING MAN] If you
tell me why this individual

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
interests you.

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
To aid DA's cause, naturally.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
Nothing gives me greater
pleasure than helping

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
spread justice.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
[crunching]

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA] The more I
investigate, the more they come

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
out of the woodwork.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
DA is a viper pit of terrorists.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
Why didn't they appear
on our radar before?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, they're
popping up everywhere.

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:37.779 position:50% align:center
And based on what I'm seeing,

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
the weapons they're
using are vastly superior

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
to even our state-
of-the-art equipment.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
This is one serious
organization we're dealing with.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
He's former Anti-Skill!

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
Went missing after
using excessive force

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
against a student and
leaving them half-paralyzed.

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
Why's he in this lineup?

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
This one illegally sold
Anti-Skill weapons

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
on the side and was dismissed.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
If I remember right,
he was arming a hostile group

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center
that targeted dissidents.

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
It's like every bad element
within Anti-Skill joined up.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
[TROOPER]
Warehouse explosion!

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
In the Third District!

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center
[NARU] So, are we done
earning our spare change?

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Did you do a final headcount?

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Aww. Look around.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
We wiped this place off
the face of the earth.

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
Can't we just assume
everyone was taken out?

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
[SEIKE] First off,
this isn't our only location.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
Secondly, we need to be sure.

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
I didn't see anyone
carrying a bag big enough

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
to have a girl
stuffed inside it.

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
What'd I say?

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
No way!

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:45.555 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMARU]
Listen up.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
Don't take this lightly.

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
We've been hired
to completely eradicate

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
this DA organization.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
If we fail to kill all our
targets, no matter their rank,

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
it'll be a breach of contract.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
[NARU whines]
So what do we do?

00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:04.157 position:50% align:center
[LEADER] We stay calm
and finish the mission.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.451 position:50% align:center
This is my Predator
we're talking about.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.079 position:50% align:center
You think a mere human
could escape from its sight?

00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:21.341 position:50% align:center
[NARU chuckles]

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:23.218 position:50% align:center
Every time you use
your ability, it reminds me

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:25.970 position:50% align:center
of some sweaty stalker
trying to catch a peek.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:32.143 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
There you are.
