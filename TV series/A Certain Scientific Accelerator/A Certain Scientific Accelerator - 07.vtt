[HISHIGATA humming]

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center
Could be a chance I made the
part configuration too complex.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.546 position:50% align:center
As soon as the memories of
10,031 deaths are in my hands,

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
I can complete the formula.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
We're close.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.468 position:50% align:center
Just a little while longer
until our research

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.386 position:50% align:center
is finally complete...

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
Hirumi.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
This isn't going to cut it.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:09.944 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.115 position:50% align:center
Adonai.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.952 position:50% align:center
Right, um,
lay her down over here.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER grunts]

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center
She's going to be okay.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.008 position:50% align:center
The life force flowing
through her body

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.135 position:50% align:center
appears largely undisturbed.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.768 position:50% align:center
Do you have the power
to heal that one?

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.103 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
No.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.105 position:50% align:center
I'm only able to check
on the state of her body.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:50.235 position:50% align:center
I wish I could do more,
but all I can do is administer

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.529 position:50% align:center
basic first aid.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.531 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't shown up.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:57.992 position:50% align:center
I don't think any of us
would be alive right now.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:01:59.703 position:50% align:center
I'm... I'm grateful.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:00.787 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.164 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile...

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:04.624 position:50% align:center
I was useless.

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:06.543 position:50% align:center
I couldn't do anything at all.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:11.798 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI giggles]

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
What do you think you're doing?

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
These aren't the sort of
people who feel gratitude.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
After losing so badly,
I'm sure they'll regret

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
the trouble they've caused.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50% align:center
Like hell they will.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] The way things
were going, we were close to

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
being killed.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
You really are incredible.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
How you save people from
death using your power.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] All I did was
stomp on some annoying bugs.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
You're wrong.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh?

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I can tell by looking at them.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
While you may've caused
physical damage,

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
your attacks weren't
meant to take their lives.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
Even though you do
your best to look and act

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
like you're wild and unmannered,

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
you're continuously
helping other people.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
In other words, the only
conclusion I can draw

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
is that you're good.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
You should stop coming
to your own conclusions.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] I'm certain you
really are the one!

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh?

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
If you'd allow me...

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:37.068 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to ask you is...

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
Would...

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
Would you be my master?

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] When a member of
the Rosenthal family pledges

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
their devotion to a teacher,

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50% align:center
our custom is for the disciple
to present an article

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
of red clothing or gear
they're wearing.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.877 position:50% align:center
It represents a blood
oath to their master.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] By adding depth
and giving form to it,

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
the significance of the
gesture increases.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
Not interested.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
Try asking the Anti-Skill
lady when shes wakes up.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
But... I need your help
if I'm going to defeat--

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Please! Teach me your strength!

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
What's it going to take
to change your mind?

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
Huotou!

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
You try asking him too!

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
As you command.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
Carrying out Adonai's order.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER gasps]

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:43.802 position:50% align:center
[HUOTOU] Accelerator, I request
you be Adonai's master.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
Please, I'm begging you!

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
See?

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] Why is she still
not wearing any clothes?

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
There wasn't time
to properly equip.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
Our first priority was to
make sure we didn't lose sight

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
of the enemy.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
But you're right.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.778 position:50% align:center
It would've improved
her defense.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I know!

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
I'll just give Huotou
my outfit to wear!

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
This should at least lend
her some protection--

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
Adonai, doing so would
decrease your own defenses.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
What if I were to borrow
Accelerator's garments instead?

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
That makes sense!

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
After all, a master doesn't
need to rely on clothing

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
to protect themselves.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
If you would!

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.635 position:50% align:center
If you'd be so kind!

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Master!

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI giggles]

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
[HUOTOU] I request you
be Adonai's master.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.989 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] You don't even
need to instruct me!

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
I'll learn by watching!
Please say "yes!"

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.995 position:50% align:center
[HUOTOU] I request you be
Adonai's master a second time.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] There's a huge
difference between having

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
a teacher and not having one!

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
[HUOTOU] I ask earnestly
and repeatedly that you be

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.543 position:50% align:center
Adonai's master.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I'm begging you!

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
I need to be your disciple!

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes!

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
Please!

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
Let go.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
You're such a pest.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER screams]

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
You don't understand!

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
If we let them be,
the world will be in danger.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
Makes no difference to me
what happens to the world.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
And if you keep pestering me,

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure you
shut up permanently.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] I need to stop Hirumi,
no matter what!

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.580 position:50% align:center
And the way I am now...

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
I'm unable to.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
I need to learn
how to be strong.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR growls]

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.260 position:50% align:center
Please help me!

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Hmph. You're willful.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50% align:center
I'll give you that much,
at least.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA]
What's going on here?

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
Do you realize you're injured?

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
Misaka suggests
first aid be applied

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
to stop the bleeding.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
Yes, Huotou agrees.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey...

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA]
Come on, stop struggling.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50% align:center
Take it easy.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Master, wait!

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
Don't leave!

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
You're an idiot if you think
I care about what you want,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.458 position:50% align:center
but Hishigata, was it?

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
That guy rubs me the wrong way.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna find him.
And crush him!

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
Then allow me to come with you!

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
Suit yourself.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER gasps]

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
Those are Rosenthal
magical arrays.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
By the looks of it, Taotie.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.613 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] A Si-xiong charm,
much more powerful than Huotou.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
Keep your distance!
It's me they want! I'll...

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
You stay back with them.

00:08:58.496 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
Isn't this convenient?

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
I don't have to go looking for
leads when the leads come to me.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Wait!

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
We still don't have
any idea what abilities

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
he's enhanced yet!

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
So be careful!

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Master!

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
Accelerator!

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
The ability to switch places.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
So you can "Replace"?

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.284 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER gasps]

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] Tch. You think
two against one gives you

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center

You out of comebacks?

[FEMALE VOICE]
Stay out of this.

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.136 position:50% align:center
A girl?

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
Hirumi.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
You have to stop this!

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
Give her back!

Adonai, have you been injured?

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] You trying
to get yourself killed?

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
Now what is it?

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch. Another corpse ability.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
So, he's got three of them.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
[MISAKA 10046 gasps]

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
Let her go! Now!

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
That's what you were after?

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:56.114 position:50% align:center
If you're done being sneaky,
how about we fight?

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.538 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
See you around, Esther.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Where do you think you're going?

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
Great.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
Go. Chase them.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
That would prove
to be difficult.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
Given the extent of the flames,
70% of my body

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
would suffer critical burns,
which would result

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
in my mobility
dropping below 50%.

[YOMIKAWA]
You're not going alone!

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
Adonai, there is only
one chance for success.

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
Shall I execute your order?

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Negative.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
I'm rescinding it.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA]
I see.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
And reinforcements?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
Copy that.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
Currently standing by.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
I'm positive I saw your
dead body, Hasami Hitokawa.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
So how are you still alive?

00:11:58.385 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Actually, she isn't.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Hasami Hitokawa is dead.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
She's able to move freely
because I grafted a pseudo-soul

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
to her body.

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
And what is a pseudo-soul?

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
It's been artificially created.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
Basically...

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
The Rosenthal line
are necromancers.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
My family's been commanding
the bodies of the deceased

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
for generations.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.620 position:50% align:center
You're saying you
brought her back to life?

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
You don't believe me.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA] How can I
deny it when the proof

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
is in front of me?

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
She was declared dead,
but here she is,

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center
walking around and speaking.

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
Still, that doesn't explain
how you're connected

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.761 position:50% align:center
to those huge ability-using
weapons.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.681 position:50% align:center
They're my fault.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
It's my responsibility
to stop them.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Huh?

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
How are you doing that?!

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
You're incredible!

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
I'm just as surprised
as you are!

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
Regardless, we can't have this.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
Moving coffins around
without permission.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.623 position:50% align:center
Mmm?

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
You caught the Sister
by yourself?

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
That's fantastic!

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
You never cease
to amaze me, Hirumi!

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI laughs]

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
Then I guess it's
my turn to play, huh?

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Let's go! Wait. What's that?

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA]
Now I get it.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
This explains the reason
why she was placed inside

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
that large weapon.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
It was because of necromancy.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
Developed by
Hishigata and myself.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
Mikihiko Hishigata.

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
So he's the one behind all this.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
Those other weapons,
are they also controlled

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
using necromancy?

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
They're even more dangerous,

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
because they rely on the
Evil Spirits of the Numbers.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
The Evil Spirits of the Numbers?

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Qiongqi, Hundun, and Taotie.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
They're a trio of
special pseudo-souls,

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.389 position:50% align:center
created by our fifth
family head, Nathan,

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
and fine-tuned for generations.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
Stronger than her?

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm plenty surprised
by how strong she is.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Bodies that have an
Evil Spirits of the Numbers

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
charm performed on them
demonstrate power in excess

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
of their actual potential,

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
but it's difficult for an
ordinary necromancer

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
to control it.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
Let alone Hishigata,
who isn't one at all.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
Continued use of them
is dangerous!

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
There have even been
stories of them losing control

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.790 position:50% align:center
and destroying entire cities.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.377 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
So, bad news, huh?

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] Well, if it
isn't Accelerator. Mmm.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
So the piles of junk
are switching drivers, huh?

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] Can you pretend
to be a little impressed?

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
Unlike the prototype
you destroyed,

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.988 position:50% align:center
each of these has a
pseudo-soul boosting

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
their abilities to
Level Five. Mmm.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.285 position:50% align:center
You may be the
first-ranked esper

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
in Academy City, but...

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
You're really annoying me.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
Just tell me where you're
hiding, you shut-in.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
So I can tear your
body into pieces.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA laughs]
Pretty confident, aren't ya?

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
It looked like you had
your hands full

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
taking on Qiong qi earlier.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
Let's see you try
and wreck this.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] You small-fries
always get too full of

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
yourselves!

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.607 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Like I already said...

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
Psychokinesis has
more versatility

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.361 position:50% align:center
than any of your abilities!

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
Powerful as it may be,
your vector manipulation

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
requires you to have
a medium to work with!

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
Without direct contact,
it's no different

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
than any other
physical phenomenon!

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA gasps]

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] I don't care if
you are using psychokinesis.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
As long as there's a force at
work, there'll also be vectors.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:06.174 position:50% align:center
Don't fool yourself.

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
Doesn't make a difference
how many Level Five

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
piles of junk you throw at me.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
Remember.

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.141 position:50% align:center
I'm still the
first-ranked esper.

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
So good!

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.977 position:50% align:center
I need him now!

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:21.147 position:50% align:center
The low-level espers I used in
my past experiments were trash!

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
But a specimen like him
inside a coffin would be...

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
I'm sure whatever happened,
it would be amazing!

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:32.117 position:50% align:center
Oh, Brother.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Guess I got carried
away. You're right.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
Our first priority ought to be
achieving our initial goal.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] So what part
should I destroy next?

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:44.921 position:50% align:center
An arm?

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
Or another leg?

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] Huh? I thought
this was gonna be one-on-one.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
My apologies.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't waste
time on you, but...

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
I was so delighted
by our reunion,

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help butting in.

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
However, I need to get back
to my original objective now.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
I didn't say you could
dart off wherever you like!

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.330 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Ah, too bad!

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
The prime field ability
installed within Hundun

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
creates "Stealth Hide,"
which dulls the senses

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
of nearby humans.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
The ability is boosted
by the coffin,

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
meaning it's able to completely
avoid being recognized!

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
Impressive, no?

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA] All I can say is,
she looks like a living,

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
breathing person.

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
That was my mistake too.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Hishigata and I both
believed we could control

I knew the truth
and couldn't admit it!

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
I have to stop him.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.782 position:50% align:center
And you're certain
you can't let Anti-Skill

00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
handle this situation?

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
I'm responsible
for sowing the seed

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
and getting my Master involved.

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
Leaving it for someone
else to clean up

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
is impossible.

Why're there so many
kids in Academy City

who feel they have to take
everything on themselves?

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] I hate to ask,
but could you accompany me

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
a while longer?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
Anything you wish, Adonai.

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Forgive me, Hitokawa.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
This will be the last time.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
Once this is over,
I'm through with necromancy.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] We're nearly done
copying over all 10,031 deaths.

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
After that, I just need
to download the formula

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
that incorporates them,
and then you'll finally

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
get your hands on
the perfect ability.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.220 position:50% align:center
Are you thrilled?

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
What would've made me
happier was getting ahold

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
of Last Order and having
data from the host individual.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] I wanted her too,
but I had no idea

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
DA would prove to be so useless.

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, Hirumi.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center

You'll never catch Hundun
running around like that.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] Then how come
they're still following me?

[HISHIGATA]
Hm?

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Or should I answer for you?

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's because
I'm right on the trail

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
of your pile of junk!

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter
if it's invisible.

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
As long as there's
a physical presence,

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
it still creates motion
and air currents.

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:47.812 position:50% align:center
And calculating those allows
me to pinpoint its location.

You're full of surprises.

could create any number of.

From the 10,031 clones
you already massacred.

a sudden you decided

to play hero and try
to save just this one.

you're so concerned

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
in the first place.

Look at their purpose.
Why they were made.

See, the clones are nothing
more than guinea pigs

have broken down,

treated like a guinea pig.
