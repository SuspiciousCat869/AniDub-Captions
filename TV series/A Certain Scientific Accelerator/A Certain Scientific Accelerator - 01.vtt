00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA]
What kind of weapon?

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA] The facility

with specifics.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] If they can
refuse to share information

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center

As if you can drive.

You ought to know better.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
You really do go to great
lengths for that little girl.

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.711 position:50% align:center
I just can't stand the
thought of those punks

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
getting the better of me.

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
Not to mention they made
off with your genetic data.

You may not realize it,
but she thinks the world of you.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center
Do you know how long she spent--

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
Anyway, where do you
think we'll find them?

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
Standard villain logic dictates
they'll be headed underground

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.980 position:50% align:center
to avoid any
satellite surveillance.

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKAWA] There's a sewer
system not far from here.

Head in that direction.

They tunneled again.

Hey, I was wondering.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
You don't think they
caught Hiro, do you?

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you're still
going on about that?

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.794 position:50% align:center
If you're concerned,
go help him.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
Myself?

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
[TAKATA] The blood on that bag
you're holding is carrying

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
radical first-ranked
genetic material.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
We'll sell it to a lab and
if we play our cards right,

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
we may just wind up
being billionaires.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
After that, getting Hiro
back won't be a problem.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.688 position:50% align:center
But first, we have to
make a clean getaway.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
[KIDERA] Then why're you
planting those charges?

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
[TAKATA]
To ensure no one follows us.

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
You didn't actually think
we were in the clear,

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
especially with a slowpoke
like you tagging along.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] Would've
been smarter to collapse it

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
on yourself.

[TAKATA laughs]
What're you even talking about?

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
You may be a Level 5,
but you can't get close to me.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
That was super-radical!

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
No! Beyond radical!

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
But there's no way you
could've survived that.

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
Aw, what's the matter? Let down?

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
[TAKATA grunts]

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
Cat's outta the bag in terms
of how that toy of yours works.

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
It runs off nitrogen, right?

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
That last explosion
employed the element,

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
which turns solid
at -210 degrees.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
Which means that
weapon is just a glorified

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
high-pressure water cutter.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
Only it operates off
liquid nitrogen instead.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
But the real clencher is how
you relied on the residual gas

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.132 position:50% align:center
the machine spread around
to deprive enemies of oxygen

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
if they got too close to you.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
[TAKATA]
Get your filthy hand off of me.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
My pleasure!

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
[TAKATA yelps]

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
The only thing that's
shocking is you thought you

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
Could outmatch me with
that piece of garbage

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
strapped to your back.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
As to how you were able
to stand in the middle

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
of the nitrogen vapor
without experiencing

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
any negative side effects,
that explains why

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
you brought along a crew,
namely the one over here

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.654 position:50% align:center
with the shaky hands.

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
You're able to control
the concentration of gases

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
dispersed in the air.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
Something like
an aero-separator.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
Very clever maintaining
enough breathable air

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
around you and your friends.

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
But now that I've figured
out your game, it's over.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
My ability to manipulate
vectors is compatible to yours!

you're all out of surprises.
