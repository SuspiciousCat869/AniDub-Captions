Misaka will! It's no problem!

00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:01.381 position:50% align:center
Misaka is making this bed!

No! Mi---!

[ACCELERATOR] Same crap-heap
of a city, like always.

00:23:08.096 --> 00:23:10.682 position:50% align:center
There're villains who
plotted this incident

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:13.518 position:50% align:center
still creeping around.

00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.854 position:50% align:center
As long as we stay in this city,

00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:18.356 position:50% align:center
villains will have
to remain villains.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.110 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, we won't be
able to protect anything.

[ACCELERATOR]
Huh?

00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:05.070 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Honestly... this damn city.

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:06.738 position:50% align:center
It never gets boring.
