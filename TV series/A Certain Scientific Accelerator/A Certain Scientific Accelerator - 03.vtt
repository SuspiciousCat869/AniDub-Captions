00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
That's the place.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.717 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
This feels surreal.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
I never expected
to come back here.

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:41.101 position:50% align:center
Now there's that
old familiar smell.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.811 position:50% align:center
Hey, come on,
the entrance is over here.

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.104 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:56.658 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.410 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Someone beat us.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.746 position:50% align:center
Nothing left.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.998 position:50% align:center
Not even mind-reading
would help with him.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.093 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER gasps]

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Qiong qi.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] I never expected
you'd be the one to come

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
searching for me.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Hello, Esther.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
That voice.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
Mikihiko Hishigata.

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER gasps]

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] Your timing
couldn't be more perfect.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
Qiong qi is completed.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to see it more
than anyone else. Mmm.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] You think you can get
away with making a monstrosity

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
like this?

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] It's a little
late to be asking that.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
After all, you're the one
responsible for teaching me

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
everything I know about
reanimating the dead.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] And what about
Taotie and Hundun?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
Are they already...?

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Yeah.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
I've inserted the evil
spirits of the Numbers

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
your family created into them.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
I cannot express
my gratitude. Mmm.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
It took a lot of dead bodies,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
but we were finally able
to make enough souls.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
You have to stop!

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Don't tell me you're spooked.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
It wasn't long ago you
were manipulating the dead,

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
same as me.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
You're wrong! I was just...

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Deny it all you want.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
From the deceased's
point-of-view,

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center
they're still being used
to satisfy the wishes

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50% align:center
of the living.

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
Don't pretend you're
any different, Esther.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Stop this.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
Please.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center
You have to stop.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Hey!

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
Could you stop spouting
cryptic garbage at one another?

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] Huh? I take it
you must be Accelerator.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
Mmm. Last Order's
guardian, right?

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
Mmm.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
One of these days, I'd like
to have you as a subject.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh?

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize using
corpses as dolls

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
was getting to be
such a popular pastime.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
That's a line even
I wouldn't cross.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
There's no reason to be so cold.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
In a sense, I'm complimenting
you and your killing style.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Momentum. Heat.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
And wow, even electricity?

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
Seems like vector control
can do just about anything.

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
And look at all the information
you're generating around you.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.622 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the key to
knowing what makes you tick

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
lies in there.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50% align:center
Either way,
you're just a bystander.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
It's premature to fight you now
and nothing would be gained.

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:22.465 position:50% align:center
On that note...

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
Bystander?

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] I think a
tactical retreat is in order.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
There's no way I'm
letting you walk outta here!

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER gasps]

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] I've collected
all sorts of data on you.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh?

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] For instance,
I know whatever you touch

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
with your vector manipulation
becomes your target.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
And if you're at a distance
and can't make contact,

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
your attacks are no
different than any other

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
physical phenomenon.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR yells]

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.549 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA laughs]

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
It's really something, isn't it?

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.095 position:50% align:center
This psychokinesis is quite
versatile once it's boosted

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
to Level Five.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
Huh? Did you say Level Five?

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
Mmm?

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
Well... I'll be seeing you.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Hishigata was right.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
He and I are the same.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
I controlled the dead too and
forced them do my bidding.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
I was using them.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Yeah, so what?

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] I thought you
were trying to stop him.

[LAST ORDER] "I went out
and bought three lunches,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center

Guess you're hungry,"

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
Misaka Misaka exclaims,
not mentioning a word

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
about the tasty snack she
ended up buying for herself.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Hm?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
[LAST ORDER] There's a strange
girl sitting across from you

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.594 position:50% align:center
on the bed.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
Who might she be?

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:38.018 position:50% align:center
Who might you be?

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Her name's--

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
I wasn't talking to you!

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
Who might you be?

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
Esther Rosenthal.
A pleasure to meet you.

--I'm a necromanc--
--[ACCELERATOR] Hey!

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
What I meant was,

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.458 position:50% align:center
I'm actually sort of like one
of Accelerator's classmates.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
And was just asking
him for advice.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
[LAST ORDER] "Nice to meet you,"
says Misaka Misaka,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.008 position:50% align:center
suspiciously glancing
over at your expression,

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
attempting to figure out what
all the eye contact is about.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
I know something's going on and
you're keeping me in the dark!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
You no-good two-timer!

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Hey.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Damn it.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50% align:center
Now what're we supposed to eat?

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
Hmph! "If you're really
hungry, then the three of us

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
could always go to a
restaurant," says Misaka Misaka,

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
giving you a chance to
apologize for all the pain

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
your infidelity has caused her.

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] I'm getting sick
of always eating at that place.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
Then you're not angry?

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
It's against my policy
to sweat the small stuff.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
Hooray!

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
"Real quick. Can I order
whatever I want today?"

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Is this really her?

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.860 position:50% align:center
A human guinea pig
that's experienced death

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
over 10,000 times?

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
I find it hard to believe.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
[door chimes]

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I can safely say...

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.177 position:50% align:center
I don't recognize a
single dish served here!

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.430 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Fascinating.

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Oh, look! This one!

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
What kind of food is
the beef curry, exactly?

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Beef curry.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
Spicy!

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Got it.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
But what sort of meat
is it served with?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
Sheep, maybe? Or goat?

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
Beef curry.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.736 position:50% align:center
It's got cow meat in it!

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
And this bizarre looking...

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a hamburger.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
Also with cow meat!

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
You know everything
about this place!

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
I'm an expert! Ask me anything!

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
All right, then. Hmm.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me what
kind of food this is?

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
Easy. A crunchy meal
that's bursting

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
with unbelievable flavor!

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
It's also known as pork,
deep-fried in oil.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
And this?

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
A delicious dish that manages
to be both piping-hot

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
and also super-creamy!

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
While that's technically true,

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA]
I'm sorry.

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA'S MOTHER]
What's going on?

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA]
I'm sorry!

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA'S MOTHER]
Just tell me what's wrong!

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.072 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA]
I'm sorry.

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA'S MOTHER]
What's the matter, Hasami?

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
Answer me!

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA]
I'm sorry.

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA]
I'm sorry.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:39.012 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA] Huh?
You mean... I'm still alive?

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 02A]
She's regained consciousness.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 02D]
Impressive.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
A Level Two pyrokinesist.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
Her ability's suited for combat.

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
Not a half-bad subject.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
And best of all, no one
will look into her death.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA]
What?

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
[ALPHA TEAM 02B]
Understood.

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
Commencing with disposal.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.530 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
Your body will serve
our cause and be used

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:00.909 position:50% align:center
to carry out justice.

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
[HITOKAWA gasping]

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Stop it!

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Are you all right?

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
I've never felt better.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
You startled me.

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect you to
touch her residual thoughts.

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
When they're uncontrolled,
they can contain

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
dangerous information.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
People sometimes refer
to them as site-bound spirits.

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
They're a tool
for us necromancers.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:28.186 position:50% align:center
We use them as
a sort of key code,

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
which allows us to slip
a pseudo-soul into a body.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I was successful.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
Now that my Huotou
is affixed to her,

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
I can close her conduit.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
It'll take a moment.

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:44.327 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] What was that
enormous amount of data

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.162 position:50% align:center
I experienced?

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
A mind-reading ability?

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
But it's specific to corpses.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
Talk about freakin' weird.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
There was also
that last vision I saw.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
Those guys will commit murder
just to get more bodies?

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
Kids, you're trespassing.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
You need to leave.

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Yeah. Real subtle.

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
Come on.
We told you to get lost.

00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
Move it.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
There's a chance
this could end badly.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
Why's that?

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
Because I've already attached
my Huotou to Hasami Hitokawa.

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
So there's a chance
her body will start moving

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
in front of those men.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:32.334 position:50% align:center
In a second, that'll be
the least of their worries.

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Huh?

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
Wait. Huh? I just had it.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.589 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
The solution's gone.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.633 position:50% align:center
Without it, how're
we going to properly

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
dispose of the evidence?

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Hey.

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
I thought I told
you kids to clear out.

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] By "solution," you
wouldn't happen to mean this?

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
How?

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
Hand that over this instant!

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
Yeah? It sounds like there's
something dangerous inside.

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
So. What if it accidentally
spilled and landed on you?

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.112 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, not a bad dodge.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
Heh. So, what's next?

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:11.373 position:50% align:center
Damn. This brat is mocking us.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.667 position:50% align:center
Then again, disciplining
rebellious children

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.211 position:50% align:center
is one of our group's
primary duties.

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:23.843 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.471 position:50% align:center
It's time...

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:28.515 position:50% align:center
...to bring about justice!
