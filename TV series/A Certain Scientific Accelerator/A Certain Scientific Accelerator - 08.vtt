00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] Tell me, Brother, what
kind of ability do you think

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
a Level Six will have?

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:39.039 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] That's something
even I don't know. Mmm.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] You don't know and you
still think I should become one?

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.669 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] What can you tell me
about the Level Fives, Hirumi?

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
Well, there's the
standalone third-ranked,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
who's as powerful
as a battle cruiser.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
And then there's
the first-ranked,

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.678 position:50% align:center
who can't even
be hurt with a nuke.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:56.598 position:50% align:center
Honestly, they all kinda
sound like urban legends.

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.475 position:50% align:center
It can be difficult
to maintain perspective

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.268 position:50% align:center
when you're talking about
people whose abilities

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
are so far above the norm.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
Now try to imagine a monster
who's reached Level Six.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
Somebody who's even tougher
than the first-ranked,

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:08.777 position:50% align:center
who won't die no matter what.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:10.904 position:50% align:center
Hirumi?

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:14.574 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
Today I met her.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.702 position:50% align:center
The girl who could help
us realize our dream

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.662 position:50% align:center
of creating a Level Six.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.584 position:50% align:center
Our best hope:
the necromancer Esther.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] Whoa. A real,
live necromancer. Crazy.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.556 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess this is one
direction we haven't tried.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.600 position:50% align:center
Hirumi, that's enough for today.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.353 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.898 position:50% align:center
I gotta say,
I'm a little surprised.

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center
I was picturing someone in a
musty, old-fashioned lab coat.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.153 position:50% align:center
I said we're done,
so go home already.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.988 position:50% align:center
My clothing is never musty.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.700 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I'm sorry! Don't hurt me!

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.661 position:50% align:center
My presence was
requested here, so I came.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.496 position:50% align:center
But what is this place?

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] Oh, these are
your forerunners, mmm.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.043 position:50% align:center
They're relics from when
our research hit a dead end

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50% align:center
and we had to look
for hints elsewhere.

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.257 position:50% align:center
We tried some OOPArts,
but they didn't work,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
and neither did extracts
from cryptid animals,

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.844 position:50% align:center
so now we've
brought in a person.

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.512 position:50% align:center
There was that orichalcum stuff.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.723 position:50% align:center
It's some sort of
legendary metal, right?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.933 position:50% align:center
I forget what number
we were on then.

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:24.644 position:50% align:center
Orichalcum was our
third sample, I believe.

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:26.771 position:50% align:center
Although it turned out
to be just a simple alloy

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.606 position:50% align:center
of iron and brass.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.275 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
That's my forerunner?

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.402 position:50% align:center
I hope you realize
I am not made of metal.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.531 position:50% align:center
I also know you're not
a carboxylic acid ester.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.743 position:50% align:center
She won't get your
dumb science nerd puns.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.411 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure this is gonna work.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on, how am
I supposed to collaborate

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
with somebody who
doesn't even know

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
about polyester?

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
My brother likes to flaunt
his useless knowledge

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
to reassure himself that he
has the intellectual upper hand.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
It's pretty annoying, actually.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
For the last time, would you
please get out of here?

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we asked you to
come because we're really

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.515 position:50% align:center
hoping you'll agree
to work with us, Esther.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
Uh, on what?

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI giggling]

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
[giggling continues]

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you okay?

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.080 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
My brother and I have a dream:

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.665 position:50% align:center
to create the world's
first Level Six.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
And we need your help.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Just to confirm,
you know I use necromancy.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
The process starts
with a pseudo-soul,

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
which is then loaded into a
dead body so I can control it.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
For that purpose, I even brought
my precious Si-xiong charms.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
Qiongqi, Hundun, Taotie,
and finally, Taowu.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
I'm a man of science, but if you
want to believe in that stuff,

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.695 position:50% align:center
I can't stop you.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
At least explain that thing!

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
I don't work with machines.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
What is it you're after?

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] I'm doing research
to determine where exactly

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
esper abilities reside
within the body. Mmm.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
To that end, I've been
using injections

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
to numb the cerebellum,
the brainstem,

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
and other internal organs
one at a time.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
If the subject can still use
their abilities in that state,

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
they pass, and if they can't,
then that raises a red flag.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
The liver's one thing,
but how are my guinea pigs

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
supposed to move if their
spinal cords are numb

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
or their hearts are stopped?

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
So I needed a pinch-hitter
that could step in

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
and handle vital functions.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
And now, thanks to this
over-the-top front-end,

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to lose
sight of my prototype.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
That's enough for now.
Let's call it a day.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
You want to discover
where abilities reside,

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
but what's that have to do
with creating this "Level Six"

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
thing your sister
was talking about?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose that's what
we're going to find out. Ha.

[CHILDREN laugh]

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center

understand why they

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
called me in.

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
What do they want from me?

Got it!

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center

I'm so confused.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center

Esther! Stop it!

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you're not
the Undresstress, are you?

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
I was just going for a
quick dip to calm my mind

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
down a little, that's all.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center

the best place to do that!

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center

Come on, let's go.

H-Hold on.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
Man, I guess she's not
the legendary Undresstress

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.363 position:50% align:center
after all.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
I guess not.

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I figured it was
too good to be true.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, let's go.

Here ya go. Need a quick
rinse? Knock yourself out.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
I'll leave a fresh change
of clothes for you

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center

[HIRUMI] Hey, that looks
pretty good on you.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50% align:center
Not bad, if I do say so myself.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
Fits you like a glove.

And so you know,
a stunt like you pulled earlier

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
could get you arrested.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
Although if that had happened,

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Brother would've gotten
it swept under the rug.

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center

I'm having her sit out for now.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
I checked her vitals earlier,
and her waveforms

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
weren't steady enough.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center

without a test subject.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.431 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] We may have
given her a regular account,

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center
but Hirumi's health will
always take precedence

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
over our research.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
It's too bad about
those other subjects.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
They won't be much use,
given the state they're in.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.692 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER 08A]
We'll need more volunteers.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Name-brand bags and fur coats.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
It was a good scam
while it lasted,

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.074 position:50% align:center
but I think we've about
exhausted the number

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
of teenage girls who
have gotten themselves

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
deep enough into debt
that they're willing to do

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
whatever we ask.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.081 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what do we do?

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] Well, maybe alter
our approach a bit and scout out

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
habitual shoplifters this time.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was afraid of this.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't have let
the others go just because

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
they were a little broken.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center
We've finished tuning
the research equipment,

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.596 position:50% align:center
and Esther is here
as our safety.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.890 position:50% align:center
We were finally going
to produce some results.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
You sure are calm, Esther.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] As a necromancer,
I'm used to seeing things

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
that might disturb other people.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
I suppose it isn't
all that bad, really.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
I mean, some may never
use their abilities again,

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
and then there are the
ones who wind up trapped

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
in a perpetual dreamlike state.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.826 position:50% align:center
Oh, that reminds me.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
Remember how we
talked about abilities

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
and where they
reside in the body?

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
Well, during the course
of that research,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
we stumbled across a separate
bit of interesting data.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
Mmm.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
We discovered that
during an experiment,

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
the output of a subject's
ability was much greater

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
than usual.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
At first we thought that by
shutting down a specific organ,

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
it was like unplugging a
stopper, but we were wrong.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
The bigger the equipment that
served as the subjects' bodies,

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
the more they were able to
draw out their ability. Mmm.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
It was almost as if their
abilities actually expanded

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.154 position:50% align:center
to adjust to their perception
of having a larger body.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
However, we've found
that there are limits.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
If we make the
equipment too big,

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
then it destroys the girls'
sense of self. Mmm.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
The reason is unclear.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
One theory we have
is that it's diluting them,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.543 position:50% align:center
placing too small of a mind
inside too big of a body.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.046 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Mind?

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.631 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] As a scientist,
I don't deal with abstract

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
concepts like the
"mind" and the "soul,"

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
but that's an area you have
some expertise in, isn't it?

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I suppose.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] If we can just keep
the dilution of the mind

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
under control,
we'll be able to hook up

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
external expansion equipment
as large as we like.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
Theoretically, there will
be no limit on our room

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50% align:center
for growth.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
In other words, the time
will eventually come

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
when anyone can easily
reach Level Six.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
You've been doing these
experiments on Hirumi, too?

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
She certainly thinks so.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
I made it look like that's
what we were doing,

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
but then I fed her a separate
diversionary program instead.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how
stressful it is keeping her

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
from catching on
every time she comes in

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
for a hypothetical
research session.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
Hirumi's gotten too
fixated on Level Six. Mmm.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
She just needs to be patient.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
It won't be much longer before
our dream becomes a reality.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
What?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna say all that
exercise was pointless now

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
or something stupid like that?

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
No, uh...

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.527 position:50% align:center
I was just wondering
how you're going to fit

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
that whole thing
inside your body.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] Well, it's not like
I work out to lose weight,

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
so I can eat what I want.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:01.661 position:50% align:center
Not that it'll matter for long.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
You're practically family now.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
So grab a spoon and
we'll eat it together.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
We'll go back to the
lab once we're done.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
You're our secret weapon, right?

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.632 position:50% align:center
Brother says you can
use some kind of power

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
he's never seen before.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to check it out.

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
Your secret weapon, huh?

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center
I hope that's true,
but I'm not sure.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
Hmm?

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking lately
about what I do.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
Wondering what kind
of power I wield

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.567 position:50% align:center
as a Rosenthal necromancer.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
I still haven't found an answer,
not even after coming here.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] Hmm, it sounds
to me like you're worried

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
because you desperately
want to be useful to someone.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
I feel the same way.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
I want to help Brother
more than anything.

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
That's why my goal is to
someday reach Level Six.

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you've got a goal,
but what should I do?

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
That's easy. You can help me!

00:11:56.466 --> 00:12:00.095 position:50% align:center
If I ever need anything,
swear you'll do it for me!

00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
"Anything"?

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
Do you think you could
be a bit more specific?

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
Promise me!
Promise me now, Esther!

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Promise you?

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
Yep.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
A promise, made between
one friend and another.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
Just you and me.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
Uh... Yeah.

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
--[HIRUMI coughing]
--There, see?

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
That's what you get for
trying to eat that thing.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not!

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
I won't let you take part in
experiments with the equipment

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
until I know it's safe.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
But...

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
No! That's final.

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Hishigata, she's
doing this for you.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
You stay out of this. Mmm.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
It's a matter between
brother and sister.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
But having Esther here should
take care of the problems

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
we were having before,
shouldn't it?

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
You think I'd rely on a
safety device whose logic

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
I don't understand when
we're talking about

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
an experiment that could
very well put my sister's life

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
on the line?

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to
trust this "necromancy"

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
business when we haven't
even seen it at work?

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] But once the
safety device is finished?

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] Yeah, after I have
plenty of data and make certain

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.326 position:50% align:center
it's highly reproducible,
and acknowledge

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
an incontrovertible pathway
linking to this experiment.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
How long is that
going to take, exactly?

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
Well, let's see.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
A year, maybe.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
But to get it perfect,
probably more like two.

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
Hirumi!

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
She'll be fine.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
I'll admit that two years
sounds like a long time,

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.561 position:50% align:center
but however impatient
she is, there's no reason

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
for her to risk her life
trying to reach Level Six.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
She'll have her
chance soon enough,

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
after we've perfected
the process. Mmm.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
Almost there.

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
Just use this special tool to
delete the purchase history,

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
and done.

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
Okay, that should do the trick.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
And it was pretty
easy to come by,

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
considering that it
was Antiskill surplus.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
[wretching]

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
A promise is a promise, Esther.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
[clears throat]

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
Hey, Esther. Hey, Big Brother.

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
How's it going?

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
Recording this little message
for you is more embarrassing

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
than I thought it would be.

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
Here goes.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
See, uh, the thing is...

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
I'm dead.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] You should probably
have found me by now.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
The liquid's a preservative,
so I doubt I'll be rotting

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
or anything,
but I am pretty close to naked,

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
which is embarrassing,
so I'd appreciate

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
if you'd retrieve
me right away.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for keeping my
medical report hidden,

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
and for preventing the
doctor from saying anything.

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.968 position:50% align:center
But it looks like
I'm basically done for.

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Hishigata.

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hishigata!

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] The first-ranked can't
even be taken out with a nuke,

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center
so I figured a more
powerful esper than him

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
would be guaranteed immortality.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
But two years?

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
That's just too long.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
So now I'm going to turn
this into a real race.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
There's only one
thing you can do now.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
You have to turn me
into a Level Six.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
I'm already dead.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
There's no point in talking
about safety devices anymore.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
If there's even a fraction of
a chance this could succeed,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
then please do it.

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
I'd really appreciate it if
my death wasn't all in vain.

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you, Esther.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.302 position:50% align:center
And you too, Brother.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
It's my fault!

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
How could I let this happen?

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
I monitored Hirumi's vitals.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.602 position:50% align:center
I knew something
wasn't quite right.

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
But I deliberately
chose to look away!

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
Hishigata!

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
That's not what's
important right now.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
What's more important than that?

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
My little sister.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
My only family member
has ended her own life!

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
Yes, but how many minutes
have passed since she died?

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
Isn't there anything we can try?

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
I told Hirumi I'd help her
if she needed me.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
I promised.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:41.668 position:50% align:center
There has to be
something I can do!

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
Let's think this through, then.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
Tell me more about
your necromancy.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
Our techniques place a
pseudo-soul into the body,

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
possessing it and
then controlling it.

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:52.846 position:50% align:center
It will preserve her flesh,
but it won't preserve her self.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
It's hopeless.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
If Hirumi's no longer Hirumi,
then there's no point.

00:16:58.601 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
So...

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] You said the machine
takes over while the organs

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
are shut down.

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
Will it work?

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA] We've never
started all body functions

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
from total shutdown before.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.365 position:50% align:center
There's no telling
what'll happen!

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.669 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
Hmm... What's this?

00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
Am I successfully integrated?

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
Hirumi!

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
But this means that
everything has gone the way

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
Hirumi wanted it.

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Are you sure about that?

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
Right now, she's just
inside the equipment.

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
I still haven't used necromancy.

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
And if I did, it wouldn't be
her soul inside her body.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
It would be an artificial one.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
I'll freeze ability
development mode.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
We need her mind to be undiluted
and her soul undamaged.

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
Or why even bother?

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
Hishigata, what's going on here?

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
I've managed to
latch on to Hirumi.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
She's in there.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
Wonderful!

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
I knew you'd come to your
senses sooner or later

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
and consent to use her!

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
What?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
With this, the path to Level Six
will finally be open to us.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Please.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
You're a bigger moron
than I realized.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
You're worse than Esther,
and she didn't even know

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.265 position:50% align:center
about carboxylic acid compounds.

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, let's take it easy.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
We'll all share in
the success, won't we?

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA growls]

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
If you think I'm messing around,
then this is your wake-up call.

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
I'll... I'll save Hirumi
at any cost.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
I won't allow you to take
our lives and use them

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
for your own purposes.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
what's come over you.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
I'm taking Hirumi, and we're
getting the hell out of here.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
Out of this facility and
beyond the walls

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
of Academy City itself--
into the outside world!

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
Hishigata, something's wrong!

[beeping]

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA]
Oh, no!

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
Hirumi's heart isn't beating!

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I thought that
was kind of the point.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
She's dead, so now we
can start working on her.

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.
I won't let her die.

[HIRUMI]
Hi there!

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
Brother, all you have to
do is get me to Level Six.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
Don't let anything distract
you from that goal.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Can you do that for
your poor little sister?

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
Hirumi?

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
But I thought she was dead.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.654 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me this is
feedback from the equipment!

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center

Quiet, you!

[RESEARCHER 08 gasps]

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] You're emotionally
unstable and intellectually

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
inferior to Brother.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.662 position:50% align:center
There's only room
for one researcher,

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center

the defense you can muster,

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.546 position:50% align:center
I have no need
for you boys, either.

thorough next time.

Huh?

Why would I do that?

For a necromancer, the more
corpses, the better, right?

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
Let's see those special
pseudo-souls of yours.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

[HIRUMI]
Go on. Say it.

00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
I never told Hirumi about how I
handle bodies, or pseudo-souls.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center
Which means one thing:

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
that you've taken
my control away.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
For a secret weapon, your

When you changed your clothes,
did you count your charms?

But if it's a power not
even Brother knows about,

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
I thought it might be
exactly what we needed.

That charm really is amazing.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
The moment I touched it,
I felt swallowed up.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.823 position:50% align:center

the real deal immediately.

information between us, okay?

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
so that's what I intend to do.

phases of the experiments.

to work them, right?

Or should I use the
remaining three charms

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
Qi--

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI laughs]

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Aw, nice try!

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
I hope you realize now
that's not going to work.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
I can say it outright if you
want, but that's instant death.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
Okay, Esther,
it's time to choose.

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
You can put those
cuffs on yourself,

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
or you can continue resisting.

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
But every time you fail, another
victim will pay the price.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
That coward hiding underneath
the body of his friend?

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
I'll crush him.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
So, what'll it be?

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
You can't do it, can you?

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
You can control a corpse,
but it's not the same

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
as returning its soul.

00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:59.194 position:50% align:center
That's why you can't be
responsible for people's lives.

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
It's the sad truth behind
being a necromancer.

00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center
[grunts] I'm sorry.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
It's okay.

00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:08.620 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
Good girl.

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:10.497 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
What are you planning to do now?

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] Hmm, I suppose
I'll need to go missing

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:13.625 position:50% align:center
for a little bit.

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.001 position:50% align:center
But it'll be okay.

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:17.420 position:50% align:center
You've got the necessary
equipment and test subjects,

00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:20.215 position:50% align:center
along with your necromancy
and Brother's knowledge.

00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:23.510 position:50% align:center
You can pick up the
experiments again easily.

00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:26.054 position:50% align:center
And I'll give you
a little sliver of hope.

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:28.640 position:50% align:center
It's hard to imagine
I'm still alive,

00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:30.892 position:50% align:center
and Taowu's charm is gone.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:34.437 position:50% align:center
But ask yourself this: at what
point was the charm used?

00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:37.148 position:50% align:center
Was it before I died? Or after?

00:22:37.232 --> 00:22:38.692 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER gasps]

00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:41.403 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI] Si-xiong talismans
can only be used on dead bodies.

00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:43.405 position:50% align:center
Which means that if
I'm being sustained by this

00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:45.615 position:50% align:center
life support system, I'm alive.

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:48.576 position:50% align:center
But if the si-xiong charm
is controlling me, I'm dead.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.578 position:50% align:center
So, which one is it?

00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:52.831 position:50% align:center
It's like Schroödinger's
cat, Esther.

00:22:52.914 --> 00:22:54.249 position:50% align:center
Dead or alive?

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:57.377 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me which
one I am right now?

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.878 position:50% align:center
There, you see?

00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:01.631 position:50% align:center
I've given you a reason
to stick with me.

00:23:01.715 --> 00:23:04.009 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:23:04.092 --> 00:23:05.176 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you say?

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.928 position:50% align:center
Are you going to help me out?

00:23:07.012 --> 00:23:09.097 position:50% align:center
Do it for my sake.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.641 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
The truth is, I knew.

00:23:11.725 --> 00:23:13.935 position:50% align:center
I knew it was nothing
more than a mental leash

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:16.438 position:50% align:center
to ensure my cooperation.

00:23:16.521 --> 00:23:19.482 position:50% align:center
False hope offered
to keep me in line.

00:23:19.566 --> 00:23:22.027 position:50% align:center
But, even so.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.237 position:50% align:center
I'd really appreciate it
if my death wasn't all

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.572 position:50% align:center
in vain.

00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:27.282 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you, Esther.

00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:29.242 position:50% align:center
And you too, Brother.

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:32.871 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Even so, I couldn't
give up without making sure.

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50% align:center
I had to try.

00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:45.008 position:50% align:center
[HIRUMI]
Esther! Promise me, Esther!

00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:48.136 position:50% align:center
If I ever need anything, swear
you'll do it for me, Esther.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.932 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Once I use
Emperor Shun's Blade...

00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:54.059 position:50% align:center
Hirumi...

00:23:55.393 --> 00:23:56.728 position:50% align:center
Hirumi will...

00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:00.690 position:50% align:center
It appears as though
you're crying, Adonai.

00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:02.400 position:50% align:center
I'm not.

00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:04.235 position:50% align:center
Why would I do that?
