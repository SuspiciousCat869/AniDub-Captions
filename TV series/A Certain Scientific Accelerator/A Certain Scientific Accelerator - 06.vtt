Oh, you mean teachers.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA]
Yeah.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.220 position:50% align:center
Hard for us not to
have one when you guys

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
are the root of all evil.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
[LEADER] She's right.
Everyone knows that.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
After all, Academy
City is pretty much

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
one huge school, right?

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
Which means that whenever things
aren't going as they should,

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
then obviously the teachers
are responsible somehow.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center

That's where we come in.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
who neglect their duty and
let the city fall to pieces.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
Eventually, we'll work our
way up to the principal,

the source of evil is.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center

we'll squash 'em flat.

a much better place.

Sure, there are
organizations like DA,

those like Anti-Skill

determination to risk our necks

I've got to save Houtou.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
Come on, think!
What can you do?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be something.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
All right,
shall we wrap this up?

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Got it.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
[NARU] May I present my
finishing move, Giant Stamp!

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
So flattened!

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
She's dead for sure this time.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Naru?

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
[NARU groaning]

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
Ouch. That didn't
go as planned.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where did that
shield come from?

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Armor of the Dead.

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
[LEADER] She can use dirt
as a medium like Naru.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
Is she a psychokinesist?

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
Don't make me laugh!

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
You think your cheap
barrier can stop a blow

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.177 position:50% align:center
from my specially
made mascot suit?

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
Killer Punch!

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
Again? I just got
feeling back in my legs!

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:44.936 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
It's no use.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.438 position:50% align:center
I don't know who you people are,

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
but I've just about reached
the limits of my patience.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
Get out of here!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right!

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
So dramatic.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Dig in, Naru.

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
It's just dirt.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
Humans have been carving
holes into the earth forever,

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.951 position:50% align:center
no matter how hard the surface.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, there's an idea.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
For a brand-new form!

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
How do you like
my excavator version?

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
[NARU yelling]

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
Hey! Quit running away!

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
Hold... still!

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
Stop dodging, you cheater!

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Got you this time!

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
[NARU yelling]
I think I'm gonna pu--!

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Looks like she
has difficulty controlling

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
such a complicated component.

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
[LEADER] The Excavator
is a one-shot kill.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
The only problem is
it can be dodged.

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
We need to catch her off guard.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Naru!

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
Aim for the blonde!

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Huh?

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Just do it!

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Not good.
I can't move anywhere!

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Here I come!

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
Houtou?

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Looks like she took the bait.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
Yes! My first hit!

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
Not like I needed more.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
Increasing speed now!

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
Houtou, stop this!

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:34.796 position:50% align:center
Do not be concerned.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
Make your escape, Adonai.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
You have to come with me!

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
Adonai's safety
is my only priority.

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
Ha! Look at you, showing off
for the rest of the class.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
Upping the rotation!

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Enough! No more!

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.576 position:50% align:center
Make it stop!

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you, please!

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
--Not...
--...a...

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
...chance!

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Why? How can you
do something like this?

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.254 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Hmm. Let's call it "justice."

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:19.424 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] Whatever this is,
it isn't justice.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Oh, no?

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Guess our definitions
of the word differ then.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
Not that it really matters.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
Let's finish this up.

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
I'm on it.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
First I'll get rid of
the honor student,

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
then after that, the teacher.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
[LEADER] And last but not least,
let her live just long enough

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
to lose all hope in this world.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Why?

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
Why is the world
so full of despair?

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
Is there nothing
else in this life?

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
'Fraid so, but you have the
teachers to thank for that!

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
Don't worry though.

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
See?

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
I'll make it better by
killing every one of you!

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
Bye-bye! You're finished now!

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
[NARU yells]

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
Who... who is that?!

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMARU]
Naru!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
What the--?

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Pretty stupid move.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
Should've held your school
arts festival in private.

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
You pull this crap in public...

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.891 position:50% align:center
...you run the risk of someone
like me dropping by.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
His face... it's so lovely.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
Eyes that say part killer,
part crazy,

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
and a grin skewed by the
oppression of the world.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
We're cut from the same cloth.

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.284 position:50% align:center
That was beautiful!

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
How about you come along
with us on our excursion

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.621 position:50% align:center
to hunt down know-it-all adults?

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
Great.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.834 position:50% align:center
Looks like Leader's awful
taste is kicking in again.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
Hey. You're alive? Right?

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center
She takes the slightest
interest in someone,

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
next thing you know,
she asks them to join.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
Still, we might need
a replacement.

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
So, what do you say?

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
How about you team up with
us and have some real fun?

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:33.266 position:50% align:center
You saved us.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
blocking her attack.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
You're in the way.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
Huh?

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] Take them and
get far away from here, now.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Hey. All right, listen to this!

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:48.031 position:50% align:center
With you, there'll be exactly
five of us on the team!

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
That's the perfect number
for a ranger squad!

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.035 position:50% align:center
And you can wear the black suit!

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
So how about it?

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
Are you on board?

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
Ugh... Hello? What gives?

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:01.002 position:50% align:center
Come on, stop ignoring me!

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
Say something, would ya?

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
You want me to reply?

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
[LEADER yells]

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
No. Okay?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Huh?

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
You told me to say
something, didn't you?!

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
[LEADER gasps]

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR laughing]

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:39.416 position:50% align:center
A bug's about to be
crushed by another bug!

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
[LEADER screams]

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
Leader!

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Who is this guy?

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
He's bad news.

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
I vote for retreating. Guys?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
But if we turn tail and run,
we'll all be demoted!

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.396 position:50% align:center
What do you propose then?

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
For real, though!

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
My technique doesn't have
any effect against him!

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
Ugh!

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.570 position:50% align:center
I can't think with
you two complaining!

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
We'll work together.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:12.949 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Nobody has ever walked away

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
from a Scavenger combo attack.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
Am I right?

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
[LEADER] Don't forget
who we are. Scavenger!

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
We're not through with you!

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
[NARU yelling]

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Good.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
He can't move from
there if there's no

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
frictional coefficient.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
Naru!

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
Marvel at my Burst of Artwork!

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
There, all done!

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Yaku!

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMARU yelling]

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
[NARU] Look. The honor
students decided to come back.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Well, they're too late.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
He's already inside there.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMARU] That's a
liquid thermite reaction.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
The heat being released can
reach 4,000 degrees.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
In fact, I doubt there's any
bone fragments left behind.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
No...

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
This isn't real.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.023 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Like our Iron Maiden?

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
It's a fitting end
for a criminal.

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMARU]
Now, about that teacher.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
[SEIKE]
It's her turn next, then yours.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
[NARU] And begging for your
life won't change our minds.

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
"Teacher" this, "teacher" that.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
Shut up, will ya?

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] As of right
now, I'm the teacher.

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
And for today's lesson, I'm
gonna show you the proper way

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
to be a villain.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
How? He's alive?

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
But our combination
attack was perfect.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Who is this guy?

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
Accelerator!

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
"Accelerator"?

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
He matches the description.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
Pale complexion.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
White hair.

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
Red eyes

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
Then you're telling me
this is the first-ranked esper

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
in Academy City?!

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER 04A] This is
what a Level Five can do?

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:23.663 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you don't have
any more tricks up your sleeve.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
Why're you looking
at me like that?

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to bring me down?

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
[SEIKE yelps]

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
You look tired!

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
Why don't I find you a nice
bed?!

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:44.851 position:50% align:center
[SEIKE grunts]

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.980 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] Did you know human
bodies have something called

00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
bioelectricity coursing
through them?

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
Let's see what happens
when I tweak yours

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.071 position:50% align:center
just a little bit.

00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
[SEIKE yelling]

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] At least pretend
like you're having fun,

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
or maybe you can't.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:08.750 position:50% align:center
This bed doesn't look too
comfortable to sleep in.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMARU]
You'll pay for that!

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
What're our orders?

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
We have to beat him!

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Leave Seike alone!

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMARU]
Naru, wait!

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
[LEADER] What do we do?
What can we do?

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
[NARU]
Die, you bastard!

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
[NARU gasps]

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
[LEADER] How are we supposed
to stop the top-ranked esper?

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
That was no fun.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
Nope. Not feeling it.

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
All you have are cheap tricks.

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
[NARU grunting]

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
And those won't work against me.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
Naru! Leader!
He took out both of them!

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.504 position:50% align:center
[LEADER]
Accelerator.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
The greatest esper
in Academy City.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
He excels in
vector manipulation,

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
and can freely
control the direction

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
of every kind of
power in the world.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
[YAKUMARU] ...or else
we're through! Leader!

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] I broke her
brain without touching her.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
Damn, I'm good.

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center
Way too slow.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
[NARU groaning]

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:29.122 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, you're a little
young to be in my class.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
As bad as I am,
it's not really my M.O.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
to go around picking
on defenseless kids.

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
[LEADER gasps]

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
So, what to do?

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Say something. Well?

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:44.721 position:50% align:center
It's rude to keep me waiting.

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] There were a load
of disappointing fights today,

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
but this one definitely
takes the cake.

00:21:57.692 --> 00:22:00.695 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER 04A] Out of the 2.3
million people in Academy City,

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
only seven of them
are Level Fives.

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:06.409 position:50% align:center
The odds of us running into
one were astronomical.

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
Looks like no bonus.

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:11.539 position:50% align:center
Not to mention we can expect
a decrease in client fees.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:16.878 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
--[ESTHER] Accelerator!
--[ACCELERATOR] Hm?

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.597 position:50% align:center
Damn. Was that it?

00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:32.310 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to get better
when this is what I have

00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:33.812 position:50% align:center
to train with?
