00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
I permitted communication.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
And this being proclaimed
himself a devil.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER grunts]

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] So you're telling me
you were actively communicating

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
with this devil?

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
And most importantly, it taught
me exactly what I needed to do

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:01.036 position:50% align:center
to accomplish the
Rosenthal family's wish.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
[HISHIGATA gasping]

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
My sister's got one
wicked sense of humor,

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
doesn't she?

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
Come on, everybody knows there's
no such thing as devils, Hirumi.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
There is.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
You should be rejoicing, Esther.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm finally making
your family's desire a reality.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.641 position:50% align:center
You do know, Mistress,

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:27.479 position:50% align:center
what the Rosenthal
family wishes for?

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
For the creation
of a perfect golem.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
Then it would appear as
though you've not forgotten.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
Every child born into our
family was told of that dream

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
when they were little and
never allowed to forget it.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
From times of old, we Rosenthals
have been searching

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
for a method that would allow
us to create the perfect golem.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
One day, our founder, Obed,
developed "necromancy,"

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
a method of making a golem
using a dead body.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.342 position:50% align:center
However, it wasn't accepted
by those in power,

00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
and Obed was cast out of
his homeland as a heretic.

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
Then, his fourth-generation
heir, Isaac,

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
crossed over into the East

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
and encountered
the Taoist jiangshi spell.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
He incorporated it,
creating a new line of magic.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
The Rosenthal style,
if you will.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
Later, the fifth-generation
heir, Nathan,

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
radically increased the
potency of pseudo-souls,

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.953 position:50% align:center
which produced talismans
for Taowu, Taotie,

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
Qiongqi, and Hundun, the four
Evil Spirits of the Numbers.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
But after all this, the
Rosenthals were still far from

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
accomplishing their goal.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
What they were in
pursuit of was a creation

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
that'd never existed before.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
A golem possessing
a perfect soul and body.

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:46.141 position:50% align:center
A being that would be
on par with a god.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I don't believe you!

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
All of this was decided
years in advance?

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
This is exactly what
the devil said.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
By repeatedly dying
10,000 times,

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
the souls of men
slowly begin to evolve.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
Reaching Keter, the top
of Sephirothic Tree.

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
Even pseudo-souls
could attain this level.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
All that's required is logging
evidence of 10,000 deaths.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50% align:center
How's that possible?

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
Are you also tampering
with reincarnation?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
I have those memories.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
The 10,031 deaths were
converted into a formula

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
and transferred into me.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
They then became appended
to the Sephirothic tree

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
that comprises my pseudo-soul.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you celebrating?

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
Sing songs of praise.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
Twirl and dance in
honor of your victory.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
The 400-year-old wish
of the Rosenthal line

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
is finally coming to fruition!

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
You have to stop
tampering with death!

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.737 position:50% align:center
If I've learned anything, it's
that necromancy doesn't return

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.280 position:50% align:center
what was taken from us.

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.866 position:50% align:center
I lost a friend, and when
I tried bringing her back,

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
I just lost her all over again.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
No matter how much
control I have over death,

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
I wasn't able to save my friend.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center

with the deceased!

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center

devils or manufactured gods!

not carry out the directions

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
And since I still
have Adonai rights,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
in the name of the head

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
and the memories of 10,031
deaths they possessed,

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
I was ecstatic.

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, all the tools that
I required for constructing

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
a perfect vessel with a perfect
soul were at my disposal.

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
You're saying the reason
everything happened

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
was because you orchestrated
this series of events?

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
Be thankful.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
You were under
the misapprehension

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
that you were being
used by these siblings.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
When in reality, the Rosenthals
were the ones using them

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
to achieve our objective.

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
Stop, already!

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
So many have died.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
The sorrow it's caused
is immeasurable!

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
I beg you, stop using
necromancy for a trivial goal!

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
[TAOWU]
A trivial goal?

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
And just who the hell
do you think you are?

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
A necromancer spends their
entire life hovering near death,

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
touching it and overturning
the natural order!

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I know what our legacy is.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
You claim that, but I
don't think you're aware

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.413 position:50% align:center
how personally
responsible you are.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't come here,
this girl wouldn't have taken

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
her own life.

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
How exactly do you think
those people died?

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.881 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's because you spread
death wherever you travel.

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
That's the entire point
of being a necromancer.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
That's not true.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.221 position:50% align:center
[TAOWU] You were born a
Rosenthal and this is just now

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
occurring to you?

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
You can't protect others.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
Then I was wrong.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
Everything I convinced
myself of wasn't true.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
[TAOWU] You're an utter
failure to the family name.

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
Now, sit back and watch
as I fulfill our bloodline's

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
ancient wish!

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
Master, I...

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
Get moving, already.

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
Our orders are to continue
guarding only the perimeter.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
Going inside the
facility is forbidden.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:51.292 position:50% align:center
What?

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI]
It's a governing board matter.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
Not another one.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
I don't care what
our orders are.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
If there are children being
put at risk, you better believe

00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
we're going in there.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI]
Count me in.

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
[TAKAHASHI] But it makes
you wonder what the hell's

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
about to happen.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
[YOMIKAWA] Whatever it is,
I'm sure it's nothing good.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
Just my luck the guy
I want to beat up the most

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
is hanging on by a thread.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to have
any fun kicking the crap

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
out of him now?

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
So, what is it you wanna do?

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER]
I was wrong about everything.

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
Meaning?

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
[ESTHER] I thought I knew
what started this string

00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
of misadventures.

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
How I caused so much misery
by allowing Hirumi

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
to learn about necromancy.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
And if I had
realized that earlier,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
none of this would've happened.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
But I was mistaken.

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:43.845 position:50% align:center
It was the fourth family head.

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
Isaac is responsible because
he sought to achieve

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center
the Rosenthals' wish
to create a golem.

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
I was wrong from the very start.

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
These events didn't spring
from Hirumi's mistake

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.693 position:50% align:center
or my losing control of Taowu.

00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center
It was inevitable the moment
I arrived at the laboratory.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
And we played right
into Isaac's hands.

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:07.494 position:50% align:center
Even when I thought
I'd discovered who I was

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:09.954 position:50% align:center
as a Rosenthal,
that was a lie.

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center
I was wrong about everything.

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.961 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] So in other words,
you're backing out now.

00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:20.799 position:50% align:center
I remember when I was
ready to kill you,

00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:23.551 position:50% align:center
and you accepted death
with your head raised.

00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:25.637 position:50% align:center
Now look at you.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.599 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna pout, you can
watch from the sidelines.

00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:31.726 position:50% align:center
Me, I'm gonna go
take this thing out.
