a patient in transport.

Hasami Hitokawa.
Female. Age, 16.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
Jumped from Bridge Three
in School District Seven.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
Found what appears to be
a suicide note in her pocket.

Her ability's suited for combat.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.375 position:50% align:center
Not a half-bad subject.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
And best of all, no one
will look into her death.

And try to exercise caution.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
The target you're after
is a unique esper.

She has the ability
to reanimate the dead.

her, she'll have more corpses

it wasn't necessary

out of the question.

However, the only way to
correct a disobedient child

it's almost comedic.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center

never aim their guns

That's right!

was because of me!

tell me where they are or not?

I want the location of
those fake Anti-Skill guys.

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:11.164 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna pay them a visit,
and find out whatever it is

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:13.541 position:50% align:center
they're after and obliterate it.

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.585 position:50% align:center

but I only know about

they kept me imprisoned.

one of several hideouts

they have.

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:22.342 position:50% align:center

00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:23.510 position:50% align:center
Right now?

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:27.347 position:50% align:center
[ACCELERATOR] So you
don't think that I look like

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:31.226 position:50% align:center
No. I really don't.
