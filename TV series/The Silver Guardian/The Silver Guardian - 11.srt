we were always together.

164
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,916
Me and Mikan.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,083
[MIKAN] Here,
that’s your share, Takeshi!

166
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,041
All we have to do is use these
and we can make money, right?

167
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,000
[grunts]

168
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,166
Only if you win, silly.

169
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,333
I will! You’ll see!

170
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,166
[T-Rex roaring]

171
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,833
[MIKAN] You can’t keep running
from every monster.

172
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,250
The only way to get stronger
is to beat them.

173
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,041
Nuh-uh, there’s other ways.

174
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,666
This Paladin’s memoir lets you
increase your fighting power,

175
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,833
even if you don’t
fight anything!

176
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,916
Sounds fishy, if you ask me.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,208
It’s true! It works!
Just look.

178
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,541
[camera shutter clicks]

179
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,833
[whirring]

180
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,250
[laughs]

181
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,875
If you put a photograph in,

182
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,791
you get stronger
little by little,

183
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,291
but you have to do it
daily for it to add up.

184
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,625
Oh.

185
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,458
At least now I know
the reason

186
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,750
you’ve been
sneaking photos of me

187
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,208
whenever you've got the chance.

188
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,416
No.

189
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,916
Not just of you.

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,583
Right. I believe that.

191
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,291
Fess up, I’m on
to your candid antics.

192
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,750
Sorry. It’s just that
I’m always with you.

193
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,666
You’re the only person
I can take pictures of.

194
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,375
Lemme see.

195
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,416
Come on.

196
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,875
Oh my.

197
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,500
Are you angry?

198
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,583
'Course not. Why would I be mad?

199
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,750
These memories are precious.
We should cherish them together.

200
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,208
And you’re just
as precious to me.

201
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,708
After all, we’re partners,
Takeshi.

202
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,708
[gasps]

203
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,708
[camera shutter clicks]

204
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,375
[TAKESHI]
Mikan, no!

205
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,416
You'll get better.

206
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,166
I'll make sure you do.

207
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,708
I’ll get you out of here
and into a better hospital.

208
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,458
I’ll go make some money,
just hold on till then!

209
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,791
[sobbing]

210
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,500
[MIKAN]
You dummy. Don’t worry about me.

211
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,875
Just get out of this town
for both of us.

212
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,666
[crowd roaring]

213
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,541
Hold on a little longer.

214
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,916
I’ll win, and we’ll leave
that place together.

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,291
Takeshi. That book.

216
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,791
[MAMMOTH VIKING laughing]

217
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,125
It doesn’t matter
if there’s two or ten of ya!

218
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,291
You won’t beat me!

219
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,666
And why’s that?

220
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,291
Intruders who qualify to fight

221
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,625
will have to take
a major penalty!

222
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,083
What did he say?

223
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,083
[RUOLONG] Regardless of
personal circumstances,

224
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,416
intruders will have the strength

225
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,750
of all their abilities
cut in half!

226
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,791
[laughing]

227
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,458
You see?
You screwed yourself.

228
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,125
There’s no way
you’ll be a match for me

229
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,958
with that puny amount of power!

230
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,916
But, I didn’t know that!

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,458
You barged in without
checking all the rules first?

232
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,250
Talk about doing something rash.

233
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,416
I don’t care!

234
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,541
I’m still winning
that ten million!

235
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,666
[grunts]

236
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,250
[energy surging]

237
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,708
[RUOLONG]
Oh, what’s this?

238
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,583
Apparently, Takeshi’s item
converts

239
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,541
photographs into
raw fighting power!

240
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,916
[MAMMOTH VIKING grunts]

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,625
Indeed, but with every attack,

242
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,791
the memories contained within
the photographs burn away.

243
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,833
That’s a hefty sacrifice.

244
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,041
He loses his memories?

245
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,208
I’ll lose everything I cherish,
if that’s what it takes.

246
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,583
[energy surging]

247
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,583
I'm saving Mikan.

248
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,041
Nothing you do will stop me!

249
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,000
