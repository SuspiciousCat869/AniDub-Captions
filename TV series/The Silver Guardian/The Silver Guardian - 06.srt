Let the grave robbing begin!

167
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,208
Somebody stop the world.
I wanna get off, Twin.

168
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,958
Don’t touch me there,
I’m really sensitive, Star.

169
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:03,291
Guess these weird things
are her true identity.

170

171
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:12,083
[YUUKI (DEMON LORD)]
Who dares awaken me?

172
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,125
Holy crap!

173
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,750
What the hell is that?

174
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,125
[TWIN STAR]
Shinryou Academy.

175
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,708
A boarding school filled
to the brim

176
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,250
with the rich
and privileged.

177
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,333
But, among
the celebrity status kids,

178
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,916
one was always alone and worked
several jobs to get by.

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,875
Suigin Riku!
Gaming is his only talent.

180
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,625
And he doesn’t pay
anything for them!

181
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,166
After all, he’s broke.

182
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,791
Meanwhile, the Madonna
of the school

183
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,958
is the daughter of
world-renowned game designer,

184
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,208
Yuuki Riku.

185
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,666
The beautiful and
kind-hearted Rei Riku!

186
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,833
She’s loaded!
Despite sucking at the game,

187
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,333
she loves it
and plays it every night!

188
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,375
Get your beauty sleep,
darling!

189
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,291
One night, while
playing her game,

190
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,041
a mysterious masked
character appears

191
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,458
and saves her
from a horrific monster!

192
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,750
What a hero!
Maybe this was destiny!

193
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:07,708
A fated meeting between the two!
Sadly, the game was discontinued

194
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,083
and they thought they’d never
see each other again!

195
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,958
Then, on the last day
a strange monster appeared

196
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,458
and ruined everything!
Talk about heartbreaking!

197
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,500
But now, there’s a new, ultimate
game called Grave Buster.

198
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,041
Like it suggests,
it’s all about Grave Robbing.

199
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,500
Sounds like there
are a ton of secrets

200
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,125
to be found in there, huh?

201
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,791
Though, who knows
if that’s true.

202
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,541
Now, Suigin’s been left with an
inheritance of ten billion yen!

203
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,666
Lucky guy,
but what’s the reason?

204
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,083
And what’s to become
of poor Rei?

205
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,791
Everything’s about to get crazy!
Don’t you dare miss a minute

206
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,458
of the excitement!

207
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,583
The Silver Guardian!
