Don’t think I’m intimidated

164
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,500
by your little
transformation act, girly!

165
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,250
I know you’re tryin’
to mess with me,

166
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,333
and I’m calling your bluff!
Bring it!

167
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,208
[laughing]

168
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,166
-You asked for it.
-[shimmering]

169
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,416
[roaring]

170
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,541
[RUOLONG]
I don’t believe it!

171
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,958
The sexy mascot girl
has turned into a monster!

172
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,291
[LAOLONG] That’s the legendary
Twin-headed Jade Dragon.

173
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,375
I’m sure of it!

174
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,291
Why is it serving that amateur?

175
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,125
Wow.

176
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,291
[yells]

177
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,125
What the hell's going on?

178
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,166
This isn't sexy, or cute!

179
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,666
[fire exploding]

180
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,541
[energy radiating]

181
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,333
[MAMMOTH VIKING
yelling fearfully]

182
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,708
I-- I lost?

183
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,916
Impossible!

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,625
[shattering]

185
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,916
[LAOLONG] That’s it, folks!
The intruders win it all!

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,791
[crowd roaring, cheering]

187
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,041
I could never
thank you two enough!

188
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,583
Sure!
Give my regards to Mikan, okay?

189
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,208
Take care of Suigin,
okay, Dragon Lady?

190
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,333
And thanks again!

191
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,416
[SUIGIN]
Dragon Lady’s got a ring to it.

192
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,458
[cell phone ringing]

193
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,375
Oh, right.

194
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,041
[TWIN STAR]
Hey, Suigin.

195
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,041
Are you sure about this?

196
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,541
That was an awful lot
of money you gave up.

197
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,166
I’m a billion player,
I can go without.

198
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,000
Ten million’s a proverbial
drop in the bucket.

199
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,916
More importantly,
could you put some clothes on?

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,166
[TWIN STAR] I can’t until
I recharge the energy

201
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,083
I used saving your sorry butt!
All that real money, wasted.

202
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,000
Hmm?

203
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,875
Whatever!

204
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,541
Real?

205
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,750
[gasps]

206
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,958
I had no idea!

207
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,416
[energy blasting]

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,833
[RUOLONG] Any idea who that guy
could have been, Mr. Laolong?

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,250
Who knows?

210
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,750
The fact that he has
a Grave Beast

211
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,833
in tow might be a clue
to answering it.

212
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,458
[RUOLONG] You don’t think he’s--
The Collector’s--

213
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,333
[LAOLONG} Careful! You
shouldn’t say her name out loud!

214
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,541
That witch conquered this stage
without any resistance.

215
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,375
If she got wind of this,

216
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,875
well...

217
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,250
let’s just say calamity

218
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,333
would be the least
of our worries.
