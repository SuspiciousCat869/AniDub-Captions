Huh?

171
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,750
Meow!

172
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,708
I guess that means
you'll have to save me

173
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,791
the next time around.

174
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,708
After all,
there’s a new game to play!

175
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,916
Of course.

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,208
-I'd be happy to!
-Meow!

177
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,291
What’s up?

180
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,625
[yells]
Really?

181
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,833
You do this to me now?

182
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,583
How am I supposed
to get to work?

183
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,958
[giggling]

184
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,375
[SUIGIN]
No! Why?

185
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,500
[giggling]

186
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,041
[SUIGIN]
The Silver Guardian.
