1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,541
[PHOENIX] Illustrator Elise
Deauxnim was murdered

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:10,958
at Hazakura Temple,

3
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,916
an idyllic retreat where spirit
mediums come to train.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But the first day of
her suspected killer's trial

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,166
ended with more
questions than answers.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,000
Further investigation
revealed secrets

7
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,541
about the murder.

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,833
Firstly, the crime took place
at the remote Inner Temple,

9
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,958
not on the grounds
of the main Temple.

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,708
Also, the victim was,
in fact, Misty Fey.

11
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:32,375
Maya and Mia's mother who had
not been seen in 17 years.

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,458
And, Iris was the twin
sister of Dahlia Hawthorne,

13
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,916
who just last month had been
executed for her crimes.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,125
The most bone chilling
truth uncovered, though,

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,416
was that little Pearl played
an unwitting accomplice

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,875
in her aunt's murder.

17
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,208
The one pulling the strings
behind this fiendish plot

18
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,833
was her mother, Morgan Fey.

19
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,291
Her objective was to
wipe out the main bloodline

20
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,000
of the Kurain School.

21
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,166
And throughout all of this,
Maya has been trapped

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,083
in the sacred cavern.

23
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,541
Oh. I hope she's okay!

24
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,041
So, it's still locked?

25
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,458
And poor Mystic Maya is still
trapped in the Sacred Cavern?

26
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,166
[PHOENIX] Mm-hmm. But Iris
is working hard to open

27
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,333
all those trick locks, so...

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,708
[MILES] If you're talking
about Sister Iris,

29
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,125
she's here at the courthouse.

30
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,458
Wait, what's she doing here?

31
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,125
Discussing her testimony
with the prosecution team.

32
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,125
Really? She's taking the stand?

33
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,208
Um, sir? Mystic Maya...

34
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,541
Is she okay?

35
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,125
Don't you worry.

36
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,041
We have somebody else working on
the locks while Iris is here.

37
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,083
Who's that?

38
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,916
Franziska is there.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,291
She chose not to sleep
and has been at it all night

40
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,708
with guidance
from sister Bikini.

41
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,083
[PHOENIX gasps]
So, the trial today.

42
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,875
Someone else is handling it.

43
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,958
Godot, I believe?

44
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:23,250
[PHOENIX sighs]
I was afraid of that.

45
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,083
[MILES] Hmph. I'm going now. I
suppose the rest is up to you...

46
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,291
...partner.

47
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,250
Right. I came here to win!

48
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,541
[PEARL sighs]

49
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,833
[PHOENIX] I'm walking headfirst
into the final showdown!

50
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,541
This is for you, Maya!

51
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,916
Good morning.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,125
Court is now back in session
for the trial of Sister Iris.

53
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,666
Hang on. Why are you here?

54
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,875
My little brother had a fever
so bad he fainted from it,

55
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,291
so I'll be hearing the case.

56
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,291
[PHOENIX]
They're brothers. Ahh.

57
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,208
Prosecutor Godot,
your opening statement, please.

58
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,833
[GODOT] One's heart can change
as the clouds move overhead.

59
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:11,416
In this mixed-up world,
there's only one constant.

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,208
There's a darkness underneath.
Complex and bitter. But still...

61
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,750
...tasty.

62
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,208
[PHOENIX] Can you just
say it in plain English?

63
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,416
To put it more simply,

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,041
I'm announcing that
the prosecution's plans

65
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,208
have changed.

66
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,708
In earlier proceedings.

67
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,750
the accused refused to admit
she had a role in the crime.

68
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,166
But as the clouds have shifted,
she's had a change of heart.

69
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,166
[gasps]

70
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,958
And her confession today

71
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,875
will illuminate what was
once shrouded in darkness.

72
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,583
[PHOENIX]
Confession?

73
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:42,208
Why couldn't she have told me
about this last night?

74
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,791
[PEARL gasps]

75
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,958
[GODOT] Besides my curiosity,
the present situation requires

76
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,458
that I ask your name
and occupation.

77
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,125
Yes, my name is Iris.

78
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,916
And I am but a simple nun
serving at the Hazakura Temple.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,250
Iris. What do you
need to confess?

80
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,041
I hope you'll forgive me.

81
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,458
But I can no longer
continue to lie to everyone.

82
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,791
The truth is, I did have
a hand in this terrible tragedy.

83
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,000
[JUDGE gasps] Young lady,
please explain yourself.

84
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,208
Are you confessing to the
murder of Ms. Elise Deauxnim?

85
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,375
Not that, but I did play
a major part in the cover-up.

86
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,791
[PHOENIX gasps]
What cover up?

87
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,458
I gathered her lifeless body,

88
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,541
and transported it to
the main temple's courtyard.

89
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,750
Then... I desecrated it.

90
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,000
[PHOENIX gasps]

91
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,125
[JUDGE]
And this was all your doing?

92
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,750
[IRIS]
Yes. I did it to cover for her.

93
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,375
Hold on a second!
What's that mean?

94
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,958
Who are you covering for?

95
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,166
[IRIS]
Someone who I had to protect.

96
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,500
Even if it meant putting my
own freedom in jeopardy.

97
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,083
It was the Master
of the Kurain School

98
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,333
of channeling's daughter,
Mystic Maya Fey.

99
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,625
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

100
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,208
No! That's insane!

101
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,750
She's no killer. You're lying!

102
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,125
[JUDGE]
Overruled.

103
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,000
We must let the witness
give her testimony, defense.

104
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,083
[PHOENIX growls]

105
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,958
That night, I did go over
to the Inner Temple

106
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,750
to relieve Sister Bikini
for a while and assist

107
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,500
Mystic Maya with
her training as well.

108
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,458
[PHOENIX] But in your previous
testimony, you told the court

109
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,750
that you never went to
the Inner Temple that night!

110
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,125
I did, but that's
because I was lying

111
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,416
in order to protect Mystic Maya.

112
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,291
After she had finished
preparations for her training,

113
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,958
she passed through the garden.

114
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,166
Then, Elise showed up out of
nowhere and just started

115
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,916
attacking her with her staff!

[MAYA gasps]

[IRIS]
As Maya stumbled away in terror,

118
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,708
Elise threw the staff
down in the snow,

119
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,375
and pulled a dagger
from her robe.

[MAYA gasps]

122

[IRIS] Maya desperately tried to
take control of the situation

123
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,041
and stole the weapon
from her hands.

124
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,458
[MAYA whimpers]

125
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,666
She was only
trying to defend herself!

126
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,125
--[CROWD gasping]
--[PHOENIX] Hmm...

127
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,083
[IRIS] Elise was going
to kill her in cold blood!

128
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,458
That's why I did it.

129
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,166
All I wanted to do was
protect poor Mystic Maya!

130
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,166
And if you moved
the body across the gorge

131
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,041
to the Hazakura Temple,

132
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,791
nobody would suspect
that Maya was involved.

133
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,875
I'd say you brewed
up a pretty solid plan.

134
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,250
[PHOENIX]
Iris... I can't imagine

135
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,250
what your true motivation
must be with this,

136
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,875
but your testimony has
one glaring contradiction.

137
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,125
[gasps]

138
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,000
Elise would not have
thrown her staff aside

139
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,625
to attack. This thing
has its own secret.

140
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,791
[IRIS gasps]

141
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,375

142
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,666
My god! Is that blood?

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,958
[PEARL gasps]

144
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,083
Defense. Can you tell us
whose blood that is?

145
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,833
[PHOENIX] There's a sample
being analyzed as we speak.

146
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,500
But Sister Iris testified that
Elise threw this sword away

147
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,625
in favor of a dagger,
which makes no sense!

148
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,875
It's compounded by the
simple fact that Elise Deauxnim

149
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,375
would never try to
murder Maya Fey!

150
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,083
[GODOT]
How can you be sure?

151
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,000
I say "Elise Deauxnim,"
but that was just

152
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:49,583
a clever pseudonym.
Her real name was Misty Fey.

A woman who'd been
neither seen nor heard from

in well over 15 years.
And what's more...

Besides being Kurain's master,
she was also Maya Fey's mother!

00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,250
[JUDGE]
Are you serious?

161
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,958
No way... There's no way...

162
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,666
What?! Mystic Misty?!

163
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,458
[PHOENIX] Why would she
try to kill her daughter,

164
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,250
who she hadn't seen
in so many years?

165
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,583
There's just no reason!
You can't give me a single one!

167

[JUDGE]
Order! Order in this court!

168
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,708
[GODOT] Well... Who can
really say with family?

169
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,666
But when we went back
and investigated the garden

170
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,000
of the Inner Temple, we
discovered something that

171
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,708
backs up the sister's testimony.

172
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,041
The tip is completely
covered in blood.

173
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,375
Forensics is processing
a sample from this as well.

174
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,083
I see. Are you saying this
was the murder weapon?

175
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,250
[GODOT] That is what
the prosecution believes.

176
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,250
[PHOENIX growls]

177
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,250
[JUDGE]
This crime scene photo.

178
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,875
There's something
rather odd about it.

179
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,708
Why was the snow cleared
out around the lantern?

180
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,041
[PHOENIX sighs]

181
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,916
[JUDGE] And there seems
to be something scrawled

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,500
on the lantern itself.

183
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,041
[GODOT]
Huh?

184
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,750
[JUDGE] My goodness!
It looks like a bloody message!

185
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,125
Like someone wrote
"Maya" backwards.

186
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,041
See? I wasn't lying!

187
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,958
After Elise was stabbed, she
reached out behind her and wrote

188
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,958
the killer's name
in her own blood!

189
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,875
There's the proof!

190
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,000
[PHOENIX]
Crap! I forgot all about that!

191
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,416
[GODOT]
Hold it! Hang on just a minute.

192
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,791
What are you all seeing?

193
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,583
There are backwards letters
written on the stone?

194
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,416
It's right in front
of our faces.

195
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,708
The center of the frame.

196
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,750
[GODOT grunts]
Nonsense.

197
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,458
Do you really expect me to
believe that there's something

198
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,791
written on that thing?

199
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,041
[PHOENIX gasps]

200
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,083
[PHOENIX] Is he joking,
or can he not see it?

201
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,791
[JUDGE]
Regardless, this is a very

202
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,041
important clue, Prosecutor.

203
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,208
What do you say?

204
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,625
[GODOT growls]

205
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,916
[JUDGE]
Prosecutor Godot?

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,875
Yeah. O-Okay, witness.

207
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,416
Shall we move on?

208
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,708
[PHOENIX] He looks like he's
sweating bullets over there.

209
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,083
When it was done,
I fulfilled my duty.

210
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,416
I believed the most important
thing was to protect

211
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,541
the future master
of the Kurain School.

212
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,125
And so we decided I would
use the snowmobile to move

213
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,125
the body to the main temple.

214
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,750
[GODOT] Yeah. There were
clear snowmobile tracks

215
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,083
leading from Dusky Bridge
to Hazakura Temple.

216
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,208
Did you just say
that the tracks were clear?

217
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh, yes.

218
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,708
By the time I carried
her body to the bridge.

219
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,625
The snow had already
stopped falling.

220
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,791
[PHOENIX]
So there was no more snow?

221
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,541
Are you absolutely certain?

222
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,666
[IRIS] Uh... Yes.
There's no doubt in my mind.

223
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,208
Objection!

224
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,000
[IRIS screams]

225
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,125
[PHOENIX] That statement
is patently false!

226
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,166
[gasps]

227
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,000
That night,
the snow didn't stop

228
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,541
falling until 10:50 PM.

229
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,291
But at 10:45,
an exceptionally noteworthy

230
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,333
event took place.

231
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,416
What are you talking about?

232
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,750
Oh, yeah.

233
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,750
[IRIS gasps]

234
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,833
You have to ask?

235
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,958
Gotta say, I'm surprised
you didn't know.

236
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,000
That's when the lightning
strike hit the bridge!

237
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,083
Uh, lightning strike?

238
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,666
So there's no way you
moved the body like you claim!

239
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,083
--I--
--[PHOENIX] No.

240
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,541
Because by that time,

241
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,541
Dusky Bridge was already
consumed by flames!

242

[gasps]

243
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,458
In other words,

244
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,125
this means your testimony is a
complete and utter fabrication!

[CROWD murmuring]

251
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,875
Young lady. Lying under
oath is a serious crime!

00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,583
You can be charged
with contempt of court!

253
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,208
The snow stopped
five minutes after

254
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,375
the lightning strike?

255
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,250
Pfft. Don't make me laugh.

256
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,375
The weather in the mountains is
as fickle as a maiden's heart.

257
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,375
It can unexpectedly
change from one moment

258
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,750
to the next.

259
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,541
He's right, you know!
Just like a maiden's heart!

260
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,583
Oh, you have
gotta be kidding me!

261
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,041
The point is, on the
night of the murder,

262
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,375
the victim's body was indeed
moved to Hazakura Temple.

263
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,833
That fact is not in contention.

264
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,708
But can you provide
a better explanation

265
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,625
for how it got there?

266
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,916
[IRIS] Yeah! Or are you
trying to tell us her corpse

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
jumped across the burning
bridge on its own?

268
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,666
[PHOENIX] I don't know
what happened exactly.

269
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,541
But the body did make it
across the ravine somehow.

270
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,375
Think of something.

271
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,375
[JUDGE] The bridge was
definitely burned to a crisp.

272
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,708
And it would appear that one
of the suspension wires is gone.

[PHOENIX gasps]

274

[PHOENIX] Is that it?
Could that be what happened?

275
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,583
No answer, huh?
If you have no explanation,

276
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,333
then it's abundantly clear that
you don't have a leg to stand on

277
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,000

Sister Iris a liar!

A corpse jumping
over a burning bridge

282
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,291
seems impossible.
But believe it or not...

283
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,625
...it could happen.

284
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,500
[GODOT] Tch. Do you really
believe that's possible?

285
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,500
Well... Okay.

286
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,458
What I can't swallow is
how you'd back that up.

287
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:52,000
It's not all that difficult.
Don't forget...

288
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,458
...we do have
eyewitness testimony.

What do you mean?

290
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,625
[PHOENIX] I'm gonna have to
bulldoze my way through this.

291
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,375
It was Laurice Deauxnim!

Right? A potentially
brilliant artist!

293

Brilliant?

He's... an artist?

295

[CROWD murmuring]

297
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,166
[PHOENIX] Ahem.
On the night of the murder,

298
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,750
he was staying in
a cabin very close by.

299
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,000
And from there,

300
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,208
he witnessed the
moment in question.

301
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,333
I don't follow you. When?

302
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,041
Look here. He actually drew
exactly what he saw that night.

303
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,875
It's all on the page
in front of us!

Defense. Are you proposing that
this rendering is accurate?

305
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,625
And these scribbles
prove the victim

306
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,791
literally flew through the air?

307
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes!

brewed up a full pot.

You expect us to drink it down?

310
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,291
The truth is here!
You can see it clearly.

311
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,083
If you just change
your perspective!

312

Hmph. Spoon feed me, would ya?

Just tell me what I'm
supposed to be seeing here.

The piece of art
that Laurice Deauxnim

315

created that night... couldn't
be more of a contradiction!

00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,083
Your Honor, I think
you misunderstand me.

319
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,458
Take a look at this photo.

320
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:11,083
The suspension
wires are below the bridge.

321
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,250
But here, in this sketch,

322
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,875
they appear to be
above the entire thing!

323
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,000
[JUDGE] Hmm... Perhaps the
artist just saw it wrong?

324
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,125
I think he probably
just drew it wrong.

325
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,750
I think that you're
just wrong in the head.

326
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,916
He drew it like he saw it.

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,791
So there has to be a reason for
this difference in perspective.

328
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,041
[gasps]

329
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,416
[PHOENIX] According to
the court transcript,

330
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,708
he was in the cabin
nearby, as he puts it,

331
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,125
"cranking out a true work
of art, in my dreams."

332
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,000
His dreams? Huh.

333
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,500
At that moment,

334
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,791
lightning shot from the sky
and set the bridge aflame.

335
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,291
The whole thing happened
right before his eyes.

336
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,750
However...

337
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,500
...he was lying on his back!

338
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,916
--[gasps]
--So what?

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,333
The fiery scene
that he saw that night

340
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,000
was actually upside down!

341
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,791
[GODOT] Heh. So that's what you
meant when you said we needed

342
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,000
to "change our perspective."

343
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,583
This looks quite different.

344
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,583
The victim's body isn't
flying above the bridge.

345
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,750
It's clearly swinging
underneath it!

346
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,083
You see? Just like a pendulum!

347
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,666
[GODOT]
Objection!

348
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,708
Dusky Bridge is about
20 meters long, you know?

349
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,791
So where would somebody
just conveniently find

350
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,791
a rope to swing across it?

351
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,250
One couldn't be closer.

352
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,250
[GODOT]
What?!

353
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,958
[PHOENIX]
Don't you see it?

354
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,083
[JUDGE]
The broken suspension wire?

355
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,333
[gasps]

356
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,125
When lightning
struck the bridge that night,

357
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,750
one of the suspension
wires began to come loose

358
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,750
from its anchor point.

359
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,958
The culprit noticed this,
tied the body to it...

360
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,666
...and then swung it across.

361
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,083
[GODOT growls]

362
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,416
[PHOENIX] They were completely
hell-bent on getting

363
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,208
the body over to
the main temple.

364
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,458
But still...

365
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,791
Since they couldn't
cross a burning bridge.

366
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,083
This "pendulum" method
was the only way

367
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,333
they could make that happen.

368
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,333
[growls]

Order! Order in the court!

[IRIS]
Mister Wright!

373
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,625
Do you have any proof that
the culprit did such a thing?

374
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,333
Or are you just guessing?

375
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,666
[PHOENIX]
Of course there's proof.

376
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,208
It's right here. The police
said the corpse was covered

377
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,958
with bruises consistent
with a high fall.

378
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,625
After swinging over the gorge,
the body crashed to the ground.

379
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,125
The resulting impact...

380
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,375
...knocked this crystal
orb from the staff.

381
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,125
[JUDGE] I believe the defense
has shown a plausible theory.

382
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,500
Explaining how the
victim's body was moved.

383
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,708
[GODOT]
Objection!

384
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,000
[PHOENIX]
Uh...

385
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,541
This cold cup of coffee
should help lower

386
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,416
your temperature a little bit.

387
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,958
Uh... What are you doing?

388
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:50,166
[GODOT] A half-brewed deduction,
and still quite bitter, Trite.

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,666
You see, you forgot something.

390

[PHOENIX gasps]
Yeah? What?

391
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,791
If the perpetrator swung
the body over like you say,

392
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,541
then one might assume somebody
on the other side caught it.

[PHOENIX gasps]

394
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,750
Meaning they had an accomplice.

395
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,375
Tell the court, Mister Blight.

396
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,416
Who was there
to receive the body?

397
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,708
"Who was there?"

398
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:14,166
Obviously... It could
only be you, Iris.

399
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,958
Uh... It's me?

400
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,708
[PHOENIX] The only way
to transport the body from

401
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,791
Dusky Bridge was by snowmobile.

402
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,125
Objection! Were you
listening to her testimony?

403

This cutie pie was
helping Maya Fey.

Cleaning up the crime scene
at the inner temple.

405
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,250
Which means...

406
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,458
...she must've been the one who
sent the body swinging across.

407

You're the one who
hasn't been listening.

408
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,625
Sister Iris was later
seen at Hazakura Temple.

409
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,125
And she admitted
to taking the body

410
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,875
to the courtyard
to fake the crime scene.

Hmm... This is quite puzzling.

It's almost as if the defendant

at the same time.

Right. On the
night of the murder,

there were, in fact,
two Irises on the scene.

I gotta hear
your reasoning. Go on.

421
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,416
To be more precise,
there was a pair of twins.

--Your Honor!
--[JUDGE] Hmm?

[JUDGE]
I still don't understand!

480
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,583
This hood is proof

481
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,625
that a second Iris made
an appearance on the night

482
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,583
of Misty Fey's murder.

483
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,416
Before 10, I met her
at the main temple,

484
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,541
where she insisted
I take this hood.

485
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,666
However, right after that,

486
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,875
Sister Bikini spoke to her
at the Inner Temple

487
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,125
where she was wearing the same
hood she had just given away.

488
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,541
That's quite a contradiction.

--[IRIS growls]
--Objection!

490
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,041
The witness has been in police
custody the entire time.

491
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,416
So tell me, when could
she have switched places

492
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,791
with Dahlia Hawthorne?

493
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,208
It was quick,
but she did have a chance.

[GODOT gasps]

495
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,291
Right? It was yesterday.

496
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,333
When she went missing
for a few minutes.

497
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,875
Right around the time
of the earthquake.

498
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,250
Earthquake?

499
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,958
[PHOENIX] She made a beeline
for the Inner temple,

500
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,166
which is where we found
her moments later.

501
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,041
But by then, the switch
had already taken place.

502
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,791
And Dahlia was
in control of her.

503
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,875
[JUDGE] But... If we were
to give credence to

504
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,875
this channeling theory,
my question is this--

505
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,875
Could we even have a--

00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,416
[IRIS (DAHLIA)]
Stop yammering.

507
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,666
[JUDGE]
Hmm?

508
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,583
[IRIS (DAHLIA)]
It's been a long time.

509
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,041
Right, grandpa?

510
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,791
That horrible attitude.
I remember it well.

511
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,125
Okay, then.

512
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,083
Seems we have to go through
this one more time.

513
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,000
My curiosity and
courtroom procedures

514
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,583
both require that I ask
your name and profession.

515
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,708
My name is Dahlia Hawthorne
and I'm permanently retired.

Dahlia Hawthorne!

520
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,958
It's time to finish this
chapter of my life for good.

521
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,333
To turn the page
on her and my past.

[PHOENIX]
Objection!

523
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,750
It's clear that Dahlia has
crossed over the void

524
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,958
and taken over Iris's body.

525
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,375
Now, she's going to take
this opportunity to finally

526
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:39,166
reveal the horrifying plot that
she and Morgan Fey concocted.

527
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,500
In order to save Maya,
I reach a shocking conclusion.

528
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,958
The trial enters
into its final stages.

Very soon, the truth
will shine through.
