00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,500
[PHOENIX] During a spiritual
retreat, Maya's mother,

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,166
Misty Fey, was murdered.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,208
The killing was motivated
by a power struggle

4
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:15,750
within the Kurain school.

5
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,833
A family torn apart by
jealousy and resentment.

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,541
Although the motive is clear,

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,166
we've yet to figure out who
stabbed the Master of Kurain

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,000
near the snow-covered temple.

9
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,291
But today, the
shocking truth will be revealed!

10
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,375
Now, if you would, witness.

11
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,666
Please state your name and
occupation for the court.

12
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,125
My name is Maya Fey,

13
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,625
assistant manager at
Wright and Company.

14
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,916
We're a law office.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,125
On the night in question,

16
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,000
you had been training
at the Inner Temple,

17
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,583
where you witnessed the exact
moment of Misty Fey's death.

18
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,208
[whimpers]

19
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,041
But when the murder took place,

20
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,083
there was another, unidentified
person on the scene.

21
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,375
[gasps]

22
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,750
Yes. That person
was the real killer.

23
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,791
Uh. No, he was only trying to--

24
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,333
[PHOENIX]
Hold on a minute.

25
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,208
You said "he," so does
that mean you saw them?

26
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,833
I didn't. And of course,
it was super dark that night.

27
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,375
Dark is great for coffee.

28
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,125
But not so good
for accurate testimony.

29
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,291
He's right!
I could barely see a thing!

30
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,083
[PHOENIX]
I'm not buying it.

31
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,125
You called the
third person "he,"

32
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,500
then stopped yourself
from speaking.

33
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,625
That suggests
to me you recognized him.

34
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,000
[gasps]

35
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,500
And for some reason,
you seem to be trying to help

36
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,750
him with a cover up.

37
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,083
[MAYA whimpers]

38
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,375
[JUDGE]
A cover up?

39
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,750
What exactly are you
suggesting here, defense?

40
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,625
[PHOENIX] It was dark
and cloudy that night,

41
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,291
so she shouldn't have been able
to see the killer clearly.

42
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,500
Still, she managed somehow.

43
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,125
A person could've
easily hidden in the shadows.

44
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,666
However, there are some things
that are easier to see

45
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,791
in the dark!

46
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,208
I like your grind, it's strong.

47
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,125
But it's a little
hard to swallow.

48
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,916
Can you show us what you mean?

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,333
Please turn off all
the lights in the courtroom!

[CROWD murmurin]

51
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,166
[JUDGE]
Wait. Hold on.

52
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,666
What is that?

53
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,791
Well, you've gone
and done it now.

54
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,291
Nicely played.

55
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,458
So Maya, despite the darkness,

56
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,625
you were able to see these
three lights, weren't you?

57
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:45,791
[MAYA gasps]

58
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,833
[MAYA]
No!

59
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,083
Something's seemed off to me.
If you look at the crime scene.

60
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,208
The most conspicuous and
seemingly damning piece

61
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,791
of evidence is front and center.

62
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,125
[gasps]

63
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,083
A cover-up at this
stage seems fairly pointless,

64
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,125
when something like this
is right out in front,

65
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,333
so why even bother?

66
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,000
Remember what happened
when this photograph

67
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,791
was presented as evidence?

68
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,375
Nonsense.

69
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,208
You expect me to believe there's
something written on that thing?

70
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,416
Oh.

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,708
And a similar thing
happened once before.

72
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,458
It was during the poisoning
case at Très Bien Bistro.

73
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,583
Prosecutor Godot,
certain colors are

74
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,083
all but invisible to you.

75
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,625
[gasps]

76
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,250
[PHOENIX] One, for example,
is red on a white background.

77
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,333
That's why you cleared out so
much snow around the lantern.

78
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,625
Why do I seem
to be the only one?

79
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,875
Everyone else can see it but me.

80
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,416
The defense will
now make a formal accusation.

81
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,458
The person who killed Misty Fey,
was Prosecutor Godot!

82
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,000
[CROWD gasping]

83
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,458
Interesting brew, but how
do you make it palatable?

84
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,875
A good reason to kill Misty Fey
might make it go down smoother.

85
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,375
It's not as cut and dry
as just killing Misty Fey.

86
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,458
You were saving a life.
Maya's, in fact!

87
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,083
[GODOT]
Tch. This may sound bitter,

88
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,208
but I'm really not as heroic as
you may be inclined to believe.

89
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not the type of
guy to protect a stranger!

90
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,041
Maya isn't some random
stranger to you, is she?

91
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,208
Say what?

92
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,708
Because after all...

She happens to be the love
of your life's little sister.

Did I hear
the defense correctly?

00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,291
Are you him?

100
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,916
The last time somebody
called me by that name

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,500
was over six years ago.

102
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,833
[PHOENIX] This all goes
back to an infamous case.

103
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,250
And a trial that ended in
the defendant's suicide

104
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,875
in the courtroom.

105
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,833
You stood beside Mia
as she made her arguments.

106
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,125
But in the end, she was
unable to find proof

of Dahlia Hawthorne's crimes.

113
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,500
[GODOT] The way she treated
her clients came from

00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,375
her kind and pure heart.

I was captivated by her.

We were still poring over
that case when I asked

117

Dahlia Hawthorne to meet me at
the cafeteria right here

in this courthouse.

I was going into a deep sleep.

120

[GODOT] The poison I was given
did a real number on me.

00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,250
I lost my sight and my hair
turned as white as cream.

Five years later, I was awoken

by the smell of fresh-brewed
coffee, and then,

124
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,750
I got a real wake up call.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,166
[GODOT] The woman I loved
had been murdered.

126

She was gone forever.

And the woman I loathed
had been sentenced to die

00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,583
in the iron bar hotel.

129
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,666
There was no way
I could go back to sleep.

130
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,208
I had two things keeping me up.

131
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,541
They're what drove me
to become a prosecutor.

132
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,250
The first one, was you, Trite.

133
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,458
Why me?

134
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,708
Because you're the one
who let Mia Fey die!

[gasps]

136

[GODOT] She'd still
be alive if you weren't

137
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,041
such an immature child!

138
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,875
I wanted the whole
world to know what kind of

139
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,875
a man you really were.

140
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,875
And my other
reason to go on living?

141
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,041
Was Maya Fey.

142
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,875
She was the only way
I could atone for the sin

143
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,541
of not being there for Mia.

144
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,833
After the incident
in Kurain Village last year,

145
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,916
Morgan Fey was arrested.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,291
But it was obvious she'd
still be plotting something.

147
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,958
I listened to
the conversations she had

148
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,333
with her visitors hoping
she'd let something slip.

149
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,375
That's when I learned there
was actually a written plan.

150
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,958
I found it before
Pearl could read

151
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,083
its bone-chilling details.

152
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,833
Instead of destroying
it right then and there,

153
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,500
I thought playing along
might be a better strategy.

154
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,958
[GODOT] If I could pull it off,
this would end once and for all.

155
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,791
But I realized
I couldn't do it alone.

156
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,291
So I asked for help from Iris,
because she would be there

157
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,875
at Hazakura Temple.

158
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,250
I also contacted Misty Fey.

159
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,500
[GODOT] The police had been
keeping an eye on her movements

160
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,125
since the DL-6
incident years ago.

00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,666
And due to my newfound position

162
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,500
at the prosecutor's office,
I was able to access that info.

163
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,958
Then finally,
the call came in from Iris.

164
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,833
I rushed to the temple
as quickly as I could.

165
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,958
The only way we
could stop their evil plan

166
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,875
from happening,
was to make sure Pearl

167
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,250
didn't channel Dahlia Hawthorne.

168
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,458
[PHOENIX] I see, and that
must be the reason Misty

169
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,708
invited little Pearl to come
up to her room that night.

170
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,625
[GODOT] Unfortunately,
she never showed up.

171
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,791
[PHOENIX] She went to
the Inner Temple instead.

172
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,666
[GODOT] That's why Misty had
to channel Dahlia herself.

173
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,750
Into her own body.
A risk she was forced to take.

174
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,958
[PHOENIX] Because if she
channeled the spirit first,

175
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,750
then Pearl wouldn't
be able to do it.

176
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,125
[GODOT]
Still, if things went sideways,

177
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,500
I would have to
stop Dahlia myself.

178
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,458
So I hid over by
the inner temple.

179
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,625
[GODOT]
Anyway...

180
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,125
That's about all
I'm gonna say at this point.

[gasps]

182
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,750
[GODOT] There's just
one question remaining.

183
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,125
We all want to know who
really killed Misty Fey

184
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,416
at the Inner Temple.

You got the answer, Trite?

188
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,083
I thought you were
the real deal.

189
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,166
So why don't you
show us your proof?

190
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,000
Make it clear you
can finish this on your own!

191
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,791
No, don't do it, Nick!

192
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,083
Please don't. For me...

the whole story earlier.

His motives may have been pure,

00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,583
but that doesn't
excuse what he did.

200
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,541
I have a duty to find the truth!

201
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,166
No matter the cost!

202
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,958
The defense will now present
our very last piece of evidence.

203
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,666
Look there!

204
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,916
[JUDGE]
That dagger.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
It's the one Dahlia Hawthorne
was carrying,

206
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,958
if I'm not mistaken.

207
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,416
[PHOENIX]
Yes. And as you can see,

208
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,000
the tip is covered in blood.

209
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,375
But we had determined
that the sword

210
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,083
was the murder weapon.

211
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,000
The blood on that
matched the victim's.

212
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,625
That's true, but why
is there a bloodstain

213
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,041
on this dagger?

214
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,791
The only possible answer...

215
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,250
...is this.

216
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,166
At the moment she was being
run through by the sword,

217
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,791
Dahlia's reflexes kicked in,
and she struck them back.

218
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,125
Is that so?

219
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,958
Therefore... the blood
on the tip of this dagger,

220
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,625
actually belongs
to the killer!

I was completely
trapped at the Inner Temple,

which means I would have
had no way to hide my wound.

[JUDGE] You've made a very
serious charge of murder,

Mister Wright.

So you must realize that
the burden is on you now.

The judge is right.

The burden is on
my shoulders alone.

There's simply no other choice.

my mentor taught me,

If we turn
our thinking around,

it should be obvious why
there's no visible wound!

why there was no bloodstain

from being a defense attorney.

But I was really
just fooling myself.

I wasn't actually
interested in saving anyone.

was out of selfishness.
