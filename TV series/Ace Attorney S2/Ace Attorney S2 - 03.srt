I took up his case

[LUKE] Indeed! And since
I am an Ace Detective,

trap to ensnare the thief.

By the way, that

and the estimated time of death

472
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,750
is 1 AM on September 12th.

473
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,041
[PHOENIX]
1 AM? You don't mean...

474
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,541
That's right,
at the same time

475
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,708
a cheap little art piece
was being stolen,

476
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,708
there was a murder
happening over at KB Security.

477
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,541
All right, then.
What brings you here?

478
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,916
We work well together
and proved a few things

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,666
in court today. On the record.

480
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,000
[PHOENIX]
Like what?

481
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,375
Like the fact that on
September 12th at 1 AM,

482
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,916
one Mr. Ron DeLite was in the
office of KB Security's CEO.

483
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,500
The scene of the murder.

484
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,375
After getting
that blackmail letter,

485
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,625
he must've been
imbrued with utter rage.

486
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,625
[gasps]

487
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,000
[GODOT]
That's right.

488
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,791
We proved the kid's
whereabouts in today's trial.

489
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,750
It may have been his alibi,

490
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,041
but it implicated him
in a more serious crime.

491
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,250
Oh, no.

492
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,833
The defendant didn't
steal the urn, true.

493
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,750
Because he was
murdering Kane Bullard

494
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,041
at the time of the theft.

495
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,083
[gasps]

496
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,916
No! I don't believe it!

497
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,291
I'm innocent.

498
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,083
I'm only a thief, I swear.
I'd never hurt anybody,

499
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,458
not even a fly.

500
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,250
We'll have to detain
you for a little while longer.

501
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,791
On a different charge this time.

502
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,333
[GODOT]
You're going down for murder.

503
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,791
What do we do? There's
no way that Ron's a killer.

504
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,291
Was this your goal from
the very beginning, Godot?

505
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,875
We're in for another showdown.

506
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,791
I'm buzzing with excitement.

507
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,458
[PHOENIX]
Just who is this guy?

508
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,541
I sense a quiet but deep
hatred coming from him!

509
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,583
What's he getting out of this?

510
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,125
No! Ronnie!

511
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,875
[PHOENIX]
Ron DeLite? A murderer?

512
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,750
What the hell is happening?

513
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,583
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

514
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,666
The case of the stolen
Kurain urn has taken

515
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,625
an unexpected turn.

516
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:37,291
Ron was declared not guilty,
but now he's accused of murder!

517
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,666
This must be a setup,
but who's behind it?

518
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,291
And, after being
revealed as Mask DeMasque,

519
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,333
the alliterative ace
Atmey's behavior

520
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,958
has been troubling, too.

521
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,166
Who's pulling the
strings in this case?

522
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,291
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

523
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,291
Next Episode: "The Stolen
Turnabout -- 3rd Trial"!

524
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,375
Take that!
