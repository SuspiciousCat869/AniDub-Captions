00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,458
[PHOENIX] The Kurain Village's
sacred urn was stolen

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:14,000
by the infamous phantom
thief "Mask DeMasque."

3
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,125
Shortly thereafter,
a man named Ron DeLite

4
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,041
surrendered, claiming to be
the man behind the mask.

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,500
But something about his
claim didn't sit right with me,

6
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,250
and I took up his case.

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,416
At the trial,
I was able to prove that Ron

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,875
didn't steal the urn,
and even unmasked

9
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,000
the true DeMasque
in the process.

10
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,166
The culprit was his
rival, Ace Detective Luke Atmey.

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,083
We won the case,
but then Ron was accused

12
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,083
of something far worse.

13
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,250
[PHOENIX sighs]

14
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,541
I'm glad we got
the urn back, but...

15
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,500
[PHOENIX] To do it, we had
to place Ron at the scene

16
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,625
of a murder as it happened.

17
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,875
I just don't buy it.

18
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,041
How could that wimp
commit murder?

19
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,000
Well. What else
could he have been doing?

20
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,666
Mr. Nick proved he
was there at 1 AM.

21
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,166
Establishing an alibi's
a really strong move.

22
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,166
As long as it's verifiable, it
can turn an entire case around.

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,583
I was just trying
to prove Ron was

24
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,000
somewhere else at the time.

25
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,000
[MAYA] Too bad that
"somewhere else" was where

26
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,541
a murder took place.

27
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,083
Looks like you did
too good of a job this time.

28
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,458
What can I say?

29
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,416
I didn't know they'd
find a body there.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,166
I'm worried.
I hope Desirée's okay.

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,833
This can't be easy on her.

32
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,500
All right.

33
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,583
We should investigate the
murder at K-B Security.

34
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,958
I don't think Ron has it in
him to kill someone, either.

35
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,916
There must be
another explanation.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,708
I'll continue to defend him.

37
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,333
For his wife's sake, too.

38
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,125
--[MAYA] Good call.
--[PEARL] And with the urn back,

39
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,791
we can focus our efforts
on helping you.

40
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,958
Oh. Yeah, that reminds me.

41
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,583
Did the urn always
have these pink splotches?

42
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,333
And what's with it saying
"AMI" again all of a sudden?

43
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,416
It still said "I AM"
on the poster.

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,083
[PHOENIX]
The truth is, one year ago,

45
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,083
Pearl broke the urn by accident.

46
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,208
She tried her best to
put it back together,

47
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,166
but she isn't exactly great
at crafts... or spelling.

48
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,833
Whoa! I just had a thought.

49
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,083
Do you think this could
be a fake or something?

50
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,791
[PHOENIX]
A-A fake?

51
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,750
If you really think so,
then I'll bring it back to

52
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,541
the village and have
Great Aunt take a look at it!

53
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,125
[MAYA]
Good idea! I'll go with you.

54
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, no. I couldn't
possibly allow that.

55
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,208
[MAYA]
Why not?

56
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,625
I want you two to spend
some time together.

57
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,208
Maybe then you'll
get all lovey-dovey

58
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,583
like our new friends are.

59
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,958
"Like our new friends?"

60
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,125
[PEARL] You know! I mean
Ron and Desirée, obviously!

61
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,666
Taking matters
into their own hands

62
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,333
to defend each other.
Oh! So romantic!

63
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,125
Now that's what I call love!

64
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,958
I hope I feel that one day!

65
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,250
Someone's excited.

66
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,708
You can say that again.

67
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,375
[PEARL] I'm off!
Be a good couple while I'm gone.

68
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,875
No fighting, okay?

69
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,541
She, uh...

70
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,375
Seems to have the wrong
impression about the two of us.

71
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,750
I know. Right?
I'm not surprised though.

72
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,833
Why's that?

73
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,083
I'm sure I've
told you this before.

74
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,666
But our channeling powers
are strictly maternal.

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,708
Only the women inherit them.

76
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,333
So inevitably,
we become the center of life

77
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,916
in the village.
Maybe because of that,

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,208
many marriages in our
family end up falling apart.

79
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,666
I guess the men
must feel like outsiders.

80
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,833
Because many of them end up
leaving the village forever.

81
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,500
Even when they have a daughter.

82
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,708
I take it Pearls's father wasn't
the exception, then.

83
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,875
It's just...

84
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,541
She's grown up surrounded
by relationships

85
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,500
that never seem
to work out well.

86
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,583
It's only natural she'd want
to encourage healthy ones.

87
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,625
Besides, ever since
the incident last year,

88
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,583
she hasn't had a mom around.

89
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,416
Oh. Yeah.

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,791
[PHOENIX]
That's right.

91
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,958
Pearls's mother, Morgan Fey,
has been rotting in jail

92
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,875
for the last year.

93
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,416
So I get it.

94
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,125
I mean, I'm the only family
she's got left at this point.

95
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,583
That makes a lot of sense.

96
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,041
[ANDREWS]
Um, excuse me.

97
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,958
[PHOENIX gasps]
Ms. Andrews? What's the matter?

98
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:24,125
I... have some bad news.
I'm truly sorry!

99
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,625
[BOTH gasps]

100
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,625
Really? You shattered
the Kurain urn?

101
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,666
Yes.

102
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,666
[MAYA]
But... When did that happen?

103
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,875
Recently. It was
about two weeks ago.

104
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,750
The urn was sent
to us after they finished

105
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,833
the photo shoot for the poster.

106
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,291
I was carrying it to the
warehouse when it happened.

107
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,333
[ANDREWS wails]

108
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,375

[screams]

112
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,458
[ANDREWS] I'll never forget
that terrible noise.

113
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,083
I rushed over and
tried to check inside.

114
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,375
[screams]

115
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,333
[whimpers, sighs]

116
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,333
[ANDREWS] And then
blacked out from the shock.

117
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,916
[MAYA]
Yeah, that checks out.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,083
The paint matches perfectly.

119
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,625
Of course... I tried
my best to repair the urn.

120
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,291
Fortunately, the shards
were pretty big,

121
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,750
so I was able to piece them back
together with relative ease.

122
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,041
With the urn
back in one piece,

123
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,958
I realized how ugly the
paint stains looked.

124
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,416
So I hid them behind
Mystic Ami's statue.

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,083
Okay, I think I'm
starting to understand

126
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,666
everything here.
Just one problem.

127
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,875
That's not where the
statue was last time.

128
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,250
[ANDREWS]
Um... Yes.

129
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,458
You're right.

130
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,416
You did seem
surprised back then.

131
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,375
But what is
she doing over there?

132
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,750
Oh, no.

133
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,166
Woah.

134
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,500
Does that mean someone
moved it without you knowing?

135
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,875
[PHOENIX] If I'm right, the
statue was only delivered here

136
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,833
a day before the theft.

137
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,500
The detective guarding
the warehouse, Luke Atmey,

138
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,000
is the only one who
could've moved it.

[LUKE chuckles]

140
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,625
[PHOENIX]
The question is why he moved it.

141
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,000
Furthermore, does
this have anything to do

142
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,250
with our new case?

143

Again. Sorry.
I sincerely apologize.

Don't worry about it!

it's supposed to now.

00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,416
That caffeine-obsessed cyclops
made us look like total idiots!

161
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,625
That's a rough one.
I feel for you two.

162
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,000
Wait, what?
That's not like you at all.

163
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,125
Usually you're like,
"Serves you right!

164
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,916
You got what you deserved!"
[laughs]

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,791
Or something along those lines.

166
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,541
Well, I can tell when
someone puts their heart

167
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,541
into their work, like
you did, so... You know?

168
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,750
That, and I can sympathize
when things don't work out

169
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,666
for hardworking people.

170
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,625
Things rarely go the way
I want in my line of work.

171
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,458
Wow, Dick, you're so thoughtful.
That's a shock.

172
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh. Oh!

173
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,625
While you're feeling talky,
what happened to Mask DeMasque

174
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,833
after the trial?

175
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,541
Him? That detective
that played dress-up?

176
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,583
Serves him right!
The guy got what he deserved!

177
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,333
[laughs

178
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,791
Now there's the
Gumshoe we know and love.

179
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,375
At least we know
there's nothing wrong with him.

180
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,875
--By the way...
--[GUMSHOE] Huh?

181
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,541
Would you mind telling us
a little bit about the victim

182
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,375
who died here the other night?

183
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,291
[GUMSHOE]
Sure thing, pal.

184
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,500
Kane Bullard, the CEO of
KB Security and a big fella

185
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,041
in his own right.

186
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,625
His corpse was
found at 9 this morning.

187
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:07,541
However, his estimated time
of death is 1 AM on the 12th.

188
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,041
It really did happen at the
same time that Mask DeMasque

189
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,958
stole the urn, huh?

190
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,833
Why did it take
an entire day for someone

191
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,166
to discover the body?

192
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,041
[GUMSHOE] Well, his corpse
was stashed away inside

193
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,833
that big safe,
if you can believe it.

194
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,125
Nobody had heard from him,

195
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,416
and when they opened
the safe in the morning...

196
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,166
[PHOENIX]
Out fell the body.

197
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,333
[gasps]

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,750
[GUMSHOE] Also, it seems
like this guy was involved

199
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,583
in some shady
business practices.

200
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,833
Shady like how?

201
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,125
If a company hired his
firm, they'd spy on 'em,

202
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,958
learn their secrets, then
sell the information to rivals.

203
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,625
Wow. Sounds like
a grade-A crook.

204
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,541
[GUMSHOE] The firm was
even in charge of security

205
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,500
for someone robbed
by Mask DeMasque.

206
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,250
But they screwed it up
and lost the victim's trust.

207
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,250
That's interesting.

208
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,125
--[thud]
--[BOTH gasp]

209
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,166
[PHOENIX]
What are you doing?

210
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,625
I'm tryin' to
open this dumb safe!

211
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,125
What's it look like?

212
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,208
[PHOENIX] I... don't think you
understand how safes work.

213
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,375
[GUMSHOE] It's worth noting
somebody must've opened that

214
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,708
on the night of the crime.

215
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,916
After all, the victim's body
was hidden in there.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,041
Also... According
to company records,

217
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,708
Ron DeLite had the
clearance needed to open it.

218
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,541
But there are plenty
of others with the same level

219
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,416
of access as him, aren't there?

220
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
[GUMSHOE]
Of course there are, but still--

[alarm blares]

00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,458
[PHOENIX]
Maya?!

223
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,000
Sorry! I wanted to see
what the button was for.

224
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,458
[GUMSHOE]
It's an emergency buzzer!

225
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,625
Can't you read?
It says right there!

226
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,333
Oops. Shoulda looked.

227
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,500
[GUMSHOE] It sets off an alarm
in the basement guard room

228
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,666
that tells security
to high-tail it here.

229
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,916
I have to wonder.

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The other night,
was that button pressed?

231
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,500
[GUMSHOE] I had the same
thought, so I asked around.

232
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,208
Security says there's no
record of the alarm sounding.

233
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,791
Plus, we dusted
the button for prints

234
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,291
and didn't find a thing.

235
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,166
[PHOENIX] I'm surprised
the buzzer wasn't used.

236
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,708
[BUTZ] You again?
You need somethin' big man?

off while you're out there

Oh, no. It's nothing
like that at all.

246

We're just here to investigate
CEO Bullard's death.

00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,500
Oh. Yeah.

248
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,000
That's right, that
guy died. Didn't he?

249
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,416
C'mon.

250
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,541
[MAYA] All right, let's actually
get down to business.

251
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,750
Larry, were you here on
the night of the murder?

252
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,958
Huh? Yeah, of course I was.

253
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,041
[PHOENIX] That's a lie
if I ever heard one.

254
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,416
What? No! I was here!
Why wouldn't I be?

255
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,916
[PHOENIX]
Yeah, you were playing hooky.

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,041
Whaddya mean? I resent that!

257
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,416
Besides. Do you have
proof I left my post?

258
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,083
Because I don't think you do!

259
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,958
[PHOENIX] I thought
you found Ron's wallet.

260
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,541
At least, that's what
you testified at the trial.

261
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,250
[BUTZ] Oh, yeah.
It was just two days ago.

262
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,541
I saw it on the ground outside
my building at work.

263
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,416
It's clear.
If you found it outside

264
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,041
two nights ago, you
must've snuck out of work!

266
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,708

it's my fault, are ya?

00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,666
It's not my fault
he's dead, right?

268
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,583
[PHOENIX] Did you bail
for the usual reason?

269
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,208
Usual reason?

270
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,333
If you're insinuating that
I left to meet a girl

271
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,458
then you're way off!

272
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,041

Did the buzzer really
not go off that night?

I had the same thought,
so I asked around.

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,458
Security says there's no record
of the alarm sounding.

282

Nope! Had to check before.

00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,916
No logs of it
goin' off all night.

say no to you, Maya. Let's see.

00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,750
Well, I figured.
We might as well try.

00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:06,625
It says it went off during
the night around 1 AM or so.

296
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,083
Around 1 AM?

297
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,625
That lines up perfectly with
the time of the murder!

believe it either, buddy.

clarification on that night.

Hmm.

Begging! Please!
Don't abandon me!

305

Ron, if you want my help,

306
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,083
you're going to have to
start telling me the truth.

307
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,541
Do I have your word?

308
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,166
Yeah.

309
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,416
All right. Now tell me where you
were the night of the murder.

310
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,250
And I mean where
you really were.

311
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,666
Okay...

312
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,916
At 1 AM on September the 12th.

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,708
You weren't at Lordly Tailor,
but at K-B Security, right?

314
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,000
[RON]
Since I used to work there,

315
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,041
I knew where the
CEO's office was.

316
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,000
I knocked, but there
was no answer.

317
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,541
[RON] So I used the key card
to unlock the door.

318
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,208
I didn't notice,
but when I went inside,

319
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,041
someone was there in the dark.

320
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,375
[RON] Then suddenly they bashed
me over the head with something!

321
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,916
[MAYA] Could you tell
if it was the C.E.O

322
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,208
when you looked at him?

323
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,708
[RON]
No. Whoever it was ran away

324
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,541
while I was stunned, so I didn't
see what they looked like.

325
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,750
[RON] But when I came to, I saw
Mr. Bullard dead on the ground!

326
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,666
[RON] I thought I had to do
something about the body.

327
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,250
[MAYA]
And what did you do after that?

328
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,333
[RON] What do you think?
I got out of there!

329
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,958
Sure, I hid the body
in the safe,

330
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,083
but that's 'cause I was
afraid of how it'd look.

331
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,916
See? That's all I did, I swear!

332
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,125
[PHOENIX sighs]

333
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,333
I was scared the
police would find out, so...

334
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,000
I turned myself in.

335
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,916
If I had been found
guilty as Mask DeMasque 

336
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,666
in the previous trial, then that
could have been my alibi.

337
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,333
One more thing.

338
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,166
Can you recall when you
received this blackmail letter?

339
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,416
Let's see...
When was it, again?

340
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,541
It's kinda hard to
tell them all apart.

341
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,333
There've been so many.

342
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,958
What does that mean?
This isn't the first one?

343
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,666
No. But this is the first
one that ever called me out

344
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,208
to a specific location,
if that counts for anything.

345
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,291
Do you at least
remember when

346
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,875
you received the first one?

347
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,416
I could never forget that.

348
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,916
I got the first letter only a
few days after my debut

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,375
as Mask DeMasque.

350
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,916
Ron, you said
you'd tell the truth.

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,625
You aren't the phantom thief!

352
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,916
It was Ace Detective Luke Atmey.

353
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,333
No, it wasn't!

354
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,916
I know it looks like I'm lying
because it wasn't me who broke

355
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,666
into Lordly Tailor that night.

356
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,833
But still! It really was me
on all the other heists!

357
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:27,833
[gasps]

358
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,333
I'm not lying.

359
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,250
Someone apparently spotted me
on my inaugural adventure.

360
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,041
I know because it said
so in the first blackmail.

361
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,041
Something like
"I know you did it."

362
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,333
You got busted
on your first theft?

363
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,833
And from then on,

364
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,458
I started receiving plans
and instructions in the mail.

365
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,250
[PHOENIX]
Plans?

366
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,916
[RON] They'd tell me what
to steal and how to do it.

367
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,708
They detailed security
blind spots, escape routes,

368
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,583
and even training methods.

369
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,458
Are you telling me
your heists were all planned

370
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,875
by someone else?

371
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,375
Yes. After the first one,

372
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,666
I was simply carrying out
my mysterious orders.

373
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,750
If I didn't, they'd tell
the cops! Pretty cool, huh?

374
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,500
Why is he so happy
about being exploited?

375
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,041
[PHOENIX] So Ron was
Mask DeMasque after all.

376
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,083
But someone else
is behind the thefts.

377
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,708
Someone who planned
it all out in detail.

378
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,666
[RON] All I had to do was
put the treasures I stole

379
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,666
into the designated
safe-deposit box.

380
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,333
Then just sit back
and wait for the cash

381
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,958
to arrive in the mail.

382
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,083
[PHOENIX]
You even got a reward out of it?

383
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,500
[MAYA] Is that why you went
after the Kurain urn, then?

384
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,500
I didn't. I've never
even seen that urn.

385
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,125
All I do is steal
what I'm told to,

386
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,375
and that urn wasn't
in my instructions.

387
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,625
Ron, do you swear everything
you've just said is the truth?

388
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,125
Yes. And now that
it's out, I'm done for.

389
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,750
If there's one thing
Dessie won't stomach,

390
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,291
it's breaking the law.

391
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,041
When she finds out,
she's never gonna forgive me.

392
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,458
If you knew that,
why'd you become a thief?

393
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,583
I had to!

394
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,083
She spends money
like it grows on trees!

395
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,125
You see, I love her,
compulsive spending and all,

396
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,083
but there's no job that could
bring in enough money for her!

397
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,583
Except being a thief, I figured.

398
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,041
[BOTH chuckle]

399
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,000
I tried telling her
I was Mask DeMasque,

400
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,500
but she immediately
laughed at the idea!

401
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,208
She thought I was joking around!

402
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,666
To be fair, I don't think
I would have believed it either.

403
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,375
Can't blame her.

404
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,583
[RON] Anyway, I wanted
to tell you something.

405
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,291
I heard that detective
who's taking credit

406
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,125
for my thievery is having his
trial at the exact same time

407
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,541
as mine, in the
courtroom next door!

408
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,958
Well, that's surprising.

409
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,500
Hold on. But we know that wacky
wordsmith isn't actually

410
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,083
Mask DeMasque, don't we?

411
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,500
[RON]
Right, he's not. I am!

412
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,791
[PHOENIX] It doesn't
matter what we know

413
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,333
if he's claiming to be guilty.

414
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,375
I have one more question
that I have to ask you

415
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,708
before we're finished.

416
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,000
Of course, ask away.

417
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,208
Be completely honest
in your response.

418
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,750
Did you kill Kane Bullard?

419
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,958
No, I didn't! Please.

420
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,333
Please believe me!

421
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,541
[MAYA grunts]

422
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,166
I'm sorry.

423
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,666
As you can imagine, I was
just trying to help my Ronnie.

424
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,000
Kinda backfired
on you there, didn't it?

425
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,791
[PHOENIX]
Don't say that.

426
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,833
Nicky boy, please.
We really need your help.

427
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,583
Ronnie's not a killer, I know
him better than anyone!

428
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,125
I'm on your side.

429
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,875
[sighs]
Thank you so much!

430
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,250
I just don't know what
to do anymore.

431
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,291
I feel so useless.

432
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,000
And that detective!
He's infuriating!

433
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,500
I want to knock that pointy
nose off his stupid face!

434
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,208
Knowing that, I'm less
surprised that you barged

435
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,083
into his office, but you still
shouldn't have done that.

436
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,708
[DESIRÉE]
I had to do something!

437
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,916
Ronnie was in major trouble!

438
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,041
We talked to him earlier,
and despite everything,

439
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,750
he's still claiming to
be Mask DeMasque.

440
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,375
[DESIRÉE]
He's so silly.

441
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,250
I know everything there is to
know about that cinnamon roll.

442
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,208
He always looks before he leaps.

443
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,666
Most of the time,
he looks and doesn't leap.

444
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,958
He's so fainthearted!

445
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,458
He just doesn't have it
in him to be a thief.

446
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,541
Right. You know him the best.

447
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,291
[PHOENIX]
I guess opposites attract.

448
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,583
[MAYA]
Huh?

449
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,166
Oh. Just thinking
out loud about how these two

450
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,458
are so different, yet somehow
ended up married to each other.

451
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,750
Come on, now.

452
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,916
You don't have to
sound so perplexed.

453
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,541
It was love at first sight.

454
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,000
For me, at least.

455
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,875
Wow! That's a surprise!

456
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,541
[DESIRÉE] It wouldn't be
if you'd been there.

457
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,083
Ronnie saved my life.

458
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,625
Back then,
I was working in a bank.

459
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,416
And one day, two men
suddenly rushed in to rob us.

460
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,041
[DESIRÉE] I can't stand
people like that, so naturally,

461
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,333
I gave 'em a piece of my mind!

462
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,750
[PHOENIX] You talked down
to armed robbers?

463
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,125
[DESIRÉE]
Yeah, and they took me hostage.

464
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,708
I was so scared.

465
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,708
But then help arrived--
in the form of Ronnie.

466
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,875
Stop! You thugs leave her alone!

467
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,125
[DESIRÉE] Crying and
swinging his arms like crazy,

468
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,541
he attacked the two robbers.

469
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,583
I think...
that's when I realized.

470
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,000
He's the kind of guy
who has real courage.

471
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,458
The courage to risk his life
when it matters most.

472
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,000
My Ronnie.

473
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,625
Tomorrow, let's send
that Prosecutor Godot

474
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,166
from espresso to depresso!

475
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,625
--Get it?
--[PEARL] Mystic Maya, Mr. Nick!

476
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,583
Hey, you two!

477
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,833
[MAYA]
Pearls!

478
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,208
[PEARL]
It's the real deal, apparently!

479
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,000
[MAYA gasps]
That's such great news!

480
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,041
Thanks again. You rock!

481
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,875
[PHOENIX] The urn. This
whole mess started with it.

482
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,958
At 1 AM on the night
it was stolen,

483
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,250
Ron was at K-B Security.

484
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,541
[gasps]

485
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,708
At the same time,
there was another Mask DeMasque

486
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,791
in the Lordly Tailor
basement warehouse.

487
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,791
Why'd Luke Atmey show up
there dressed like that?

488
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,833
And why would he pick that time
in particular to steal the urn?

489
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,416
Not to mention, why
was the statue moved?

490
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,750
There had to have been a reason.

491
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,791
And that's not
all we don't know.

492
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,958
Who attacked Ron in the
CEO's office at K-B Security?

493
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,000
And that emergency buzzer.

494
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,916
Why would the killer
let it be pressed?

495
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,500
He should've realized
security would rush there.

496
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,000
Wait, did he do it
because he knew

497
00:20:55,083 --> 00:21:00,083
security would come?
Why didn't I see it before?

498
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,291
[LUKE laughs]

499
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,708
[PEARL]
I know that look!

500
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,083
You just figured something
out, didn't you?

501
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,916
Tomorrow's trial will
be a race against the clock.

502
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,166
Aww. I was hoping we could
take this one nice and easy.

503
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,666
Unfortunately, we can't.

504
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,333
That won't cut it tomorrow.

505
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,125
This court is hereby
in session for the trial

506
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,708
of Ron DeLite.

507
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,375
[PHOENIX] In a nearby courtroom,
another trial is set to begin.

508
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,833
Court is now in
session for the trial

509
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,500
of Luke Atmey.
Please take your seats.

510
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,708
Two simultaneous
trials, linked at the core.

511
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,583
I have to find the truth
and drag him to the stand...

512
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,750
...before the verdict
is handed down!

513
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,875
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

514
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,000
The two tangled trials begin.

515
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,458
In order to prove Ron's
innocence, I'll need to unveil

516
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,500
the crimes of Detective Atmey,
who stands as the accused

517
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,083
in the other ongoing trial.

518
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,791
Which means it's
a battle against time!

519
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,541
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

520
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,666
Next episode: "The Stolen
Turnabout--Last Trial"!

521
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,875
Take that!

522
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,666
[RON]
Please believe me!

523
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,541
[BUTZ]
Oh, come on, Nick! [wails]
