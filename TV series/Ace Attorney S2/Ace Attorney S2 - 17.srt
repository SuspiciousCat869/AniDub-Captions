[PHOENIX] Among Kurain
Village's sacred treasures

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,291
is the "Shichishto," or
"Seven-Branched Sword."

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,833
This relic was forged to be
a symbol of life itself.

5
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,833
Though our choices
may seem infinite,

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,625
with possibilities branching
out in every direction.

7
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,416
Much like our destinies,
the sword eventually leads

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,875
to one end.

9
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,291
It severs the delicate
thread that binds us

10
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:33,541
to this world without mercy,
and impales us with truth

11
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,541
by slashing through
the fantasy that we can

12
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,583
escape this grim fate.

13
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,500
[MAYA] Wow, I am so glad Pearls
showed me this magazine,

14
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,291
or I would've snoozed
on an awesome chance

15
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,541
to give my spiritual
powers a boost!

16
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,541
Thanks a million, Pearls!

17
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,916
I'm just happy
that it makes you happy!

[MAYA whimpers]
Oh, my goodness, Nick!

20
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,458
I'll freeze to death
before we get there.

21
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,083
It's so cold!

22
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,541
Ah-choo!

23
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,291
Exactly why
I dressed for the weather.

24
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,791
I'll just think of it as
my first phase of training!

25
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,791
Ah-choo!

26
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,208
That's the way!

27
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,375
We're almost there, Mystic Maya,
you can tough it out!

28
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,041
Yeah!

29
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,458
[PHOENIX] Winter is cold enough
in the heart of the city,

30
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,166
but here we are trudging through
the snow-capped mountains,

31
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,666
all to support Maya
in her training.

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,583
Oh! It's right up there.

33
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,458
There's Hazakura Temple!

[PEARL] This place was built
so spirit channelers

38

from the Kurain school can
go get additional training.

39

I-It's amazing!
We made it here alive!

40
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,375
Ah-choo!

41
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,291
[BIKINI] Come in, come in,
right this way!

42
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,041
Have a seat around the fire!

43
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,500
We appreciate it, ma'am.

44
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,375
[BIKINI] Well, we appreciate you
coming all this way.

45
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,916
Now sit down, get cozy!

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,125
Oh, yeah!

47
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,291
Now that is exactly
what the doctor ordered!

48
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,416
Quit acting tough and
warm your bones, Nick!

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,416
I'm not trying to act tough.

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,750
[BIKINI]
Now. Let me introduce myself.

51
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,791
I'm head nun at
our quaint little temple.

52
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,208
My name is Bikini.

53
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,208
Bi...

54
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,958
--...ki...
--...ni?

55
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,666
I wasn't born with that name!

56
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,875
But I took it on when
I came to this temple.

57
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,916
Bi! Ki! Ni!

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,708
Not what you expected, is it?

59
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,250
Yep. It can be quite
a shock for some folks!

60

So who might you be?

63
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,291
Me? I'm the one who signed up to
get some specialized training!

64
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,958
[BIKINI] Aren't you
a brave little firecracker?

65
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,083
Coming out here 
in the deathly cold.

66
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,291
Oh, to be so young and reckless!

67
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,916
Don't blame me if you die.

00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,291
What does she have to do?

70
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,458
Chant Kurain mantras
while sitting on ice.

71
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,791
Thirty thousand iterations!

72
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,375
All while dousing herself
with freezing cold water.

--[MAYA] Mm-hmm.
--[PHOENIX groans]

You could turn yourself
into a human popsicle,

00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,000
if you're not careful.

76
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,041
[MAYA whines] But I don't
wanna be a human popsicle.

00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,750
Well, get comfortable.

78
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,083
There's a little time
still before dinner.

79
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,916
In that case,
I think a nice hot bath

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
oughta thaw me out.

81
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,791
Did you say "hot"?

Oh, you youngsters

You can shower in

Uh, sorry, ma'am. But...

I hope you don't mind me asking
if you're Elise Deauxnim?

Do you know who she is, Nick?

105
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,208
Well, she kinda looks like...
a fortune teller?

106
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,125
[ELISE chuckles]
Good guess.

107
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,750
But I'm a writer and illustrator
of children's books.

108
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,166
Oh, neat. Like picture books?

109
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,500
Looking at your drawings
is a purification ritual

110
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,708
for my heart!

111
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,125
That must be the most
beautiful compliment

I've ever received.

113

I've thought about writing

Oh? When the time comes,

00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,625
you'll create a

I'm flattered.

125
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,416
But I was just recently
asked by a young man

126
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,916
if he could become
my apprentice.

Oh, really?

He even calls himself
Laurice Deauxnim.

He's around here working
on his landscape sketches.

So, then.

Did you come here to do
research for your next book?

Yes. I suppose
you could say that.

Friends, you'll have
to excuse me for now.

I promised to help with
dinner preparations.

Wow, does that mean
you're going to be

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,583
[MAYA] Come on, Nick.
You're fine, so hurry!

162
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,250
[MAYA]
Anyone here?

163
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,708
[PHOENIX]
Looks pretty no frills to me.

164
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,416
And that's a rockslide
just waiting to happen.

165
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,666
[MAYA] But the Inner Temple's
Hermit Hall is strong! Yikes.

166
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,958
I'm not so sure
"strong" was accurate.

167
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,250
Is this really where
you're gonna be training?

168
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,541
Creepy, huh?
Probably full of ghosts.

169
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,666
[PHOENIX] Heh. A spirit-medium
that's afraid of ghosts

170
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,166
is kinda ironic.

171
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,583
[MAYA screams]
There's one!

172
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,708

[PHOENIX gasps]

176
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,500
Whoa, awesome!
I think she's actually alive!

177
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,708
Hi. I'm gonna be doing some

178
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,666
advanced training
in here tonight.

179
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,208
Oh. I'm Iris, one of the nuns.

180
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,500
We're very glad to
have you at the temple.

181
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,958
My name's Maya Fey.

182
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,833
It's nice to meet you, Iris.

183
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,541
Yes, you as well.

184
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,083
Please excuse me,
I have chores to do.

185
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,666
[PHOENIX]
Ah... Iris! Hang on a sec!

186
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,333
[PHOENIX]
You wouldn't happen to--

187
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,125
[MAYA] What? Nick, you
gotta check this out! Quick!

188
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,833
[PHOENIX]
What am I looking at, exactly?

189
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,083
That woman...

190
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,166
It's her. It's my mom.

191
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,458
[gasps]

192
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,833
Ah!

193
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,666
[MAYA] "Master of the Kurain
School of Channeling.

194
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,041
Misty Fey."

195
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,416
Is that really her?

196
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,083
Do you see that crest
at the top of the scroll?

197
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,083
[MAYA] That's the symbol
of a Kurain Master.

198
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,541
[PHOENIX]
What is it?

199
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,041
[MAYA]
That crest is how I knew.

200
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,791
If it wasn't there, I'd have
no idea it was my mother.

201
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,625
[sniffs]

202
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,208
I haven't seen her
in over 15 years,

203
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,541
so I don't even
remember her face.

204
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,583
[PHOENIX sighs]
Poor Maya...

205
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,541
I am so glad that's over.

206
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,708
You okay? You've turned
a different shade of green.

207
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,375
Yeah. I'll probably
be fine eventually.

208
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,208
[BUTZ]
Hey! Move it, you two!

209
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,708
I'm working on
a landscape here,

210
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,583

I'm not into portraiture--

[BUTZ groans]
Hi! A pleasure to meet you.

214
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,750
Uh... I'm Laurice Deauxnim!

215
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,875
[PHOENIX] Are you insane?!
I know it's you, Larry!

--[blow lands]
--[BUTZ] Owie! Shut up!

217

My name is Laurice!

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,666
And I'm here to do an artistic
study of Dusky Bridge!

219
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,750
[MAYA] Deauxnim?
Oh, are you the apprentice?

220
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,750
[BUTZ]
Truth is...

221
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,291
I was starting to feel
like I didn't wanna be

222
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,375
ol' Larry Butz anymore.

223
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,041
And that's when
I discovered her books!

224
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,250
Elise Deauxnim turned me
into a new man!

225
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,958
Like your heart
had been purified? That it?

226
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,875
Yeah! Exactly!
I have been reborn!

Whoa! That is so cool!

Hungry? It's time for everybody
to come and eat dinner!

00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,583
Meet us in the
Main Hall, if you please.

232
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,166
Time to get some curry!

233
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,000
Just who is she?

234
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,000
She's a beautiful flower.

Here you go. Eat your fill.

237
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,250
[PHOENIX]
She looks exactly like her.

238
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,375
But there's no way.
That would be impossible!

239
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,041
All right!
I'm stuffed to the gills

240
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,250
with curry and ready
to start my training!

241
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,958
Be careful.
Promise you won't overdo it.

242
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,416
[giggles] Haven't you ever
heard the old saying,

243
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,708
"No pain, no gain?"

244
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,750
Maybe not too much pain, okay?

245
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,875
Best of luck, Mystic Maya.

246
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,625
Luck? Or skill?

Yes. Of course, Sister.

Hey, Pearl. If you'd like...

253
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,875
...you can come
to my room for a bit.

254
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,791
Maybe we could read
some books together.

255
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,666
Yeah, that would be amazing!

But, um... The truth is...

00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,541
I'm not really the
strongest reader just yet.

258

[ELISE chuckles] Well,
then I'd be more than happy

to help you improve.

Aw! You're so nice!

261
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,625
So, um... Do you think
you can tell me what this says?

262
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,041
That word is "gravely."

[gasps]
And what's this word?

264
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,333
"Fruition." Those
are fairly difficult words.

[BUTZ]
All right, later, Nicky.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,875
Don't wanna keep
my canvas waiting.

All this snow ignites
an artistic fire

deep inside my soul.

00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,291
Just try and stop me!

272
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,208
Why would I even wanna stop you?

273
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,458
Looks like a bad winter storm.

274
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,666
[PHOENIX] That tree has
some kinda aura to it.

275
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,291
Is it a weeping cherry?

[gasps]

282
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,666
[PHOENIX]
How does she know my name?

283
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,791
Sorry. I'm being rude.

284
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,666
But if you would... could you
take off your head scarf?

285
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,666
[IRIS gasps]

Please, miss.

287
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,083
[PHOENIX] It's way more
than a resemblance.

288
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,333
She's the same person.

289
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,500
But... Dahlia is
still in prison!

[IRIS] Mister Wright.
Is something wrong?

Uh... Excuse me, Iris.

292
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,791
But can we talk for a minute?

293
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,791
[IRIS]
Sure.

294
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,958
I appreciate it.

295
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,958
When did you come
to Hazakura Temple?

296
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,833
I've lived here ever
since I was a little girl.

297
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,625
Because, I really don't
have any family to speak of.

298
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,083
[PHOENIX] People come
here to train and boost

299
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,041
their spiritual powers, right?

300
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,000
[IRIS] Right. The temple
is loosely affiliated

301
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,041
with the Kurain School
of Channeling.

302
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,458
It does seem extremely
different from that place.

303
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,958
I believe that's a good thing.

304

[gasps]

305
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,625
Communicating with the
dead has never helped anybody.

306
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,125
I don't like it at all.

307
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,250
[IRIS gasps] Forgive me. I have
to ring the bell for lights out.

308
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,333
Sorry, I didn't
mean to get in your way.

309

Hey. Mister Wright?

310
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,916
Yes?

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,916
[IRIS]
If you don't mind...

312
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,750
...I'd like you to take this.

313
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,333
This scarf will protect
you from evil spirits.

314
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,458
On a night like this,
you may need some extra help.

315
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,958
Thanks, but what about you?

316
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,333
Now don't worry about me.

317
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,958
Thanks again.

318

Uh. Iris?

00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,833

met before now have we?

320
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,833
[gasps]
I have to get going.

321
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,333
I have to ring
the bell at 10 PM.

[PHOENIX gasps]

323

[PHOENIX] She knows me.
There's not a doubt in my mind.

324
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,958
Definitely need to bring it up
with her again tomorrow.

Why are you on the ground?

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,750
Obviously, because I passed out!

00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,750
Just hurry up and
call the police! Now!

[PHOENIX]
Ah! You're right!

339
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,708
I don't have my phone!

340
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,291
I think I must've left it back
at the office or something.

341
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,625

next to Dusky Bridge!

Run over there!

Hey! Let me go! Now!

349
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,791
No way! The freakin'
bridge is on fire!

350
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,541
[PHOENIX] Larry,
you gotta call the police!

351
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,791
Huh?!

352
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,791
[PHOENIX] I'm serious!
There's been a murder

353
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,791
over at the temple!

354
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,250
Wait, for real?

355
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,458
[PHOENIX] I'm worried that
the killer might have tried

356
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,416
to flee across the bridge!

357
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,291
[PHOENIX] Maya's over there
inside the Inner Temple!

358
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,333
[BUTZ]
What? I'm totally confused!

359
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,625
[PHOENIX] Just get it together
and call the police!

360
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,000
I gotta help Maya!

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,958
Tell me what happened.

[PHOENIX] Reading over
the transcript of Mia's

370
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,583
very first case is
making my head spin.

371
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,333
To think it all revolved
around events that

372
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,291
took place on that same bridge.

373
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,291
The defendant died
in the courtroom,

374
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,791
and Dahlia was involved
in the whole thing.

375
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,291
I had no idea about
some of this stuff.

376
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,958
Almost as crazy as
what happened last night.

377
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,458
Rushing across
that burning bridge,

378
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,666
then plunging into
the icy river.

379
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,375
I'll probably be in
the hospital for a while,

380
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,291
but it's a miracle
I even survived.

381
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,458
I can't believe
I'm stuck here in this bed.

382
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,416
I don't know exactly what
happened at the Temple,

383
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,416
but the police started their
investigation of Elise's murder.

384
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,375
And Iris is in custody as
their number one suspect.

385
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,041
I know she's not a murderer.

386
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,500
But above all else...

387
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,291
...I'm really worried about
what's going on with Maya.

388
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,791
That bridge was the
only way for her to get back.

389
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,958
So she's trapped
inside the Inner Temple.

390
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,125

find a way to help her.

Larry called me last night.

394
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,916
He was crying and
saying that you'd drowned.

395
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,583
[PHOENIX grunts] Nope.
Fortunately, I am still alive.

Hey, Miles.
Thank you for coming here.

Actually, it's just a
coincidence that I happened

to be back in the country.
Only for a bit.

I'm Miles Edgeworth.

414
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,583
I was sent here at the
request of Phoenix Wright.

415
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,166
[IRIS gasps] Really? So you've
actually talked to him?

416
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,625
How is he doing?

417
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,083
[MILES]
All things considered,

418
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,458
he's doing remarkably well.

419
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,875
I'm so relieved!

420
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,208
At first I heard that
he didn't survive the fall.

421
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,041
[MILES] Of course Larry had
to go and tell everyone that.

422
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,416
[MILES]
This may seem odd,

423
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,583
but I feel as though you
and I have met before.

424
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,458
I don't see how that's possible.

425
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,375
I hardly ever leave
Hazakura Temple,

426
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,791
so unless you've been there...

427
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,916
Understood. Tell me.

428
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,500
Are you there training to
boost your spiritual abilities?

429
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:32,458
[IRIS] Mm-mm. I'm afraid
I don't have those abilities.

430
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,666
For me, I'm strictly trying
to atone for my wrongdoings.

431
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,333
The sins of my past.

432
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,375
[IRIS]
I'm training to purify my soul.

433
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,750
About last night...

434
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,041
Can you share with me your
recollections of what happened?

435
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,458
[IRIS]
Of course.

436
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,583
After dinner I led the new
trainee and Sister Bikini

437
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,041
across the bridge and
over to the inner temple,

438
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,500
and then at 10 PM I rang
the bell for lights out.

439
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,416
After that, I was
in my room until I heard

440
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,875
all the commotion.

441
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,791
I'm going to ask you directly.

442
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,708
Did you murder
Elise Deauxnim last night

443
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,583
on the Hazakura temple grounds?

444
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,875
No. I swear it wasn't me.

445
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,750
Before coming here to see you.

446
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,708
I paid a visit to Wright
at the hospital.

447
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,000
He requested I do him a favor.

448
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,416
That I act as your defense
attorney in the trial

449
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,958
tomorrow morning.

450
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,208
What? He really asked for that?

451
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,791
[MILES]
He did. Be honest with me.

452
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,500
You knew him
before this, correct?

453
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,083
[IRIS gasps]
Why... would you think that?

454
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,125
[MILES] He acted strangely
when your name came up

455
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,166
in our conversation.
He couldn't hide it from me.

456
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,625
So let me ask you.

457
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,375
Do you consider him to be
a friend Mister Edgeworth?

458
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,416
Without a doubt.
One of my oldest.

459
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,708
You should know this.

460
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,333
Five years ago,

461
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,458
I betrayed his trust
and deceived him.

462
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,000
What do you mean by that?

463
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,958
[IRIS] Well. Long story,
but I was a weaker person then.

464
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,083
I know that my cowardice
truly hurt Phoenix.

465
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,958
I made a vow that
I would never show my face

466
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,916
in his presence again.

467
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,791
Whatever you did to him,
he's still hurting from it.

468
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,458
I firmly believe
the only cure for

469
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,208
that kind of pain is honesty.

470
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,500
[gasps]

471
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,333
[MILES]
It's not too late.

472
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,833
You can tell him the
truth and set him free.

473
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,875
[IRIS]
I will. I promise.

474
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,791
Very well, then.
I'll provide your defense.

475
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,166
[MILES]
Okay. Now that's taken care of,

476
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,166
it's time to begin
the investigation.

477
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,958
[MILES] I'll have to try
a different approach

478
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,458
in this trial. So I'll do
things your way, Wright.

479
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,541
[PHOENIX]
I may be stuck here in bed.

480
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,500
But the situation is going
to go on without me.

481
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,208
And still...
The Inner Temple is cut off

482
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,458
from everything.

483
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,500
[PHOENIX] Poor Maya.
I really hope you're okay.

484
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,083
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

485
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,375
Iris is in jail, awaiting her
trial for the murder

486
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,416
of Elise Deauxnim. But I have
faith my old friend Miles

487
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,250
can argue her defense
in my absence.

488
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,583
Maya is locked away
inside the inner temple.

489
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,791
How strange that a setting
which figured so largely

490
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,583
in Mia's first case has
come up once again.

491
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:48,416
As the various motives come to
light, a shocking trial begins!

492
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,000
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

493
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:54,041
Next episode: "Bridge to the
Turnabout - 2nd Trial"!

494
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,375
Take that!
