[PHOENIX] Maya and I
traveled to Hazakura Temple

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,625
in the snowy mountains,
so she could further

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,083
her spiritual training.

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,666
But tragedy struck
when children's book author

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,750
Elise Deauxnim was murdered.

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,666
Lightning set Dusky
Bridge on fire,

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,125
stranding Maya on
the other side of the river.

8
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,375
Failing to cross over and save
her, I ended up stranded, too--

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,041
in a hospital bed.

10
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,750
The police arrested
Sister Iris for the murder.

11
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,875
The defendant is a secretive nun
who bears an uncanny resemblance

12
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:36,250

whose face I could never forget.

13

Your Honor.
This man was apprentice

30
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,375
to the late Ms. Deauxnim.

31
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,791
That night, he was staying in a
small cabin near the scene.

32
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,916

in Heavenly Hall!

[JUDGE 204A] Well, sir,
please begin your testimony.

41
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,000
Iris did take the
snowmobile that night.

42
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,375
But it wasn't
to commit any crime.

43
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,500
No, she did it to
give us all a warning.

44
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,666
We needed to know
that dinner was ready!

45
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,708
[JUDGE 204A]
Dinner?

46
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,916
Yeah! She was
like "come and get it."

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, man, she looked super-cool!

48
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,291
A little later that night,

49
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,000
I was in the cabin cranking
out a true work of art.

50
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,208
Well, in my dreams.

51
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,541

means he dozed off

54
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,916
Suddenly, crashentino!

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,625
Pow! It was hella loud.

00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,083
Totally scared the
living crap outta me.

57
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,000
But then I saw that
creaky ol' bridge up in flames.

58
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,416
I rushed over to check it out,

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,708
and that's when I ran
into my buddy Nick.

60
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,000
Was the bridge still intact?

61
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,833
Well, I wouldn't have set
foot on it if you paid me to.

62
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,708
The thing was up in flames.

63
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,250
But Nick was feeling brave.

64
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,541
He tried to cross it and
tumbled right into the gorge.

65
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,541

He either has the
most incredible or rotten luck.

It's almost impossible to tell.

00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,625
So Larry.
According to police records,

72
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,291
they received a call about
the incident at 11:30.

You were the one who made
that call, were you not?

[BUTZ] Yeah! That's exactly
what I shoulda done, right?

was also on fire!

Wright showed up?

it was divine inspiration!

up its life for my art!

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,000
And so, I started creating
my rendition like a madman!

162
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,166
But how can you be
so sure it was the defendant

163
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,750
that you saw? You couldn't have
had a clear view from the cabin.

164
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,625
[chuckles]

165
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,666
You do realize who
you're talking to?

166
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,833
I'm a Deauxnim.

167
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,916
Nothing escapes my artist's eye!

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,208
Including proof she
was the person I saw!

169
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,250
There's proof?

170
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,625
[BUTZ chuckles]

171
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,708
After Nick went
whizzing into the gorge,

172
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,000
I called the cops.

173
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,875
I came back to where
the bridge used to be

174
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,458
and saw something nutty.

175
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,750
"Nutty," how?

176
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,333
I'll show ya!

177
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,541
So, what is this?
A crystal sphere?

178
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,625
Or what?

179
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,875
Pretty sure it's
the thing from Iris's

180
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,541
weird hoodie that she wears.

181
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,166
I think that it probably
fell off when she landed.

182
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,416
[FRANZISKA] Well. Her headwear
did have a crystal sphere on it.

183
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,000
[JUDGE 204A gasps] There's a
red stain on this, right there.

184
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,708
I believe that
it might be blood.

185
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,125
There are bloodstains on it?

186
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,208
[CROWD gasping]

187
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,083
That's why I was worried
about her doing dangerous stuff.

188
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,500
Poor thing...

189
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,416
She must've hit the ground
too hard when she landed.

190
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,625
[MILES]
Objection!

191
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,125
[BUTZ whimpers, yelps]

192
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,875
After your testimony,

193
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,083
there is one fact that
I'm absolutely certain of.

194
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,875
[BUTZ]
Yeah? Well, what is it?

195
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,166
The person that
you depicted in this work...

196
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,625
...could not be the defendant!

197
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,375
Uh... No?

198
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,625
The night of the crime.

199
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,166
Sister Iris's head was
completely uncovered.

200
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,833
But as seen in this picture.

201
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,500
[JUDGE 204A] You can tell
she has the hood on right there.

202
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,083
What?

203
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,625
Oh, really? But how in
the world would you know that?

204
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,375
I mean, you weren't even at
the temple that night, man.

205
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,250
Because I talked to
the person to whom she had

206
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,083
earlier given her hood.
She gave it to Phoenix Wright.

207
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,041
What? So Nick had it?

208
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,625
I believe that
he may have been

209
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,791
the hooded figure you painted.
He was wearing one, after all.

210
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,625
[BUTZ growls]
Why does he always do this?

211
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,541
It was, like, totally obvious
I was into her!

212
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,083
Calm yourself!
So explain the crystal sphere!

213
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,250
It was discovered at
the foot of Dusky Bridge.

214
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,250
And there're clearly
bloodstains on it!

215
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,666
That one is too big.

216
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,958
[gasps]

217
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,708
Just look at the size of it.

218
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,250
The one you're holding.

219
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,666
It would be preposterous for
that to be attached to a hood.

220
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,958
[JUDGE 204A]
Oh. Yes. Excellent point.

221
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,375
That night, there was
one person at the temple

222
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,708
who lost a crystal sphere
and left bloodstains. Correct?

223
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,083
[BUTZ] Oh, is that so?
And who would that moron be?

224
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,583
I'm surprised you asked that.

225
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,125
I'm talking about the woman
who mentored you, moron.

226
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,833
Ah! What? You mean Elise?

227
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,166
[FRANZISKA]
Wait. So the victim dropped it?

228
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,625
As shown here,

229
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,875
there's a similar crystal
sphere affixed to her cane.

230
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,458
That may be,

231
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,000
but do you have any actual proof
that this one belonged to her?

232
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:59,083
Just look. The evidence
tells the whole story.

233
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,083
[FRANZISKA gasps]

234
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,291
[BUTZ]
Whoa! Her orb is gone!

235
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,458
To make sure
I understand, Defense,

236
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,708
are you implying it was
the victim who flew across

237
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,125
the bridge that night?

238
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,208
That would be
the logical conclusion.

239
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,416
Even though, the fact remains
that humans cannot fly.

240

[CROWD gasping murmuring]

[FRANZISKA]
Objection!

A fool, working with
another fool on a fool's errand

00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,083
to foolishly reach a foolish
conclusion together.

What do you mean by that?

245
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,500
The night of the murder,

246
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,083
Elise Deauxnim was in her room.

247

Which is located
at Hazakura temple.

248
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,291
She had no reason to
go to Dusky Bridge at that hour.

[MILES growls]

250
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,250
[MILES]
Unfortunately, she's correct.

251
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,750
There's no proof that the
victim left her room that night.

252
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,625
But, there's also
no proof she didn't.

253
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,750
It seems that
you have nothing to say.

254
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,666
Rare that you're speechless.

255
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,333
[MILES] I have a hunch,
but can I prove it?

256
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,125
No, it doesn't matter if I can.
Because I must!

257
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,666
[MILES] After all,
that's the way Wright

258
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,958
would approach the situation.
I'm sure of it.

259
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,750
This new evidence
points us in the direction

260
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,291
of a new possibility.

261
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,333
[FRANZISKA]
A new possibility?

262
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,125
And what's that?

263
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,541
[MILES]
Of an entirely new crime scene.

264
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,500
She wasn't killed at the temple.

265
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,458
Maybe... the murder was
committed next to Dusky Bridge!

266
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,708
What? So the
scene's wrong, but ho--

How foolish! There's no way!

269
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,416
She must've gone
down to the bridge.

270
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,333
While she was there,
something happened.

271
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,208
And as a result, the sphere
was knocked loose.

272
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,500
Then it somehow came
into contact with blood.

273
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,166
And you think that
"something" was her murder?

274
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,000
The killer took her body
back to Hazakura Temple.

275
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,583
They wanted to make it appear as
though she was murdered there.

[FRANZISKA]
Objection!

Have you forgotten?

278
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,833
The head nun of Hazakura
gave us her testimony earlier.

279
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,750
She said she saw your
client killing the victim

280
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,916
in the courtyard!

281

[MILES]
Objection!

282
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,708
She later clarified that what
she saw, was the defendant

283
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,166
holding on to the
weapon sticking out

284
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,416
of the victim's back.

285
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,166
Not the moment
of the actual murder!

286
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,875
[gasps]
Maybe so.

287
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,375
But it takes ten minutes to walk
from the bridge to the temple.

288
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,791
It's too far.

289
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:08,916
The killer wouldn't
have carried

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,416
the body all that way.

291
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,375
There was a snowmobile,
was there not?

292
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,125
What?

293
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,250
[MILES] They must've used
it to transport the body.

294
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,375
Any "fool" can see that all
the pieces are in place!

Order, order! Please!

[yelps]

298
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,875
The defendant was
the only one who had

299
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,458
access to the snowmobile!

300
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,958
What's more, the witness saw her

301
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,625
with her hands on
the murder weapon!

302
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,833
Which leads us
to the same conclusion.

303
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,083
That Sister Iris
is the murderer!

304

the defense has
completed our objective.

00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,000
At least for the time being.

307
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,291
What? What are you
trying to say?

308

[MILES] We've proven it is
not possible to hand down

a definite verdict
at the moment.

310
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,625
The case requires
further investigation.

311
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,791
We need to discover
where the murder

312

really took place.

313
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,125
And why the killer
needed to move the body.

314
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,625
Also.

315
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,750

Please. Don't be foolish.

Do you seriously believe the
victim was somehow flying?

318
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,666
[MILES] Her crystal sphere
was found at the foot

is this man would never
hurt or lie about a girl

He drew what he saw then.

So something had
to have happened.

I hereby request
that both the defense

329
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,833
and the prosecution conduct
further investigation.

wasn't what killed her.

So there's gotta be
another sword out there

00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,625
that was used. We just
need to find it somehow.

That would be decisive.

00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,666
Apparently, this is it.

477
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,958
Oh, really?
She was killed here instead.

478
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,291
I'm worried about Maya.

479
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,125
Stuck in there.

480
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,041
After that rickety old
bridge finally got patched up,

481
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,041
the cops looked all over
the Inner Temple.

482
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,958
But there was neither
hide nor hair of her.

483
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,791
Only place left.

484
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,666
Would be somewhere behind that
door with the crazy lock on it.

Gets really cold
inside the sacred cavern.

486
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,958
Below freezing.
I hope she can survive.

No way...

488
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,250
And if we can't
bust her out in time,

489
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,708
it means you sent a
woman off to die.

490

Won't be your first one.

Your memory can't be so bad.

Yeah.

498

Maya Fey's older sister.
And your mentor, right?

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,416
She'd still be alive now

Three years ago,

Mia made a very dangerous

00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,833
and it cost her her life!

505
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,250
And I didn't rest until I made
sure he paid for what he did!

506
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,333
Yeah, he may have
been caught, but so what?

507
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,500
The truth is...
That's not gonna bring her back.

You were with her right
until that psycho killed her.
