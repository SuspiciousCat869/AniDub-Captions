[PHOENIX]
In the peaceful mountain setting

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:13,625
of the Hazakura Temple,
a brutal murder has taken place.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,458
Filling in for me
as the defense,

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,333
Miles called the presumed
crime scene into question,

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,500
sending the case back to
the investigative stage.

6
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,791
[PHOENIX grunts]

7
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,916
She should've never
taken you under her wing.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,416
You're a coward!

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,250
If you had any guts,
she'd be with us right now.

10
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,791
And it's not just her!

11
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,500
You're gonna let the same thing
happen to her little sister!

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,083
[GODOT grunts]

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,833
[PHOENIX] I believe the murder
took place in the Inner Temple's

14
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,041
courtyard across Dusky Bridge.

15
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,291
I've found evidence
to back up that theory.

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,583
But it also raises
troubling questions.

17
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,291
[PHOENIX]
What the hell is going on?

18
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,375
We just got
the results back from

19
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,291
the forensics lab,
and they're saying the victim

20
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,250
wrote this in her own blood.

21
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,875
So it's a message
from Ms. Deauxnim.

22
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,291
But why was
it written backwards?

23
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,333
That's the thing that proves

24
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,083
she wrote it out herself, buddy!

25
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,083
[PHOENIX]
Uh...

26
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,541
So there she was,

27
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,583
being backed into a corner
by this cold-blooded killer.

28
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,958
She was walking like this, with
her back facing the lantern.

29
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,333
As you can see,

30
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,333
if the victim wrote down
her attacker's name

31
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,125
while standing in this position.

32
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,041
[PHOENIX]
It would look backwards!

33
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,875
[GUMSHOE chuckles]

34
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,375
This spells out "Maya."

35
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,333
You said she wrote
her attacker's name.

36
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,000
So you believe
Maya is the killer?

37
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,958
[gasps] Well... I hate
to break it to you, uh...

38
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,041
That's what HQ's thinkin'.

39
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,833
[PHOENIX sighs]
There's no way.

40
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:18,458
[gasps] I've seen this before.
Elise was wearing it that night.

41
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,458
[PHOENIX gasps]

42
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,458
[PHOENIX]
Whoa. It's the same crest!

43
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,250
The one that's on
the scroll inside.

44
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,458
Maya told me what it stands for.

45
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,291
So why did Elise have it?

46
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,083
Oh, before it slips my mind.

47
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,958
I found something I thought
was a little weird over there.

48
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,125
[gasps]

49
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,500
[GUMSHOE chuckles]
Let's check it out, huh?

50
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,125
Somebody obviously
tried to burn up this note.

51
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,416
[PHOENIX gasps]
What is this?

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,708
It talks about channeling and
what to do after lights out.

53
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,625
Are these some
kind of instructions?

54
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,000
Hey, Detective.

55
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,833
You mind if I hang on
to this for a little while?

56
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,041
Heh. As long as you keep
it in this bag, we're good.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,916
[PHOENIX]
Iris!

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,458
[IRIS]
Ah. It's Mister Wright.

59
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,791
[PHOENIX] Please, you gotta
get Maya outta there quickly!

60
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,583
Of course. I'm heading over
to the Inner Temple right now.

61
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,166
Back off! You can wait for
us inside the Main Hall.

62
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,291
Are you serious? I'm going, too!

63
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,666
I assure you, I'm quite serious.

64
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,791
I know what's going on.

65
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,625
It's because Maya's
a suspect now, right?

66
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,125
Good to know
that you do understand

67
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,833
the position you're in.

68
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,375
Iris! I'm counting on you!

69
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,458
You're the only one who
can open up that door!

70
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,541
Right.

71
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,000
[FRANZISKA]
Let's move!

72
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,291
[PHOENIX] Okay, guess I gotta
focus on what I can do to help.

73
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,375
[BIKINI]
Well, this is shocking.

74
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,791
I didn't think you'd
survived that fall.

75
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,833
May the gods
have mercy on your soul!

76
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,625
You do realize I am alive?

77
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,666
I caught a terrible cold,
but that's about it.

78
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,333
I am absolutely
delighted to hear that!

79
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,791
[sighs]
My word.

80
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,708
I'm afraid I've made a
horrible mess out of everything.

81
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,125
First Mystic Elise
dies on my watch,

82
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,541
now all this with Iris.

83
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,458
[PHOENIX]
Wait. Did I hear that right?

84
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,791
Excuse me.
But I couldn't help noticing

85
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,583
that you referred
to her as "Mystic Elise."

86
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,958
[BIKINI gasps]

87
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,125
Why's that? I thought
she was a book illustrator.

88
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,500
Oh, well, uhh...

89
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,500
It has something
to do with the amulet

90
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,291
she was wearing doesn't it?

91
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,666
[gasps]

92
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,666
[PHOENIX] I remember seeing
this same crest before,

93
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,625
on the scroll hanging over
in the training hall.

94
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,750
It's reserved for
the Master of Kurain, right?

95
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,125
What'd you say?! Hold on,
how do you know about that?!

96
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,875
Maya explained it to me.

97
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,708
Did you know that she's
the master's daughter?

98
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,333
[gasps]
That young trainee?!

99
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,666
Wait... If she's the
daughter of the master...

100
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,833
[PHOENIX] Hmm.
It means she's the next in line.

101
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,458
[BIKINI wails]
Oh, Mystic Misty!

102
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,166
[wails]

103
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,083
[PHOENIX whimpers]

104
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,333
So it's true.

105
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,791
And "Ms. Elise Deauxnim"

106
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,750
was really just Misty's
Fey's pseudonym.

107
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,666
Yes. She arrived a week ago.

108
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,625
Of course,
I wasn't expecting her.

109
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,916
[BIKINI]
Huh?

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,375
[BIKINI] And when she
showed me the talisman with

111
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,958
the master's crest on it.

112
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,166
I tell you, I nearly
died from the shock.

113
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,791
It had been 17 years
since anyone had seen her.

114
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,208
That's quite an absence.

115
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,541
Why'd she come back now?

116
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,166
She was worried
about the state of things.

117
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,416
[MISTY] The Kurain's main
bloodline is in trouble.

118
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,125
We're dangerously
close to dying out.

119
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,458
I'm going to
stop that from happening.

120
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,083
That's why I've come here.

121
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,958
The main bloodline?

122
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,250
The Kurain School has
but one successor at the moment.

123
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,083
Only the master and
her daughters are considered

124
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,416
part of the "main family."

125
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,166
And the others
are branch families.

126
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,541
That right?

127
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,791
[BIKINI] Mm-hmm. You can
imagine the Kurain's history

128
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,125
is littered with... "incidents."

129
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,083
Times when the branches tried
to take out the main family.

130
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,000
Assassinations and the like.

131
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,958
Sounds like a war.

132
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,291
That's the
same motivation behind

133
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,750
a case from last year.

134
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,000
When the master's older sister
tried to frame Maya

135
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,958
for a murder in the village.

136
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,041
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

137
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,833
But she's been sent away.

138
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,083
She's in prison,
where she belongs.

139
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,541
Her main goal in all of that,
was to make little Pearl

140
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,541
the next master of Kurain.

141
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,750
That's true.

142
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,166
If you're already aware
of Mystic Morgan,

143
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,416
surely you know her
connection to Iris.

144
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,625
Who she really is.

145
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,625
What? No, who is she?

146
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,541
Sister Iris is
the estranged daughter

147
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,750
of Mystic Morgan.

148
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,583
I had no idea!

149
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,333
One of a pair
of identical twins,

150
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,666
and part of another
sad chapter in the family.

151
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,041
Wait. Iris has a twin?

152
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,708
Seems like Pearl would've
mentioned that she had

153
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,916
older twin sisters by now.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,625
[BIKINI] Several years ago,
when Mystic Morgan's husband

155
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,625
at the time learned she would
not become the master,

156
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,833
he divorced her and
left Kurain Village,

157
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,916
taking the two girls with him.

158
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,333
[BIKINI] Later, he realized he

to Hazakura Temple.

And that's how Iris got here.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,916
How much do you know
about the twins?

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,375
Can you at least tell me
Iris's sister's name?

163
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,333
Was it... Dahlia?

164
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,583
Yes. I believe
that was her name.

165

[gasps]
That's what's been bothering me!

166
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,416
I can't believe it.
Iris is Dahlia's twin sister!

I think it's over now.

Ah! Oh, no!
The tremors were strong!

You have to go and check
on the sacred cavern!

[PHOENIX]
Iris got away?

179
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,791
[FRANZISKA] Because this scruffy

[yelps]
I'm sorry, ma'am!

181
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,041
I had just arrived
here with the perpetrator.

182
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,791
When the ground
began to tremble.

183
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,958
[GUMSHOE] I went over
to escort the defendant.

Man, I took my eye
offa her for a second!

I really stepped in
it this time...

00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,833
Well, the more capable officers
have set up checkpoints.

That'll only be a waste of time.

Answer me, Wright!

Right over there.

The Inner Temple?

Don't be foolish!
It's completely isolated!

There's nowhere to run!

[FRANZISKA]
I don't care who.

Only that they're
removed at once!

difficult task to accomplish.

What do you mean?

212

[IRIS] These are trick locks
that can only be opened

Yeah, you're right.

Well, if that's
the case, so be it.

So what brings
you out here, anyway?

I was curious
about this crystal.

it truly was the victim's.

around here again as well.

The murder weapon
really was here.

I'll take it to

[PHOENIX grunts]

00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,083

I couldn't shake the feeling I
had seen her somewhere before.

But where?

254
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,916
Now I know.
My first trial as a prosecutor.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,458
A nightmare for
everybody involved.

Yes. Dahlia.

you can't erase

from your thoughts either.

00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,875
[PHOENIX sighs]
Yeah, she's hard to forget.

261
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,666
Yet another thing the two of us
have in common, I suppose.

262
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,250
I didn't know this before,

263
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,791
but it seems that
she had a twin.

264
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,750
Which happens to be Sister Iris.

265
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,291
Yep, that's right.
I'm kinda impressed.

266
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,791
You've really done
your research.

267
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,416
This is slightly out
of character for me to say.

268
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,208
But I feel like Dahlia
Hawthorne's shadow

269
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,916
is looming over this case.

270
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,625
'Course it's impossible
she could be involved

271
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,666
at this point.

272
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,916
Because she's in prison?

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,208
Well, Dahlia was in prison,
but now she's no more.

274

[gasps]

275
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,208
[MILES]
It happened about a month ago.

276
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,500
Her sentence was carried out.

277
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,708
She was executed.

278
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,958
[PHOENIX gasps]
Really...?

279

This must be quite
a shock for you.

00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,750
My apologies.

281
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,958
But you should know that she
had nothing to do with this.

282
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,583
Because the simple
fact is that the dead

283
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,333
can never come back.

284
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,083
[PHOENIX] Is that a fact?
I don't know what to believe.

285
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,833
[IRIS]
Mister Wright. Is that you?

286
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,125
[PHOENIX]
Yeah.

287
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,583
I have some bad news.

288
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,791
This is harder than I thought,

289
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,750
so I can't open it
until tomorrow.

290
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,708
Please don't stop on my account.

291
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,125
But I'd like ask you
something if you don't mind.

292
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,500
[IRIS]
What is it?

293
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,166
It's about the night
of the murder.

294
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,333
After ringing the bell for
lights out at 10 PM,

295
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,666
you went back to your room,
or at least that's what

296
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,166
you claim you did.

297
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,791
You think I'm lying about that?

298
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,083
I saw you there.

299
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,041
When you were on
your way to ring the bell.

300
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,416
And I heard it, too,
not long afterward.

301
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,250
[PHOENIX] But around the same
time, somebody else saw you

302
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,041
in the Inner Temple.

303
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,458
They say it happened
at 10 PM as well.

304
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,875
[IRIS]
Was it Sister Bikini?

305
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,625
It was. I wasn't in court today,
but I heard about it.

306
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,541
She said she saw you there.
And even talked to you.

307
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,083
If she's telling the truth,

308
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:17,291
the only explanation is
that there were two of you.

309
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,208
If that's a joke,
I don't get it.

310
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,333
How in the world could there
be another one of me?

311
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,791
Well, what about Dahlia?

312
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,291
I found out she was
your twin sister.

313
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,541
And that she was
executed a month ago.

314
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,125
[IRIS]
What of it?

315
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,958
I mean, if she's dead, there's
no way she could have been seen.

316
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:43,125
[PHOENIX] Mm-mm. Things work
a bit differently around here,

317
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,583
don't they?

318
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,958
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

319
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,458
The other "you" who
showed up that night

320
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,458
was your twin sister's spirit.

321
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,708
So Dahlia was, in fact, here.

322
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,166
Yes. 'Cause a spirit
medium channeled her.

323
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,416
[IRIS]
Hmph. You never miss a thing.

324
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,708
It's kind of amazing.

325
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,375
I see. So you knew after all.

326
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,250
But I don't understand why
you didn't say anything sooner.

327
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,250
I've proven myself a traitor.

328
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,541
So I wasn't about to go and get
in my sister's way this time.

329
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,083
[PHOENIX]
What do you mean?

330
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,875
I'm surprised you have to ask.
I mean the fake kidnapping.

331
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,666
Everything that happened
all those years ago.

332
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,375
After that, our lives
would never be the same again.

333
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,750
My sister committed
crime after crime,

334
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,750
and that's why she's dead now.

335
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,333
But I know none of
this would have happened

336
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,916
if I hadn't betrayed her.

337
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,291
Betrayed her, how?

338
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,625
It wasn't a coincidence
that Dusky Bridge was where

339
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,750
the ransom was going
to be handed over.

340
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,416
There was a reason behind it.

341
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,208
Because in the original plan,

342
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,666
I was supposed to be the one
helping her pull it off.

343
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,083
Is that true?

344
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,583
[IRIS] I got too scared
by the whole thing.

345
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,083
And ended up
running away instead.

346
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,375
That's a good thing!

347
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,416
It means you didn't want
to be an accomplice!

348
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,291
Naturally, you wouldn't
want to steal two million

349
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,708
from your own father!

350
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,666
Yeah, but she told me
that he deserved it

351
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,208
for everything he'd done.

352
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,166
Especially for abandoning
our poor mother like that,

353
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,666
because she couldn't be master.

354
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,000
I heard about that.

355
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,708
And about all the
family infighting.

356
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,583
Yes. Thinking
back on it all now,

357
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,750
I realize I should've
helped my sister that day.

358
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,916
[PHOENIX gasps]

359
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,708
Not to be rude,
but I need to concentrate.

360
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,625
[PHOENIX]
Can I ask you one last thing?

361
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,083
[IRIS]
Yes?

362
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,625
Years ago,

363
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,708
right after Dahlia poisoned
that defense attorney's coffee,

364
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,208
she started dating a college
student for several months

365
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,833
so she could use him.

366
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,166
I'm curious. Did she ever
talk about that guy?

367
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,500
[IRIS] Not really, but she
did tell me one thing.

368
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:48,125
She said...
she hated his guts.

369
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,666
[PHOENIX]
Thank you.

370
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,541
Ah, looks good. Yeah.

371
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,500
Hot! Be careful with it, okay?

372
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,291
Thanks, I appreciate it.

373
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:04,875
[PHOENIX]
That looks good.

374
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,083
[gasps]
Mister Nick.

375
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,625
Hey, back off. You can't
just come and steal our taters.

376
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,416
I wouldn't worry.

377
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,833
[BUTZ growls]

378
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,458
Actually... I was hoping to chat
with Pearl for a minute.

379
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,000
You want to talk... to me?

380
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,375
There was a magazine.

381
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,166
A magazine you had that
mentioned the temple.

382
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,750
That's what got Maya
interested in coming here

383
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,500
in the first place, right?

384
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,375
But I wanted to know something.

385
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,666
Did somebody ask
you to show it to her?

386
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,375
[PEARL gasps] Yeah, but how'd
you figure that out?

387
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,041
This was found in the
incinerator by the Inner Temple.

388
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,583
Uh...

389
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,833
It looks like a plan.

390
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,000
A way to carry out
this whole thing.

391
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,125
But somehow it didn't
totally burn up in there.

392
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,666
[PEARL whimpers]

393
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,166
Tell the truth.

394
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,208
You were the spirit medium who
channeled Dahlia Hawthorne

395
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,000
that night, weren't you?

396
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,166
I'm not mad.

397
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,791
But I'm curious
if you actually know

398
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,375
who that person is.

399
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,916
No. I don't.

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You be nice to her! You hear?!

401
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,583
'Cause if not,
I'll tater ya!

402
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,208
I don't want your stupid tater!

403
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,000
I swear! I didn't know
anything about a letter!

404
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,000
No?

405
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,291
There's no proof!

406
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,875
You need proof if you're
gonna accuse someone

407
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,500
of something don't you?

408
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,125
You really didn't know?

409
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,083
Yeah! Show her
the proof, law man!

410
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,583
[PHOENIX] All the pieces
just fell into place.

411
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,666
And now I know exactly how
this whole thing went down.

412
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,833
How 'bout this?
Somebody read that letter,

413
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,541
and they channeled Dahlia's
spirit just like it said.

414
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,291
And whoever did it
was a child. I'm sure.

415
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,666
Huh?

416
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,708
I mean, it's pretty obvious
no adult would've made

417
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,958
a silly little
mistake like that.

418
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,083
[PHOENIX] There was curry
splattered all over that scroll

419
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,041
that hangs in the inner temple.

420
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,291
Come on.
You did that, didn't you?

421
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,041
[PEARL whimpers]
How'd you know?

422
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,541
From your reading lesson.

423
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,708
Remember?

424
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,333
Uh...

425
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,583
[PHOENIX]
"Gravely" and "sunder."

426
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,333
She taught you how to read them.

427
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,708
But she never explained
what they really meant.

428
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,500
"Gravely sunder the Master,

429
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,583
roast her in the
fires of Hades."

430
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,458
Huh? That sounds crazy.

431
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,541
There's your proof.

432
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,750
That work for ya?

433
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,416
"Gravely" sounded like "gravy."

434
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,708
So I got pretty confused
about what to do.

435
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,875
That's why you smeared
curry on that scroll.

436
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:24,125
Because that's the closest thing
you had to gravy, right?

437
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,583
I'm really sorry...

438
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,000
Now this letter.

439
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,833
I have a good idea about
who it was that sent it to you.

440
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,833
It was your mom, wasn't it?

441
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,916
That's why you
followed the instructions.

442
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,375
I felt like I didn't
have any other choice.

443
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,375
That the only way to
honor her final wish,

444
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,375
was to do everything exactly
like the letter said.

445
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,875
It was her "final wish"?

446
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,041
She said that.
She also made it seem like

447
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,750
the plan would be good
for Mystic Maya, too.

448
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,333
Did you ever talk
about it in person?

449
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,041
It was during one
of the times that I went out

450
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,583
to visit her in jail.

451
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,125
She told me to look for
the letter at our house.

452
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,291
[PHOENIX] If she hid it there,
that means all this was planned

453
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,166
before she had
even been arrested.

454
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,916
[PEARL] It's weird. The seal on
the letter had been broken.

455
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Like somebody already
had opened it before I did.

456
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,041
So you don't think you
were the first one to read it?

457
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,333
Yeah.

458
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,375
--[PHOENIX] Hmm...
--[BUTZ] Hmm? It wasn't me!

459
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,041
[PHOENIX sighs]

460
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,875
[PHOENIX] Who else could
have known about this?

461
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,333
And what did they do
with the information?

462
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,958
I know that I'm being
punished for being bad.

463
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,500
That's gotta be the reason
why I lost my powers.

464
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,791
Oh. Like you can't
channel anymore?

465
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,333
No, I can't.

466
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,833
After dinner that night, I never
went up to Ms. Elise's room

467
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,958
to read with her,
like she'd asked.

468
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,000
I was too worried
about Mystic Maya.

469
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,083
I see. You went to
the Inner Temple instead.

470
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,833
The letter said that
I should wait to channel

471
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,791
the spirit, until after they
rang the bell for lights out.

472
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,416
[PHOENIX] Then you called
Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit?

473
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,416
[PEARL] I tried, but I
couldn't make it work!

474
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,708
No spirit came?

475
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,166
No, never. That's not normal.

476
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,708
I was really surprised.

477
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,625
But I went ahead and followed
the letter as best I could.

478
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,041
[PHOENIX] But you got
confused and splattered

479
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,833
the curry on the scroll.

480
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,333
[PEARL]
That's right.

481
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,125
I kept trying over and over
again to summon the spirit.

482
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,833
But nothing I did ever worked.

483
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,208
Could there be
any other reason why

484
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,791
you couldn't channel her?

485
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,666
I mean besides the
mix-up with the curry?

486
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,833
Well, I can think of one thing.

487
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,208
There's a small possibility that
another medium had already

488
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,625
channeled her spirit.

489
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,708
Everybody only
has one, you know.

490
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,416
[PHOENIX]
I never thought of that.

491
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,416
Did somebody really get
to Dahlia's spirit first?

492
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,541
Mystic Maya's
gonna be okay, right?

493
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,875
I'm scared. But I know
Mother is watching over her.

494
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,583
Yeah. I'm sure she is.

495
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:44,333
[MORGAN] My dear little Pearl,
you've made your mother proud.

496
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,208
It's best you don't know
about all the ugliness,

497
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,375
but now, the main family
is out of the way.

498
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,750
And at last, you can
assume your rightful place

499
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,916
as master of the Fey clan.

500
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:28,958
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

501
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,916
This entire debacle
was the direct result

502
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,416
of a succession fight between
the Kurain school's families.

503
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
And of course, I'm involved
in a strange way,

504
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,250
because of my past
connection to Dahlia.

505
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:43,000
This trial will be my chance
to prove that Iris is innocent!

506
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,500
Her confession just
doesn't sit right with me.

507
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,583
There's clearly
something missing!

508
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,166
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

509
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,458
Next episode: "Bridge
to the Turnabout - 5th Trial"!

510
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,916
Take that!
