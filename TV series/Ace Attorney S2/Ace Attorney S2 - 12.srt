00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,458
[PHOENIX] A fugitive by the name
of Avery Richman has hijacked

2
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,458
the Silver Star Express.

3
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,750
His demand?

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,625
A retrial of the American
murder case in which

5
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,458
he was found guilty.

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,000
I happened to be on this train,

7
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,708
and have taken the role
of defense lawyer

8
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,750
in this unprecedented trial.

9
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,250
But in a twist of events,

10
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,250
a passenger who could have
been a crucial witness

11
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,625
has been murdered.

12
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,875
And what's more, his corpse
disappeared the minute

13
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,458
we took our eyes off it.

14
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,291
All right.

15
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,166
Court is now back in session
for the trial of Avery Richman.

16
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,250
There's nothing else to be said.

17
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,000
Mr. Gale was murdered,
and he vanished.

18
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,375
There is no other
new testimony to hear.

Gale was our last hope.

21
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,250
And he's gone.

23
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,666
How can this be happening?

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,625
Oh, Mr. Richman.

[RICHMAN]
What is this?

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,875
I am so sorry, my King!

That's right, I know
everything that's goin' on!

Know why?

32
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,250
Because I'm a detective,
Dick Gumshoe!

00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,583
A policeman?

34
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,750
[GUMSHOE] And Gale Gaelic's
body didn't vanish!

35
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,041
Wait, did you find it?

36
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,375
Sure did. Or, it found us!

37
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,291
Whoa! How'd it get there?

38
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,625
What happened?

39
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,208
Unless it teleported
somehow, I don't know.

40
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,416
Say what? It couldn't be magic!

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,791
Obviously. But the
fact is, it did show up here.

42
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,250
Fell through the ceiling!

43
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,333
The ceiling?

44
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,083
Also, whaddya
mean the body vanished?

but I'm in Car 3 and it's
connected to the engine!

50
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,333
Our rooms
and the dining car

51
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,541
completely disappeared!

00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,791
What? Seriously?

53
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,875
[MAYA]
It's not like we derailed.

54
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,375
What a night!

55
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,666
First whole cars disappear,
then a missing corpse falls

56
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,708
from the ceiling,
plus, that human soul.

57
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,791
A soul?

I know it sounds crazy.

61
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,250
But it happened when
the lights went out.

62
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,833
In the distance, I saw a raging
flame drifting out there

63
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,958
in the darkness.

64
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,833
A soul? That's rich.

65
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,916
I saw what I saw!

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,750
A flame when
the lights went out.

[gasps]
Hold on a minute!

68
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,333
There was a fire in here
when that happened!

69
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,541
[gasps]
Yeah, he could have seen that.

70
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,458
What? You guys saw a soul, too?

71
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,791
No. Not a soul,
but... a birthday cake.

What do you
mean a birthday cake?

Your Honor. Just after 8,
a small birthday celebration

74
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,500
was held here in the dining car.

Yes. I remember the bump.

92
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,125
A "raging flame in the dark."

93
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,708
That fire was big enough
to be seen at a distance.

94
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,208
Ridiculous!

the dining car from Car 3?

96
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,458
[PHOENIX]
I'm getting to that.

97
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,958
If what Dick says is true,
what he saw could explain

98
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,208
the disappearance
of our cars, as well.

99
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,666
Then please, continue.

100
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,625
It's not that the cars vanished.

101
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,333
It's that they were rearranged.

102
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,333
[JUDGE]
What? Rearranged?

103
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,958
[PHOENIX] This railroad used
to be a small local line.

104
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,375
And the old freight stations
that were used for transporting

105
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,750
lumber still dot the tracks.

106
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,458
First, the lights
were turned off,

107
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,291
making it impossible
for us to see what was

108
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,916
about to happen to us.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,500
Second, the train was
slowed down before it reached

110
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,791
a predetermined junction.

111
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,541
And the couplings in front of
Cars 1 and 3 were disconnected.

112
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,166
[MAYA]
The train split up!

113
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,333
[PHOENIX] This was when
the fire broke out,

114
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,625
and that's what Gumshoe saw.

115
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,791
Our cars running along
a parallel freight line.

116
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,333
And then...

117
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,166
By no small coincidence, we
ended up behind the third car.

118
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,333
So when we all
reached the junction...

119
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,833
[MAYA]
We switched places!

120
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,791
Finally, the Silver Star
came to a halt.

121
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,291
But why? Other than
to let you board this train,

122
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,708
there was one other
reason for the standstill.

123
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,250
Am I on the right track?

124
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,250
Yes.

125
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,166
We needed to stop to reconnect
the couplings between the cars,

126
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,875
as you surmised.

127
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,083
I'm deeply impressed
by your deductive skills.

128
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,125
I knew I picked
the right lawyer.

129
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,166
Wait, you really
rearranged the cars?!

130
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,166
That's nuts.
Why do something so crazy?

131
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,583
You'll find out soon.

132
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,458
Just the whim of a rich man?

133
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,500
I knew it would be
something asinine.

134
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,416
Well. That asinine
decision helps us.

135
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,041
What do you mean?

136
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,125
[PHOENIX]
Thanks to the shuffle.

137
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,708
I've identified who killed Gale.

138
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,583
[gasps]

139
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,500
And that is?

140
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,583
Can't you figure it
out yourself?

141
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,333
If the body before
Gumshoe is the real Gale,

142
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,958
then the only possible
explanation is the one we saw

143
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,125
before was actually a fake.

144
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,166
[MAYA gasps]

145
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,916
Gale died in Car 3.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,791
And... the killer
hid his body in

147
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,916
the ceiling where it
shouldn't have been found!

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,625
Wait, we're standing
in a crime scene?

149
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,708
[REGINA] The only reason the
corpse fell out of the ceiling

150
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,041
is 'cause of that
lightning strike.

151
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,458
That makes sense.

152
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,750
And I'm sure the killer didn't
expect that to happen.

153
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,125
[GUMSHOE]
So then...

154
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,458
When exactly was
this man murdered?

155
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,958
Good question.

156
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,541
It had to have been before
the cars were rearranged,

157
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,666
most likely.

158
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,791
No way! I've been here
the entire time!

159
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,000
There was a period
when nobody was

160
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,458
in the car, remember?

161
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,041
That's right! Dinnertime!

162
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,041
Yeah!

163
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,625
Of course!

[PHOENIX]
A phony.

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,125
Gale had already been murdered
and hidden in the ceiling

by the time we found it.

All right.

I'm with you this far, but I
can think of one problem.

172
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,625
The victim was a Car 1
passenger, and nobody

173
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,250
passed through the dining
car while we were eating.

174

[PHOENIX] Still, Gale and the
killer must have met there.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,416
[TRISTAN] Nonsense. This court
requires facts, not conjecture.

176
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,750
Now, is there anyone who can
testify the victim went through

177
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,000

the suggested time?

[CYLINDER growls]

Man. I can't blame 'em.

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,875
Nobody would remember everyone
they passed on the train.

If you asked me,
I'd say I dunno!

183
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,291
[PHOENIX] But in this case, just
pointing out the possibility

184
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,458
will be enough, because...

185
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,208
It's clear that there
is only one person

186
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,208
who could have done this!

The killer... is you!

Tristan Turnbull!

The killer is Mr. Turnbull?

How could that be?

This isn't even worth arguing.

[PHOENIX]
It could only have been you.

195
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,791
After hearing the scream,

196
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,250
I ran to the room and
then put out the fire.

197
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,291
Soon after, the body
disappeared.

You were the one who
checked the body back then.

209
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,666
You didn't let us get close to
it and then closed the door

behind you to "preserve
the crime scene."

211

While you were buying
time for him by the door.

212
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,666
The "corpse" took off
the victim's clothes

213
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,583
and stashed them away for later.

214

Then, they hid themselves
behind the door.

No!

And while we stood there
shocked, unbeknownst to us,

220
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,875
the double snuck out
from behind the door.

221
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,875
But... that is such a cliché!

222

And just who
was this accomplice?

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,250
Funny enough.

224
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,916
There was someone who
wasn't nearby when we were

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,375
in the hallway,
but suddenly appeared

226
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,000
as soon as we went inside.

227
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,208
And that someone...

How could you, Rick?

Why would you do this?

[RICK]
I'm terribly sorry, King.

238
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,208
But... I've been cooperating
with American law enforcement

239
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,541
since a year ago.

240
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,625
That explains it.

241
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,041
An entire year? Then...

242
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,500
This fool.

243
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,541
I was offered
a large sum of money.

244
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,791
All I had to do procure a gun
with your fingerprints on it.

245
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,166
The gun? From the first trial!

246
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,416
That's right.

247
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,083
I followed orders,
and a few days later,

248
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,875
Secretary General Cashanova
was shot at the ceremony

249
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,166
and you were arrested!

250
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,708
Then that whole murder
was a setup to frame me?

251
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,583
A man was killed so that I would
be out of their hair?

252
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,833
Yes, and the one
who really shot Cashanova

253
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,541
was Gale Gaelic.

254
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,041
He fired from
near you on purpose.

255
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,500
And then the policemen who
frisked you planted the evidence

256
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,125
in your coat pocket.

257
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,958
They claimed the pistol
I stole for them was

258
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,208
the murder weapon,
but it wasn't.

conspired against him?

myself to tell you.

to cooperate, by Turnbull.

we hijacked the train,

He told me to do as he
said if I didn't want the King

to find out I betrayed him.

270
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,416
It was before the trail began?

271
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,083
Right! Then!

272

I'll need to prepare.

273

[PHOENIX]
And "prepare" you did.

274
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,125
You formulated a plan,
approached Rick, and forced him

to help you pull it off!

...Wright's theory about the
missing corpse was right.

I wonder, do you have
any concrete proof

I cut a deal with Rick?

There's more in here, too.

309
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,750
According to the record, one
year ago, there was a witness

310
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,333
whose summons was
canceled by you personally.

311

That witness's
name was Gale Gaelic!

It was Gale?

313
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,041
The current trial has
made it perfectly clear

that he was quite
the crucial witness.

315

So why, then, did you
deliberately avoid calling him

00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,250
I can't think of
any other reason for it.

325

[PHOENIX] He was afraid
of the truth coming out

Tristan...

328
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,041
That proves you were at the
center of the conspiracy!

329
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,291
During the first trial,
you never actually set foot

in court yourself.

331
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,333
But behind the scenes, you laid
the groundwork to entangle

And who's that?

338
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,208
The chief prosecutor.

339
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,125
The man at the very top of
America's justice system.

[CHIEF PROSECUTOR] Our courts
are built on the foundation

of pursuing justice and

And yet, you've dragged those

You will be

Hold on a moment!

345
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,541
I was told to convict Richman
so he could be thrown

I only did what the

And that's the problem.

A fool who would follow unjust

Funny that you

We spoke to him not long ago,

and he confessed with
little provocation.

He admitted to collusion
and conspiring with

rid of Cashanova altogether.

There was no justice

One year ago,

I came to believe that
you were my enemy.

But it seems I was mistaken.

Hmm.

Very well, then.
It was soon after we departed.

[TRISTAN]
You were invited, too?

379
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,125
I was just as surprised.

380
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,125
But. Somehow, I sense
the hand of God behind this.

381
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,458
What does that mean?

382
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,666
This whole year,
a thought never left my mind.

383
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,375
A nagging feeling that I wasn't
given enough hush money.

384
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,791
Wouldn't you agree?

385
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,375
Are you threatening me?

386
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,666
Being an assassin is
taxing work.

387
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,041
And I've considered switching to
blackmail, so why not start now?

388
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,583
It is a lucrative business.

[TRISTAN] Like him, I, too,
felt the hand of God at play.

390
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,958
It was the perfect
chance to silence him forever.

391
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,208
So I took it.

392
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,458
Then let's talk.

It was around 6 PM.

396
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,125
We went at a time when lots
of people would be going in

397
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,875
and out of the dining car.

398
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,625
Which helped divert
any unwanted attention from us.

399
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,583
And we easily made
it to Car 3.

400
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:16,041
[TRISTAN] Then... In one of
the Car 3 compartments,

401
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,958
I put a knife in his chest.

402
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,041
Yikes. I think it was my room.

403
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,958
[PHOENIX] Finally. You hid
the body in the hallway ceiling.

404
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,250
[TRISTAN] But... I never
could have foreseen

405
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,500
what was about to
happen on this train.

406
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,541
We were hijacked,
and all forced into a trial.

407
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,458
[TRISTAN] If anyone
realized he was missing,

408
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,791
the train would be
searched and the body

409
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,666
would quickly be found.

410
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,416
I had to prevent
that from happening!

411
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,333
So you put on a fanciful
show of the body disappearing

00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,541
in front of people who
could vouch for it.

It was a bid to buy myself time!

When we arrived,
the room was in flames.

What part of your
plan was that exactly?

to set fire to it just before

00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,125
And to accomplish that,
we will correct any mistakes

484
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,291
we have made.

485
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,833
Chief Prosecutor.

486
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,041
You have my sincerest apologies.

487
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,833
We have wronged you.

488
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,250
I give you my word.

489
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,291
We will give you
an honest, fair retrial.

490
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,333
Of course. It'll all be public.

491

[gasps]

492
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,708
Aww, I'm so glad!

493
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,041
Me, too!

494
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,291
I have a feeling Edgeworth
talked him into that.

495
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,875
Now, we save him.

496
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,666
Roger! I hope you're ready to
spring into action, Vanguard!

497
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,208
[GUMSHOE]
You got it! I'm at the controls!

498
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,958
We're catching up!

499
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,333
'Kay. Come on!

[MAYA grunts]

501
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,166
Clear! Full speed ahead!

502
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,666
Roger that! Max speed comin' up!

Check it out!

505
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:41,333
Hey! First of the year.

506
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:46,000
[RICHMAN] How beautiful.
What an incredible sunrise.

507
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,916
I have never seen one better.

508
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,041
Yeah. Me, either.

509
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,250
Wow.

510
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,708
Today, you embark
on a brand new journey.

511
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,916
[RICHMAN]
Hmm.

[PHOENIX]
Objection!

514
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,125
Five years ago, before
I was an attorney,

515
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,666
I took to the courtroom
for a different reason.

516
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,083
Back then... I was the
accused in a murder case.

517
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,458
And that case was the
reason I first met Mia.

518
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,458
She was still a rookie
attorney at the time,

519
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,916
and the two of us faced off
against a terrifying incident.

520
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,708
But we would soon find
out that even bigger

521
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,875
shadows loomed behind it.

522
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,416
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

523
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,708
Next episode, a one-hour
special: "Turnabout Memories"!

524
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,041
Take that!
