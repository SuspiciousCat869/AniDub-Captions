[MIA] My name is Mia Fey,
attorney-at-law.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,000
And this is the story of the
first time I tried a murder case

12
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,083
as a defense lawyer.

13
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,375
These events transpired
one year before I met

14
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,000
my protégé, Phoenix Wright.

15
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,333
The client was
quite a challenging one.

16
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,041
An escaped death row inmate.

17
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,250

The layers of this trial
would coalesce,

00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,541
forming a much larger picture.

21
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,875
Revealing a shocking
truth I'd carry with me

22
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,916
for the rest of my life.

[MIA] This is my first client,
Terry Fawles.

00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,083
Sentenced to death
five years ago for murder.

34
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,500
He escaped from prison,

35

and now faces
another murder charge.

I'm sorry! Please calm down!

00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,458
[MIA] Two days ago,
his police transport crashed

41
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,500
and he fled the scene.

42
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,083
Eight hours later,
he was recaptured.

43
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:38,291
But in that relatively brief
time, a policewoman was killed.

44
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,083
And once again,
Terry Fawles stands accused.

45
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:45,375
[TERRY] It's a setup.
Just like the last time.

46
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,791
That woman didn't tell
the truth about me.

47
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,208
I had to. I...

48
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:54,083
You had to escape... and
meet up with the policewoman?

49
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,416
[TERRY whimpers]
Yeah. That's the reason

50
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I busted out. But...

Heh. If you wanna build a case,

you'll have to do more
than just stare at the guy

So, this is the

You've got some
impressive guts, Ms. Fey.

62
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,625
I've never seen somebody
take on a death row escapee

as their first client.

Do you not prefer
a strong blend?

No, it's great!

71

I'm just surprised they sent the

even asked for an identifier.

about you, Mister Edgeworth.

[JUDGE 204A]
Well, Prosecutor Edgeworth.

112
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,833
Your opening statement, please.

113
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,166
Just five years ago,
this man, the defendant

114
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,833
Terry Fawles, was
sentenced to death.

115
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,416
His crimes were heinous.

116
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Kidnapping, extortion, and the
murder of a 14 year-old girl,

117
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,166
whose life he took by
throwing her from a bridge.

118
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,541
Her body was
flung into Eagle River,

119
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,583
which is well known for
its powerful current.

120
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,958
A large percentage of
the bodies that have fallen in

121
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,958
have never been recovered.

122
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,250
A truly heinous crime, indeed.

123
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,375
The deciding
factor in that case...

124
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,333
...was the testimony
of a witness.

125
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,958
[TERRY whimpers]

126
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,875
[MILES] It was the officer
who made the arrest.

127
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,041
She confronted him at
the scene of the crime.

128
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,333
And her recounting of that
moment is what sealed his fate.

129
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,375
This monster took
that little girl hostage.

130
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,458
And then just threw
her in the river!

131
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,250
[TERRY whimpers]

132
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,958
[MIA] So her account
is what sealed the deal.

133
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,833
What put him on death row.

134
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,291
[MILES]
Sadly, she was his next victim.

135
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,958
The same brave woman
who refused to back down.

136
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,375
Police Sergeant
Valerie Hawthorne.

137
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,833
Her courage and strong
sense of moral obligation

138
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,208
is what put him away.
So when he escaped...

139
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,541
...he was hell-bent
on getting revenge!

140
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,250
It's obvious--
this defendant is guilty.

141
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,916
[MIA gasps]
Wha--?! Hold on, Your Honor!

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,875
A-As the defense, I, uh...

143
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,208
I demand a cross-examination!

144
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,791
[JUDGE 204A] Oh, I suppose
youngsters these days

145
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,083
don't know when to give up.

146
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,458
I blame naivete, the
glaring inexperience of youth.

147
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,208
[MIA] What the hell? You're
younger than me, you know?

148
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,500
Very well. In that case,

149
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,791
I call the detective
overseeing the investigation

150
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,750
to take the stand.

151
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,875
Please state
your name and occupation.

Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe,
and I'm a homicidal--

down at the precinct.

but now... "Big" Dick is
standing tall as a proud member

of the detective unit!

157
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,125
I don't believe that's relevant.

158
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,916
Detective.
Your testimony, please.

Yes, Your Majesty!

160
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,833
[MIA]
This is it! A real trial.

161
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:39,500
[DIEGO] Listen closely, kid.
You'll need your full attention.

162
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,541
Or you may find
yourself ground up...

163
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,750
[slurps]
...and then roasted by justice.

164
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,375
[MIA growls]

165
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,750
[GUMSHOE clears throat]
The day of the incident,

166
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,916
the defendant called the victim.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,250
He asked Officer Hawthorne
if she'd meet with him.

168
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,250
She then went to Dusky
Bridge at the designated time

169
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,333
She jotted down
a memo during the call.

170
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,666
Shown here.

171
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,083
[MIA] The same one Armando
showed me in the lobby.

172
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,125
[GUMSHOE] The two met and
the defendant proceeded to stab

173
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,708
the victim in the back
with a hunting knife.

174
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,250
The wound would prove fatal.

175
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,666
[GUMSHOE] He then stuffed her
body into the trunk of his car

176
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,125
and attempted to make a getaway.

177
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,708
But he was quickly
arrested at a police checkpoint.

178
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,333
Here's a photograph
of the victim's body.

179
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,166
You can clearly see the murder
weapon still lodged in her back.

180
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,833
It's all pretty cut and dried.

181
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,500
[CROWD whispering]

182
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,000
All right, defense.
Your witness.

183
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,750
--[MIA gasps]
--[JUDGE 204A] Defense?

184
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,250
Of course! Yep, coming right up!

185
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,791
[DIEGO]
Easy, easy.

186
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,000
Keep trembling like
that and you're gonna

187
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,541
make me spill my jitter juice.

188
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,791
[MIA]
I'm just so excited!

189
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,833
So the defendant,
Mister Fawles, had a car?

190
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,416
[GUMSHOE]
Well, yeah.

191
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,958
I mean, the murder happened on a
bridge way up in the mountains.

192
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,625
It was a stolen car, of course.

193
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,583
A bridge up in the mountains?

194
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,458
Why would they be meeting there?

195
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,083
The location's significant.

196
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,583
Because it factored
heavily in the earlier case.

197
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,291
[JUDGE 204A]
In what way, exactly?

198
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,791
It's the crime scene.

199
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,708
The place he murdered his
young hostage five years ago.

200
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,291
And was subsequently apprehended
by officer Hawthorne.

201
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,541
This also transpired
on Dusky Bridge.

202
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,333
Heh. You're saying he was
looking to have a reunion

203
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,083
at their special place, right?

204
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,375
[GUMSHOE] This photograph was
taken moments before the crime.

205
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,916
You can clearly see the two of
them facing off on the bridge!

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,916
[gasps]

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,458
What a pretty picture.

208
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:33,916
Huh, Fey? Hmph. I'd say the
evidence is strong and bitter.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,666
However, there's an odd taste.

210
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,750
Something that leaves
me feeling kinda cold.

211
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,458
Uh... Odd taste?

212
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,916
[MIA gasps]
Oh. I see!

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,541
That's good. Now.

214
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,291
Let's sample that signature
roast of the truth.

215
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,416
Detective!

216
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,958
Yes, ma'am?

217
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,458
You described this
photo as "cut and dried."

218
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,791
That's what you said, right?

219
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,583
[GUMSHOE]
Yeah, that sounds like me!

220
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,500
Look here. At the memo
the victim had written.

221
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,625
"Wear white scarf
for identification."

222
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,250
If she followed all
the instructions,

223
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,458
she must've been
wearing a white scarf.

224
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,166
Except... Upon
further examination.

225

[CROWD gasping]

226
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,708
[GUMSHOE] What the...?!
I don't see a scarf!

227
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,791
Yes! So...

228
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,791
Uh, that means...

229
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,250
Something's messed up!

[CROWD gasping]

232
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,500
[DIEGO] I think you meant to
say, there's a "contradiction."

233
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,833
[MILES] Could this be the
scarf you're looking for,

234
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,291
by any chance?

235
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,500
Wait! Where the
hell d'ya find that?

236
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,375
On Dusky Bridge, of course.

237
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,458
It was the first place I looked.

238
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,000
[GUMSHOE] I don't get why
you wouldn't tell me about it!

[MIA]
Something feels wrong here.

240
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,250
Did the prosecutor
hide it on purpose?

241
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,291
It's not exactly white,
as the defendant had requested.

242
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,833
but the victim likely
thought it was close enough.

243
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,625
But it is clearly shown
in this photograph.

244
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,208
As she tried to
fight off her killer,

245
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,708
it slipped from her neck.

246
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm quite shocked...
the defense overlooked it!

Good. I think
we need to refocus.

Maybe listen to
some new testimony.

257
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,750
What? New testimony?

258

From whom?

We'll have to find that witness.

Can you produce
the individual who took it?

[GUMSHOE]
Huh? I... Well, uh...

266
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,166
The photograph in question,
was taken by a third party.

Can you tell me why they
haven't been summoned?

269
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,958
If there was in fact
a witness to this crime,

270
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,875
the defense demands they
provide sworn testimony!

[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

no desire to hide the witness

Mm-hmm...

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,791
Is it accurate
to state you're the one

294
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,125
who took this photo?

295
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,041
[MELISSA] Um... Excuse me,
but who might you be?

00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,250
Oh. I'm the defense lawyer.

[MELISSA] Of course.
I'd be more than happy to.

303
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,708
[MELISSA] That day... I'd
taken my camera and tripod

304
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,458
to this charming, flowery,
little meadow that also had

305
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,166
a view of the bridge.

306
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,000
[MELISSA] Using the timer, I took
some cute pictures of myself

Hmm?

[MELISSA] I couldn't help
but notice there was a man

and a woman having
an encounter on the bridge.

My interest was piqued,
but as I watched them,

314
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,625
they began to scuffle
and tussle with each other.

00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,000
[MELISSA] Miss Victim tried
to skedaddle out of there,

317
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,666
and rushed past Mister Killer.

318
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,208
As her back was to him,
he followed her

319
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,666
and gored her like a bull!

320
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,625
[screams]

321
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,291
[MELISSA] Then, big
Mister Killer picked up

322
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,500
poor Miss Victim's cadaver
and carried it off the bridge.

323
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,541
[MELISSA]
From what I understand,

324
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,625
he hid it in the trunk
of this automobile

325
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,458
like it was some kind of
refuse and fled the scene.

326
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,791
When I finally returned
to my senses,

327
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,875
I telephoned the boys in blue.

328
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,000
[JUDGE 204A] Hmm.
Witnessing such violence

329
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,583
must've been traumatizing.

330
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,375
[MELISSA]
It's true. I feared my little

331
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,416
heart would go pitter-patter
right out of my chest.

332
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,875
[JUDGE 204A]
Mm. You poor delicate flower.

333
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,083
If her testimony
is allowed to stand,

334
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,166
we'll be burned.

335
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,791
Oh, no!

336
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,458
[MIA]
Okay, Mia, time to fight back.

337
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,666
[MIA] You claim the killer
picked up the victim's body

338
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,833
and carried her off.
Are you absolutely certain?

339
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,041
Yes.

340
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,500
[MIA] Hmm, it's rather odd,
don't you think?

341
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,958
Huh?

342
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,791
[MIA] I mean, considering
the river under the bridge.

343
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,250
If he wanted to hide it, why not
just throw it into the current?

344
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,458
[gasps]

345
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,958
In fact... This same
man was proven guilty

346
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,666
of doing exactly that
only five years ago!

347
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,000
[gasps]

348
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,791
[MIA] So why would he choose
to carry a dead body

349
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,000
all the way to
his car this time?

350
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,166
It doesn't make sense!

351
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,500
[MELISSA]
Uh... Well, I...

352
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,291
His judgment is not in question!

353
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,291
He is being tried here
today for his brutal actions!

354
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,958
She did not read his mind,

355
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,083
but she did see him
kill that woman!

356
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,458
Yes, without a doubt.

357
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,125
I saw him do it!

358
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,208
He carried her off, and then
he broke into the trunk

359
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,541
of the car where
hid her lifeless body!

360
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,833
[MIA gasps]

361
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,291
That would impossible!

362
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,458
Uh, what do you mean by that?

363
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,583
This is one of your
photos from that day.

364
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,500
I ask you to look carefully.

365
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,416
Notice that the end
of the bridge is hidden

366
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,416
behind this outcropping.

367
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,166
Which means from where
you were standing...

368
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,625
...you couldn't have seen
him breaking into that car!

369
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,291
[wails]

370
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,791
If you didn't witness it,

371
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,583
then explain how you know
about that specific detail!

372
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,416
Logically, there's only one
answer that would make sense.

373
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,791
[MELISSA whimpers]

374
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,250
[MIA] The person who placed
officer Hawthorne's body

375
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,583
in the trunk of that car...

376
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,125
...was the witness,
Melissa Foster!

377
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,333
[JUDGE 204A] Hold on.
What reason would she have

378
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,416
to hide the body?

379
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,333
[MILES]
Objection!

380
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,166
There's no way that
she was involved!

381
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,458
She wasn't present
at the actual scene!

382
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,958
Have you forgotten?

383
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,833
She took this photograph exactly
when the murder happened!

384
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,041
It seems to me
you have forgotten

385
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,583
the witness' testimony.

386
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,458
She was using
a tripod and a timer.

387
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,791
[MILES gasps]

388
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,125
Therefore... the camera
could've taken the picture

389
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,375
with or without her
behind the lens.

390
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,541
[MILES growls] Okay. But why
would she do all that?

391
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,666
[MIA] Because she murdered
Valerie Hawthorne,

392
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,458
and then hid the
body in the trunk.

393
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,250
What? I would never.

394
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,958
This would also
explain why the body

395
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,416
was not dumped in the river.

396
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,375
It was all a plot to
frame Mister Fawles!

397
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,458
[MELISSA gasps, screams]

398
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,958
[JUDGE 204A] Wait a minute!
The witness is the real killer?

399
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,875
It just don't make no sense!

400
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,125
What's wrong with that?

401
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,583
[TERRY]
Well... What happened was...

402
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,458
I got in that car
and drove away,

403
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,916
right after I met the lady.

404
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,708
So there wasn't
no time to kill her

405
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,375
and put her in the trunk.

406
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,916
I see. Which would
imply that the killer

407
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,875
hid the victim's body in
the trunk before you two

408
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,041
met on the bridge.

409
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,125
Further proving
that you were framed.

Objection!

00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,291
This is asinine!

Everyone here can
clearly see that the victim

00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,416
is in the photograph!

414
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,375
Which means Valerie
Hawthorne was, indeed,

415
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,333
alive when it was taken!

416
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,000
Objection!

00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,541
[MILES groans]

418
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,208
[MIA] Mister Edgeworth,
are you unwilling

419
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,416
or unable to understand?

420
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,750
[MILES gasps]

421
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,166
By the time my client
had arrived at the bridge,

422
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,083
the victim was dead and
her body had been hidden.

423
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,250
Ergo, the person
in the photograph

424
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,125
was not Valerie Hawthorne.

425
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,875
[MILES] Absurd! If not her,
who else could it have been?

That should be obvious.

[JUDGE 204A] You think
she was posing as the victim?

wasn't it, Miss Foster?

You staged this.

That's a lie! It's preposterous!

look like Miss Victim?

[MIA] Mister Fawles
had trouble remembering

the victim's appearance.

441
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,708
That's why he needed the
scarf as a way to identify her.

00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,750
Correct?

Uh, yeah. I forgot her face.

00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,833
Yep. And I'm
actually surprised

475
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,375
that this bit of info
didn't come up sooner.

476
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,666
Dahlia Hawthorne...
was the victim's younger sister.

477
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,666
[JUDGE 204A]
What?

478
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,250
She was?

479
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,833
[MIA] It did strike me as
extremely risky to fire

480
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,333
at someone holding a hostage.

481
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,500
And that was her sister.

482
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,000
[gasps] That file,
is that what I think it is?

483
00:20:56,083 --> 00:21:00,333
This? It's all about Mr. Fawles'
previous murder trial.

484
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,166
I thought the key
to solving this current case

485
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,291
was probably somewhere in here.

486
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,500
All we had to do
was look for it.

487
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,916
Objection!

488
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The name of your client's
last victim is irrelevant!

489
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,500
It has absolutely nothing
to do with this case!

490
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,208
[DIEGO]
I just have to wonder...

491
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,000
Did she really die?

492
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,833
What are you getting at here?

493
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,208
This says...

494
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,250
Five years ago on that
same rickety bridge,

495
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,166
the then 14 year-old
Dahlia Hawthorne

496
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,875
fell into the river and
her body was never found.

497
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,625
--[gasps]
--Is that so?

498
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,125
Sadly...

499
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,875
...she disappeared from the
world, leaving nary a trace.

500
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,083
[CROWD murmuring]

501
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,000
[MIA gasps]

502
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,541
[MIA]
No, it can't be.

503
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,750
[DIEGO]
She was 14 at the time.

504
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,333
Which means that if
she were still alive...

505
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,291
...she'd be around your age.

506
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,541
[gasps]

507
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,583
Tell the truth. Who are you?

508
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,041
What are you hiding?

509
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,708
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

510
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,666
In order to prove that
her client was innocent.

511
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,583
Mia had to unravel
the mystery surrounding

512
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,291
his previous murder conviction.

513
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,541
What really happened on
that bridge five years ago?

514
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,458
Exactly who is this
mysterious Melissa Foster?

515
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,000
And what was Fawles' true
motivation that would lead him

516
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,875
to kill Valerie Hawthorne?

517
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,833
What will be revealed
when we shine a light

518
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,416
into this darkness?

519
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,916
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

Beginnings - Last Trial"!
