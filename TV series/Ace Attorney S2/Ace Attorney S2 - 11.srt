00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,791
[PHOENIX] December 31st:
Maya and I have been invited

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,208
to ring in the New Year
with a luxurious trip on

3
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,125
the maiden voyage of a
one-of-a-kind railway liner.

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,666
Now. The moment you've
been waiting for.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,250
We're proud to bring you the
ultimate in first-class travel.

6
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,166
Ladies and gentlemen.
The Silver Star Express!

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,250
This train is a
labor of love, folks.

8
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,666
Love for the elegance of the
steam-powered locomotive,

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,083
and Japan itself.

10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,500
A gift to our society from
the Goldstruck Republic's

11
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,958
prominent tycoon,
Avery Richman!

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,500
Mr. Richman sends his blessings.

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,958
Sadly, he couldn't be here to
celebrate this occasion with us,

14
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,625
but regardless, we'll be
departing soon, so all aboard!

15
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:52,708
This is so cool!
A luxury choo-choo train!

16
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,750
I think it's all very
nostal-chic.

17
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,500
I think you mean nostal-gic.

18
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,250
Ooh! Come on!

19
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,791
Let's climb on board, Nick!

20
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,208
[GUMSHOE]
Whoa, you two again?

21
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,291
[gasps]

22
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,791
[PHOENIX]
Hello, Detective Gumshoe.

23
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,541
[MAYA]
Hello, judge. Judge?

24
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,541
Hello. Nice day.

25
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,125
We both sent in
a postcard and won a trip!

26
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,916
I'm going on
an all-expenses paid tour

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
of the hot springs up north
on board this old-timey train!

28
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,750
Yeah? We got an invitation!

29
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,750
With a fancy wax seal!

30
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,958
[CONDUCTOR]
All aboard!

31
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,166
[train whistle sounds]

32
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,833
[PHOENIX] What should have
been a fun journey aboard

33
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,666
a luxury express train
turns into a debacle when

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,666
the Silver Star is taken over
by the fugitive Avery Richman.

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,083
His demand?

36
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,500
The retrial of a year-old case
in America that ended in

37
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,625
a jury finding him
to be guilty of murder.

38
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,458
Maya calls
Detective Gumshoe for help

39
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,250
on her walkie talkie,
but it turns out the train car

40
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,291
we're in seems to have
vanished without a trace.

41
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,125
Wherever we are, the
Silver Star has been transformed

42
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,750
into a courtroom on wheels

43
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,833
as a truly unprecedented
trial begins.

44
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,000
If you'd come to order,
court is now in session

45
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,000
for the trial of fugitive,
Avery Richman!

46
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,000
Maya are you still holding up?

47
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:57,041
Yep. And I filled
in Gumshoe, too.

48
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,083
We'll start with
Prosecutor Turnbull.

49
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,208
Have you prepared
an opening statement?

50
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,291
There's something each of
you needs to understand.

51
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,541
The US court system
is completely flawless.

52
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,250
This retrial is nothing
but a waste of our time.

53
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,708
[RICHMAN growls]
If it were really infallible.

54
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,166
I wouldn't have had to resort
to such drastic measures

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,875
to prove my innocence.

56
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,416
Problem is... we're
completely in the dark.

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,916
I know basically nothing
about your conviction.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,833
Yes, that's true.
Please explain the case.

59
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,333
I was not the prosecutor
at his first trial.

60
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,500
But I am an official member

61
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,625
of the United States
Attorney's Office.

62
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,125
Which means I always
have a database

63
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,791
of notable cases with me.

64
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,875
I'll catch you up.

65
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,375
One year ago,

66
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,791
at the All-American Trade
Federation's year-end ceremony,

67
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,583
Secretary-General Benjamin
Cashanova was murdered.

68
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,791
Mr. Cashanova saw
the Goldstruck Republic's

69
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,208
financial might as a threat,
and was trying

70
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,416
to boot it out of
America's economy.

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,750
The accused, Avery Richman,

72
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,291
wouldn't stand for this.

73
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,208
[TRISTAN] Which resulted in the
incident during the ceremony.

74
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,375
[TRISTAN]
This is a map of the venue

75
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,375
where the crime took place.

76
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,916
The red dot is where
the victim was shot.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,541
At the time, he was giving
a year-end speech.

78
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,333
The yellow dot
is the origin of the shot.

79
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,000
Upon hearing the gunshot,

80
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,791
everyone in attendance
looked in the direction

81
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,541
that the sound came from.

82
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,708
They found Avery Richman
standing in the corner.

83
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,250
Officers already on the scene
restrained him immediately.

84
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,083
When they searched Mr. Richman,

85
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,375
they found a pistol within
his interior coat pocket.

86
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,458
The barrel was still quite hot,
thus proving it was used.

87
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,666
And Richman's were the
only prints on the gun.

88
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,291
I swear that I didn't
have a weapon on me that night.

89
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,166
And yet, the police found one.

90
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,041
It's obvious that you carried
the murder weapon.

91
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,083
Not to mention,
you had a strong motive.

92
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,166
[RICHMAN growls]

93
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,708
[PHOENIX grunts]

94
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,166
[JUDGE] Everything does seem
to indicate that the defendant

95
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,416
is in fact the guilty party
in this homicide case.

96
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,083
[TRISTAN]
Naturally.

97
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,666
[PHOENIX] No wonder an American
jury questioned his innocence

98
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,291
and put him away for life.

99
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,708
What about the defense?
What do you make of this?

100
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,291
Well, the pistol gives me pause,

101
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,875
I have my doubts about it.

102
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,250
Yeah, you heard the man.

103
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,875
He says he wasn't
carrying a gun.

104
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,583
That's right.
Not to mention,

105
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,791
there was no way
to sneak a weapon

106
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,125
into that venue.

107
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,500
[TRISTAN] Except as the
ceremony's guest of honor.

108
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,833
You would have been exempted
from security searches.

109
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,291
And besides.

110
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,875
There is no doubt that
the murder weapon

111
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,916
belonged to the defendant.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,458
As you can plainly see,

113
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,666
the pistol is registered
under his name.

114
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,958
Yes, I do admit
that it was my gun.

115
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,000
Although, someone could
have stolen and planted it.

116
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,958
It was a plot to
frame me for murder!

117
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,375
And do you have any proof?

118
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,791
Well. No. Not yet.

119
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,208
[TRISTAN]
Hmph.

120
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,375
This prosecutor's sure not
doing us any favors here.

121
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,166
It appears there's
no need to overturn

122
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,958
the original verdict after all.

123
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,625
[PHOENIX] A-Ah! Your Honor!
Before you decide that,

124
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,541
shouldn't we hear what the
witnesses have to say?

125
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,666
I swear. You attorneys
never know when

126
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,250
to throw in the towel.

127
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,708
[PHOENIX]
Aren't you an attorney yourself?

128
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,750
[PHOENIX] Sir, you were in
attendance at the ceremony

129
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,166
and witnessed the murder?

130
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,750
Yes. Edgar Piston of
the All-American CRY Foundation.

131
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,125
I can't stress enough
how even the smallest detail

132
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,166
could help, so was there
anything odd you noticed

133
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,375
about the incident?

134
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,708
I mentioned
this a year ago, but...

135
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,291
Mr. Cashanova did stop
in the middle of his speech

136
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,833
right before he was shot.

137
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,250
As though he was
taken aback by something.

138
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,125
Oh, really? Any idea why?

139
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,250
[CYLINDER] It must've
been the tray. I'm certain.

140
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,625
[PHOENIX]
And you are?

141
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,583
The name is Allan Cylinder,
member of the Council.

142
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,791
What happened was, a waiter
dropped a tray on the floor

143
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,208
making a clatter right in the
middle of the man's speech.

144
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,750
Well, that's rude.

145
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,666
[CYLINDER] The sound
distracted Mr. Cashanova,

146
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,291
and the very next moment.

147
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,750
Yes, that's right!

148
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,291
I remember the waiter
dropping the tray right

149
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,583
in front of me first.

150
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,000
And then a gunshot
rang out after that.

151
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,750
[PHOENIX] Where did you
hear the shot come from?

152
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,291
While I know
it was close to me,

153
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,208
I can't say where
with any certainty.

154
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,333
Yes, and I was
standing nearby as well.

155
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,083
Seriously, what kind
of waiter drops

156
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,500
a tray in the middle
of an important speech?

157
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,625
These five-star hotels
need better hiring managers.

158

I don't think we should

[BUTTER gasps]

I walked to the table

because the napkins were there.

Not long after,

it was such a terrible fright

that it caused me
to pass out.

Dropping a tray is one thing,

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,500
but there's simply no excuse for
a waiter at a five-star hotel

00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,625
to spill champagne on a guest!

Well, given the man's situation,
it was understandable.

What was his situation?

204
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,416
I remember feeling
sorry for him

205
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,125
because he was waiting
on us with an injured hand.

Injured how? Like it
was all bloody and stuff?

207
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,125
I distinctly recall he was
wearing a bandage as he worked.

208
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,750
It covered his right hand.

Immediately after he spilled
champagne on Mrs. Mytonbred,

00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,875
he ends up in the corner

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,750
he dropped the tray, drawing

We didn't overlook him.

The truth is, we simply
concluded that he had

I know this man.

476
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,291
What's his name?

477
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,625
Um... This is Mr. Gale.

478
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,291
Is he a train attendant?

479
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,416
He's not--Mr. Gale's a passenger
from Car Number 1.

480
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,625
But the thing is,
he should be at the trial in

481
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,666
the dining car right now!

482
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,666
[GUMSHOE]
What's going on?

483
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,333
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

484
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,416
A murder, a missing body,
and the mystery

485
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,333
of the vanishing train cars.

486
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:37,041
As the abnormalities continue
mounting, the trial rumbles on.

487
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,666
But then, Edgeworth
butts in from America!

488
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,458
As the pieces fall into place,
the incident a year ago

489
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,166
connects to the present.

490
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,583
The Turnabout Express finally
rushes toward its conclusion!

491
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,125
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

492
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:53,791
Next episode: "Northward,
Turnabout Express--Last Trial"!

493
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,125
Take that!
