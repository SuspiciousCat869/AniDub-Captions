My name is Phoenix Wright.

And I'm a defense attorney.

No matter the odds,
it's my job to stand up

for those who have no one
else in their corner.

ol' "big" Dick Gumshoe
and his crew was here.

Are you seriously
cleaning the toilet again?

No work, so I gotta
make myself useful somehow.

Oh, wow, that's just pathetic.
Hope I don't end up like you.

[PHOENIX growls]
You might.

00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,458
Especially if you slack off
on your training.

Get off my case.

Hey! I know you've been
playing games all night

you should be trying to
gather up some new clients.

Glad you're here, but what
brings you into the city?

39
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,625
Heh. I thought that
Mystic Maya would've

40
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,041
told you about it by now.

41
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,166
Ah?

42
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,500
"Kurain Village treasures"? Huh.

43
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,208
Yup! Straight from me
and Pearl's hometown!

44
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,291
The exhibition doesn't
actually get started until

45
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,000
next week, but the
promoter was nice enough

46
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,708
to give us some VIP passes
so we could go early.

47
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,041
VIPs!

48
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,958
So I decided to go all out
and dress extra fancy.

49
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,375
Whattaya think?

50
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,500
[PHOENIX] That's, like,
the only thing you ever wear.

51
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,541
Yep, good 'ol Maya Fey.

52
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,750
She's the younger sister
of my friend and mentor,

53
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,833
the late Mia Fey.

54
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,708
I met her a couple of
years ago, and even defended her

55
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,458
when she was falsely accused
of Mia's tragic murder.

56
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,833
They're from Kurain Village,

57
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,791
home of the mysterious
Spirit Channeling technique.

58
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,250
Maya's the daughter
of the Kurain School's master

59
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,083
and is training to become
a spirit medium herself.

60
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,875
Of course, the
precocious little girl

61
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,375
is Pearl Fey.

62
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,583
She's Maya's cousin,

63
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,583
and also a young spirit
medium in training.

64
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,833
The promo poster
looks better than I'd hoped!

65
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,208
They even got a great picture
of the sacred urn!

66
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,666
[gasps]
I still feel bad.

67
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,875
First, I broke the urn,

68
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,791
and then I put it back
together all wrong.

69
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,375
It's fine!

70
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,416
I'm sure Mystic Ami's just happy
to know that you did the best

71
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,708
that you possibly could!

72
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,958
[PHOENIX] A year ago,
while we were investigating

73
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,208
a murder case in Kurain Village,
little Pearl accidentally

74
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,791
shattered the sacred urn that
contains the spirit of Ami Fey,

75
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,208
the school's founder
and protector.

76
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,500
But by breaking the urn,

77
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,791
she unwittingly broke
the case as well.

Masque the Mask?

A criminal mastermind.

A thief that targets
rare treasures.

He's like a ghost, and
no one knows who he really is!

stimulates the tongue,

while the richness
warms the throat!

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,083
Exquisite. Life is
about stimulation.

And not going through all the
highs and lows it can offer.

But, I promise--

is the phantom thief!

Thanks for that. And I'll
try to make things right.

00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,291
You can start by telling us
everything you know

about the crime.

143
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,750
Well, first off, the phantom
thief himself sent us

144
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,291
a calling card of
sorts ten days ago.

145
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,500
[PHOENIX]
What did it say?

146
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,958
[ANDREWS] That he was
planning on stealing

147
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,083
the most valuable piece in
the Kurain Village exhibit.

148
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,333
Guess the urn's more
valuable than it looks, huh?

149
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,875
That urn has Mystic
Ami's spirit inside of it,

150
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,708
which makes it
unbelievably valuable!

151
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,125
Hard to believe.

152
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,750
We had an appraisal
done that discovered

153
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,041
it had zero monetary value.

154
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,458
Zero...?

155
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,333
But I did my best to
polish it and make it look

156
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,791
like it was worth millions!

157
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,583
I think it's quite a beautiful
work of art, honestly!

158
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,208
Aw... Poor Mystic Ami...

Oh, but of course

But what is she
doing over there...?

Something wrong, Ms. Andrews?

[ANDREWS]
Ah? Oh, no.

176
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,666
But the little girl is right,
that's a statue of Ami Fey,

177
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,166
the founder of the
Kurain School's

It was delivered
yesterday afternoon.

Just think about it,
Mystic Maya,

181

someday, you'll take over
the clan and become

Uh. Oh, yeah!

Hmm?

00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,208
[LUKE chuckles]

187
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,083
Wait. Who's this?

188
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,625
Welcome to my little soiree.

189
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,583
A Feast of Chaos!

190
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:36,916
[LUKE chuckles] I see it as
clearly as the nose on my face.

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,583
You do? But what is it?

192
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,125
[LUKE]
Zvarri!

193
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,583
And once again, the truth so
elegantly reveals itself to me.

194
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,000
I see a lawyer
and a spirit medium.

195
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,375
Both but beginners in their
particular professions.

196
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,000
Say what? How could you
know all that just by looking?

197
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,958
[LUKE] How, you ask?
For a skeptical mind,

198
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,291
"how" is as pertinent
a question as "why."

199
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,208
I am a tried and true
traveler of both time and space.

200
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,541
As well as a man who
drifts through dreams.

201
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,250
I might call him a lot of
things, but not any of those.

202
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,208
He's just trying
to put on a show.

203
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:10,125
The poster for the exhibition
had a little blurb about you.

204
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,625
And the attorney's
badge I'm wearing

205
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,666
is kind of a giveaway.

206
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,166
I am Luke Atmey!

207
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,625
A man unto whom some
have bestowed the title.

208
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,208
Ace Detective.

209
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,500
Sounds familiar.

210
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,791
I've seen him on the news,

211
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,000
he was on the "Great People
in Town" segment.

212
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,291
[PHOENIX]
Is that really even a thing?

213
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,750
Seems there's
a plethora of things

214
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,583
you don't know, counselor!
It's quite strange.

215
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,000
Usually, the tales of my
investigative prowess

216
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,875
precede me wherever I go!

217
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,291
Very well.

218
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,958
Please, allow me the pleasure
of enlightening you on

219
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,000
the topic of myself!

220
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,958
If this has not permeated
the particular rock

221
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,166
you're living under,
there is a yin and yang

222
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,375
of good and evil in this city!
I am on the side of light,

223
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,041
while Mask DeMasque
dwells in darkness!

224
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,916
And when his shadow
enshrouds all under its pall,

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,458
I shall turn a spotlight on
that ghostly figure

226
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,625
and expose him to the world!

227
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,875
You get the feeling his
voice is his favorite sound?

228
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,458
[PHOENIX]
Mm-hmm.

229
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,333
[LUKE] I have been personally
pursuing the pseudonymed phantom

230
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,041
since the inception of his
immorality, and thwarted

231
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,125
his latest loathsome larceny
armed only with my intellect

232
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,875
and insatiable
inquisitive ingenuity!

233
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,416
One could argue that
we're two sides of the same coin

234
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,041
buying our way into history.
A rivalry for the ages!

235
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,958
And last night, at 1 AM,
we stood face to face

236
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,333
in the bowels of this building,
engaged in brilliant battle!

237
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,625
[PHOENIX]
So it was 1 AM. Wait.

238
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,416
You mean to tell us that you
were on the premises

239
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,041
when the robbery took place?

00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,041
But of course. You see...

241
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,500
Wherever DeMasque dares
to tread, be assured, Atmey

242
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,166
has already set an elegant trap.

243
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,625
Ah. But the trap was
not elegant enough.

244
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,750
Actually, I allowed him
to escape filled with fantasy.

245

An illusion of victory.

246
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,916
But still, you were
on guard last night. Why?

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,500
The gentlewoman solicited
my services as sentry.

248
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,375
Twenty days ago, in fact,
which was ten full days,

249
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,750
before DeMasque declared
his dastardly designs

250
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,125
to dame Andrews.

251
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,541
She hired you before the
calling card was delivered?

252
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,208
I did. I couldn't
shake the feeling

253
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,791
something bad was
going to happen.

254
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,250
And her premonition
proved to be prescient.

255
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,166
The calling card
arrived soon after.

256
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,291
Indeed!

257
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,958
And since I am an Ace Detective,

258
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,083
I expertly arranged an elegant
trap to ensnare the thief.

259
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,666
If you knew something
was gonna happen,

why not go to the

as the mysterious type.

No, I refuse to believe it!

Why on earth would
he steal an urn?

That's a tough question.

But let me ask you something.
You know, don't you?

377
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,625
About your husband
and Mask DeMasque?

378
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,125
That's no secret.
He's pretty open about it.

379
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,833
I mean, he's practically
DeMasque's biggest fan.

380
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,041
He's a fan?

381
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,583
Oh, definitely.
And he can get carried away.

382
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,458
Wait, would you
clarify that, please?

383
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,125
What do you mean
by "carried away"?

384
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,875
He pretends he's
the phantom thief,

385
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,833
and sometimes,
it's like he believes it.

386
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,666
It's kooky, but so adorable.

So. DeMasque is like his hero.

[DESIRÉE chuckles]
Anyway.

392
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,916
If Ronnie had stolen the urn,
wouldn't he still have it?

393
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,958
I'd think so.

394
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,458
Well. Yeah.
That would make sense.

395

He is odd.

396
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,916
But I would never let him
do anything illegal.

Good to know.
I wouldn't think otherwise.

00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:03,125
Yeah. Fine. Just a peek, then.

475
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,583
All right, little Pearls.

476
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,208
Time to get to sleuthin'!

477
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,958
Yeah, okay.

478
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,333
With all this crazy stuff here,

479
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,166
this has gotta be the
phantom thief's hideout.

480
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,791
[gasps, screams]

481
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,291
[gasps]

482
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,958
Oh, Mystic Maya, are you okay?

483
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,375
Ah?

484
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,125
--[doorbell rings]
--[DESIRÉE] Coming!

485
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,291
[MAYA gasps]

486
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

487
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,833
[gasps]
Why's he here?

488
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,291
[PHOENIX] What is this?
Something smooth and hard.

489
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,708
[gasps]

490
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,791
Ahoy! Is anyone here?

491
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,875
Counselor, this
is quite concerning.

492
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,666
I'm flabbergasted to
find a friend of the law

493
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,250
flagrantly ignoring it.

494
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,750
Uh. I'm sorry about that.

495
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,166
Right. I suppose your
shortage of scruples will be

496
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,041
of service as you
stand on the side of that

497
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,750
sinister scofflaw,
some call DeMasque.

498
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,291
[PHOENIX]
Where did you hear that?

499
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,333
I'll be there at the trial.

500
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,083
Providing my perceptions
to the prosecution.

501
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,166
--[gasps]
--And Zvarri...

502
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,250
This testimony will
take its toll on you.

503
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,375
You miserable minion
of Mask DeMasque.

504
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,125
[sighs]
Minion, eh?

505
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,958
[LUKE chuckles] Although,
I alone am not your adversary.

506
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,416
Tomorrow's trial will
introduce a terrible threat

507
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,041
who will truly thwart
your thriving trajectory.

508
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,541
What do you mean?

509
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,583
[LUKE] A defense's most
fearsome foe is a properly

510
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,958
prepared prosecutor.

511
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,833
You may be used to
Edgeworth's excellence,

512
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,291
but your next enemy
is without equal.

513
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,291
He is correctly called the
most cunning counselor

514
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,500
in the country.
But you may know him as...

515
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,041
...Godot!

516
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:49,708
[GODOT] Hmph. We're to do battle
in this gladiator's arena.

517
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,875
[PHOENIX gasps]

518
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,208
The sole reason

519
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,875
I've returned from
the ghastly depths of Hell.

520
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,958
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

521
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,333
The case of Kurain's stolen
treasure continues as

522
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:34,916
the trial of Ron DeLite,
or Mask DeMasque, begins.

523
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,541
Standing before
me is the resurrected,

524
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,666
undefeated, legendary
prosecutor, Godot!

525
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,583
Something stinks
about this case.

526
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,875
And as usual, Butz is to blame!

527
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,416
But the most offensive
odor oozes out of Atmey,

528
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,416
the demented detective.

529
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,250
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

530
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,291
Next episode: "The Stolen
Turnabout--2nd Trial"!

531
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,500
Take that!
