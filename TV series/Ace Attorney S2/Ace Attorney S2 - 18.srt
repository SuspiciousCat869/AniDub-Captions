1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:09,916
[PHOENIX] Maya signed up for
advanced spiritual training

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,541
at Hazakura Temple up in
the snow-capped mountains,

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,416
and Pearl and I tagged along.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,958
There I met someone who
was strangely familiar.

5
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,458
Her name was Iris and she
was the spitting image

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,958
of Dahlia Hawthorne,
my old flame.

7
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,625
Later that night,
after Maya crossed

8
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,625
the infamous Dusky Bridge
to begin her training,

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,458
all hell broke loose.

10
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,666
Acclaimed children's book
author and illustrator,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,291
Elise Deauxnim, was murdered on
the grounds of the main temple.

12
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,541
Adding to the chaos,

13
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,791
a lightning strike
incinerated Dusky Bridge,

14
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,500
leaving Maya completely stranded
on the other side of the ravine.

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,375
I tried to save her.

16
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,125
[BUTZ]
Nicky!

17
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,791
[PHOENIX screams]

18
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,333
[PHOENIX] When law
enforcement finally arrived,

19
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,708
they arrested Iris
for Elise's murder.

20
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,375
I believe in her innocence,

21
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,041
so I entrusted my old
friend Miles with the case

22
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,750
and my defense attorney's badge.

23
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,958
[MILES]
Although I can't say I'm

24
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,208
enjoying these
frigid temperatures,

25
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:47,166
it is interesting to visit
the site of Dusky Bridge.

26
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,666
[GUMSHOE]
Whoa, Prosecutor Edgeworth!

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,875
[MILES]
Hello, Gumshoe.

28
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,541
It's been too long, sir!

29
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,250
I heard you'd be here, so I
busted out the ol' kneepads

30
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,541
to work this case!

31
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,458
[MILES] Honestly,
I'd expect no less from you.

32
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,833
[GUMSHOE] So rest assured
you'll have "Big" Dick Gumshoe

33
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,750
at your service
whenever you need me!

34
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,708
That so? Appreciate it.

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,041
Full disclosure,

36
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,958
there's something that
I need to tell you first.

37
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,208
[GUMSHOE]
Objection!

38
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,541
You gotta be kidding me, pal!

39
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,500
You're really gonna
defend Sister Iris?!

40
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,958
Yes. It was a shock
to me as well.

41
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,541
[GUMSHOE]
But how can you be a prosecutor

42
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,083
that's not a prosecutor?!

43
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,208
"Prosecutor Edgeworth
standing for the Defense"

44
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,333
makes my brain hurt!

45
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,791
It's like a crime
against nature!

46
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,958
Regardless, I'll need
a briefing from you.

47
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,416
Uh--

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,666
But a cop giving the defense
that kind of inside scoop

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,291
could get into some murky
territory, ethically speaking.

50
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,000
[MILES]
Don't let that get in your way.

51
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,208
All you have to do is leak it to
me without telling anyone else.

52
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,291
[GUMSHOE]
Hmm...

53
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,875
I'll be leakier than
a discount diaper!

54
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,625
Just... be discrete.

55
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,916
So, as I understand it,

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,875
Maya Fey is stuck in a temple
on the other side of this gorge.

57
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,916
[GUMSHOE] Yeah, and with all
this wind whippin' around,

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
an aerial extraction's
off the table.

59
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,166
She's there till tomorrow
at the very least.

60
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,541
In this bitter cold.

61
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,416
I hope she's okay.

62
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,666
I'm curious.

63
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,083
Do you know what caused
the bridge to burn?

64
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,625
[GUMSHOE]
It was a lightning bolt.

65
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:21,041
After it quit snowing, there was
some kinda electrical storm.

66
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,583
Completely fried the bridge.

67
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,708
[MILES] Looks like there's
another building that way.

68
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,958
[GUMSHOE]
All right, pal.

69
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,500
We should head over
to the main temple

70
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,625
and see what the
eyewitness has to say.

71
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,791
[MILES gasps]

72
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,583
An eyewitness? Really?

73
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,333
Yep! The Bikini lady saw it all.

74
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,958
[MILES]
O...kay...

75
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,625
[MILES] Well, I don't
see a bikini anywhere.

76
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,500
I know I'm probably
not what you expected,

77
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,083
but I gotta bundle it up
for the cold weather.

78
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,208
Come back this summer.

79
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,000
I shoulda made it clear we'd
be talkin' to Sister Bikini,

80
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,375
the head nun, but I totally
thought the same thing.

81
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,000
Details like that are
important, Detective.

82
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,875
And perhaps you should
take this as a clue

83
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,791
to why you have
never gotten a raise.

84
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,458
You're right about that, sir.

85
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,875
Sister.

86
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,833
Can you tell me what
happened last night?

87
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,833
I took the trainee over
to the Inner Temple,

88
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,375
where she'd be doing
her spiritual exercises.

89
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,750
By "trainee" you mean Maya Fey?

90
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,833
[BIKINI]
Yep.

91
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,416
The training lasts
all night long

92
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,875
and the head nun has to be there

93
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,833
to observe throughout
the process.

94
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,458
[MILES]
So you're there all night.

95
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,500
But didn't the incident occur
over here in the courtyard?

96
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,083
[sighs]

97
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,500
I did have to leave
my post for a bit,

98
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,416
but Iris took over for me.

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,041
So Iris was there?

100
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,333
[BIKINI] My lower back's
been giving me trouble.

101
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,291
Iris came to see
how I was holding up

102
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,375
and told me she'd sub in for me

103
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,833
so I could get some
decent rest in my own room.

104
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,666
And then at 10 PM I rang
the bell for lights out.

105
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,083
After that, I was in my room
until I heard all the commotion.

106
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,625
I headed back to
the Inner Temple

107
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,583
to check on things after a bit

108
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,625
and that's when I saw
it in the courtyard!

109
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,125
What did you see?

110
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,500
It was like it was something
straight out of a nightmare!

111
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,333
[BIKINI whimpers]

112
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,166
No... I can't...

113
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,666
I can't even say it!

114
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,500
What?

115
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,125
[BIKINI wails]

116
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,833
[BIKINI]
Iris... She...

117
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,958
Are you saying Iris
was in the courtyard?

118
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,291
I saw her with my own eyes!

119
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:16,666
How could that gentle girl
do something so horrific?!

120
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,583
I screamed bloody murder
and then passed out.

121
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:24,083
I only came to when that spiky-
haired man ran across my belly.

122
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,333
[MILES] That corroborates
Wright's story.

123
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,375
And she doesn't
appear to be lying.

124
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,583
[BIKINI cries, blows nose]

125
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,166
[GUMSHOE]
Ew, that's disgusting!

126
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,166
Is there anything else
you'd like to mention?

127
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,500
Yes, come to think of
it, there is something.

128
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,291
I have no idea where
Pearl ran off to!

129
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,875
Who might that be?

130
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,333
A sweetheart of a little girl
who came here with the trainee.

131
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,041
I haven't seen her all day,

132
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,791
but I heard she went up to
Elise's room last night.

133
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,291
You mean the victim?

134
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,375
[sobs] It's all because...

135
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,708
This happened because
of my creaky old back!

136
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,708
[BIKINI wailing]

137
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:07,083
I got a search together
for little Pearl Fey.

138
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,416
Good work.

139
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,916
So the crime scene--

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,250
We took the body, of course,

141
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,666
but everything else is
practically untouched.

142
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,041
[MILES]
That's the murder weapon?

143
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,916
[GUMSHOE] Seven-pointed sword,
the "Shi-something."

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,750
[MILES]
Any info on the victim?

145
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,083
Yessir.

146
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,875
All we know is that she
was a picture book author

147
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,583
who went by Elise Deauxnim.

148
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,458
Don't know her real
name or much else

149
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,500
besides she won
an award last year.

150
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,541
That kind of privacy
is rare these days.

151
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,958
[GUMSHOE]
Time of death is estimated

152
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,625
between 10 and 11 PM last night.

153
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,458
The cause is being
ruled as blood loss

154
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,500
resulting from a
stab to the back.

155
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,750
That poor woman.

156
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,750
And you should probably
know the victim's body

157
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,166
was practically covered
head to toe with bruises!

158
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,000
[MILES]
Really?

159
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:46,958
Yeah.

160
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,166
They seem to be consistent

161
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,125
with falling out of a
second-story window.

162
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,916
[MILES] Like the one in
the room above us, correct?

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,208
Which just so happens
to be the exact room

164
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,375
the victim was
staying in last night!

165
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,875
[MILES]
Interesting.

166
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,958
Leads me to believe she may
have been pushed from there

167
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,125
and then stabbed with the sword.

168
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,375
What's that?

169
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,791
The victim's fingerprints
were all over it,

170
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,125
so we're guessing it's
some kind of cane she used.

171
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,125
Oh, speaking of fingerprints.

172
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,708
Yes, what?

173
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,166
[GUMSHOE] That crazy sword,
the murder weapon,

174
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,458
had the accused's
fingerprints on it, too.

175
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,458
That sort of evidence
will be difficult to refute.

176
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,083
Whoops, it totally
slipped my mind

177
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,708
that you're the
defense, Prosecutor.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,625
[MILES] Things definitely
seem desperate right now.

179
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,083
Is this how Wright felt
every time he stood in court

180
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,541
for one of his clients?

181
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,083
You weren't kidding
when you said

182
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,833
you're gonna be the
defense attorney, were ya?

183
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,958
No.

184
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,416
But you're a pretty
famous prosecutor,

185
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,875
so won't that be a problem

186
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,000
when they see you walking
into the courtroom tomorrow?

187
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,250
[MILES]
I realize that,

188
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,375
which is precisely the
reason why I arranged

189
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,791
to have a different judge
presiding over this case.

190
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,458
[GUMSHOE]
Okay, well, we've been waiting

191
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,833
for Godot to get back to us,

192
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,000
'cause he's supposed
to be the prosecutor.

193
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,333
Not a problem.

194
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,708
I've made arrangements
for a prosecutor as well.

195
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,333
[GUMSHOE stammers]

196
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,833
[MILES]
Problem?

197
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,416
Nope, that's just the sound
of my mind being blown away

198
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,333
by how amazing you are!

199
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,791
[sighs]

200
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,416
Let's go.

201
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,166
[GUMSHOE]
Crazy, I didn't even know

202
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,250
there was a shack over here.

203
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,125
[BUTZ]
I knew you'd come.

204
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
Edgy boy.

205
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,458
Hello, Larry.

206
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,541
You took your time.
What've you been doing?

207
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,083
[MILES] I should be
asking you that question.

208
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:32,958
Huh?

209
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,416
I'm saying I don't understand

210
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,458
why you're even here
in the first place.

211
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,000
Come on, bro!

212
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,750
I'm an artist, so I'm working on
some snowy landscape pieces.

213
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,416
An artist? Surely you jest.

214
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
This guy was apparently the dead
picture book lady's apprentice.

215
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,583
That so? This dullard?

216
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,750
Hey man, why you
gotta call me that?

217
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,333
I'm Laurice Deauxnim,
the artiste,

218
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,333
and I'm here to do a
study of Dusky Bridge!

219
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,375
[BUTZ]
What's up with Iris?

220
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,791
Have the po-po finally
let her outta jail yet?

221
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,750
She will be standing
trial tomorrow.

222
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,333
It's not lookin' good, pal.

223
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,541
[BUTZ] That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard!

224
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,125
There's no way in hell
she could be the killer!

225
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,875
And what makes you so
certain of her innocence?

226
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,708
I mean, you guys have
seen her, haven't you?

227
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,791
She's way too cute
to be a murderer.

228
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,083
[MILES]
Why did I even ask?

229
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,666
[BUTZ]
But man, in my opinion,

230
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,666
a beautiful girl like
her shouldn't be taking

231
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,500
those kinds of risks.

232
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,833
[MILES]
What's that mean?

233
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,291
[BUTZ] Nothing! Just one
of those Butz brain farts!

234
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,750
As I understand it,

235
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,583
you're actually the one who
called the cops last night

236
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,333
after the body was
found, aren't ya?

237
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,500
Is that true?

238
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,583
Huh? Oh, yeah, right.

239
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,333
Man, that was insanity!

240
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,833
First, the lightning was all
like "crashentino," "zaparroo,"

241
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,791
there goes the bridge and
Nick whizzing right off it!

242
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,250
[MILES] I don't speak your
made-up language, Larry.

243
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,208
Anyway, Nick had run
up screaming at me

244
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,375
to call the cops, so I did,
and boy howdy was I a mess.

245
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,666
With the lightning, the fire,

246
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,625
and your buddy whizzing
off the bridge,

247
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,375
I mean, how could
anybody not be?

248
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,041
Oh, naw, it's because of the
totally bonkers thing I'd seen

249
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,166
before all that happened!

250
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,416
Uh--

251
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,875
You care to elaborate on that?

252
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,583
Well--I told you
everything I know

253
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,083
so you should be on your way.

254
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,666
Larry, you're hiding
something from me, aren't you?

255
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,458
I'm offended that one
of my oldest friends

256
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,416
can't tell when I'm telling
the honest-to-god truth.

257
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,875
I can tell, that's how
I know you're lying now.

258
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,583
You better start
talking, pronto,

259
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,708
or we're gonna throw
your butt in the slammer!

260
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,208
[screams]

261
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,583
Quit hassling me, bro!

262
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,583
[GUMSHOE]
Hey!

263
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,208
Don't make me have to chase you!

264
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,166
[MILES]
Your choice.

265
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,875
But I will drag you
into the courtroom

266
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,833
if that's what it takes
to hear the whole story,

267
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,500
old friend.

268
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,750
[JUDGE 204A] And now, this
court is hereby in session

269
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,833
for the trial of Sister Iris.

270
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,166
The defense is ready to present
our argument, Your Honor.

271
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,291
[MILES] It is a prosecutor's
duty to doubt the defendant,

272
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,875
but today I must take
an opposite approach.

273
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,458
Wright told me
a defense attorney

274
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,291
must believe in their
client's innocence

275
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,958
through to the last
moments of the trial.

276
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,916
Am I truly up to the task?

277
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,583
I am fully prepared
to defend my client!

278
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,083
[JUDGE 204A]
Mm.

279
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,500
If the prosecution is ready,

280
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,458
then we shall begin without
further ad--[groans]

281
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,750
Does my whip feel ready to you?

282
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,750
[JUDGE 204A]
Oh, and you are?

283
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,333
[FRANZISKA]
My name?

284
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,416
Franziska von Karma.

285
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,000
Uh, really? Like the
legendary prosecutor?

286
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,958
That von Karma?

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,041
[FRANZISKA]
"Legendary" describes the past,

288
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,541
but I am bringing
us into the future!

289
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,541
[JUDGE 204A gasps]

290
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,333
[MILES]
She left home for America

291
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,291
and became a prosecutor at 13.

292
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,708
And like her father, she'll
do whatever it takes to win.

293
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,416
I'm glad you're here, Franziska.

294
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,125
[JUDGE 204A clears throat]

295
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,583
Guess that's been cleared up.

296
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,958
But I do have a question
for the defense.

297
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,166
[MILES]
Yes, Your Honor?

298
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,250
I can't help feeling
I've met a prosecutor

299
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,250
to whom you bear such
an uncanny resemblance.

300
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,625
He could practically
be your twin brother.

301
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,500
Must've imagined it.

302
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,625
Prosecutor von Karma, do you
know who I'm talking about?

303
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,375
[FRANZISKA]
You imagined it.

304
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,291
Why would I invent
such a person?

305
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,916
[FRANZISKA] I had expected
that I would be squaring off

306
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,458
against Phoenix Wright
in the courtroom today.

307
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,208
But perhaps this is the battle
I've been preparing for

308
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,416
my entire life.

309
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,500
This is my chance to crush Miles
Edgeworth once and for all!

310
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,541
Prosecution, with
that out of the way,

311
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,000
please begin your
opening statement.

312
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,916
[FRANZISKA] The victim
is children's book author

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,916
and illustrator, Elise Deauxnim.

Her bloody corpse was discovered

in the courtyard of
Hazakura Temple.

316
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,166
As seen here, she was
stabbed through the torso

317
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,458
with a ceremonial sword
held by a golden statue.

318
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,458
What an awful tragedy.

319
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:00,083
An act of brutality clearly
carried out by Sister Iris.

320
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,875
The proof? Well, it was all seen

321

by an eyewitness with
an honest reputation.

up certain ima--[groans]

is a sacred place.

leave my own courtroom?

341
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,583
I'm afraid I did.

342
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,291
I'm shocked my sweet
little Iris could do this.

[JUDGE 204A]
This may be difficult for you,

344
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,125
but please describe
the events of that night

345
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,916
as accurately as possible.

346
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,416
[BIKINI]
Mm-hmm.

347
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,208
On that night,
I was helping a trainee

in the Inner Temple.

349
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,416
Then around 10 PM,
Iris came for me.

350
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,791
She stayed to help the trainee

351
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,625
and I went back to
the main grounds.

352
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,958
[MILES]
Hold it!

353
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,333
That can't be true,

354
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,291
because the defendant never
went to the Inner Temple

355
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,291
on the night in question.

356
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,958
Isn't that correct, defendant?

357
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,250
I was in my room in
Hazakura Temple all night

358
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,125
up until I heard the commotion
outside when the body was found.

359
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,250
I swear I saw her
with my own eyes!

360
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,958
She was dressed exactly the
same as at dinner earlier!

361
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,250
[MILES]
And how was she dressed?

362
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,750
[BIKINI]
Same robes she always wears

363
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,458
and with her head scarf
on just like before!

364
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,791
Unfortunately,
that is also untrue.

Iris. This head scarf, or hood--

367
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,375
Had you done anything with it?

368
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,041
I gave it to Mister Wright

369
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,291
on my way to ring the bell
for lights out before 10 PM.

370
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,875
You gave it away?

371
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,875
[MILES] Indeed. Which means she
wasn't wearing her head scarf

372
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,458
when the witness claims
to have seen her--

373
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,166
a fact that begs the question
"who did she see that night"?

374
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,708
Ha! Are you suggesting the
defendant had a doppelganger

375
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,125
come to the Inner Temple?

376
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,291
We don't really
know who was there.

377
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,208
However, this witness
needs to be precise

378
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,708
with the details
of her testimony.

379
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,125
[BIKINI]
It's so bizarre!

380
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,625
I know exactly what
I saw that night.

381
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,916
[MILES] I don't think
she's purposefully lying.

382
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,833
This contradiction is sure
to come up later in the trial.

383
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,125
[JUDGE 204A] You may continue
with your testimony, witness,

384
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,750
but keep in mind you'll need
to be precise in your account.

385
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,166
Yes.

386
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,833
After resting for a short while,

387
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,833
I headed back to the
Inner Temple around 11 PM.

388
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,958
Then, I heard a strange noise
coming from the courtyard.

389
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,875
When I looked that way,
I saw Iris holding a sword.

390
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,541
It was plunged to the hilt
into poor Ms. Deauxnim's back!

391
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,708
I imagine that was a
very traumatizing thing

392
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,791
for you to witness.

393
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,375
That's all I remember.

394
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,125
I let loose a scream
and passed out.

395
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,291
Are you absolutely certain
that you saw the defendant?

396
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,166
[BIKINI]
Yes. Without a doubt.

397
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,375
She wasn't wearing her
head scarf at the time,

398
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,916
but I know it was Iris!

399
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,291
When I awoke,
Ms. Deauxnim was lying dead

400
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,083
underneath Mystic Ami's
golden statue.

401

Game over, Edgeworth.

You've nowhere to turn.

[grunts]

404
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,916
The witness stands by
her damning testimony,

405
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,541
which is corroborated by the
defendant's fingerprints found

406
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,166
on the seven-pointed sword that
was used as the murder weapon.

407
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
Sister Iris' prints were on it?

408
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,208
This proves she
murdered Ms. Deauxnim.

409
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,416
Therefore, this court
must find her guilty.

410

[JUDGE 204A] Do you care to make
a counter-argument, defense?

like to be on the other side.

Plunged in to the hilt?

Then the entire blade should
be covered with blood.

Considering its unique design,

423
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,083
is it even possible to stab a
person all the way to the hilt

with this particular sword?

Th-That's what she saw!

When I looked over,

427
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,500
the sword was totally run
through the poor woman

428

and the hilt was the
only part sticking out!

what is the point you're
trying to make here?

My point is simple.

[MILES]
However,

471
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,208
since it's quite obvious there
was a different murder weapon,

472
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,208
we must ask what became of that.

473
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,458
[FRANZISKA]
What do you mean?

474
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,000
Following the incident,

475
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,333
the local police conducted a
thorough investigative search

476
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,666
of the surrounding area.

477
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,333
Yes, they did their
jobs quite well.

478
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,666
But nothing suspicious was found
on or near the temple grounds.

479
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,750
I see. That's very
peculiar indeed.

480
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,750
Although there is an extremely
secure hiding place nearby.

481
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,291
Is that so?

482
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,875
If it were disposed of there,
it may never be discovered.

483
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,208
Where might that be?

[FRANZISKA]
Eagle River.

[MILES]
Really?

486
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,250
There was a snowmobile next to
Hazakura Temple's main gate.

487
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,166
Somebody could have driven
this over to the bridge

488
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,875
and thrown the weapon into the
gorge where the rapid current

489
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,916
would whisk it away
to who knows where.

490
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,208
Uh--the snowmobile?

491
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,166
Have you any proof of
this, or just conjecture?

492
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,500
Do I? Of course I have proof.

493
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,916
[MILES]
Nonsense!

494
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,500
[FRANZISKA] There were
snowmobile tracks leading from

495
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,875
Hazakura Temple to Dusky Bridge
that were made that very night.

497
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,583
It makes sense if you
consider another weapon.

498
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,958
The killer drove there to
get rid of the evidence.

499

Tell us, witness.

500
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,583
Who could have used the
snowmobile that night?

501
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,458
Well, just Iris.
She's the only one.

502
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,708
What? Why just her?

503
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,458
[BIKINI] Because she had the
only key to the snowmobile.

Iris! Did you really do this?

Iris...

Iris, why won't you answer?

Your Honor, the defendant's
stubborn refusal

is practically a confession!
