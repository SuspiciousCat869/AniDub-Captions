00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,583
[PHOENIX] We've learned that
the murder at Hazakura Temple

2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,666
was actually an attempt to
wipe out the bloodline

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,500
of the Kurain School of
channeling's main family.

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:20,416
A hit job orchestrated by
none other than Morgan Fey.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,416
Also, the true identity of
the victim was revealed.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,916
It was Misty Fey, Maya's
long-lost mother.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,625
The final day
of the trial delivered

8
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,750
the biggest twist so far.

9
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,250
Sensing something
odd about Iris's behavior,

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,458
I realized who she really was.

11
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,541
The person on the
witness stand was not Iris,

12
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,541
but the spirit of her twin
sister, Dahlia Hawthorne,

13
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,458
who had recently been
executed for her crimes.

14
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,708
[DAHLIA]
My name is Dahlia Hawthorne,

15
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,625
and I'm permanently retired.

16
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,583
[PHOENIX] Now I need to know
where the real Iris is,

17
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,125
and if Maya is still alive.

18
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,166
[CROWD murmuring]

19
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,000
[GODOT]
Dahlia Hawthorne, huh?

20
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,458
So. It seems you're done
trying to hide your identity.

21
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,333
Yeah, well. I'm dead.
So what does it matter?

22
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,916
I was executed, so it's
not like I can be punished

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,083
any harder, right?

24
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,375
[JUDGE]
How is this possible?

25
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,541
These instructions
detail Morgan Fey's plan

26
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,833
for that night.

27
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,791
Tell me--Did you have
prior knowledge of this?

28
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,625
I did. Although I was
on death row at the time.

29
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,625
I was still allowed to
visit with my mother

30
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,083
every now and then.

31
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,541
She told me of her plot
during one of those visits.

32
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,458
[JUDGE] And what was
she planning, exactly?

33
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,791
[DAHLIA]
She wanted to murder Maya Fey.

34
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,416
[PHOENIX]
So the real target was Maya?

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,625
[DAHLIA] The idea was
that I would kill her.

36
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,833
Then Iris would be
the one to hang for it.

37
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,000
Things didn't go
exactly as we wanted,

38
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,000
but it all worked out.

39
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,541
[PHOENIX]
You're wrong!

40
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,666
Maya's trapped inside the
sacred cavern, but she's alive!

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,125
Still such an idiotic optimist.

42
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,375
Oh, Feenie.

43
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,666
[PHOENIX growls]

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,958
Let me share
a little something with you.

45
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,958
When I met you that day,
it was hate at first sight.

46
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,708
But after I got to know you,

47
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,833
and saw the naive faith
you have in others,

48
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,333
I grew to despise you.

49
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,958
[PHOENIX]
Why would you kill Maya?

50
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,250
[DAHLIA]
Hmph.

51
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,833
Making her youngest
daughter the Master, well,

52
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,208
it's practically all
my mother thinks about.

53
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,708
But to do that,
she needed to eliminate

54
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,666
the heir of the main
family. It's simple.

55
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,583
To make Pearl the Master?

56
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,916
What's all this "Master"
business, anyway?

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,166
It's about who would
head the small, but influential,

58
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,500
Kurain School of Channeling.

59
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,208
Both Morgan Fey and
Dahlia Hawthorne are members

60
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,250
of the so-called
"branch" family,

61
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,416
whereas Maya Fey is the
successor of the main family.

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,291
[DAHLIA] If the main
bloodline were to die out,

63
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,041
then the next master would
come from the branch family.

64
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,833
That's actually the
only reason she even raised

65
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,000
that little brat Pearl,

66
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,083
who luckily has strong
spiritual powers!

67
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,125
That's enough!

68
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,791
Whether that's true or not,

69
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,666
Pearl would never
go along with it!

70
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,125
Do you believe that
we cared if she agreed with us?

71
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,291
She just had to do
what her mommy said.

72
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,916
Be a good, obedient
little girl, and channel me.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,500
And after you took
over her body,

74
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,250
you would be handling
all the rest.

75
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,458
Is that right?

76
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,000
Nail on the head.

77
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,375
I mean, the whole plan was
an absolute train wreck,

78
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,791
if you ask me.

79
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,125
[PHOENIX]
If that's how you felt,

80
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,333
why did you agree
to help her carry it out?

81
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,708
[DAHLIA]
Why do you think?

82
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,083
Because I thought it
would serve my interests.

83
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,333
I had my own agenda
to consider, you know.

84
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,833
[PHOENIX]
And what might that be?

85
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,375
Mine? Pure revenge.

86
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,375
Powerful force, huh?

87
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,458
[DAHLIA] Every day, the thought
burned inside my brain.

88
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,083
That I was sent to die
because of that damned woman.

89
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,708
[gasps]
Mia.

90
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,916
I wanted her to face
the same humiliation

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,375
that she put me through.

92
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,333
I wanted to make her feel
the kind of pain that I felt

93
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,541
every single day of my life.

94
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,166
That's pretty nutty.

95
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,166
I was absolutely livid
when I found out

96
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,791
she died before me.

97
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,541
But still... A person's soul
will live on into eternity.

98
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,625
So to harm her soul,
I would take the life of

99
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,250
the one she loved most
with my own hands!

100
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,416
And then... I would
finally have my revenge!

101
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,625
[PHOENIX]
Are you serious?

102
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,583
You'd kill an innocent
person for that?!

103
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,958
[DAHLIA]
I'm dead, remember?

104
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,625
So don't waste your breath
trying to make me

105
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,208
feel guilty about it.

106
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,666
There's nothing you
can do that's worse than

107
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,083
what I've already been through.

108
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,541
[PHOENIX growls]

109
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,958
On that night,

110
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,875
around 9:30, I crossed
the void back into this world.

111
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,541
I quickly pinned up
my hair and put on a hood.

112
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,208
Then I grabbed the
staff sitting next to me

113
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,958
and left Hazakura Temple.

114
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,125
That clown of a head nun
at the Inner Temple

115
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,583
never imagined
that I wasn't Iris.

116
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,708
She went back to the main
temple, which meant I would be

117
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,791
alone with Maya, who was
still getting ready to train.

118
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,375
[DAHLIA] I was able
to corner her in front of

119
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,208
the stone lantern,
took out the dagger

120
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,750
I found in the storeroom,

121
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,291
and went after her with
a huge smile on my face.

[slashing, blood splashing]

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,541
Say what? Do you mean
you stabbed Maya?

124
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,375
It's weird, things got foggy.

125
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,500
I don't remember
what happened next.

126
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:25,541
But I think maybe... I
somehow got stabbed instead.

127
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,625
By who? Who would stab you?

128
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,208
It was Maya, you dolt!

129
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,208
Who else could have done it?
She killed me!

130
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,333
No way! You're lying.

131
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,750
She would never!

132
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,791
[DAHLIA]
I started to black out.

133
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,916
So I scrawled her name
on the lantern in blood,

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,041
hoping that would draw suspicion
to her, at the very least.

135
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,291
Tch. Still so vindictive.

136
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,708
[DAHLIA] I don't know
how long I was unconscious.

137
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,291
But when I woke up.

138
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:57,166
I realized I was inside
the Sacred Cavern.

139
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,125
[JUDGE] Is that so?
How did you end up there?

140
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,708
[DAHLIA]
No clue, grandpa.

141
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,208
But I did know that I wanted
the satisfaction of seeing

142
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,041
Maya's dead body on the ground.

143
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,500
However...

144
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,750
...I couldn't get out.

145
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,875
[PHOENIX] Right, because
of the trick lock!

146
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,958
[DAHLIA] I took me hours
to get that damn thing open!

147
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,041
And almost the exact
moment I stepped out.

148
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,291
The earthquake hit.

149
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,875
[DAHLIA]
But I was in luck.

150
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,083
Because there she was.

151
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,458
[IRIS pants]

152
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,375
[DAHLIA] Iris showed up,
and to make it even sweeter,

153
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,791
she was all by herself.

154
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,333
I got her to tell me
everything that was going on.

155
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,708
[DAHLIA] And then, I locked
her up in the sacred cavern.

156
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,458
Shortly after...

157
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,541
...I put the pieces together.

158
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,250
What do you mean by that?

159
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,083
[DAHLIA] I'd misunderstood
one important thing.

160
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,541
I was under the impression
that Pearl Fey had been the one

161
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,458
who summoned me
the night before.

162
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,458
Well, that was part
of the plan your mother

163
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,875
had brewed up, wasn't it?

164
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,458
But that's not how it went.

165
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,833
The person who had actually
called my spirit over

166
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,375
from the other side was...

167
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,500
It was Elise Deauxnim, right?

168
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,125
Misty Fey herself.

169
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,541
Yeah! So then
I realized something.

170
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,041
After I lost consciousness,
it was her body left lying

171
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,958
in front of the lantern.

172
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,333
Even though
I wasn't able to kill Maya.

173
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,708
I did successfully force her
into committing one of

174
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,166
the most disgusting
and vile sins a person

175
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,541
could ever dream of!

176
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,625
[DAHLIA] Yes! I made her
kill her very own mother!

177
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,916
[DAHLIA] And unable to bear the
guilt for such a horrific act.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,625
Maya Fey took
her own pitiful life.

179
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,041
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

180
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,458
Maya! She would never do that!

181
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,125
[DAHLIA] Well, if you
don't believe me,

182
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,583
why don't you tell me exactly
where she is right now.

183
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,375
[PHOENIX] Why don't you
tell us where she is?

184
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,958
The cave, right?

185
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,458
The bottom of Eagle River.

186
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,833
[gasps]

187
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,166
[DAHLIA] After killing
her poor mother to thwart

188
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,791
that unexpected attack,
she threw herself

189
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,375
into the river
in a fit of despair.

190
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,250
And most bodies that wind up
there, never come back out.

191
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,791
No! She's just been trapped in
the sacred cavern all this time!

192
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,541
Sorry. Somebody's
giving me a buzz.

193
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,375
Prosecutor Godot, not right now.

194
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,166
[GODOT]
All right, great, thanks.

195
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,666
Excuse me.

196
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,458
But I wanted to be alerted when
they got the locks removed

197
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,166
from the sacred cavern.

198
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,833
They're off?!
Has anybody found Maya?

199
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,875
Apparently, there was
a woman found inside the cave.

200
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,291
And that was Sister Iris.
She was alone.

201
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,000
They say anything about Maya?

202
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,833
[GODOT]
According to that call,

203
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,125
Iris was the only
one they found.

204
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,291
Oh, no...

205
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,041
I wasn't lying, you fool.

206
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,541
You should try dragging
the river instead.

207
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,041
Her body might turn up.

208
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,958
[PHOENIX growls, yells]

209
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,541
[cackles]

210
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,125
The plan actually worked!

Vengeance is mine!

212
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,583
So, like I said,
check the river.

00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,708
Face it! There's
nowhere else around there

could be hiding!

215

She's dead!

[GODOT]
Hmph.

So Trite...

218
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,333
There's a saying you
might've heard before.

219
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,750
It goes, "Once you
eliminate the impossible,

220
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,875
whatever remains,
no matter how improbable,

221
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,833
must be the truth."

222
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,291
"Whatever remains is the truth."

223
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,791
Nobody has seen
or heard from Maya

224
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,541
since that night.

225
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:22,583
She's not in the main temple,
the cave, or the inner temple.

226
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,416
And I don't believe she'd
throw herself into the river.

227
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,916
So what's left?

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,583
Of course! It's improbable...

229
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,375
...but not impossible.

230
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:39,583
[PHOENIX] Dahlia. I have
an idea where we can find her.

231
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,333
One last place where
she could possibly be hiding.

232
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,291
You're terrible at bluffing.
But go on, tell us where she is.

233
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,416
Okay. But let me
ask you something first.

Who's channeling you right now?

00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,500
[DAHLIA]
What a stupid question.

236
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,208
It's that pathetic, sniveling
little rug-rat, Pearl Fey.

237
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,250
But it can't be her.

238
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,416
'Cause she's here with us,
watching from

239
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,791

240
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,291
[DAHLIA]
Huh? Then who?

241
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,000
[PHOENIX]
There's one possibility.

242
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,916
And you're not gonna like it.

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,416
The person channeling
you is Maya Fey!

244

What?! That can't be!

245
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,875
[PHOENIX] After she
realized what was going on,

246
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,166
Maya then made the conscious
decision to channel you.

247
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,125
It was the only way
to defend herself.

248

N-No way...

249
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,791
Yes. The very last place
Maya could hide

00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,625
is right here in plain sight.
She's hidden inside you!

tell me who gave her

such a brilliant idea, huh?

Heh. You really
are something else.

But why? Why are you here?

274
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,208
That night,

275
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,791
you backed Maya into a corner
outside the inner temple.

276
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,583
But right before
you could kill her,

you blacked out, didn't you?

Yeah! That's because
I was stabbed!

Maya stabbed me!

[MIA] But she lost consciousness
at the exact same time.

281

to have been somebody else

there who stabbed you.

283
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,875
[MIA] A short time later,
when Maya woke up,

284
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,875
she was in the training hall.

285
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,625
She immediately wrote a note
about what was going on

286
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,833
and proceeded to channel me.

287
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,458
She asked for my advice,
what I thought she should do.

288
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,375
I didn't think she was
smart enough for that.

289
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,666
I didn't have all
the details at the time,

290
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,791
but one thing was
perfectly clear to me.

291
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,083
Which was?

292
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,833
The simple fact that
you could not be allowed

293
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,541
to wander around freely.

294
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,416
I wrote down two things
that she absolutely had to do.

295
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,250
The first step was to
channel Dahlia Hawthorne.

296
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,916
And the second was to hide.

297
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Lock herself in the
cavern until help arrived.

298
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,250
I see.

299
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,375
So it was Maya who put
that lock on the door.

300
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,041
I never would've
considered that.

301
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,333
She had to do it quickly,
or Dahlia definitely would've

302
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,750
been channeled by Pearl instead.
And if that had happened...

303
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,875
...this demonic spirit here
would have used the body

304
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,041
of that little girl to take her
murderous revenge out on Maya.

305
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,000
There's no way...
How could I have been...

306
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,750
Could have been such a failure?

307
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,166
Because that's all your plan
amounted to in the end.

308
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,458
Another loss.

00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,875
...when you wound up killing
somebody else and all you got

318
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,833
from it was a death sentence.

319
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,041
Just one stupid
move after another.

320
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,500
It's so bad,
it's not even funny.

321
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,500
[DAHLIA]
Shut up!

322
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,083
And now this.

323
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,500
You stepped in it once again,
because you couldn't fool Mia.

324
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,916
Maya was right
there in front of you,

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,083
and she still got away,
because of your incompetence.

326
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,333
[DAHLIA snarls]
Damn you, Mia Fey!

327
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,250
I despise you.

328
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,666
Why did you have to get
in my way again?!

329
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,416
[MIA] Oh, please,
it's not all my fault.

330
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,625
The fact is,
you will never beat me.

331
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,041
What'd you say...?

332
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:44,000
Never in your life, and,
apparently, not even in death.

333
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,250
Seems like you're going
to be a complete embarrassment

334
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,625
for the rest of time!

335
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,958
Remember this?

336
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,000
You said the dead
couldn't be punished.

337
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,500
But you also said that
a person's soul lives on

338
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,833
for all of eternity.

339
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,666
[MIA] And that's the punishment
from which you'll never escape.

340
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,833
You're always going to be
that weak, insecure,

341
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,333
pathetic creature known
as Dahlia Hawthorne.

342
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,500
A petty, perpetual loser!

343
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,500
To be honest,
that sounds like one hell

344
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,083
of a punishment to me.

345
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,166
And on the very day
you were executed,

346
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,166
your narrow little bridge to
freedom burned under your feet!

347
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,166
No...

348
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,333
You're wrong!

349
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,916
It can't be...

350
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
[demonic] How the
hell could I lose to you?!

351
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,250
I'm the superior one!

352
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,916
Think whatever you want,
but it won't make a difference.

353
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,041
Dahlia!

354
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,000
I order you to get out
of Maya Fey's body right now!

355
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,458
[roars]

356
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,541
[demonic]
Not yet! No! I'm not ready!

357
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:44,208
[shrieks]

358
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,166
Hey, Nick,
is that really you...?

359
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,541
And Mia...?

360
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,750
[sighs]

361
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,791
Yeah, it's me. Glad you're back.

362
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,041
[JUDGE]
Now, then. Is it safe to assume

363
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,125
I'm speaking with the
real Sister Iris this time?

364
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,291
Yes.

365
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,625
[JUDGE] I'm sure you've
heard this before,

366
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,666
but you two look awfully alike.

367
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,041
Well, anyway!

368
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,375
I shall hereby deliver
the verdict in this case!

369
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,583
[GODOT]
Objection!

370
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,458
Slow down with the gavel, chief.
Did ya have too much caffeine?

371
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,583
[JUDGE]
Uh, what are you talking about?

372
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,291
He means the trial isn't over.

373
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,375
[gasps]

374
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,625
You can't just
exorcise an evil spirit,

375
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,291
give yourself
a pat on the back,

376
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,666
then expect to go
on your merry way.

377
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,166
The bitter truth is Misty Fey,

378
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,625
Master of the Kurain School,
was actually murdered.

379
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,208
She's dead,
and we still don't know

380
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,458
who's to blame, do we now?

381
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,833
[JUDGE] But I'm afraid
the court isn't prepared for

382
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,291
any further
deliberations at this time.

383
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,125
The prosecution
will issue our final summons.

384
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,250
And this one is going to
clear up the whole mystery.

385
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,500
They'll answer the question
of who murdered Misty Fey!

386
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,833
[MIA] You sure about this,
Mister Prosecutor?

387
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,666
[GODOT] Hmph. But of course,
Madame Attorney.

388
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,125
I'm positive.

389
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,916
[PHOENIX gasps]

390
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,916
Mia...?

391
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,041
Okay. Who might
this final witness be?

392
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,500
[GODOT]
Heh. I thought it was obvious.

393
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,875
The only person we know
was there that night.

394
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,791
Who saw her mother die.

395
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,375
Wait, do you mean, Maya?

396
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,541
You can't put her on the stand
after what she's been though!

397
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,083
We need to find the truth!

398
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,291
[gasps]

399
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,583
[JUDGE]
Hmm. Very well, then.

400
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,166
The court will now adjourn
for a short recess.

401
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,041
Once the witness
is ready to testify,

402
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,791
we will proceed with the trial!

403
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:42,958
[GODOT]
Listen, Trite.

404
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,625
I'm just gonna get
this out there, okay?

405
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,958
What?

406
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,291
Put mildly, I don't
have a high opinion of you.

407
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,916
Your methods are sloppy,

408
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,916
you squeak by without even
the faintest understanding

409
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,333
of the case,

410
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,375
and then some beautiful woman
always comes dashing in

411
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,875
at the last minute to save you.

412
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,833
You haven't earned the right
to call yourself an attorney!

413
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,458
This time around,
you're gonna have to

414
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,500
do this all by yourself.

415
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,333
[PHOENIX sighs]

416
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,708
[IRIS] Please forgive me
for worrying you.

417
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,333
I'm glad you're okay.
Look, we're short on time.

418
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,916
Tell me what
happened that night.

419
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,916
Well, after I rang
the bell for lights out,

420
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,166
I got a phone call.

421
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,083
It would have been around 10:30.

422
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,250
I was asked to come to
the Inner Temple at once, so...

423
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,583
A call?

424
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,208
That's right. I got on
the snowmobile right away.

425
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,875
But then... I couldn't
reach the inner temple.

426
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,500
Because of what
happened to the bridge.

427
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,750
The lightning.

428
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,708
Yes. I had been told
to receive Elise's body

429
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,166
on top of the gorge
and take it to the temple.

430
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,125
So that's exactly what I did.

431
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,583
[PHOENIX] And when you
were staging the body

432
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,791
in the courtyard, that's when
Sister Bikini saw you?

433
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,250
[IRIS grunts]

434
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,291
Iris! I need the truth!

435
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,708
You gotta tell me who it was
that called you and told you

436
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,958
to move the body!

437
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,791
They have to be the one
who murdered Misty Fey!

438
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,375
[IRIS whimpers]

439
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,958
Please forgive me!

440
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,250
But I just can't do it. I can't
tell you who was behind this!

441
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,666
[sighs]

442
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,958
[BAILIFF 213A] Defendant,
the judge is calling for you.

00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,708
Listen. Mister Wright,

00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,791
--I, uh...
--[grunts]

445
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,041

Hurry up, defendant.

446
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,083

447
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,958
[PHOENIX]
Mia! Uh... How's Maya?

448
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,958
Is she feeling okay?

449
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,791
[MIA]
Physically, she'll be fine.

450
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,583
However... Emotionally speaking,
she's been very badly hurt.

451
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,833
I understand.

452
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,541
Did anyone tell her
Elise was your mother?

453
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,458
I did. I talked to her just now.

454
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,166
And told her everything
I knew about what happened.

455
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,375
Poor Maya...

456
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,708
She's always been
extremely strong.

457
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,916
I've no doubt she can
handle it. All of it.

458
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,666
All of it?
What do you mean by that?

459
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,208
You're going to need
to figure that answer out

460
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:03,041
by yourself. This will
truly be the final battle.

461
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,166
Who's behind it?

462
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,666
I need to go back and re-examine
the sequence of events.

463
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,541
We know she was
really killed in the garden

464
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,458
of the Inner Temple.

465
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,791
I find it hard to believe the
killer was there by accident.

466
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,708
Which means they must've
known of the plan

467
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,875
from the very beginning.

468
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,041
What's more,
the victim was moved across

469
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,041
the burning bridge by
means of a pendulum.

470
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,791
In other words,
the killer wasn't able

471
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,916
to cross the bridge.

472
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,541
So that would mean,
it would have been someone

473
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,250
who wasn't on the main
temple side the next day.

474
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,166
[MIA]
Hmm.

475
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,000
The trial's about to resume.

476
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,166
We need the defense to
return to the courtroom.

477
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,250
Right.

478
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,291
I've done as much
as I can, Phoenix.

479
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,500
My time is up.

480
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,000
Thank you, Mia.

481
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,958
The rest of the battle
in your hands now,

482
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,916
but I have faith in you.

483
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,916
I've got it.
I appreciate all you've done.

484
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,291
[PHOENIX] It's time to finally
bring this case to an end.

485
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,083
What did Maya see that night?

486
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,875
And who was it that actually
killed Misty Fey?

487
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,791
[PHOENIX]
Whatever my conclusion,

488
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,458
I'll have to prove it.

489
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,833
And I'll have only
myself to rely on.

490
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,541
[JUDGE] Before we
resume the proceedings,

491
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,625
I have an important
announcement to make.

492
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,958
[PHOENIX]
What's that?

493
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,375
Two weapons were
presented as evidence.

494
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,250
The bloodstains on both
have now been analyzed.

495
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,125
And the results
indicate the murder weapon

496
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,833
was the sword hidden
inside the staff.

497
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:34,083
[PHOENIX] But, what about
the bloodstain on the dagger?

498
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,500
I'm not sure.

499
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,166
But at the very least
it was not the victim's.

500
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,958
[PHOENIX grunts]

501
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,375
Now. Bring in the final witness!

502
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,833
Maya...

503
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,875
[gasps]

504
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,125
Help me, Nick...

505
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,875
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

506
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,166
This case has reached
the final stage.

507
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,250
We have to learn what
really happened that night.

508
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,083
Who killed Maya's mother?

509
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,125
As the moment o,
truth draws closer.

510
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,416
Maya takes the witness stand,

511
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,625
and the harsh, painful
reality comes to light.

512
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,166
The end of this long trial
will be filled with tears

513
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,500
cried over sins of the past.

514
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,083
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

515
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,875
Next time,
the final episode:

516
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,291
"Bridge to the
Turnabout -- Last Trial!"

517
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,583
Take that!
