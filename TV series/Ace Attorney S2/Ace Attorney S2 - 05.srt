00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,791
[PHOENIX] While the Kurain Urn
was being stolen,

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,625
a brutal murder took place in
the office of Kane Bullard,

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,750
CEO of KB Security.

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,958
Since Ron's alibi for the theft
put him in that very office,

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,500
he was arrested
once more for murder.

6
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,166
But the actual
assassin was someone

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,208
artfully arranging all this
from behind the backdrop.

8
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,708
This court is hereby
in session for the murder trial

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,500
of Mister Ron DeLite.

10
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,625
[RON whimpers]

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,333
Court is now
in session for the trial

12
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,625
of Luke Atmey.
Please take your seats.

13
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,083
[PHOENIX]
Two trials linked at the core.

14
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,791
I have to get him to the stand.

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,958
If the prosecution is ready.

16
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,458
You may now proceed.

17
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,041
I always limit myself
to no more than 17 cups

18
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,541
of coffee during
any given trial.

19
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,791
But that first one
is something special.

20
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,833
Gives me the right
amount of stimulation.

21
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,916
[JUDGE]
Uh. Okay.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,375
[PHOENIX] I get the feeling
he's ready to grind me up.

23
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,708
[GODOT]
I did some digging.

24
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,000
Trying to find out exactly
why you were terminated

25
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,500
from KB security last year.

26
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,583
[RON whimpers]

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,125
It was because
of your wife, wasn't it?

28
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,166
Because of me?

29
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,291
[BOTH gasp]

30
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,708
[RON gasps]
No. You got it all wrong.

31
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,125
Is that so?

32
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,625
In order to satisfy her
thirst for spending,

33
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,041
you stole confidential company
data you thought you could sell.

34
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,791
The CEO found out and
poured you down the drain.

35
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,250
[RON grunts]

36
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,625
[GODOT] Of course, the truth
would leave a bitter taste

37
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,166
in the missus' mouth.

38
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,000
Quitting on "principle"
sounds much sweeter.

39
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,000
Personally,
I'd call it saccharine.

40
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,708
[RON whimpers]

41
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,583
Mister Bullard then
brewed up a plan to spill

42
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,041
the beans about you.

43
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,125
Blackmail. You decided
he needed to get burned.

44
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,083
Ronnie. That can't be true...

45
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,291
[RON whimpers]

46
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,000
Definitely a robust
motive if you ask me.

47
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,666
This is bad.

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,250
[GODOT] Moving on. What did you
do after receiving this letter?

49
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,791
We need to know.

50
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,541
[RON gasps]
Just what it said.

51
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,500
I followed the letter's
instructions and went up

52
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,708
to my old boss's office.

53
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,958
I opened the door...

54
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,666
[RON] ...and that's when
I saw a suspicious shadow!

55
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,208
They clocked me hard on the
forehead and knocked me out.

56
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,333
Next thing I knew,
Bullard was dead on the floor!

57
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,833
[gasps]

58
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,125
[BOTH whimper]

59
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,291
[gasps] If I hadn't decided
to wear it that night,

60
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,166
I might have died
right there beside him.

61
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,166
[GODOT]
Huh?

62
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,625
Wait, what protected you?

63
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,375
Oh, I was wearing my mask.

64
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,958
So, you wore a costume?

65
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,541
Yeah. I was wearing
my full "Phantom Thief"

66
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,916
regalia for the meeting.
Mask and all.

67
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,250
[JUDGE gasps]

68
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,708
[gasping]

69
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,750
Uh. Is that important?

70
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,750
Guess I didn't think
to mention it earlier.

71
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,583
It is kind of a major detail.

72
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,208
I would've really
liked to have known that.

73
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,083
Since I was being
blackmailed over my identity

74
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,458
as Mask DeMasque,
seemed like showing up

75
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,875
in the costume would be
the thing to do, yeah?

76
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,375
[groans]

77
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,625
I gotta start to
move things along.

78
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,333
[PAYNE chuckles] Do you have
anything to add, Mr. Atmey?

79
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:57,583
[LUKE chuckles] Perfect
performance Prosecutor Payne.

80
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,000
Your professionalism
is without parallel.

81
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,125
It appears that we're
absolutely accelerating

82
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,875
toward appropriate adjudication.

83
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,541
As far as stories go,

84
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,583
I'm finding the kid's
testimony a bit unpalatable.

85
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,958
He walked in and
was knocked out cold?

86
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,916
Bit hard for me to swallow.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,458
Look at the evidence!

88
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,083
There are logs documenting
every time the emergency buzzer

89
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,958
in that office rang up security.

90
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,666
And according to the records,

91
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,375
the alarm was hit
just after 1 AM.

92
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,458
If Ron were the killer,

93
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,250
he would've run
as soon as it sounded.

94
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,500
You sure of that?

95
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,708
He would know a
security guard was on the way.

96
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,041
But Ron's previous testimony
stated that he hid

97
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,000
Mister Bullard's body in
the safe after he came to.

98
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,833
Would a killer stay
at the scene when he assumed

99
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,916
a guard was on the way?

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,541
[GODOT]
Objection!

101
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,458
But the fact of the matter
is the security guard

102
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,916
never arrived to the scene.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,625
Ah. Yeah, well.
That's just a coincidence.

104
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,041
[BUTZ giggles]

105
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,208
Perhaps the watchman on
duty at the time simply didn't

106
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,833
notice the buzzer going off?

107
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,333
[PHOENIX]
Not a chance.

108
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,500
The alarm is ear-splittingly
loud and impossible to miss.

109
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,916
That is... Unless, you
were completely unconscious

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,250
when it sounded, of course.

111
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,166
[JUDGE] You mean the
guard was unconscious?

112
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,916
Surely, you do recall
the defendant's testimony?

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,958
Someone hit him over the
head and he only discovered

114
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,041
the victim's body
when he woke up.

115
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,333
So what are you trying to say?

116
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,000
Obviously, when
the alarm went off,

117
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,583
Ron DeLite was
passed out on the floor.

118
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,833
He was? Right then?

119
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,625
By the time the buzzer rang,

120
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,208
Kane Bullard had already
been brutally murdered,

121
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,291
and the defendant was
attacked and rendered

122
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,791
completely unconscious.

123
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,666
With the real killer
choosing that window to escape.

124
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,458
What conclusion
would be reached?

125
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,541
[RON] Anybody walking into
that situation would think

126
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,541
I was the murderer!

127
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,416
And so! The emergency buzzer was
set off by the actual killer!

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,041
It was all an attempt
to make Ron DeLite look guilty--

129
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,041
to frame him!

130
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,291
[GODOT grunts]

131
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,041
And just who might
this "actual killer" be?

132
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,708
Are you prepared to
make an accusation?

133
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,625
I believe that it's Luke Atmey.

134
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,083
Oh, yeah?

135
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,833
You do realize the phantom
thief is currently on trial.

136
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,375
Just one courtroom
over, in fact.

137
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,041
[PHOENIX]
He's not the phantom thief.

138
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,833
Two crimes were being
committed simultaneously.

139
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,166
One theft and one murder.

140
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,916
Which of those would
be the lesser offense?

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,250
[JUDGE] No question, it would
clearly be the robbery.

142
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,041
If the robbery charge
resulted in a conviction,

143
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,916
that could be used as
an alibi for the murder.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,125
The trial next door
is a cover-up!

145
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,500
A cunning scheme deviously
devised by Luke Atmey!

146
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,875
--[JUDGE] Hmm?
--You can't be serious.

147
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,750
The defense requests
that Luke Atmey take the stand!

148
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,583
Right now! Before the
guilty verdict is declared!

149
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,750
[JUDGE] Now then, this court
is once again in session.

150
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,125
[LUKE growls]

151
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, he's here, so now what?

152
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,750
Things are about to get real.

153
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,458
At 1 AM, the night
of September 12th,

154
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,750
Kane Bullard was killed in
his office at KB security.

155
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,000
What were you
doing at that time?

156
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,416
You insist upon the same
imbecilic inquiry, is that it?

157
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,541
I had made a particular pledge.

158
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,291
Yes. To purloin a
priceless piece,

159
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,291
and was in the process
of perpetration.

160
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,416
Simply scrutinize the

it makes perfect sense.

That's why I'm confident this

When that golden
statue wasn't in the frame.

206

It must've been pretty
jarring walking into the scene.

Which means, at the very least,

210
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,500
you had to move it somewhere
out of the line of sight.

did know that somehow.

330
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,458
[PHOENIX] Mm-hmm. There's
only one explanation how

331
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,875
he could corroborate
Ron's testimony.

332
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,416
Earlier, Ron stated
that he had seen

333
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,375
a suspicious shadow just
before he was attacked.

334

If you shift the perspective
and turn things around,

335
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,500
that would also mean
the shadow saw Ron, as well.

336

Before you take your leave,

you need to tell us

Is that clear, detective?

355
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,833
Indeed, it was all
initiated on the evening

356
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,416
of Mask DeMasque's inaugural
infractions of illegality.

357
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,041
As he scampered from
the scene, he stumbled into

358
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,458
a side street, where nary
a soul stood sentry.

359
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,333
[LUKE] Nary a soul save
the sobriquet Ace Detective,

360
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,416
surreptitiously
surveying the spot.

361
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,583
So it came to pass that
Mask DeMasque would be unmasked.

362
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,166
At that moment I masterminded

363
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,416
a magnificent maneuver
for myself in the matter

of the moonlighting marauder.

365
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,958
The cat-bird seat I'd
acquired, meant I was capable

366
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,916
of controlling the criminal
and coercing him

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,291
into committing
continued capers.

368
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,875
Simultaneously shining
the spotlight on the struggle

369
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,291
surrounding DeMasque
and the Ace Detective.

370
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,041
Whatever I wanted
was well within warrant!

371
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,083
I made myself master of
Mask DeMasque and the masses.

372
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,208
They were practically
pirouetting in my palm.

373
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,250
And... at the conclusion
I could claim his capture.

374
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,458
Resulting in reports of
my righteous reputation

doing all this for fame?

An unanticipated obstruction
unfortunately occurred.

00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,125
the schemes you'd
been percolating?

--[LUKE growls]
--[SECURITY GUARD] Hold it!

383
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,291

384
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,875
to the CEO of the selfsame

This scarlet stone.

He figured out the
fact that the fancy fixture

387
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,041
was affixed to my finger.

388
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,625
Before I knew it,

389
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,541
I was being blackmailed by that
behemoth blackguard, Bullard.

390
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,416
Unbelievable!

391

You mean to tell us
Kane Bullard blackmailed you?

392
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,166
For his deliberate
display of disrespect,

393
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,958
I decided that he should die.

394
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,791
After careful calculation,
it came to me that

395
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,958
I could co-opt my current
client to carry out this caper.

396
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,750
Are you saying you used
the Kurain exhibit as cover?

397
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,333
Yes, precisely!

398
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,291
It could prove possible
to permanently purge

400

And furthermore frame the
fabled phantom for the felony.

401
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,666
Thus, in the bowels of
that boutique's basement...

...my magnificently
masterful machinations

You sent the calling
card to Lordly Tailor.

405

The next step...

406
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,541
...was to take that staged
photo on the premises

407

to shore up an alibi.

408

And then you delivered
Bullard's blackmail letter

to Ron DeLite.

the last part of the plan.

To take the fall for the stolen
urn which would mean

a far less severe penalty.

00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,041
but I never thought
you were him.

478
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,958
I'm sorry, Dessie, I know
you can't stand criminals.

479
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,916
[gasps] Oh. The only
types of people I can't stand

480
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,125
are slimy and
full of themselves.

481
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,916
Like that awful detective.

482
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,625
Wait. Are you saying...?

483
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,583
But you always gave
fair warning and declared

484
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,666
your intentions before
sticking it to your targets.

485
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,125
It only proves that
you're the guy for me.

486
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,458
That kind of sportsmanship
turns me on.

487
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,583
You are talking about crimes.

488
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,958
You mean that?

489
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,416
[DESIRÉE]
Hmm. Hey, Nicky boy.

490
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,625
Uh, yes?

491
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,375
Asking you to defend
my Ronnie was one of

492
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,791
the best decisions of my life.
Thanks for your hard work.

493
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh, yeah. Sure!

494
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,583
Aw, look at that. You're
blushing like a little kid.

495
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,750
You guys did such
a wonderful job in there!

496
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,541
Major congratulations!

497
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,250
[gasps]

498
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,208
Hang on. Let me explain.

499
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,708
Making time
with another man's wife.

500
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,583
And right in front of
poor Mystic Maya.

501
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,041
How dare you!

502
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,833
[PHOENIX grunts]

503
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,750
[PHOENIX] As I slipped into
unconsciousness,

504
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,666
I thought about the
case we just closed.

505
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,041
Ron said that a broken
bowl can never be put back

506
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,583
together again,
but I know that's not true.

507
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,833
I offer this urn as exhibit A.

508
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,416
Back in one piece
and better than before.

509
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,708
Well, Mister Trite.

510
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,958
It would appear that the party
has only just begun.

511
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,583
Let's drink in
everything it has to offer.

512
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,625
Ah. Bitter.

513
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,083
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

514
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,916
We were all kids
when it happened.

515
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,291
A tragic incident that sent
a dear friend far away.

516
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,541
But a signal from the radio
reminds us of how close

517
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,125
we really are.

518
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,875
Little Edgeworth may
feel lost living in

519
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,875
that cold von Karma household.

520
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,583
But as we can see, that
which is lost, can be found.

521
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,375
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

522
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,625
Our next episode
is an anime original:

523
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,500
"Sound the Turnabout
Melody!" Take that!
