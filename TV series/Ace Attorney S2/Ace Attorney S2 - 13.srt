[PHOENIX]
My name is Phoenix Wright,

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,375
and I'm a defense attorney.

3
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,250
I've made a pledge to
stand up for those who have

4
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,166
no one else in their corner.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,833
No matter how
tough the case may be,

6
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,000
or how high the odds
are stacked against us.

7
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,958
I'll do whatever it takes
to fight for the truth!

8
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,708
But of course,
there was a time before I made

9
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,333
that pledge and earned
my attorney's badge.

10
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,875
Five years ago,
something changed

11
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,791
the direction of my life
and convinced me

12
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,708
to be a voice for justice!

13
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,208
[DOUG] Listen, man.
You should stop seeing her.

14
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,666
[PHOENIX]
What? How is our relationship

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,083
any of your business?

[thunder rumbles]

17
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,916
Please. This is
for your own sake.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,083
She's bad news,
and that's putting it lightly.

19
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,875
[PHOENIX growls]
You're lying!

20
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,875
[DOUG] There's something
you need to know about her.

21
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,250
Before you get hurt.

22

[thunder rumbles]

23
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,583
[PHOENIX]
Shut your mouth!

24
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,750
She's not like that!
There's no way!

25

[blow lands]

26
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:11,083
[PHOENIX]
No. It's not my fault.

27
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,416
It... couldn't be.

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,291
I didn't kill this guy!

29
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,125
[thunder cracks

30
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,041
[MIA]
Ugh. It's almost time.

31
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,000
I can't believe
how nervous I am.

32
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,458
[MARVIN clears throat]

33
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,958
[MIA yelps]
You startled me, Mr. Grossberg!

34
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,541
Good morning!

35
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,583
Now, now, Mia.
There's no need to be so jumpy.

36
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,666
You might get questioned
for suspicious behavior.

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,708
I'm perfectly calm, thank you.

38
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,208
Is this not the face
of tranquility?!

39
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,458
--Uh... Ms. Fey! [coughs]
--Please forgive my outburst.

40
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,541
I understand the emotion,
but no more manhandling!

41
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,666
[sighs] Your first time
trying a case, eh?

42
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,500
I, Marvin Grossberg,
vow to be your rock.

43
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,666
Actually, to be clear,

44
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,458
this'll be my second
time to try a case.

45
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,666
Nevertheless,
you gave me quite a surprise.

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,041
What made you come to me
all fiery eyed last night

47
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,750
and insist on handling this?

48
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,166
When I heard about it yesterday,
it caught my interest.

49
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,541
[MIA] The defendant's name
is Phoenix Wright.

50
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,000
He's accused of murder,

51
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,916
and the official cause of
death was electrocution.

52
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,458
[MARVIN]
And here he is.

53
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,083
This is Phoenix Wright.

54
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,083
The man whose freedom you
will be fighting for today.

55
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,208
[PHOENIX] Thanks so much
for taking my case!

56
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,708
I know you can clear my name!

57
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,583
I'll help you anyway I can!

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,416
Yes, of course. Thank you.

61
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,291
[PHOENIX]
Great!

62
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,125
[PHOENIX]
Oh, but my name.

63
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,166
It's Wright, like
the flying brothers.

64
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,291
I misspoke, Mr. Wright!
It won't happen again!

65
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,083
I swear on my life
I won't fail you!

66
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,375
[coughs]

67
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,416
Forgive me.

68
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,208
[PHOENIX] All I want is
to prove my innocence,

69
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,291
because I would
never kill anybody!

70
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,041
[MIA] I need to keep
things in perspective,

71
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,125
he's got every right
to be nervous.

72
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,500
Come on, Mia. Stay strong!

73
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,916
My first trial, a year ago,

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,500
was such a
traumatizing experience.

75
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,583
I thought I'd never set
foot inside a courtroom again.

76
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,750
But I can't keep running away.

77
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,375
I have to go back
and face my fears.

78
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,541
And this time...

79
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,416
...I believe in myself.

80
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
I'm gonna win this!

00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:06,083
[CROWD murmuring]

00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,000
This court is hereby in session
to hear the murder trial

84
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,541
of Mister Phoenix Wright.

85
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,333
The defense team is
ready to begin, Your Honor.

86
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,583
Yes, Your Honor. The
prosecution is ready as well.

87
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,583
Ms. Fey. Am I to understand

88
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,375
that you'll be
leading the defense?

89
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,916
Um... Yes. Is there a problem?

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,541
No, but I was under the
impression Mister Grossberg

91
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,250
would be fulfilling
duties of council.

92
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,208
Oh. Well... Mister Grossberg
had an urgent matter

93
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,875
that came up all of a sudden.

94
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,708
So I'm here in his
stead, Your Honor.

95
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,875
Is that the case?

96
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,541
Because that man
standing next to you looks

97
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,375
a lot like him, Ms. Fey.

98
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,833
That's true.

99
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,375
It turns out the urgent
matter was that

100
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,750
I desperately needed to
observe this trial, Your Honor.

101
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,625
[MIA]
Mm-hmm.

Well then.

your opening statement.

[PAYNE]
Hmm. It boggles the mind.

107
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,000
To think they would send
someone so green to go

108
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,166
against a "rookie
killer" like me.

109
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,666
[MIA growls]

110
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,625
[PAYNE] Anyway, I'd like to
proceed with a brief summary

111
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,291
of the events in question.

112
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,916
This tragic incident
occurred one rainy afternoon,

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,708
on the local campus
of Ivy University.

114
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,250
The victim of this
horrific crime was Doug Swallow,

115
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,166
a senior so close to finishing
his pharmacology degree.

116
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,625
[JUDGE]
Pharmacology.

117
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,208
[PAYNE] Some fellow students
discovered the crime scene

118
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,541
and notified the authorities.

119
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,916
They found Mr. Swallow's
body, and the defendant

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,083
who'd made a complete
mess of his get-away attempt.

121
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,625
Phoenix Wright sits before us.

122
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,708
Wright is a third-year
Ivy University student

123
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,375
who is pursuing a degree
in the arts, of all things.

124
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,416
Apparently, this man
and the late Mister Swallow

125
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,666
had some bad blood
between the two of them.

126
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,250
Please elaborate.

127
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,416
[PHOENIX] You make it sound like
there was some big feud, but...

128
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,041
[coughs]

129
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,875
[JUDGE] Contain your coughing
or we'll be forced to eject you.

130
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,458
[CROWD murmurin]

131
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,916
But there was a disagreement

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,833
between the two men.
Wasn't there, young lady?

133
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:49,791
[MIA gasps]

134
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,166
Nothing to say?

135
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,708
[chuckles] If you call yourself
a defense attorney,

136
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,333
surely, you must know all
about what went down.

137
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,708
[MIA] So. He wants to
test me, does he? Fine.

138
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,250
I'm not scared of Payne.

139
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,458
I assume this so-called
"bad blood" you mention

140
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,958
has to do with Dahlia Hawthorne?

141
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,916
[JUDGE]
And who might that be?

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,666
[PAYNE] Currently, the
defendant's girlfriend.

143
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,708
But until half a year ago,
Miss Hawthorne could usually be

144
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,375
found hanging on the arm of
the victim, Mister Swallow

145
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,750
I'm sure that romantic
entanglement was the motive

146
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,458
behind this senseless murder.

147
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,875
[JUDGE] Hmm. So it was your
run-of-the mill love triangle.

148
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,166
[PHOENIX]
I object!

149
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,291
You'd better keep my
sweet Dollie out of this!

--[JUDGE] Hmm?
--[PHOENIX] You hear me?

another look at the victim

[gasping]

154
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,958
[JUDGE] Hm. Is he
holding a medicine bottle?

155
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,291
[PAYNE]
Indeed. It's Coldkiller Z,

156
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,833
an elixir that claims
it "kills colds dead."

157

[PHOENIX]
Hey, wait a second, that's mine!

158
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,666
I'd been trying to
kill this cold with it,

159
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,541
but I ended up losing the
bottle somewhere that day.

00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,458
I could swear I had it
on me till lunchtime, at least.

161
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,416
[JUDGE]
Defendant! Control yourself!

162
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
[PHOENIX]
I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,916
[MIA]
He behaves like a child.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,208
[PAYNE] Your Honor.
The defendant's fingerprints

165
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,833
were found all over the bottle,
so he's telling the truth.

166
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,750
Mere moments
before his untimely death,

167
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,416
the victim used the last
bit of his strength

168
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,125
he could muster to wrest it
from the hands of his attacker.

169
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,583
All to ensure
that the killer would be

170
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,083
identified as Phoenix Wright!

171
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,000
[PHOENIX yells]

172
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,625
His argument
carries incredible force!

173
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,541
Another thing I'd
like to mention is the watch

174
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,291
pictured here on the
victim's wrist is broken.

175
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,708
[JUDGE]
Is that so?

176
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,083
[PAYNE]
The impact from the death-blow

177
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,416
is what likely
caused it to break.

178
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
So we can take that to
mean the time of the murder

179
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,958
was exactly 3:05 PM.

180
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,833
Let us proceed to the
defendant's cross-examination.

181
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,875
State your name and occupation.

182
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,083
[PHOENIX] Gladly! My
name is Phoenix Wright!

183
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:40,708
My occupation is,
uh, accused murderer?

184
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,833
What did you do
before you were arrested?!

185
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,000
[PHOENIX]
Oh. I'm a college student!

186
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,541
[JUDGE] Mister Wright,
please tell the court

187
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,750
about the events of said day.

188
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,250
[PHOENIX] That morning,
Doug had asked me to meet him

189
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,333
behind the Pharmacology
Department at 2:45 PM.

190
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,625
We talked for a bit and then
parted ways around 3.

191
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,416
So, had you and the victim
had any previous interactions?

192
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,916
[PHOENIX]
Never. That was the first time

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,500
we'd spoken to each other.

194
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,833
He said he wanted to
talk to me about Dollie.

195
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,166
Dahlia Hawthorne. Right, Wright?

196
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,208
[PHOENIX]
Yes, Dollie, my soulmate!

197
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,750
This sweater I'm wearing
is a token of our love.

198
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,791
And she gave me
this beautiful pendant!

199
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,208
Before I met him,
she and I had lunch together!

200
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,041
She made omelets and
it was just like eating

201
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,375
a little bite of Heaven!

202
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,541
You testified that you
and the victim had a talk.

203
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,250
Was that really
all that happened?

204
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,000
[PHOENIX]
Uh, what do you mean by that?

205
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,083
Did the situation
get heated and escalate

206
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,375
into something physical?
Like shoving?

207
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,333
[PHOENIX] No way, I'm just
not that kind of person,

208
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,875
I would never lay
a finger on the guy!

209
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:38,958
[PAYNE]
Objection!

210
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,291
Please, Your Honor.

211
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,875
Go and take another look
at the crime scene photo.

212
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,708
You can see the victim
was wearing a leather jacket.

213
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,166
Upon further inspection,
we found the defendant's

214
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,208
palm print on the left breast.

215
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,208
It's there, clear as day.

216
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,458
[MIA gasps]

217
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,458
Obviously, Mister Wright,
your testimony

218
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,166
to the court is full of lies!

219
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,500
[yells, coughs]

220
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,583
Well, Wright,
what do you have to say?

221
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,083
[PHOENIX]
That's exactly what happened!

222
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,250
I'm so sorry!
I really did shove him!

223
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,458
[CROWD gasping, murmurin]

224
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,416
[JUDGE] Order in the court!
Order, please!

225
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,333
I'm shocked. This is
the first I've heard of it.

226
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,333
We're done, Mia. Might
as well stick a big fork in us.

227
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,541
Not yet. I can't
just let it end like this.

228
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,500
I can think of only one
way the defendant could have

229
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,791
left such an
unmistakable hand print.

230
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,333
He assaulted the
victim with an intent to kill!

231
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,375
[gasps]

232
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,916
[JUDGE]
Hmm. That does make sense.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,625
[MIA]
Objection!

234
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,000
[gasping]

235
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,791
[PHOENIX]
Ms. Fey?

236
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,000
Even if my client
did shove the victim,

237
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,958
the blow did not
actually cause his death.

238
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,166
This is not a murder!

239
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,500
Care to explain that, defense?

240
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,208
Look at the autopsy report.

241
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,083
It states the cause of
death was electrocution.

242
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,833
He died by electrocution?

243
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,291
Remember what
the weather was like?

244
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,625
I mean it was raining cats
and dogs the entire day.

245
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,750
[thunder cracks

246
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,208
Considering that fact,

247
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,333
it stands to reason the
most likely cause of death

248
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,791
would be a lightning strike.

249
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,208
[JUDGE]
It was an act of God?

250
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,041
This wasn't a murder after all.

251
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,541
But rather an unfortunate
freak accident!

252
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,583
Oh, brilliant
deduction, Ms. Fey.

253
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,458
[PAYNE chuckles] I wouldn't
begin the celebration yet

254
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,208
if I were you, young rookie.

255
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,375
A seasoned prosecutor
covers every base,

256
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,458
so of course I investigated
the meteorological report.

257
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,625
[MIA gasps]

258
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,166
There were, in fact,
no lightning strikes

259
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,041
in that area on the
day of the murder.

260
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,583
What? There weren't?

261
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,833
Simply look at
the crime scene photo.

262
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,208
And Mister Swallow's true cause
of death is clearly visible.

263
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,958
[MIA]
That thing. Above him.

264
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,083
Is that a severed
electric cable?

265
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,708
Precisely. Your
client heartlessly pushed

266
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,666
the victim toward that cable
hoping it would end his life.

267
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,708
Which, as we all know,
was exactly the thing

268
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,541
that killed Mister Swallow.

269
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,375
[yelps]

270
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,875
[MIA]
Was that all just a trap?

271
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,583
The prosecution has
presented a credible motive

272
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,791
and explained the method
of murder in this case.

273
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,458
Hold on. No one's proven
Wright meant to kill him!

274
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,541
Did he even know about
the severed cable?

275
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,625
[coughs]

276
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,000
It's so sad. The defense
has resorted to conjecture.

277
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,083
Very well.
I suppose I'll spare you

278
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,250
from any further desperation
and finish you off for good.

279
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,500
What do you mean by that?

280
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,250
[PAYNE]
The prosecution has a witness

281
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,083
whose testimony is unassailable.

282
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,333
[JUDGE] And who might
that be, Mister Payne?

283
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,083
This witness has
had a horrifying image

284
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,666
burned into their mind forever.

285
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,708
They actually saw
the murder as it happened.

286
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,708
[gasping]

287
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,250
[JUDGE]
Did they now?

288
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,375
[PAYNE chuckles] She has already
come up in this very trial.

289
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,083
Her name is
Miss Dahlia Hawthorne!

[MIA growls]

291

[PHOENIX] Oh, I knew
that my sweet little Dollie

292
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,583
would come and save me!

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
I call Miss Dahlia Hawthorne
to come to the witness stand!

[DAHLIA giggles]

299
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,833
I'm afraid this witness
reeks of bad news for us.

[MIA]
Hmph. I doubt that.

301
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,625
In fact, this is just the
news I've been waiting for.

302
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,500
Your time's up...

If you would be so kind--

304
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,041
Who are you, and what do you do?

305
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,541
Who, me? Well, I, uh...

306
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,000
Aww, poor thing.

307
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,041
There's no reason for you
to be nervous, sweetie.

308
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,083
Yeah! If anyone
even makes one rude remark

309
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,125
toward you, I will make
them eat their words!

310
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,875
I'll use my gavel to
teach them about respect!

311
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,833
[MIA] How comforting
that they're glaring at me

312
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,500
when they say that.

313
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,291
You're both sweet.

314
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,666
Oh, but of course.

315
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,125
It's my pleasure, dear.

316
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,750
I believe you'd asked for
her name and occupation?

317
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:41,500
[DAHLIA] Hmm. You're still
the same as ever, Mia Fey.

318
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,625
[MIA]
Hmph.

319
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,166
Oh, my. Does this mean the two
of you are already acquainted?

320
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,916
We've met, just once.

321
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,916
To answer your question,
my name is Dahlia Hawthorne.

322
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
A literature student
at Ivy University.

323
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,083
It's truly an honor
to be here in the presence

324
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,833
of such great legal minds.

325
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:00,833
I'm honored, too.

326
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,000
Yet still we try to stay humble.

327
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,958
She wasted zero time
getting the old boys

328
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,791
wrapped around her
little finger.

329
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,666
[DAHLIA] That day, I
had gone over to meet

330
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,250
sweetie Feenie
after class let out.

331
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,958
[JUDGE]
Who's that? Oh, the defendant?

332
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,875
[DAHLIA] Yes, sir. I came
across Feenie and Dougie.

333
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,666
They were having
some sort of conversation

334
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,166
behind the building.

335
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,500
I was too far to hear
what they were saying,

336
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,833
but all of a sudden Dougie got
angry and gave Feenie a big pow.

337
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,291
Say what? The victim
pow'd the defendant?

338
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,125
[DAHLIA] Yeah! I didn't see
Feenie do anything

339
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,541
to deserve it!

340
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,166
He had no choice but
to shove him back after that.

341
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,500
[DAHLIA] Poor Dougie
slammed into the utility pole

342
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,625
and snapped the electric cable.

343
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,791
I could see Dougie
get up and desperately try

344
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,000
to skedaddle his way outta
there, but Feeny followed him.

345
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,458
He ran over and shoved him
again from the back,

346
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,708
knocking him to the ground.

347
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,791
And at the exact same
moment that Dougie collapsed,

348
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,208
I heard an extremely loud,
cracking noise.

349
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,125
I thought my little
heart was going to pitter-patter

350
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,458
right out of my chest!

351
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,125
I'm pitter-pattering
just hearing about it.

352
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,125
A loud cracking noise, you say?

353
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,000
There's no doubt that what
you heard must've been

354
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,958
the victim being electrocuted.

355
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,541
[DAHLIA] All of this happened
mere moments after

356
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,041
that cable was knocked
loose and fell.

357
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,291
[MIA gasps]

358
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,916
Well then.
The witness's testimony

359
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,291
makes it crystal clear
how the murder happened.

360
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,958
And the prosecution
has also gathered

361
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,833
corroborating testimony.

362
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,458
Oh? Who'd you get that from?

363
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,791
[PAYNE] The science majors
who were conducting experiments

364
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,583
in one of the labs nearby.

365
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,875
Allow me to read
their prepared statement.

366
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,541
"Around 3 PM, all of the
electrical equipment in the lab

367
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,791
simultaneously lost power."

368
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,458
[JUDGE]
So, was there a blackout?

369
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,500
[PAYNE] Yes. There are
logs of a blackout taking

370
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,666
place at 2:55 PM.

371
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,333
The equipment
in that particular lab

372
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,375
requires high
voltage to operate.

373
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,375
Which was being supplied
by the cable that had been

374
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,750
severed at that time.

375
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,208
The defendant met with the
victim at 2:45 that afternoon.

376
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,875
And a mere ten minutes later he
had caused the untimely death

377
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,666
of poor Mister Swallow.

378
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,291
This is the shocking
truth of what happened

379
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,875
that fateful day!

380
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,833
[CROWD murmurin]

381
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,083
[JUDGE] Hmm. There's
little room for doubt.

382
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,666
Thanks for your brave
and helpful testimony.

383
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,000
Thank you.

384
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,666
I couldn't hide the truth
from you, Your Honor.

Huh?

389
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,708
[MIA] The only thing brave
about her testimony...

390
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,625
...is that she's
risking perjury!

[PAYNE]
Really? In what way?

392

[DAHLIA growls]

393
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,375
The electric cable
was severed at 2:55.

394
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,833
This must be when my client
admittedly shoved the victim.

395
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,791
But looking at
the crime scene photo.

396
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,291
We can see the victim's watch
stopped functioning at 3:05.

397
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,208
How can you explain
the ten minute gap?

In the sworn testimony
you gave the court,

401
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,041
you stated that the incident
took place mere moments

402
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,041
after the cable was
severed right?

403
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,250
I'll ask again!

404
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,333
Do you have any
reasonable explanation

405
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,541
for this discrepancy?

Tell me, Miss Hawthorne.

410
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,708
Why must you continuously
spout these lies?

in this courthouse.

[MIA] Miss Hawthorne.
You were on the scene as well,

when that terrible
incident took place.

[DAHLIA gasps]

I couldn't help but notice
who was the prime suspect.

It was you!

434

The crime that rocked this
courthouse eight months ago

438
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,916
has a link to this case.

The witness
was Dahlia Hawthorne.

[DAHLIA growls]

The end goal
of this trial today,

I found him lying prone

Anyway, the police
investigated her back then,

511
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,583

questioning is redundant.

According to the constabulary,

According to the officer I spoke
with, it was a liquid poison.

[PHOENIX] I'd been trying
to kill this cold with it,

That's when Miss Hawthorne

She knew he would take it.

So she laced it with poison.

that happened eight months ago.

[JUDGE] And where
would that be, defense?

975
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,500
[MIA] In that instance, the
poison was inside her pendant.

Which she made sure to quickly
pass along to someone else.

00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,166
She used a
similar tactic in this case

00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,541
with Mister Swallow.

981

She had seen

The argument,
Mister Swallow's accusation.

She watched as he was shoved.

986

She also saw the
severed electrical cable.

987
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,625
She realized the victim
would not remain silent

988

about her crimes.

989
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,250
So she decided to use
the cable to guarantee

990
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,333
he wouldn't tell anybody else.

991
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,250

then what do you make

of the testimony she
gave the court earlier?

How could she have done it?

995

[MIA] Well, she is
a rather frail little thing,

996
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,666
so it would take her some
time to move Swallow's body

to where she needed it.

Which explains the time
discrepancy in the testimony.

the cable falling and his death.

Another problem arose
for Miss Hawthorne.

1003
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:36,250
The defendant, who she'd seen
leaving the scene, came back.

1004
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,166
Also, because
of the power outage,

1005
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,500
the students in the lab
came out to investigate.

1006
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:42,791
Which caused her to panic.

1007
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,375
After all,

1008
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:47,250
she was carrying something she
did not want to be caught with.

1009
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,750
The bottle of
poisoned cold medicine.

1010

The police had
frisked her before,

what if they did it again?

she'd been in the last time.

Huh?

1106
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,750
The girl I loved...

1107
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:40,250
She would never have said and
done all those terrible things.

1108
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,458
[MIA sighs]

1109
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:46,583
It's tough, but learn from
this and move on.

1110
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,458
I know. You're right.

1111
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:50,958
Let me ask you this.

1112
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,458
About your job--

1113
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:55,583
Lawyers help people out whenever
they're in trouble, right?

1114
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,875
Well, that's my
personal philosophy.

1115
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:59,333
Nice.

1116
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,750
I've been taking law classes
and it's got me thinking.

1117
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,708
If I become a lawyer
there's a friend I could help.

1118
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:06,750
After meeting you,
I've made up my mind.

1119
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:07,791
Oh, really?

1120
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,916
I have! I'll study hard.

1121
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,333
I'm gonna be a lawyer for sure!
And maybe someday--

1122
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:16,291
You and I will meet again
in the courtroom!

1123
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,000
[MIA]
Hmm. Yeah.

1124
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,708
[heart monitor beeping]

1125
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:30,666
[MIA] I finally settled the
score for you, like I promised.

1126
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,958
I'll be back.

1127
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:45,208
[PHOENIX] It's been five years
since that case was closed.

1128
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,708
[PHOENIX]
I did become a lawyer.

1129
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
And I even helped my old friend.

1130
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:56,250
But... Mia's no longer with us.
She's in a better place.

1131
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:59,791
Even though she's gone,
she's here in other ways.

1132
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:02,125
And I can always
hear her in my mind.

1133
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,666
[MIA]
Phoenix.

1134
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,333
Remember to always believe in
your client, no matter what.

1135
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,125
The power of that trust
will guide you through

1136
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:11,375
the toughest cases.
Like a light in the darkness.

1137
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:44,000
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

1138
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:46,333
A broken shell weaves
a tale of memories

1139
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,458
from Mia to Maya to now.

1140
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,250
Little Pearl's journey
through her past

1141
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,791
is about to begin.

1142
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,291
Wait! I can't let her go alone!
I gotta go with her!

1143
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:57,541
Look for a new shell,
solve the mystery,

1144
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,458
and carve a path to the future!

1145
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,625
For the first time,
Pearl and I are gonna have

1146
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:04,041
an adventure together.
Let's hit the road!

1147
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,541
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

1148
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:08,916
Next Episode: "Hear the
Waves of Turnabout!"

1149
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,291
Take that!
