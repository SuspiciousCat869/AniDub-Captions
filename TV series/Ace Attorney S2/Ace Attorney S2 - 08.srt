1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:09,625
[PHOENIX] Turns out I have
an imposter who earned

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,000
a guilty plea for
a client of mine.

3
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,083
I can't let injustice
happen on my watch,

4
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:17,416
so I petitioned for a retrial
to prove her innocence.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,833
But the testimonies
given by the two star witnesses

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,791
left a bad taste in my mouth.

7
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,416
Something is definitely
rotten here.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,458
Maggey swears
she saw the killer.

9
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,041
But where did they go?

10
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,583
To get to the bottom of this,

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,458
I'm returning to the scene of
the crime to look for clues.

12
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,125
[MAYA]
Bonjour, Monsieur!

13
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,333
[PHOENIX]
Maya?

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,750
That's moi! Très Bien!

15
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,791
[MAYA] That retrial really
made things more complicated,

16
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,666
don't you think?

17
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,125
It's true,
we definitely have a lot

18
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,833
on out plate in this case.

19
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,333
The elusive second waitress,

20
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,708
and the victim's
mysterious earpiece.

21
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,875
It's strange.

22
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,250
And then there's
that whole imposter thing

23
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,833
with Fake-nix Wrong

24
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,541
I'm not sure I can
stomach that part of it.

25
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,000
By the way...
Is he the only customer?

26
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,875
Yeah, this place is so boring.

27
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,041
You should order something
to liven things up!

28
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,250
It is lunchtime.

29
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,875
So I think you should
get today's special,

30
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,416
which is the Twin-T plate!

31
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,250
Twin-T, eh?
Well, how much is that?

32
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,458
That'll be 20,
thank you kindly!

33
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,333
--No way!
--Aw, come on, Nick!

34
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,708
Be a sport and get it, please!

35
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,083
No, honestly, this
case has killed my appetite.

36
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,833
Well, this will bring it back!

37
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,416
One special coming up!
Twin-T, see-voo-play!

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,125
Hey, wait a second, Maya!

39
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,791
[MAYA] Here. Bone-apple-teeth
to you, mon-sewer.

40
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,083
Wow, this actually
looks like it could be

41
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,458
worth 20 bucks.

42
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,708
[PHOENIX groans]

43
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,250
Y'okay?

44
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,791
I think my tongue hates me now.

45
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,125
[MAYA] Oh. That explains
why this place is so empty.

46
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,041
[GUMSHOE]
Yeah, that's the number, pal!

47
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,916
Come on, come on, come on!

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,125
Now give me an eight!
I can smell it coming up!

49
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,125
I know that voice.

50
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,125
[yells]
No! I said an eight!

51
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,125
[yells

52
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,125
Hello?

53
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,125
[GUMSHOE]
Huh?

54
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,291
[gasps]

55
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,833
A little radio? Ah, I get it.

56
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,583
What exactly do you get, bub?

57
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,833
Well, from what I overheard,

58
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,541
it sounded to me like
you were listening to

59
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,125
the lottery results just now.

60
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,500
[GUMSHOE growls]

61
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,000
[PHOENIX] Knowing how
Glen Elg hit the big jackpot

62
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,916
right before he kicked the
bucket gave you an idea. Right?

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,541
Are you some kind of psychic
mind reader or something?

64
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,375
No, it was just really obvious.

65
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,791
You got me, kid.

66
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,958
I was listening to "Millionaire
Radio" where they read

67
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,208
the results, and I guess I kinda
let myself get carried away.

68
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,916
Millionaire, huh?
I could see listening to that.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,583
[GUMSHOE] It comes
on Wednesdays at 1:30

70
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:08,666
and runs for about ten minutes,
if you wanna check it out.

71
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,291
I'll buy a ticket today!

72
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,666
Good luck!

73
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,916
By the way...

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,500
Maggey didn't happen to
say anything, did she?

75
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,583
I don't recall her
saying anything, do you?

76
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,583
No, no. Not really.

77
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,416
Just tell me what
she said about me.

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,833
I can take it.

79
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,625
To be honest, we all
know you painted her

80
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,583
into a corner with the
testimony you gave the court.

81
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,000
So, after the trial...

82
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,375
I can hardly believe
that stupid ol' Dick!

83
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,291
Ugh! I hate him!

84
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,250
[yells]

85
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,708
What could I do?

86
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,000
Take it easy.

87
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,166
These things happen, pal.

88
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,791
You ain't helpin' me here, doll.

89
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,166
So, uh...

90
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,125
I assume the reason you came
here today was because

91
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,291
you wanted to question
Mr. Armstrong again.

92
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,958
Yeah. That's the chef!

93
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,375
Well, coincidentally,
that's why I'm here, too.

94
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,541
Oh, he's back in the kitchen.

95
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,666
Weird. I could swear
he was just here.

96
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,458
[MAYA] A vanity? I guess
he does his makeup here?

97
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,000
[PHOENIX]
What's all this?

98
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,916
[GUMSHOE]
Looks like aromatherapy bottles.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,625
[PHOENIX] Okay. But one of these
things is not like the others.

100
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,583
Yeah, you're right.
Doesn't even have a label.

101
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,291
[GUMSHOE]
A mystery liquid?

102
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,708
It's odorless.

103
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,500
But I'll tell you what,
I smell a rat here!

104
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,208
I'm gonna take this
back to the boys in the lab.

105
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,291
Get Byrde outta that cage!

106
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,500
See ya, pal.

107
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,166
[ARMSTRONG]
Oui-oui. Next month?

108
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,583
[VIOLA]
If you don't have it by then,

109
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,541
I'll turn your
bistro into toast.

110
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,541
[giggles]

111
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:43,166
[screams]
That won't be necessary!

112
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,208
[VIOLA]
Don't let me down.

113
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,791
Because I'll be watching you
like a hawk, doughboy.

114
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,166
[giggles]

115
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,583
[PHOENIX]
That's her.

116
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,416
Au revoir!

117
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,291

Ooh-la-la!

Sorry.

Non. Zis is who I am.

but my wings, zay are broken.

I'm at ze mercy of
the Big City Tiger!

124
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,416
Big City Tiger?

125
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,791
You must be very
careful when you need

126
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,000
to borrow a few francs
from someone, no?

127
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,541
Every time 'e
starts to yell and rage

and use me as a rug!

00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,333
[BOTH]
Like a crepe?

132
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,458
[MAYA]
The Big City Tiger sounds scary.

133
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,583
You sure you can
just leave the restaurant?

134
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,791
[MAYA] Yeah. I'm on
break until dinner time.

135
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,500
[KUDO] Hey! You think
you're too good for my seeds?

Ya lousy buncha ingrates!

What a kooky guy!

Hello!

00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,625
Argh. And now you! Hmph!

140
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,208
I hope you can forgive
me about what happened in court.

141
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,416
Well. You weren't
wrong, were ya, Wright?

142
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,333
I was so busy admiring
the waitress's figure,

143
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,916
that I didn't see her face.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,458
I'm just a dirty old man!

145
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,666
Buh-buh-birdie!
Pretty, pretty bird!

146
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,958
Okay, then.
Work your magic, Maya.

147
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,166
Hey, sir. What do you say you
and I have a teeny little chat?

148
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,916
With a "teeny little" girl?

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,541
No, thank you.
Run along and play on the slide.

150
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,541
Ow!

151
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,666
[PHOENIX]
Didn't take the bait.

152
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,208
[MIA]
Excuse me. Do you have a moment?

153
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,291
Huh?

154
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,208
Have all the time
you want missy!

155

Mia?

156
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,666
Good. Thank you.

157
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,166
I hope you don't mind talking
to me for a few minutes.

158
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,000
Sure. I'm Victor Kudo,
nice to meet ya.

159
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,625
That trial must've
been so hard on you.

160
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,041
You bet yer tookis.

161
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,291
No matter what anyone says,
I know what I saw!

162
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,875
That waitress put
some kinda white powder

163
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,750
in the young lad's javaccino!

164
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,333
The poor sap
listened to his earphone

165
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,458
while he gulped it
down none the wiser.

166
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,708
Yeah. It was in his left ear!

167
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,916
[PHOENIX]
He doesn't seem to be lying.

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,708
[KUDO]
Don't stare at me like that!

169
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,791
I know, I'm just
an inconvenience!

170
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,541
At home, at that restaurant.

171
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,916
All I'm good for
is running errands!

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,708
Oh, errands, you say?

173
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,916
Sure's you're born.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,708
On that very day the
unlucky lad met his end.

175
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,625
Did somebody ask
you to do something for them?

176
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,541
Yeah. That pasty chef!

177
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,666
Excusez-moi!

178
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,708
Call zee policemen,
s'il vous plait, pépé!

179
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,041
Whole thing had me
feeling like a deer

180
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,375
in the headlights.

181
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,666
But I ran outta there
just like he asked me to.

182
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,916
I needed to find
a pay phone, ya see.

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,125
[PHOENIX] Why didn't
you use your cell phone?

184
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,333
I don't trust those
new-fangled thingies.

185
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,333
What then?
Did you find one quickly?

186
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,541
'Fraid not. I ran around
looking for ten minutes or so.

187
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,875
That long?

188
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,291
And Maggey was passed out,
so the chef was alone.

189
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,083
[KUDO] Gotta say,
that definitely ruined

190
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,791
my javaccino time.

191
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,375
[MIA]
Your javaccino time?

192
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,083
[KUDO] My daily routine is to
enjoy a nice cup of javaccino

193
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,166
at 2 PM sharp every day.

194
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,833
That chef's got no sense.

195
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,250
If you're carryin'
around that kinda debt,

196
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,208
you should value your regulars!

197
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,291
[PHOENIX] Wait. You know
about Armstrong's debt?

198
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,750
Sure do. And I recently
heard he let it blow up

199
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,916
to 500,000 smackerooneys.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,208
Five hundred grand?!

201
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,750
[KUDO] And then he
wants to cry about it

202
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,541
bein' "society's fault."

203
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,583
[PHOENIX] It's obviously
his cooking skills.

204
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,500
[KUDO] Well, he borrowed
from the Tiger,

205
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,250
so he shoulda seen this coming.

206
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,333
That name again.

207
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,791
[KUDO]
If you're in dire straits,

208
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,875
don't make the mistake of
goin' to the Tender Lender.

209
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,333
You don't say.

210
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,125
Is that this "Tiger's" business?

211
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,375
That it is.

212
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,000
But make no mistake--
he's just a loan shark.

213
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,541
[MIA]
Thank you very much.

214
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,541
--I appreciate your help.
--[yells]

215
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,583
Well, sir.

216
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,041
Can you tell us where to
find this "Tender Lender?"

217
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,375
[VIOLA]
You're here to discuss a loan.

218
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,375
Is that right?

219
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,541
Yes, we are.

220
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,750
The office manager
is away at the moment.

221
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,041
So I hope you don't
mind waiting a bit.

222
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,208
[giggles]

223
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,458
[PHOENIX] Yeah. That's
who we saw at Très Bien earlier.

224
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,083
[clattering]

225
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,166
[PHOENIX]
Hmm?

226
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,333
[PHOENIX]
Maya! What are you doing?

227
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,208
This is our
only chance! Come on.

228
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,833
How are we gonna find any clues
if we don't start looking?

229
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,541
Is this a good idea?

230
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,166
So much junk.
Where do we start?

231
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,708
[PHOENIX]
Hold on.

232
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,125
That the CD Maggey
told us about?

233
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,583
[MAGGEY] No, it said
"MC"-something on it in marker.

234
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,875
[PHOENIX]
Hmm.

235
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,958
What's that?

236
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,125
This appears
to be a work invoice

237
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,916
from a car body shop.

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,291
Whoa, that is a lot of money!
That's crazy!

239
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,000
[MAYA] The car's registered
to the Cadaverini Group.

240
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,500
[PHOENIX]
Cadaverini?

241
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,583
Hey, I noticed this earlier.

242
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,291
Don't you think this
suit looks a lot like

243
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,875
the one you always wear?

244
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,875
[PHOENIX]
Yeah. Hm? What the heck?

245
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,375
[MAYA]
A badge like yours.

246
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,125
[PHOENIX] But it's cardboard!
And nobody noticed?

247
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,791
[TIGRE]
Hey! What's goin' on?!

248
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,083
How come you two is
snoopin' around my office?!

249
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,416
Huh?!

250
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,750
Guess you figured
it out, didja tough guy?

251
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,041
The Big City Tiger?

252
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,833
I didn' expect the
genuine article to show up.

253
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,208
So you're the imposter?

254
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,333
Say what?!

255
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,666
[MAYA whimpers]

256
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,208
Just calm down.

257
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,250
[TIGRE] Yeah? How'm I s'posed
ta be calm when there's ash

258
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,375
all over my Persian rug?

259
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,541
Was it you?!

260
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,916
No, I had nothing
to do with it, I swear!

261
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,125
Listen, boul.

262
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,333
I'm gonna pummel you
flatter than a pancake,

263
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,541
then use youse as my new rug!

I'm sorry.

[TIGRE gasps]

267
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,958
Look. I accidentally
knocked over

268
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,916
the ashtray earlier.

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,125
[TIGRE growls]

270
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,166
[PHOENIX]
Oh, man. What am I gonna do?

271
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,000
Now he's gonna
pancake her instead.

272
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,583
It's okay,
I'm just glad you didn't

273
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,958
hurt yourself doin' it.

274
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,208
You know I could never
get angry at you, Violetta.

275
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,708
[PHOENIX]
What happened to the pancaking?

276
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,625
Huh? What was that?

277
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,750
[PHOENIX]
Nothing!

278
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,416
Well... Don Tigre
and I are lovers.

279
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,875
He's very tender with me.

280
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,458
Did you call him Don Tigre?

281
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,375
Yeah! We're
cuckoo for each other!

282

Got it?

[MAYA whimpers]

284
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,833
As a matter of fact, I owe
this incredible man my life.

285
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,666
You see, I came awfully
close to dying recently.

287

You almost died?

288

Yes, but I was saved by
my knight in shining armor.

289
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,541
He gave up everything for me.

291
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:17,291
I'm so happy now. Don Tigre.

[GUMSHOE]
The Tender Lender?

300
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,166
You might as well kiss your
keister goodbye, cupcake.

301
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,583
I didn't borrow money.

302
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,833
Even for a loan shark,
that operation is super fishy.

303
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,041
And they've had some
sort of trouble lately.

304
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,541
I hear they've been
extra heavy-handed

on calling in their debts.

306
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,333
So, uh... Do you
know who the gloomy lady

307
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,333
we met at the office
could've been?

308
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,333
Yeah. Viola Cadaverini.

309
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,750
Wait a second.

310
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,250
That was the name
I saw on the invoice!

311
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,000
[GUMSHOE] She's the
only living granddaughter

of Bruto Cadaverini.

00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,083
[PHOENIX]
Should I know who that guy is?

314
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,500
[GUMSHOE] Head of the
Cadaverini crime family.

Controls all the black
market cash in the city.

316
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,791
He's got the Tiger by his tail,
and his you-know-whats.

317
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,166
He sounds scary.

318
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,416
I'm glad we ran into her
instead of her grandfather.

319
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,000
He's about
as tough as they come,

320
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,833
but he sure has one
heck of a soft spot

321
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,291
for that little girl of his.

322
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,125
Hey. Speaking of the Tiger,

323
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,791
the victim borrowed some
scratch from him, too.

324
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,958
How much we talkin'?

325
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,416
[GUMSHOE]
It was around a hundred grand.

326
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,666
[gasps]

327
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,416
Apparently, he was
a big-time gambler

328
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,166
and that's where
all the money went.

329
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,625
Stupid, but kinda gutsy.

330
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,666
Wait, didn't he
win 500,000 big ones

331
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,166
in the lottery that day?

332
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,583
Five hundred grand! I won!

333
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,916
Some guys really
do have all the luck.

334
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
[PHOENIX] But... What was he
planning to do if he didn't win?

335
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,416
He'd racked up
some serious debt.

336
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,416
[GUMSHOE] Well, according
to his coworkers,

337
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,541
he said he was gonna use his
skills to pay those bills.

338
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,708
[PHOENIX]
What do you mean?

339
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,166
It seems that the
victim had programmed

340
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,000
a nasty computer virus.

341
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,416
What was he gonna do with it?

342
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
If you can create one
with enough wallop to it,

343
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,208
that sucker can
fetch you millions

344
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,666
on the black market, easily.

345
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,083
Now we're talkin'!

346
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,875
Our boy was top of his
game, as far as programmers go.

347
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,541
[PHOENIX] I've never been
savvy with computers myself.

348
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,375
[GUMSHOE] I think
the virus he had written

349
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,875
was called MC-something.

350
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,083
Oh. Was it MC Pipe wrench?

351
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,750
It was MC Bomber, wasn't it?

352
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,958
Yeah, you're right.

353
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,666
It was MC Bomber!

354
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,250
[PHOENIX]
So that CD actually contained

355
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,000
the virus that Glen Elg wrote.

356
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,625
Dunno if this'll help ya,

357
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,583
but it looks like the victim
was planning to meet up

358
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,333
with somebody the day
he kicked his oxygen habit.

359
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,958
Can you tell me who it was?

360
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,125
[GUMSHOE] Sorry, but
I couldn't figure that out.

361
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,541
Aw, man.
I'm sure you tried hard.

Oh, yeah. Hey, kid.

There's something
else I had for ya.

Ooh! Wonder what it is!

Hang on. Well, actually.

366
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,458
It's for Maggey!

367

[PHOENIX, MAYA]
Huh?

368
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,291
[MAYA]

Got up early this
morning to make it for her.

370
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,333
I've been worried
because I could tell

I could eat a buttload

So please, be a pal

I really wanted to
talk to you about.

Yes, what?

Well, it's concerning
the old man's testimony.

At the time
I took the coffee over to

there was another customer

It was a car accident.

Four months ago, a motorbike
ran out in front of my car,

[VIOLA whimpers]

478
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,000
[TIGRE] This is that
gloomy bitch's fault!

479
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:11,208
[VIOLA] You're right.
It's because of who I am.

480
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,708
My operation was pretty cheap.

481
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,208
Wait. Hold on.

482
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,875
But didn't you say it
was super expensive?

483
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,375
A million dollars.

484
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,583
Eh?!

485
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,958
The majority
of that money was

486
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,083
for "compensation," though.
Punishment.

487
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,666
[PHOENIX] Tigre had
to pay for the accident.

488
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,875
The pieces are
falling into place.

489
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,583
[VIOLA]
I wanted it to be real.

490
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,750
I wanted to believe
that he loved me.

491
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,708
That it wasn't because
of my grandfather.

492
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,791
I tried to convince myself.

493
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,750
Even though it was a lie.
I just wanted it so badly.

494
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,000
Viola...

495
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,916
And so I did every
possible thing I could.

496
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,916
To help Don get back
on his feet again.

497
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,041
I... I'm sorry.

498
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,041
[sobs]

499
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,958
Where are you going?

500
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,750
Take these. They may help you.

501
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,333
What's in here?

502
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:23,708
Don Tigre. Watch your back.

503
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,083
Huh?

504
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,500
[PHOENIX gasps]

505
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,916
That was such
a depressing story.

506
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,083
[PHOENIX]
Look. Viola's medical records.

507
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,000
[MAYA]
Why did she give those to us?

508
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,750
[VIOLA]
Don Tigre. Watch your back.

509
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,083
Watch your back, huh?

510
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,916
Maybe. Check the back?

511
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,166
[PHOENIX]
Hmm.

512
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,166

Huh?

515
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,875
[TIGRE]
Hey! You two punks again?

516
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,333
Whatchu got, huh? Lemme see it.

517
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,416
Uh, Nick, what are
we gonna do now?

518
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,375
What'd that dumb broad give you?

519
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,583
Just cuz her
grandpop's the boss,

520
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,791
she thinks she's hot stuff.
Hand that over!

521
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,041
Not a chance. You've no right!

522
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,541
Huh?! Youse wanna
play games wid me?!

523
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,541
[GUMSHOE]
Hold it!

Detective Gumshoe?

[MAYA gasps]

529
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,416
Huh? A detective?

530
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,166
You ain't gonna stop me, copper!

Leave this guy to me!

You sure you got this?

534
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,666
Just get outta here!

535
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,291
You gotta save Maggey!

536
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,833
If you don't,
she'll be convicted.

537
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,708
Count on us. Let's go.

538
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,958
Yeah!

539
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,208
[PHOENIX] There are two things
I consider inexcusable.

540
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,875
Poisoning and betrayal.

541
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:52,208
They're the cowardly acts,
and the most hurtful crimes.

542
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,625
I'm going to settle
this in court tomorrow!

543
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,458
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

544
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,416
I'm getting closer to
the truth, I can feel it.

545
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,708
The Tiger, who
pretended to be me.

546
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,833
The bottle found at Très Bien.

547
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,375
Mr. Armstrong's debt
to a loan shark.

548
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,583
The truth behind MC Bomber.

549
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,458
The other man Maggey saw.

550
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,708
It must have been...

551
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,083
Yes!

552
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,333
Everything will be revealed
in the upcoming trial.

553
