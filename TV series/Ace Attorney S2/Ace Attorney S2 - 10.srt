1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,083
[PHOENIX] I'm Phoenix Wright,
attorney-at-law,

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,250
and my next case takes
place in a peculiar venue.

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,458
A luxury express train, shooting
northward through the snow--

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,000
The Silver Star.

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,708
Inside its exquisite dining car,
a trial is about to begin.

6
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,708
It's a bizarre setting, but
my extremely unusual client

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,083
fits right in.

8
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,625
If you'd come to order,

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,708
court is now in session
for the trial of fugitive

10
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,333
Avery Richman!

11
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,541
[PHOENIX] December 31:
Maya and I have been invited

12
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,791
to ring in the New Year
with a luxurious trip

13
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,166
on the maiden voyage of
a one of a kind railway liner.

14
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,708
Now. The moment you've
been waiting for.

15
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,291
We're proud to bring you the
ultimate in first-class travel.

16
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,333
Ladies and gentlemen--
The Silver Star Express!

17
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,375
This train is a
labor of love, folks.

18
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,750
Love for the elegance of the
steam-powered locomotive,

19
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,208
and Japan itself.

20
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,625
A gift to our society from
the Goldstruck Republic's

21
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:39,500
prominent tycoon, Avery Richman!

22
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,500
Mr. Richman sends his blessings.

23
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,916
Sadly, he couldn't be here to
celebrate this occasion with us,

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,750
but regardless, we'll be
departing soon, so all aboard!

25
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,750
This is so cool!
A luxury choo-choo train!

26
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,833
I think it's all
very nostal-chic.

27
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,708
I think you mean nostal-gic.

28
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,625
Ooh! Come on!
Let's climb on board, Nick!

29
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,291
[GUMSHOE]
Whoa, you two again?

30
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,375
[MAYA gasps]

31
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,791
[PHOENIX]
Hello, Detective Gumshoe.

32
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,541
[MAYA]
Hello, Judge. Judge?

33
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,541
Hello. Nice day.

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,166
We both sent in
a postcard and won a trip!

35
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going on an
all-expenses paid tour of

36
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,041
the hot springs up north on
board this old-timey train!

37
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,833
Yeah? We got an invitation!

38
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,625
With a fancy wax seal!

39
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,875
Wha--? Personally invited?

40
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,458
So which car are you two in?

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,208
We'll be right up front
in the first one.

42
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,166
They put us back in car 3.

43
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,125
We should totally meet up later!

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,125
Here.

45
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,500
Thank you very much, young lady.

46
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,250
Miss Maya Fey and
Mister Phoenix Wright,

47
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,500
welcome to the Silver Star.

48
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,125
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

49
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,208
My name is Rick and I'll be
your attendant on this journey.

50
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,750
[MAYA]
Pleasure to meet you, too!

51
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,250
I see you'll be staying
in the Sakura Room today.

52
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,708
The Sakura Room?

53
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,125
Ah! Even the name screams
"traditional elegance!"

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,458
I can't wait to see inside!

55
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:06,166
[MAYA giggles]
It's absolutely beautiful!

56
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,000
Wow, we get our own compartment.

57
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:12,208
[MAYA giggles]
This is great! Travel in style!

58
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,291
[PHOENIX sighs]
Very nice.

59
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,958
I'm so happy you like it!

60
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,583
Mister Richman had the idea
for a private rail line.

61
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,958
So he bought an unused one
and gave us the Silver Star.

62
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,083
We take great
pride in the design.

63
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,833
Its retro look is inspired by
the old steam engine trains

64
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,375
from the 1950s.

65
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,708
[GUMSHOE gasps]

66
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,750
[RICK] No detail inside or
out has been overlooked.

67
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,333
Although the styling harkens
back to an earlier time,

68
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,250
the train's engines
and propulsion system

69
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,250
are cutting edge technologies.

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,541
By the way.
In case you're interested.

71
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,500
Every single crew member
aboard hails from

72
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,875
Mister Richman's homeland.

73
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,500
[MAYA]
Oh, that means you, too?

74
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,708
Yes. I'm originally from
the Goldstruck Republic.

75
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,625
I hear Mister Richman's really
into Japanese culture.

76
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,166
And he even recently became
a naturalized citizen.

77
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,416
[RICK]
That's true.

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,666
Ah. That explains
why there's a Sakura Room.

79
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,625
This railway is
a coming together of a lot

80
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,541
of Mister Richman's interests.

81
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,000
His dreams.

82
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,125
We hope your journey
is a pleasant one.

83
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,125
Wow, this is really
something else.

84
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,666
Makes ya wonder why someone
like you got an invitation.

85
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,291
I mean, I never had
a clue that you were

86
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,041
such a big shot, Nick.

87
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,083
Yeah, it's kinda funny
you mention that.

88
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,750
I don't have any sort of
connection to Mr. Richman.

89
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,750
So I'm actually at a loss
as to why I was invited.

90
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,083
I guess it is a mystery
why he'd ask some nobody.

91
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,208
[PHOENIX gasps]

92
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,958
Anyway, let's look around.

93
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,500
Explore a bit!

94
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,416
Hurry up!

95
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,416
[PHOENIX sighs]

96
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,750
Of course, sir.

97
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,416
Pardon me. Where is
the Chrysanthemum Room?

98
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,791
[RICK]
Follow me, sir.

99
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,458
Long time no see.

100
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,083
Yes, indeed.

101
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,208
[RICK]
Having a look around?

102
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,625
You know it!

103
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,041
[RICK]
Nice! Have fun!

104
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,041
Here we are, sir.

105
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,500
I appreciate it.

106
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,375
[BOTH gasp]

[VOICE A]
Attention, all units!

109
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,750
The fugitive has escaped the
flight and is still at large.

110
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,000
Set up checkpoints
on every transportation system

111
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,041
in the area.

112
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,666
If you do encounter
the fugitive,

113
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,541
please exercise extreme
caution when approaching.

114
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,583
We cannot risk the
safety of civilians.

[COP A] Looks like
there's a nasty storm

coming our way tonight.

117
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,208
[COP B] Yeah, that's not
gonna make this any easier.

118
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,083
We've definitely got
our work cut out for us.

119
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,791
[COP A] Last thing we need
is a diplomatic crisis.

120

[MAYA] Hey, we're right
next to the dining car!

121
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,958
That's pretty convenient!

[BOTH gasp]

123
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,458
[PHOENIX] Wonder if the
food's as rich as the décor.

124
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,083
[REGINA]
I didn't know. We can't do it.

[ATTENDANT A] But we
have specific orders from

126
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,875
Mister Richman that
we're to meet all

127
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,791
the passengers' demands.
No matter what they may be.

128
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,541

Well, if that's the case,
please come this way.

Thanks.

132

After receiving the invitation,

141
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,500
I did a little digging
into Mister Avery Richman.

142
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,083
Not like I hadn't heard of him.

143
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,875
He's one of the
world's wealthiest men,

144
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,791
and he'd made the news when
he became a Japanese citizen

145
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,416
and purchased an
entire railroad line.

146

[gasps]
What's that?

147

Ahoy, Steel Samurai.

00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,583
Come again?

149
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,958
Pretty cool, huh?

150
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,041
But what's even cooler
is that it's a transceiver!

151
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,500
Yeah, but what are
we gonna do with transceivers?

152
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,083
[MAYA]
Isn't that obvious?

153
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,000
We're gonna play bomb squad.

154
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,958
Oh. You don't say?

155
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,625
Come in, Vanguard, tell me
you've found the bomb. Over.

a red wire and a blue one.

What do we do? Please! Help!

death over in the United States?

Really?

329
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,208
Yes. One year ago,
I did stand trial for murder.

330
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,125
And that travesty of
justice was held in

331
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,750
an American court of law.

332
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,333
They declared me guilty.

333
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,375
Then why are you in Japan now?

334
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,375
I was in the process
of being transferred

335
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,833
to a Japanese prison.

336
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,250
I see.

337
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,791
Because you had become a
naturalized citizen of Japan.

338
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,833
They decided to
extradite you back home.

339
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,333
That's correct.

340
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,416
I was ordered to return to
Japan to carry out my sentence.

341
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,416
But I managed
to escape from the airport,

342
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,416
and now I stand before
you aboard the Silver Star.

343
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,958
Exactly how I had
been planning all along.

344
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,208
So. It's part
of some larger plot?

345
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,875
Yes. I have spent
innumerable hours

346
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,083
formulating my method of escape.

347
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,958
Of course, there's
no way I could've pulled off

348
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,666
such an elaborate scheme alone.

349
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,875
That's the reason I have

350

so many trustworthy
companions at my side.

351

Every single one of them
is from my true homeland,

Their belief in my innocence
has remained steadfast

354

throughout this ordeal.

355

And they have supported
me every step of the way.

My gratitude to them
knows no bounds.

they're all your accomplices.
