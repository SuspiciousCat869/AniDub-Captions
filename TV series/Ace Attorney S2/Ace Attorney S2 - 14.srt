and sometimes the ones

Hey, what's up?

00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,958
Sorry to bug you, but
I need to ask you for the favor

11
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,583

Let me see what you've got.

00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,166
Yeah, okay.

16
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,416
[PEARL] I need to find
another one just like this.

17
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,708
But one that's not broken.

18
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,875
[PEARL]
Mm-hmm.

19
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,916
It's one of my most
prized possessions.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,375
But it slipped out of
my hands and shattered.

21
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,791
[PHOENIX]
That's too bad.

22
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:41,000
But the worst part is,
I can't hear the waves anymore!

23
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,333
What do you mean?

24
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,041
Before, whenever I
held this shell up to my ear,

25
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,541
I could always hear the
sound of the waves inside.

26
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,041
I hate to say it,
but that is pretty big hole.

27
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,458
I know. I looked, but I couldn't
ever find the missing piece.

28
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,375
So I came here today
to ask you to help me find

29
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,625
a new shell like this one!

30
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,875
Yeah. I'm sorry, but I've never
seen this kind of shell.

31
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,125
Is something wrong?

32
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,416
No. Nothing.

33
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,916
It's weird.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,958
But I feel like I do recognize
this thing from somewhere.

35
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,125
I heard it was
a special seashell.

36
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,666
And it can only be found
at one particular beach.

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,916
Oh?

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,750
Do you happen to know
which one that would be?

39
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,250
[PEARL]
Not really.

40
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,625
But I do have some
clues that might help us.

41
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,916
[PHOENIX] Huh. Did Maya
write this for you?

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,083
[PEARL]
Yeah, she did.

43
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,375
I think they're supposed
to be directions.

44
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,833
[PHOENIX] Well, then
we should probably ask her.

45
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,000
[PEARL gasps]

46
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,208
[PHOENIX]
Ah, but she's not here today.

47
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,833
She had something
important come up.

48
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,375
--But...
--[PEARL] No!

49
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,666
Please promise me that you won't
tell Mystic Maya about this!

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,916
[PHOENIX]
O... kay.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
[PEARL]
Also, we have to find it today!

[PHOENIX groans]

53
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:59,458
[PHOENIX gasps]
Hang on. I've got an idea.

54
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,791
[PEARL]
What is it?

55
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,750
[cell phone beeping]

56
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,958
Bingo. Just as I suspected.

00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,583
All right, kiddo.

00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,250
You ready to go beachcombing?

59
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,625
So this big ol' shell
is pretty important to you.

60
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,125
Yes, very.

61
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,333
It's a special treasure that
Mystic Maya herself gave me.

62
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,625
Oh, did she now?

63
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,166
Yeah.

64
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,625
[PEARL] Mother,
what kind of bird is that?

65
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,041
[MORGAN]
It's a kite.

66
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,000
They like to swoop down
and steal fried foods.

67
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,666
So be careful when
they're around.

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,791
Oh... You sure do know
about a lot of things.

69
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,250
[MORGAN]
And one of those things

70
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,750
is that it's time for lunch.

71
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,583
[PEARL] Okay. I'll go
and get Mystic Maya.

Ah? Mystic Maya! I'm sorry.

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,208
I came into your room
without permission.

78
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,041
I don't care. Did you
find something interesting?

Kinda. What is this?

80
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,375

A shell.

you've never seen one.

You find them on the
beach or in the ocean.

84

And what's... the ocean?

Look. This is the ocean.

S'Pretty. It doesn't look real.

going on and on and on forever.

Yeah. I felt the exact same way

when I saw it
for the first time.

91
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,750
It made me realize that
the world is a huge place!

[MAYA] I mean the world
outside Kurain Village.

00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,333
Huh? But I thought...

95
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,333
...that there actually wasn't
anything outside of the village.

96
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,541
Nothing besides the mountains.

97
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,500
'Cause. That's
what mother told me.

98
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,500
[MAYA] Heh. Uh-uh.
The ocean is incredible.

99
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,041
People call it
the cradle of life,

100
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,875
because that's where
all life came from.

101
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,500
All from there?

102
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,625
[MAYA] Yeah, the mountains
rose from it, fish of course,

103
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,708
and life that eventually
became people.

104
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,791
A long time ago, even our
village was part of the ocean.

105
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,750
Oh, wow. That's cool.

106
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,416
I can hardly believe it!

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,041
[MAYA] Hey, Pearls, do you
wanna see it for yourself?

108
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,625
Yeah, yeah, I would love to!

109
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,083
But how?

110
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,333

Just leave it all to Maya!

is only Kurain Village

been told my entire life.

Your mother may
have been a bit overprotective.

116

So asking to see the ocean

117
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:03,625
was totally pointless.
There's no way they'd let me go.

Absolutely not!

I cannot allow
Pearl to take a single step

121
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,791
outside of the village.

122

[MAYA] Oh. Well. The Dedication
Ceremony's coming up.

123
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,333
How about I take her
with me this year?

124
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,625
[MORGAN] Only the head of the
main family is allowed to leave

125
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,708
the village, once per year.

126
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,750
That's an ironclad rule
of the Kurain,

127
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,041
and one I should not
have to remind you of.

128
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,041
I'm aware of what the rules are.

129
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,625
But Mom and Mia both said
we need to see the world.

130
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,250
That we must keep
learning new things and--

131
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,958

discussion to be over

speak such nonsense.

Wait a sec!

Okay, now let's see
if my hunch was right after all.

142
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,291
Oh, yeah! You ready to go?

Hmm? Yes!

[PHOENIX chuckes]

145

[PEARL] Are you sure that
we should be doing this?

Yep. I'm positive!

you the ocean, didn't I?

Yeah.

to be our little secret.

So you gotta swear you
won't tell your mom, okay?

00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,458
[PEARL]
I swear I won't say anything.

152

You don't say.

I didn't know this
was the anniversary.

155

Yep! That's the reason why I was
so insistent on us coming out

00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,666
[gasps]

160
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,791
Oh, wow. It's huge.

161
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,625
I'm so glad you
could be here to see this.

162
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,375
[PEARL]
Thank you, Mystic Maya.

163
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,416
[PEARL] I'll start looking
for another one around here,

164
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,916
so if you could look
over in that area,

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
we might have better luck.

166
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,166
[PHOENIX]
Got it!

167
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,750
[MORGAN] Unbelievable!
What were you thinking?!

168
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,500
As a candidate
for the head of the family,

169
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,958
you should know
better than this!

170
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,458
--[PEARL whimpers]
--[MAYA] Yes, ma'am...

171
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,250
And the fact that you
took her out of the village

172
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,541
without so much as telling
anybody makes this worse.

173
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,208
What if something
had happened to her?

174
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,500
I'm sorry, Aunt Morgan.
I shouldn't have.

175
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,041
[MORGAN]
Good grief.

176
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,625
Obviously, the rotten apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

177
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,833
[MAYA]
Huh?

178
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,750
[MORGAN] Think about
what befell your mother!

179
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,666
I mean, when she broke the rules
and got involved with outsiders,

180
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,125
how did that turn out for her?

181
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,708
After she almost ruined
the Kurain school's reputation,

182
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,791
she vanished and left me
to take care of you.

183
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,208
But the only
reason she left was to

184
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,375
make things better for u--

185
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,333
[MORGAN]
Not to mention Mystic Mia.

186
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,166
She left the village saying that
she wanted to become a lawyer.

187
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,708
Can you imagine the selfishness?

188
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,916
No, you're wrong!

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,416
She left because she's
trying to find leads

190
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,958
on what happened to Mom!

191
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,041
You women of the main family
are an embarrassment

192
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,416
to the entire clan!

193
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,500
[MAYA whimpers]

194
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,000
[PEARL] Mother! Mystic Maya was
just trying to be nice to me.

195
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,541
Don't worry, little Pearl.

196
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,375
You didn't know what you
were doing was wrong,

197
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,166
so I'm not angry with you.

198
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,208
I hope you realize

199
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,916
she's much more
powerful than you.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,666
The only reason you have
any standing over her

201
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,500
is because of your blood!
Never forget that!

202
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,291
[PEARL]
Mystic Maya...

203
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,125
Hey, it's you.

204
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,041
[PEARL] I'm sorry.
You got in trouble

205
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,041
because I was being selfish.

206
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,458
[MAYA] Mm-mm. I was the
one who invited you

207
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,208
to come with me, remember?

208
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,416
You have nothing
to apologize for.

209
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,583
Wait just a second, okay?

210
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,833
[PEARL]
It's the shell!

211
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,416
[MAYA]
This is very special,

212
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,958
because there's only one beach
around where you can find it.

213
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,166
[PEARL gasps]

214
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,458
[MAYA] Hey, you should put
it up to your ear and listen.

215
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,666
[PEARL]
Whoa! I can hear something.

216
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,375
[waves crashing]

217
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,708
[MAYA]
It's the waves.

218
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,000
This shell is filled with
the sound of the ocean.

219
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,333
[PEARL]
Wow, that's amazing.

220
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,250
[MAYA]
You know... You should have it!

221

[PEARL]
Really? Are you sure?

222
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,916
[MAYA]
Mm-hmm. To remember this day!

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,125
The sound of the ocean will
take you back to the beach

224
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,458
whenever you want.

225
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,750
[PEARL gasps]
That is so sweet.

226
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,291
Thank you, Mystic Maya.

228

[PHOENIX] Your special
seashell is pretty hard to find.

229
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,625
[PEARL] I can't believe that
I just dropped it like that.

230
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,083
How am I gonna face
Mystic Maya again?

231
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,625
Luckily, Maya is
the understanding

232
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,958
and forgiving type.

233
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,875
Is that a shrine?

234
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,833
Looks like a pretty old one.

235
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,875
Since we're here, why don't
we ask the gods for help?

236
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,250
[PEARL]
Okay.

237
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,791

find that special seashell.

Uh. What are you doing here?

Are you asking me?

I mean the real question is what
are the two of you doing here?

And how in the world
did you find this place?

Oh, yeah! There's a super

Ugh! It's so unfair!

Well, that's too bad.

Who me? I'm surprised
Pearls didn't tell you.

It's the annual
Dedication Ceremony.

I don't know what that is.

This is the day

when the head of the
Kurain visits that shrine

273
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,041
near the cliffs to
perform a ritual that

274
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,250
returns spirits
back to the ocean.

I actually let little Pearls

Oh, Well, uh...

00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,791
I'm kinda curious
as to how you were able

00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,333
to find this beach.

This helped a little.

283
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,791
Whoa! I wrote all that,
like, a couple of years ago.

284
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,708
[PHOENIX] McSopp's Fables

285
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,416

They're one of
my all-time favorites!

Something about their broth
is completely out of this world!

I saw these names
and made the connection.

That this had to be a list of
all the noodle shops on the way

from the station to the beach.

291
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,458
So then I looked up
coastal towns that had

292
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,500
these places, and here we are.

293

00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,875
you can hear the
sound of the waves!

316
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,333
[PEARL whimpers]

317
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,458
[MAYA]
Ah, what a beautiful memory!

318
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,625
[PEARL] Um... I gotta go
take care of something!

319
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,875
You two have fun!

320
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,041
[MAYA]
Pearls!

321
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,791
I need to ask you something.

322
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,416
You gave that seashell
to Pearl, didn't you?

323
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,333
[MAYA]
Mm-hmm. A few years ago.

324
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,208
[MERCHANT 14A]
Here ya go! Two wave specials!

325
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,125
[PHOENIX yelps]
Seriously?

326
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,583
Ooh! Didn't I tell you
this was worth the wait?

327
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,541
I mean it's not every day that
you can eat a yummy bowl

328
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,333
of noodles out of a huge shell!

329
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,708
[PHOENIX]
So that's what it was!

330
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,791
Huh? What do you mean,
what is what was?

331
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,833
[MAYA] Okay, so you guys
came all the way out here

332
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,166
looking for a shell.
Pearls could've just told me.

333
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,916
[PHOENIX] Man. I can't believe
this is really the case.

334
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,166
No wonder we couldn't find one.

335
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,958
Well, now that
it's all figured out,

336
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,250
I can give this one to Pearls!

337
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,375
Wait up.

338
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,291
Could you let me
handle this, instead?

339
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,750
[MAYA] She gave me
the shell so I'd remember

340
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,583
our time here together.

341
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,708
[PEARL whimpers]

342
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,250
[PEARL sobs]

343
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,458
[PHOENIX]
Hey, Pearl.

344
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,791
Oh. Hey there, Mister Nick.

345
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,125
Well. You have any luck?

346
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,583
Not really.

347
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,708
It's fine. Look here.

348
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,833
[gasps]

349
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,083
[gasps]
Where did you--?

350
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,458
It's exactly like this one!

351
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,666
[MAYA]
Pretty amazing find, huh Pearls?

352
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,125
Yeah. Incredible!

353
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,625
Maya actually just
found it a few minutes ago.

354
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,750
[PEARL]
Mm-hmm.

355
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,000
Nick told me that
you were out looking

356
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,500
for another one.

357
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,458
I'm sorry that the
old shell broke.

358
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,958
But this new one will
let you hear the sound

359
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,708
of the ocean again.

360
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,500
Great news, don't you think?

361
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,791
[PEARL whimpers]

362
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,791
[PEARL sniffs]

363
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,541
Pearls? Why are you crying?

364
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,791
[PEARL]
I'm so sorry about all of this.

365
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,125
Thank you for finding
this new shell for me.

366
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,000
It's so nice of you and
I really appreciate it.

367
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,583
But the truth is...

368
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,291
...I wanna keep this one!

369
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,833
I had no idea that
it was holding so many

370
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,166
important things inside of it.

371
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,958
Things that really
mean a lot to me.

372
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,708
It's filled with Mystic Maya

373
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,041
and Mystic Mia's
memories together.

374
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,166
I wish I hadn't broken it.

375
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,458
And that you could still
hear the ocean sounds.

376
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,458
It's not perfect,
but I love it very much!

377
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,250
I want to keep it forever!

378
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,250
So sweet. Thanks, Pearls.

379
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,375
[PEARL]
Aww!

380
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,375
[MAYA]
Thank you so much.

381
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,416
[PEARL]
Mystic Maya, why are you crying?

382
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,708
[MAYA]
'Cause I'm happy.

383
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,625
[MAYA]
Thanks for the bowl, mister!

384
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,958
[MERCHANT 14A]
No problem!

385
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,750
So, do you really
think Pearls is gonna like it?

386
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,083
[PHOENIX]
Oh, yeah.

387
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,375
She'll have her own story to
tell about this one.

388
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,000
I can kinda hear
the ocean in this shell.

389
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,375
It's still there.

390
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,666
Yeah?

391
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,875
I'll go and return
this one to the noodle guy.

392
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,166
'Cause it seems the waves
decided to come back.

393
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,750
[BOTH giggle]

394
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,833
[MAYA]
Man, that was so good!

395
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,000
Wasn't it?

396
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,625
I'll never forget
coming here with Mom,

397
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,291
way back when
I was about your age.

398
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,041
This is the most
incredibly yummy bowl

399
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,375
of noodles I've ever
eaten in my life!

400
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,916
Yeah. They're amazing.

401
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,125
And so is the bowl!

402
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,833
[MIA] Obviously, it looks
like a huge shell.

403
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,750
But what's really cool is
if you hold it up to your ear,

404
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,833
you can hear the sound
of the ocean inside of it.

405
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,333
Whoa, are you kidding me?

406
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,250
Maya, please be careful!

407
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,875
Well then?

408
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,166
[MAYA] Heh. Yeah, I can
totally hear the ocean!

409
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,583
[MIA] Hey, Maya. Did you think
more about what I said?

410
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,583
[MAYA]
About me becoming the head?

411
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,041
It's a lot to ask.

412
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,250
I'm sorry for giving you
such a big responsibility.

413
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,666
However, I need
to leave Kurain village.

414
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,791
To become a lawyer
and discover the truth.

415
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,083
I'll take over
the clan if you need me to.

416
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:48,458
Don't worry about me.
You'll be an awesome lawyer!

417
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,750
[MIA sobs]
Oh, Maya...

418
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,625
[MIA]
Thank you.

419
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,583
[PHOENIX]
Some good memories.

420
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,625
[gasps]

421
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,541
[PHOENIX] Oh, I remember
something, myself.

422
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,333
[MIA] Hey, Wright.
Would you do me a favor

423
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,083
and bring in those
case files for me?

424
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,750
[PHOENIX]
Sure thing! [grunts]

425
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,250
Aw, man.

426
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,791
Hmmm.

427
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,333
That's Maya, and one
of my favorite memories

428
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,833
my sister and I shared.

429
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,166
Wow. That is
one monster seashell.

430
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,958
[MIA giggles]
Isn't it?

431
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,750
[PHOENIX] Memories are
what help keep us all together.

432
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,208
[PHOENIX] Thinking back
to the bonds we share,

433
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,125
reminds us of the warmth
we can provide each other.

434
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,541
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

435
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,125
Let's look back at the first
case Mia fought in court.

436
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,458
A year before she met me,

437
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,875
a helplessly love-struck
college student.

438
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,833
Her client was an
escaped death row inmate.

439
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,458
Accused of murdering
a policewoman

440
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,208
during his break out.
But did he really do it?

441
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,625
At Mia's side stood
Diego Armando,

442
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,375
a defense lawyer
that guided her.

443
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,416
as it turns out, there
was a link to this case

444
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,291
that nobody saw coming.

445
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,666
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!

446
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,666
Next episode: "Turnabout
Beginnings - 1st Trial"!

447
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,875
Take that!
