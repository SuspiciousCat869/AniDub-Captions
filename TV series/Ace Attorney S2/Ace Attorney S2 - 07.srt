1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,416
[PHOENIX] I'm Phoenix Wright,
a defense attorney.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,541
While my reputation
has grown lately,

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:15,000
there are still plenty
of challenges ahead of me.

4
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,500
No matter the odds,
it's my job to stand up

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,750
for those who have no one
else in their corner.

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,791
I take the courtroom
again today,

7
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:25,208
to defend my client
and find the truth,

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,375
That's enough!

9
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,541
This trial has gone on
far too long.

10
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,875
The court sees
no reason to continue.

11
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,791
[MAGGEY]
You can't be serious!

12
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,250
But I saw it!

13
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,708
[MAGGEY]
There was another man!

14
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,875
He's the real killer!

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,958
Why won't anyone believe me?!

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,125
[JUDGE] I shall hereby
hand down the verdict

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,416
in the case against
Maggey Byrde.

18
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,833
Guilty as charged!

19
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,625
[MAGGEY]
It wasn't me!

20
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,916
Heh.

21
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:31,916
[PHOENIX]
New Year's cards?

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
[MAYA] Well, it is
getting close to that time.

23
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,250
And you gotta do your
part, so start writing!

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,250
We could just print them.

25
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,625
Hand-written's more personal!

26
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,333
I've been saying "thank you
for helping us to the very end,"

27
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,083
so write that.

28
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,750
"Thank you for helping
us to the very end."

29
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,125
Hmm? What do you mean,
"to the very end"?

30
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,416
That sounds like
we're closing up shop!

31
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,541
Huh?

32
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,125
You're hopeless.

33
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,333
--[rumbling]
--[PHOENIX] Hmm?

34
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,750
It's the cops!

35
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,250
Woah, is something wrong?

36
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,291
[GUMSHOE] No, I screamed my
head off cuz I felt like it!

37
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,500
What's the deal with this?

38
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,208
[MAYA] "Deadly Poisoning
Brings Guilty Verdict.

39
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,083
Defense Attorney Wright...
Trounced"?!

40
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:17,041
[PHOENIX] "The defense gave a
childishly amateur performance"?

41
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,791
Wright must take full
responsibility for

42
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,541
the ruling in this case"?!

43
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,958
I do?!

44
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,416
[GUMSHOE] And all while
I was away scouting for clues

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,041
and upholdin' justice.

46
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,500
Here're your souvenirs.

47
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, thanks, Dick.

48
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,500
Don't change the subject!
What's this article all about?!

49
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,250
[PHOENIX] I have no idea!
And you changed the subject!

50
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,875
I'm stumped, too, and
this issue is a month old.

51
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,791
Uh, more to the point,
I wasn't involved

52
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,375
in any poisoning cases lately.

53
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,375
Ah!

54
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,833
Everything about this is weird.

55
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,625
If it wasn't you, then why
do people think it was?

56
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,125
Wait, don't tell me.

57
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,875
An imposter Nick?

58
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,250
What? An imposter?

59
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,625
[GUMSHOE]
Either way!

60
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,958
You're comin' with me to
apologize to the defendant.

61
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,291
And then you're gonna take
the case back to court.

62
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,291
You got that?

63
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,833
Hey, come on, calm down, man.

64
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,541
Why are you getting
yourself so worked up?

65
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:06,000
[GUMSHOE] Ah! Well. You'll get
it, when you see the defendant.

66
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,750
Just help! It's your
responsibility to defend her!

67
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,041
That was odd.

68
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,208
He's got a point.

69
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,875
If this client entrusted
a case to my fake

70
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,916
based on my reputation,

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,666
then I guess I kind
of am responsible.

72
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,041
[PHOENIX]
And my impostor was willing to

73
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:25,083
defend this client, huh?
I better find out who it is.

74
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,291
[MAGGEY]
Ah! Mr. Wright!

75
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,125
--It's you!
--[MAGGEY growls]

76
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,625
[MAYA]
Maggey?!

77
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,916
[PHOENIX]
This is Maggey Byrde,

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,166
a police officer
I defended once before.

79
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,625
She was accused of murdering
her superior officer.

80
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,541
What are you doing in here?

81
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,916
I thought I got you acquitted!

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,875
Oh, ha-ha, funny joke!

83
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,291
That fifth-rate defense job of
yours got me declared guilty!

84
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,000
I understand why you're angry,
but let me explain!

85
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,625
[MAGGEY]
A phony?

86
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,875
I'm finding it kind
of hard to believe myself,

87
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,791
to be honest with you.

88
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,875
[MAGGEY]
Looking back now,

89
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,750
I guess things did
feel a little off.

90
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,750
A little?

91
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, just a little.

92
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,416
Like how you were
a bit taller than normal,

93
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,583
looked kind of shady,
your voice sounded sorta weird,

94
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,625
and how you had
this funny accent.

95
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,458
So the guy was nothing like me.

96
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,666
Hang on a second, let me
tell you what was the same!

97
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,041
He had your spikey hair
and your blue suit!

98
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,000
[MAYA] Those are your
signature features.

99
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,333
Come on.

100
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,791
By the way, how come
you're dressed like that?

101
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,541
After the incident
with the first murder,

102
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,791
I quit the force and started
working at a restaurant!

103
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,375
That sounds like
a nice change of pace.

104
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,708
Why don't you fill us in
on what happened?

105
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,041
[MAGGEY sighs]
Yeah, sure.

106
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,250
It all started last month.

107
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,583
There were two men
at the restaurant,

108
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,333
sharing a table
and drinking coffee.

109
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,666
When, out of nowhere--
one of the men

110
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,291
slipped some poison
into the other's cup.

111
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,291
It only took one sip.

112
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,416
[rasps]

113
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,750
[gasps]

114
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,875
[MAGGEY]
It was awful.

115
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,333
I was so shocked.
I passed right out.

116
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,250
[PHOENIX] Did you know
the victim personally?

117
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,791
Not at all!
I'd never seen the guy before!

118
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,333
Lack of motivation
does help our case.

119
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,875
And that mystery man
has to be the killer.

120
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,208
Then why would
they convict poor Maggey?

121
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,250
Because...

122
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,000
...no one else saw it happen.

123
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,708
[MAYA]
Really?

124
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,375
[MAGGEY] The chef, the other
customer, everyone testified.

125
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,791
They said the victim
was sitting alone

126
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,791
at his table the whole time!

127
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,125
Seriously?

128
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,541
And then, to top it all off,

129
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,125
they found a small
bottle of poison

130
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,791
in the pocket of my apron.

131
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,833
What? Why were
you carrying poison?

132
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,166
It wasn't mine,
I don't know how it got there!

133
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,833
Maybe the real killer it in when
I was passed out

134
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,916
And this man no one else saw.

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,583
You're sure he was there?

136
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,166
[MAGGEY]
I'm dead sure!

137
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,083
I mean, I was the one who took
the coffee over to their table!

138
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,875
So what were these guys like?

139
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,416
Let's see. When I first saw
them, I thought they might be in

140
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,333
the music industry or something.

141
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,666
The victim was focusing
really hard on his earphone.

142
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,708
And there was what looked
like a sample CD on the table.

143
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,625
Was it an unmarked CD?

144
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,291
[MAGGEY] No, it said
"MC"-something on it in marker.

145
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,333
Must've been a band
preparing their debut.

146
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,458
Like what's-his-face,
"MC Screwdriver?"

147
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,458
I doubt it's
who you're thinking of.

148
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,958
So Mr. Wright.

149
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,333
Do you think it's
possible to get a retrial?

150
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,541
[PHOENIX]
Mm-hmm.

151
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,666
The defense attorney
lied about his identity.

152
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,375
It shouldn't be much
trouble to get a do-over.

153
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,166
[gasps] My life's been
a full course meal of bad luck,

154
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,625
complete with
defeat for dessert.

155
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,166
I've been hit by
all sorts of vehicles,

156
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,083
gotten sick from every kind
of food, been falsely accused

157
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,750
of murder twice,
and even landed a phony lawyer.

158
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,208
Fake Nick!

159

Why'd you have to do this?!
She's been through enough!

Why're you glaring at me?

161
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,166
I got through it all,
and I'll get through this!

162
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,666
And one day,
I'll find the life I want.

163
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,416
A normal and happy one!

So inspirational.

Will you allow me to defend you,
this time for real?

167
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,625
Of course, Mr. Wright.

168

I'm so glad!
Thank you for believing in me!

169

[PHOENIX] Whoever used
my name to frame her

171

We'll get 'em.

Interesting place.

I'm sorry?

189
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,541
Like a puppy
rejected by life itself!

190

You're fatigued, non?

191
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,416
You need zis!

192
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,458
Oil of bergamot.

193
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,833
With peppermint and clary sage.

194
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,666
It will bring

...natural beauty!

196

Can't say that

00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,791
Oh, well. If you will
be seated, Monsieur Wright.

198
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,333
Wait, how do you know my name?

199
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,958
[ARMSTRONG] I could never
forget ze name of a man

200
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,458
who flirted with me!
Especially in ze courtroom!

201
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,458
I bet your imposter
cross-examined him in the trial.

[ARMSTRONG]
It was ze third of last month.

206
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,458
Just after one in ze afternoon.

207
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,125
A man enjoying a coffee
suddenly became violently ill.

208
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,958
Because of the
poison in his coffee?

209
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,500
[ARMSTRONG] Zat's right.
I was in ze kitchen.

210
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:21,541
I heard ze sound of someone
collapsing and came running.

211
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,458
Maggey had passed out.

212
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,375
There should've been
another man at that table,

213
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,291
across from the one you saw.

214
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,250
Yes, zat's what
Maggey is saying.

215
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,458
And you're sure?
You didn't see anyone else?

216
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,458
Mon answer is ze same.

217
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,125
Zere was no one else zere.

218
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,583
But that's not possible!

219
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,791
[ARMSTRONG] Ze other customer
didn't see him, either.

220
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,625
Honestly. I'm not
surprised she was

221
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,458
ze prime suspect
after what took place.

222
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,000
[PHOENIX]
What do you mean by that?

223
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,750
[ARMSTRONG]
Ze lottery ticket.

224
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,125
How could you forget?

225
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,000
First I've heard of it.

226
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,125
Ze man was listening
to ze radio with his earphone.

227
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,500
In one ear.

228
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,250
[PHOENIX] The earphone.
Maggey mentioned that, too.

229
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,250
[ARMSTRONG] Ze winning number
was announced on ze news,

230
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,208
I believe. Because all of
ze sudden he shouted!

231
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,500
Five hundred grand! I won!

232
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,500
Five hundred thousand?

233
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,500
That's a whole lotta dolla!

234
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,000
[ARMSTRONG]
Oui. And in ze court,

235
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,833
zey said zat was her motive.

236
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,750
She poisoned him to
take zat lottery ticket.

237
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,000
[MAYA]
Oh, come on.

238
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,000
I simply couldn't believe it.

239
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,583
We don't believe it, either.

240
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,416
That's why we're trying
to prove her innocence.

241
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,833
But we need some sort
of lead to do that.

242
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,250
Can you remember anything else?

243
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,708
Anything at all could help.

244
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,000
Let me think. Oh, zat's right.

245
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,958
I remember zere was
a prescription bag

246
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,833
on the table next to him.

247
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,958
A prescription bag?

248
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,250
Just sitting there?

249
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,208
Oui. I just remembered.

250
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,708
Did you happen to
mention that at the last trial?

251
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,791
Non, non, I'd
forgotten all about it.

252
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,125
That's our lead!

253
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,333

Medicine.

How is she?
Is Maggey doing all right?

258
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,791
[PHOENIX] I wish I could
say she was, but not really.

259
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,666
Understandable.

260
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,333
I've been thinking
about her a lot,

261

I've been so shorthanded
since I lost her!

You want to?!

Really? Why's this
exciting for you?

276
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,333
[MAYA]
The trial's tomorrow morning.

277
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,791
[PHOENIX] And we've found
ourselves a new clue.

278
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,041
We have to believe our
client and do our best.

279
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,791
[MAYA] Our big problem is that
everyone says the same thing.

280
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,750
Except for Maggey. That man...

281
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,083
The man who disappeared. Yeah.

282
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,875
[MAYA] And then there's
the winning lottery ticket,

283
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,750
and the poison in her pocket.

284
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,125
You'll have to
fight off all of that.

285
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,416
And I will. For Maggey.

286
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,541
I can't let her be convicted on
a second false accusation.

287
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,791
[MAYA] You know just what
to say to get me fired up!

Let's do this! [giggles]

Hmm.

Mm. [slurps] Bitter.

What are you doing?!

Well, whenever I
addressed you last time,

298
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,208
you'd go, "Talkin' to me?!"

299
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,208
So. Your politeness
shocked me a bit.

300
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,583
Like I said,
that was an imposter.

301
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,041
[GODOT] So, someone switched
out the pot for decaf.

302
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,000
That doesn't matter.

303
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,291
I wanna find out
if you're the real deal.

304
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,208
Right here, right now.

[PHOENIX growls]

306
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,541
The court has
already given its verdict

307
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,583
on this case once. However.

308
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,583
Since there was an issue with
the defense's representation,

309
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,958
we will now hold
a special retrial.

310
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,833
The prosecution's
as real as it's ever been.

311
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,458
Now why don't we get to work?

312
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,166
I'd like to call a witness.

313
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,375
I'm Dick Gumshoe, and
I'm a detective with the police.

314
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,083
The victim's name was Glen Elg.

315
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,333
He was a professional
programmer.

316
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,375
The cause of death
was potassium cyanide poisoning.

00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,291
Traces of it were found
on the coffee cup

318
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,875
the defendant
brought the victim.

319
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,416
The defendant
has testified there was

320
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,916
another man there.

the chef and the

--[gasps]
--Haven't they?

326

That's correct. Their two
testimonies do line up on that.

327

Both of 'em said there
was no other guy at the table.

[MAGGEY sighs]

Are we absolutely
certain the victim drank

330
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,041
the coffee in question?

331
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,000
[GODOT]
Hmph. See for yourself.

332
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,666
[JUDGE] There is clearly
a coffee stain on the rim.

[GODOT] That's a steaming
cup a' proof right there.

He drank the coffee
the defendant brought him.

Okay, maybe, but...

338
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,833
The defendant and victim
didn't know each other.

She had no motive!

I didn't take that, I swear!

[GODOT] Detective! Where was
this lottery ticket recovered?

00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,500
On the defendant.

When we patted her down right
after the incident happened.

345
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,666
No way, it was?

346

[MAGGEY]
Uh-uh. Mm-mm!

347
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,041
Why don't we wrap this up

with our final sip
of evidence?

Take a look.

00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,708

at the time of the murder.

Yeah, but what is it?

00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,583
[GODOT] The bottle of poison
was found in this pocket.

That right, Detective?

Wait, that's it?

You're not gonna mention
the huge red stain?

363
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,250
[GODOT]
What stain?

364
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,250
It could be blood,
but there's a lot there.

365
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,916
No one told me!

[PHOENIX] Can you see
anything out of that visor?

[MAGGEY]
U-Um... It's not blood.

It's just ketchup.

[PHOENIX]
Mm-hmm. Your Honor,

381
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,333
the defense would
like to present

382
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,833
new evidence to the court.

383
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:34,916
Oh?

384
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,250
We spoke to Trés Bien's
chef, Armstrong.

385
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,625
He gave us some new information.

386
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,666
[ARMSTRONG] I remember
zere was a prescription bag

on ze table next to him.

388
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,375
[JUDGE]
A prescription bag?

389
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,666
This was indeed not deliberated
on during the last trial.

390
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,375
I believe this
is an important piece of--

[GODOT]
Objection!

392
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,291
We've already investigated that.

393
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,291
[GODOT] Yes, there was a
prescription bag at the scene.

394
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,625
But it was empty.

395
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,166
You already looked?

396
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,333
We searched the scene,

397
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,583
and couldn't find any
medicine anywhere.

398
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,041
That's not good!

399
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,166
Hold on.

400
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,833
The victim was
poisoned to death!

401
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,708
There's a chance the missing
medicine was laced with poison.

402
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,041
Investigating this should
be our top priority.

403

No complaints here,
let's investigate now.

Ah. Otolaryngological?

a fight with a coworker

the day before the murder.

408
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,041
During the altercation,
he suffered a blow to

409
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,000
the side of the head and
ruptured his left eardrum.

to the inner ear.

Hmph. That settles it.

This is not going like I wanted.

418

That's quite enough.

419
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,333
This court sees no reason
to pursue the trial any longer

420
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,833
than we already have.

[GUMSHOE]
Hold it!

We haven't heard
from a witness yet!

We can't conclude the trial
without hearing his testimony!

Who's he mean?

relevant testimony a month ago,

did we not?

427
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,458
The defense hasn't
cross-examined them!

a witness to the crime.

Hmm.

So be it, then.

434
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
Your witness may
approach the stand.

435
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,708
The name is Victor Kudo.

436
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,541
Born and bred in
the low-lying district,

I'm a craftsman
through and through.

00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,125
At the time of the incident,

439
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,041
you were inside the
restaurant, weren't you?

440
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,875
[KUDO] Uh-huh. Like I
said the last time,

441
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,625
I was eating some seeds over
a cup of javaccino.

442
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,666
Victor. Will you tell
the court what you saw?

443
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,708
We're eager to know.

444
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,250
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

445
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,625
Drinkin' a cup of javaccino
at that time had become

446
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,500
sort of a daily routine.

447
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,833
So there I am, and
I see the serving girl slipping

448
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,125
a white powder into
the guy's cup.

449
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,416
And then...

450
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,666
The man collapsed!

451
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,083
And she was the girl I saw!

452
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,541
Are you absolutely sure?

453
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,500
[KUDO]
Of course! I wouldn't forget!

454
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,041
She's got that uniform!

455
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,083
Uniform?

456
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,666
It's so revealing.

457
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,083
I mean... What?

458
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,041
Am I supposed to not look
at her legs in that getup?

459
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,583
[chomping]

460
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,291
I believe the
witness also remembers

461
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,958
the victim well, no?

462
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,041
My memory's great!

463
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,208
If I'm wrong,
I'll sing like a bird

464
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,166
and eat seeds at the same time!

465
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,375
Okay, then. Go on.

466
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,250
I remember all the details.

467
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,208
The whole time, he kept rustling
the pages of his newspaper

468
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,875
with his right hand.

469
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,916
And while he did,
he gulped down his drink

470
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
with his left hand.

471
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,000
The left? But that can't be.

472

What do you mean?

473
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,125
The coffee stain
on the cup indicates

474
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,000
the victim drank with his
right hand, not his left.

475
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,458
[gasping]

476
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,291
Nah, you're wrong.
I remember it clear as day, kid!

00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,875
Wasn't he wearing
that weird blue lens

478
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,625
over his left eye ball?

479
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,000
That's correct.

480
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,000
It's a small computer monitor
used by programmers,

481
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,625
aptly called a "monocle."

482
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,833
Yeah! So like
I was saying before,

483
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,833
he wore his earphone on
the same side as that thing

484
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,541
and was listening to the radio!

485
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,083
He messed with
it then used the same hand

486
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,833
to drink his javaccino.

487
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:02,958
[slurps]

488
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,125
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

489
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,750
[PHOENIX]
That, sir, is impossible.

490
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:13,208
[wails]
What's that supposed to mean?!

491
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,750
The victim's left eardrum
had been ruptured.

492
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,750
He got into a fight
the day before.

493
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,708
He couldn't possibly
have worn his earphone

494
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,250
in that ear.
He couldn't hear out of it!

495
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,291
[KUDO]
Is that true?

496
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,375
--It is.
--[KUDO] Buh-Birdie!

497
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,625
Pretty, pretty bird!

498
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,541
Your Honor,
this clearly sheds doubt

499
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,416
on his memory, and his claim
that he saw the defendant.

500
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,625
Oh, shut up! Whaddya you know?

501
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,833
I saw her! I got a
great look at her!

502
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,083
In that case,
do you remember

503
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,250
any distinctive features
about the waitress?

504
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,208
You bet her beautiful butt I do!

505
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,000
There was that
big ribbon in her hair.

506
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,250
Her apron straps were
about to come undone.

507
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,291
And then, of course,
there were those legs of hers.

508
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,291
Couldn't help but get
a glimpse, you know?

509
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,583
How's that?

510
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,125
It's only stuff
you'd notice from behind.

511
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,875
And what about her face?

512
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,125
Did you see that at all?

513
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,041
Huh? Obviously, I saw her face!

514
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,166
I don't know how to say this
without sounding like a jerk,

515
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,291
but she was pretty
ordinary looking.

516
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,916
Putting aside that
rude assessment,

517
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,208
how could you not mention
my glasses you dog?

518
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,625
I get the feeling
this guy didn't see

519
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,833
Maggey from the front.

520
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,875
Or at least didn't
care to remember.

521
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,333
[gasps]

522
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,166
[PHOENIX] Mr. Kudo. Do you
recognize this apron?

523
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,583
Yeah, that's the one they
use at the restaurant, right?

524
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,833
[PHOENIX]
Have you seen this one?

525
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,000
I never saw
one of them so filthy.

526
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,500
[PHOENIX]
That's interesting.

527
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,291
Because on the day
of the murder,

528
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,416
the defendant
wore this very apron.

529
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,541
Wait, she did?

530
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,541
[gasps]

531
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,375
Even if you forgot her face.

532
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,083
You couldn't have forgotten
this bright red blemish.

533
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,666
That is...

534
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,916
...if you'd actually ever seen
the defendant from the front!

535
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,916
[KUDO growls]
Shut your trap!

536
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,750
My eyes were peeled
the entire time!

537
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,875
Since I was only there for...

538
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,041
Her legs I assume?

539
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,375
[KUDO whimpers]
Buh-buh-birdie!

540
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,958
Pretty, pretty bird!

541
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,375
Order in the court.

542
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,041
As the witness's
testimony seems suspect.

543
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,250
I cannot, with good conscience,
pass a verdict at this time.

544
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,916
I order the defense
and prosecution

545
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,666
to investigate
this case further.

546
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,708
Understood.

547
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,875
[GODOT sighs]

548
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,291
[BOTH gasp, giggle]

549
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,833
[sighs]

550
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,750
And with that,
court is adjourned for now.

551
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,541
[MAYA]
Way to go, Nick!

552
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,916
You rocked it!

553
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,791
You got the verdict
postponed to the next date!

554
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,625
Not to mention
made Maggey's day!

555
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,166
But the question remains.

556
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,750
How do we explain
the different testimonies?

557
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:26,750
[MAYA]
Hmm?

558
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,208
[PHOENIX]
That's a flashy color.

559
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,000
And it's all beaten up.

560
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,125
[TIGRE]
Hey!

561
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,708
[MAYA]
What, what, what?!

00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,541
Whad'you think you're
doin' with my hot ride, sucker?

563
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,916
I atta beat yah so hard,

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,083
it'll feel like you were
smoochin' the express train!

565

I'm sorry, man, I was
just checking it out!

566
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,333
[MAYA]
Um... Are you...

567
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,875
...the imposter Nick?

568

--[gasps]
--Heh?

569
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,375
I don't gotta take this garbage.

00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,583
I atta beat you so hard,

571
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,625
the express train'll
feel like pillows!

00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,875
Uh...

573
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,000
[TIGRE]
I atta beat you so hard...

At Trés Bien,
the restaurant of mystery,

Maya begins her part-time job!

577
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,125
While we search for
the identity of my imposter,

578
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,125
a mysterious woman appears.

579
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,333
As it turns out, it's possible
that a traffic accident

580
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,291
had something to do
with the murder.

581
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,291
The more we learn,
the more questions we have.

582
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,875
Find the contradictions!
Believe in the truth!
