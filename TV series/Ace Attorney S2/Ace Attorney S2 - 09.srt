1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,166
[PHOENIX] The murder at
the French bistro Très Bien

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,458
has served up a full
course of mystery.

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,541
The strange bottle
found in the kitchen,

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,458
chef Armstrong's massive debt,

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,333
the computer virus
that the victim wrote

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,666
worth millions on
the black market,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,041
and the shadow of the
Cadaverini Crime Family

8
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,916
looming over it all.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,166
But I was able to figure
out who my imposter was.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,041
A dangerous loan shark.

11
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,916
There's only one
thing on my menu:

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,666
Justice for Maggey Byrde!

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,375
Her trial heats back up today!

14
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,375
Good morning, Mister Wright!

15
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,041
Well, you seem in high spirits!

16
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,125
Dunno 'bout high spirits.
More like high-strung!

17
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,625
Now simmer down!

18
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,125
It's the cops!

19
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,541
[grunts]

20
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,458
And that's my cue to exit!

21
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,791
[PHOENIX]
Uh...

22
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,750
Uh. Maggey, I--

23
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,833
[GUMSHOE groans]

24
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,791
By the way, pal, the lab
results on this came in.

25
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,583
[gasps] They said it was
full of poison, didn't they?

26
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,166
Sorry, but sadly for us,

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
it's a harmless bottle
of ear medicine.

28
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,375
You don't say.

29
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,500
The victim had a
ruptured eardrum.

30
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,958
This has to be what he was
prescribed to treat it.

31
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,833
[PHOENIX]
What was Glen Elg's ear medicine

32
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,416
doing in the kitchen?

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,708
We were able to find some
unknown fingerprints

34
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,208
on the bottle.

35
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,166
They're trying to turn up a
match down at the precinct,

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,958
so I'd better run back
to check on that.

37
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:58,666
See ya!

38
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,666
[GUMSHOE screams]

39
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,875
What's wrong?

40
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,458
[GUMSHOE]
Almost forgot.

41
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,333
How did that lunch I made
for her yesterday turn out?

42
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,333
Uh... Well, it was, uh...

43
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,708
It was delicious!

44
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,125
That's what she said?
Best news I've heard today!

45
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,375
She may not have used
those words exactly.

46
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,208
[MAGGEY] Well, no, I can't
really eat this crap.

47
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,208
Why don't you take them, Maya?

48
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,541
[MAYA]
Uhh...

49
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,875
[GUMSHOE]
Great!

50
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,416
'Cause I whipped up a
jumbo-sized helping today!

51
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,833
Oh, yeah!

52
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,875
She can celebrate her freedom!

53
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,083
[GUMSHOE yells]

54
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,958
[PHOENIX] Anyway, I know
the Tiger is the key

55
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,333
to this whole case.

56
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,458
I have to find a way
to get him to testify.

57
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,583
This court is hereby
back in session

58
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,375
for the trial of
Miss Maggey Byrde.

59
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,750
Let me remind you that
yesterday we were presented

60
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,500
with the testimony of
Mister Victor Kudo.

61
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,208
He claimed to have
witnessed the defendant

62
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,791
pouring a mysterious powder
in the victim's coffee

63
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,666
right before he died.

64
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,541
However, this
testimony was plagued

65
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,208
by some rather troubling
inconsistencies.

66
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,708
Mister Kudo had stated
that he'd seen the victim

67
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,875
pick up his coffee
using his left hand.

68
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,625
But upon examining the mark
on the rim of the cup,

69
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,833
it clearly shows that he
drank his jitter juice

70
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,250
with his right hand.

71
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,416
There was another
questionable point.

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,291
He said Elg was
listening to the radio

73
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,625
with an earphone
in his left ear.

74
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,083
But Mister Elg's left
eardrum was ruptured,

75
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,041
so it would've been painful to
be listening through that one.

76
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,166
Seems like we've got
ourselves a steaming cup

77
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,500
of contradictions to digest.

78
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,375
Cheers.

79
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,875
[JUDGE]
Very well.

80
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,000
Let us call upon today's first
witness to take the stand.

81
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,541
[ARMSTRONG]
Bonjour!

82
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,500
Jean Armstrong à votre service!

83
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,833
Génie culinaire!

84
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,625
Muchas gracias, Señor Chef.

85
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,708
You were in the kitchen day of
the incident, is that correct?

86
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,625
[ARMSTRONG]
Oh-la-la!

87
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,166
Well, monsieur. Aren't you
a yummy little bon-bon?!

88
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,333
Oh-la-la! C'est magnifique!

89
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,250
Not my cup of joe.

90
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,500
Ahem!

91
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,541
Please remember, you're
here to give testimony.

92
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,291
Now then, if you would,

93
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,541
tell the court what happened
that day at Très Bien

94
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,916
to the best of your ability.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,666
Truthfully.

96
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,333
Oui, but of course.

97
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,458
On z'at afternoon, Monsieur
Elg was at my bistro.

98
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,708
'E came inside alone.

99
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,083
Pépé Kudo arrived
not long after 'im.

100
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,875
When 'e got word 'e
won le grand prix,

101
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,166
Monsieur Elg became
very aroused, indeed.

102
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,125
Five minutes after
'is 'appy ejaculation,

103
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,958
a 'orrible scene unfolded.

104
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,375
[PHOENIX]
Objection!

105
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,458
You're cooking up some
falsehoods, aren't you, chef?

106
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,041
Nani?

107
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,500
The victim was listening to a
certain radio program that day.

108
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,458
A show called
"Millionaire Radio."

109
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,833
It runs every Wednesday
from 1:30 to 1:40 PM.

110
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,250
And why do you bring 'zis up?

111
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,083
Well, as Mister Kudo told us.

112
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,250
[KUDO]
Gotta say,

113
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,541
that definitely ruined
my javaccino time.

114
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,125
[MIA]
Your javaccino time?

115
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,875
[KUDO] My daily routine is to
enjoy a nice cup of javaccino

116
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,125
at 2 PM sharp every day.

117
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,000
[PHOENIX]
He said it was 2 PM.

118
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,375
If the incident occurred five
minutes after the victim

119
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,000
found out he'd won the lottery,

120
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,708
then Mister Kudo could
not have witnessed it.

121
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,666
Because he wouldn't have
even been in the restaurant

122
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,708
at that time of day!

123
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,125
[ARMSTRONG]
Non!

124
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,166
[PHOENIX]
The earphone in his damaged ear.

125
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,083
The radio program that
should've been long over.

126
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,625
We can clear up
these contradictions

127
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,958
with a simple answer!

128
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,958
The murder Mister Kudo
witnessed on that day

129
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,000
was nothing more than
an elaborate fake!

130
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,916
You think it was staged? How so?

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,666
[CROWD whispering]

132
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,750
Are you implying that
the witness was correct

133
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,458
when he testified the
earphone was in the left ear?

134
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,000
The reenactment was
elaborate, not perfect.

135
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,000
Perhaps because the murderer
simply didn't know

136
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,666
about the victim's
ruptured eardrum.

137
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,583
[GODOT]
Objection!

138
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,208
If you're truly serious
about that theory,

139
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,833
let me ask you somethin'.

140
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,416
When the fake was putting on
the act for the old man,

141
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,208
tell me, where was
the real Glen Elg?

142
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,375
By then, he'd already
been poisoned.

143
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,666
[GODOT] But that would've
left behind a corpse.

144
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,416
Surely they wouldn't
have left his body

145
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,416
lying around the bistro.

146
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,333
It stands to reason the killer
must've hidden it nearby.

147
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,083
Maybe in Très Bien's kitchen.

148
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,541
Mon dieu!

149
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,000
[PHOENIX] Mister Armstrong,
do you recognize this?

150
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,625
I 'ave never seen zat before!

151
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,125
All ze bottles I use
are cute and delicate!

152
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,791
This particular one was found
inside Très Bien's kitchen.

153
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,166
Why would that 'orribly
plain zing be zere?

154
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,875
What a pertinent question.

155
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,458
Analysis shows this bottle
contains the ear medicine

156
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,666
prescribed to the victim.

157
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,666
Non, but 'ow could zat be?

158
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,166
It must've fallen
out of his pocket

159
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,125
while his body was
being stowed there.

160
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,541
So, let me ask you this!

You were back in

Immediately after the incident,

165

you told Victor Kudo
to call the police,

put to good use.

In that time, he took the

the pocket of the defendant

Objection!

[GODOT] You're overlooking
a critical detail.

328
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,458
There's simply no reason
for the ol' tiger man

He won 500 grand, but he only
owed me a hundred thou.

334
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,208
So that means he could pay
back what he borrowed

335
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,333
and I wouldn't have to do the
wet work and grease nobody.

[PHOENIX]
But the fact is,

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,375
a hundred thousand wasn't
nearly enough, was it?

338

339
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,791
About six months ago, you caused
a traffic accident, didn't you?

340
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,083
Say what?

341
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,500
[PHOENIX]
The victim was the granddaughter

342
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,583
of the head of the
Cadaverini crime family.

343
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,416
They wanted about
a million from you

344
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,458
to pay for her
extensive surgeries.

345
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,125
Which are listed on
her medical file!

346
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,416
If you didn't compensate
them for the expenses,

347
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,250
you'd be the one
getting "greased."

348
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,666
So you had to do
whatever it took

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,833
to get your hands on the money.

350
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,500
Even if he killed Elg and
took his lottery ticket,

351
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,583
that's half the money
he owed the Cadeverinis.

352
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,416
He'd still be deep in the
hole for the rest of it.

353
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,416
But it wasn't the
money he was after.

Why do youse have dat?

358
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,958
Glen Elg had a reputation
as a skilled programmer.

359
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,833
That skill was the collateral
on his loan from you.

360
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,291
A virus such as this one
could net you millions

Wow. Millions, you say?

If you got your
hands on that disc,

364
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,208
you could pay off
the Cadaverinis.

365
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,250
That's what you thought, right?

366
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:41,208
And so, on that day, when he
won that 500 thousand lottery,

367
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,791
which meant he wouldn't
have to give you the CD,

368
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,500
you decided to go
with another plan.

[PHOENIX] To murder Glen Elg
and steal the virus anyway.

And then you made
a last-ditch effort

371
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,291
to frame the defendant
for the crime!

476
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,125
I just saw the poison bottle
during dat dog and pony show!

[PHOENIX]
Objection!

478
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,625
[yells]

479
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,875
Then explain to the court
why you would even do that!

480
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,416
Why would you go to
all that trouble

481
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,416
to pretend to be someone's
lawyer in a trial

482
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,750
that had nothing to do with you?

483
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,375
Look, I, uh.

484
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,000
[PHOENIX] There's only
one plausible reason.

485
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,916
You were trying to cover up
a murder you committed!

486
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,375
I have to appreciate the
irony that a fraud like you

487
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,125
was brought down by a bluff.

488
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,000
There's a kind of
"poetic justice" quality

489
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,208
to the whole thing.

490
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,833
You tried to trick
the legal system

491
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,166
by pretending to be
something you're not,

492
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,500
only to reveal how much
of a criminal you are!

[screams]

494
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,291
Today the defendant was given
a second chance at justice

495
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,833
and the truth has prevailed.

496
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,250
This court has found
Maggey Byrde...

497
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,291
Not guilty!

Huh?

Violetta. Why'd you sell
me down da river?

503
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:06,750
It's simple. I did it
because I'm a Cadaverini.

504
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,541
We always get our payback.

505

You know I could never
get angry at you, Violetta.

506
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,625
I'm so happy now, Don Tigre.

507

I'd do anythin' for

Thank you so much,
Mister Wright!

I can hardly believe that you
saved my bacon a second time!

514
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,333
Speaking of food,
we brought some snacks

515
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,083

your victory today!

You know, weenies
aren't really my thing.

518
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,041
If you wanna thank someone
for getting you out of jail,

519
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,250
you should thank Gumshoe.

520
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,916
He worked his tail off.

521
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,208
Put in a lot of hours because
he was so worried about you.

522
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,541
Right up until the last moment

523
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,333
when he brought in the
final piece of evidence

524
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,125
to seal the case.

525

had our fill of fakes.

The truth is much
more satisfying.

538

Maggey's reputation and her
plate have both been cleaned.

have also come along.
