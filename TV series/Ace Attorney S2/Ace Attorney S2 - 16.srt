00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,625
[MIA] Terry Fawles was sentenced
to death after being convicted

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,166
in a kidnapping incident.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,583
Two days ago,
he escaped custody.

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,833
While he was free, a
policewoman was murdered,

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,000
and her body was found
in the trunk of a stolen car.

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,375
It just so happens that
her testimony is what put him

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:25,750
away in the first trial,
five years prior.

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:26,833
Believing in his innocence,

9
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,958
I took to the court
to defend him.

10
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,666
And as I pressed the
eyewitness, Melissa Foster,

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,916
I caught a glimpse of the truth.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,583
[MILES] Okay. But why
would she do all that?

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,916
[MIA] Because she
murdered Valerie Hawthorne,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,166
and then hid the
body in the trunk.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,916
This would also
explain why the body

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,458
was not dumped in the river.

17
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,291
It was all a plot to
frame Mister Fawles!

21
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,041
Dahlia... Hawthorne?

22
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,375
Yeah. That was her name.

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,500
The poor little girl who was
kidnapped and murdered

24

five years ago.

25
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,458
She was 14 at the time.

26
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,916
Which means that if
she were still alive...

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,166
...she'd be around your age.

Um, sure, go ahead.

32
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,000
You're saying
I'm the girl who was

33
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,666
abducted five years ago?

34
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,500
Oh, dear. What was
her name again?

35

Dahlia Hawthorne. Kuh.

Well that simply cannot be.

Huh?

40
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,916
You see, the truth is...

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,791
I was living out of the country
until the year before last.

42
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,750
Yes. She grew up
in a country at war.

43
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,166
After her parents were killed,
she managed to make

44
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,625
her way back home alone.

That's right.

50
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,375
Come to think of it,

51
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,208
I guess I'm lucky I wasn't
wearing a scarf that day.

[JUDGE 204A]
What do you mean by that?

53
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,083
[MELISSA] Mister Killer had
forgotten what his target

looked like, hadn't he?

55
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,208
If I had worn a white scarf,
I might have been mistaken

murdered instead!

[MELISSA] Yes, didn't you
mention a scarf earlier?

59

Mister Fawles had
trouble remembering

the victim's appearance.

61
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:59,166
That's why he needed the
scarf as a way to identify her.

Yes, I did.

63

But why did you just say
"a white scarf"?

"Wear white scarf

00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,708
since they had a cop on
their side to cover it all up.

164
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,750
But she--Valerie--
betrayed us!

165
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,833
She shot at me!
Got me right in the arm!

166
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:10,833
[gasps]

167
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,250
And then Dahlia...

168
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,958
[DAHLIA giggles]

169
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,375
[TERRY] She jumped
straight in the river.

170
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,125
The diamond was in her backpack.

171
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,291
And I don't know what
happened to her after that.

172
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,916
[MIA]
To be perfectly clear,

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,708
you're saying she
jumped on purpose?

174
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,833
[TERRY] Of course,
I couldn'ta pushed her!

175
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,333
I would never do that to her!

176
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,458
And that's the bitter,
piping-hot truth, eh?

177
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,125
Huh.

178
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,208
After she jumped,

179
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,750
I blacked out from
the gunshot wound.

180
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,708
Valerie must have arrested
me while I was down.

181
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,541
And soon afterward,
you were sentenced to death.

182
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,333
I couldn't forget
that trial if I wanted to!

183
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,583
[thud]

184
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,625
[VALERIE] That man
threw her off the bridge!

185
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,333
Straight into the river!

186
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:55,416
I saw. It happened!
Right in front of my eyes!

187
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,083
[TERRY]
These five years,

188
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,125
it's all I wanted to know
before I died.

189
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,083
Why did she lie like that?

190
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,625
I had to hear it come
from her own mouth.

191
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,083
[MIA] And that's why you
made such a crazy escape.

192
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:11,583
[TERRY whimpers] Yeah. But I
forgot what she looked like,

193
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,416
so I told her to wear a scarf.

194
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,333
But... I di'n't murder her!

195
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,458
I just wanted to know
why she did it.

196
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,416
You're not
getting out of this one.

197
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,166
You're Dahlia Hawthorne.

198
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,375
Otherwise, you
couldn't have known

199
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,333
what was written on the memo!

200
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,875
[MILES]
Objection!

201
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,083
That's enough.

202
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,791
[MIA]
What do you mean?

203
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,666
[MILES] Now we know
our witness is the victim

204
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,583
who disappeared five years ago.
Quite the shocking discovery.

205
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,208
But, that fact has
practically nothing to do

206
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,541
with the current case.

207
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,166
[MIA]
How do you figure that?

208
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,500
There's one important
thing in his testimony.

209
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,250
And only one.

210
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,166
The sole piece of
information that matters here

211
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,041
is the fact that the defendant
despised the victim.

212
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,583
[gasps]

213
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,208
[MILES] The one person with
a motive strong enough to kill

214
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,416
Valerie Hawthorne
stands before us.

215
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,166
The defendant, Terry Fawles!

216
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,916
[MIA]
Objection!

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,708
Prosecutor Edgeworth!
That's not true.

218
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,166
[MILES grunts]

219
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,500
Someone else has a strong
motive to murder the victim.

220
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,083
To cover up her tracks.

221
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,458
That right? Dahlia Hawthorne?

222
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,791
If you would be so kind
as to read the rest of the memo

223
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,291
the victim wrote.

224
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,291
The rest?

225
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,791
[MIA]
"Talk to Dahlia.

226
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,750
Make everything public."

227
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,291
Yes.

228
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,708
The victim told you she was
going public about everything.

229
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,958
She would tell the
world of your crime.

230
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,291
You two shared this secret,

231
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,791
and your lives depended
on it being kept.

232
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,708
So in your mind, you didn't
have much of a choice

233
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:41,166
but to kill her. To make sure
she kept quiet forever.

234
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,000
And what was this
secret between them?

235
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,750
Let's review what we've heard.

236
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,250
Five years ago, something else
disappeared along with Dahlia.

237
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,833
A diamond worth two million,

238
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,166
that had been brought
there as ransom.

239
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,625
[DAHLIA]
Hmm?

240
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,791
Yes. The fake kidnapping
was a setup from the beginning.

241
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,708
A trap carefully devised to
frame Mr. Fawles and land

242
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,416
the two million
in Dahlia's hands!

243
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,791
Nonsense!

244
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,291
Five years ago, the witness
was only 14 years old!

245
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,416
Do you think she was
capable of such a twisted plan?

246
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,041
I do! Because she
was twisted in her own right!

247
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,750
And there was
one more person tormented

248
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,625
by this twisted young girl.

249
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,875
Her older sister,
Valerie Hawthorne!

250
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,208
This is interesting.

251
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,500
According to
the case files here,

252
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,708
Terry Fawles was tutoring
both the Hawthorne girls.

253
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,708
I bet that's how the
whole relationship started,

254
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:33,333
and how he was forced to go
along with his angel's scheme.

255
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,083
[JUDGE 204A]
I'm not convinced yet.

256
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,416
She faked her death and
pretended to be someone else

257
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,958
for five years?

258
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,125
That seems just a little too
preposterous, don't you think?

259
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,291
Valerie was a policewoman.

260
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,291
With her help,
it could've be done.

261
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,375
She could arrange whatever
paperwork they needed

262
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,750
without much trouble.

263
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,041
Yes, but...

264
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,291
It must have weighed heavily
on her conscience.

265
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,416
For five years,
she covered up this lie.

266
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,583
That's why she contacted
her sister immediately

267
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,708
after Mr. Fawles called her.

268
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,916
And told her what
she was planning to do.

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,875
She would tell the world.

270
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,958
Or, in the words of
the memo, she was going to

271
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,541
"make everything public."

272
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,791
[MIA]
Exactly.

273
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,500
But the decision to tell
her sister first is what

274
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,375
ultimately sealed her fate.

275
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,166
Dahlia Hawthorne came up
with yet another twisted plan

276
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,791
to divert suspicion.

277
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,708
A plan that would ensure
neither accomplice would talk.

278
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,041
Frame one and kill the other.

279
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,916
And that, Your Honor, is
why she murdered her sister,

280
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,375
Valerie Hawthorne!

281
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,666
[JURY gasping]

282
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,958
[JUDGE 204A]
Order! Order in the court!

283
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,625
[DAHLIA giggles]

284
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,250
[laughs]

285
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,708
Um... Why are
you laughing, Miss?

286
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,708
[DAHLIA] Forgive me.
It's just so comical.

287
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,250
You're really amusing.

288
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,958
You know that, Mia Fey?

289
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,625
[DAHLIA] You can certainly
weave an exciting tale, hag.

290
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,166
But do you have
any proof of your claims?

291
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,458
Um... Evidence?

292
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,791
Yes, evidence
that I, this inmate here,

293
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,541
and the policewoman were
all in on it, obviously.

294
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,750
Without some,
it's just conjecture.

295
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,750
[MIA]
But it's not.

296
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,333
[DAHLIA]
The kidnapping was fake?

297
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't know why we should
believe an inmate on death row.

298
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,750
After all, I'm the victim.

299
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,291
Yeah, but...
Why did you fake your identity?

300
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,916
Can you really blame me?

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,458
I mean, I was kidnapped.

302
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,750
Why wouldn't I want
to go into hiding?

303
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,708
I was scarred
by the whole thing.

304
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,958
[JUDGE 204A]
Well, defense?

305
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,625
If you do have evidence,
now would be the time.

306
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,500
[MIA] It's impossible to
prove that the kidnapping

307
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,916
was staged now!

308
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,375
Or prove Terry
didn't murder Valerie.

309
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,833
The defense has... nothing.

310
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:36,916
What a joke!

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,916
You put on that
whole show for nothing?

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,416
Are you stupid?

313
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,041
[JUDGE 204A] Hmm. It seems
we've reached a conclusion.

314
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,416
The witness's behavior
does raise suspicions,

315
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,250
but I'm forced to reject
the defense's assertions.

316
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,083
Of course you are.

317
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,041
[MIA]
Is this it? Is it really over?

318
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,291
This is why you haven't
graduated from cub yet.

319
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,333
Huh?

320
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,166
You're a lawyer now.

it gets, it's part of the job.

[gasps]

323
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,416
[DIEGO] Get a load
of the smirk on her face.

324
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,375
Electrifying, isn't it?

325
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,541
That means she's
hiding something big.

326
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,583
She's ecstatic she
won't be found out.

327
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,000
Maybe. But we've got no proof.

328
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,250
[DIEGO] Peh. So without it,
the trial's over?

329
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,166
Who made that decision?

330
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,875
What do we do, then?

331
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,375
[DIEGO] To an extent,
you can make your own rules.

332
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,208
Even when there's zero evidence,
there's always testimony.

333
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,458
[gasps]

334
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,708
[DIEGO]
So what's our working theory?

335
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,166
Dahlia Hawthorne
killed her sister Valerie,

336
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,791
hid her body in the trunk,
disguised herself as her,

337
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,750
and met Fawles on Dusky Bridge.

338
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,041
Is that about right so far?

339
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,166
[MIA]
Yes, that's right.

340
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,083
In which case,
the answer's obvious to me.

341
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,791
We've still got a man on
the witness stand after all.

342
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,791
[MIA gasps]

343
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,833
Uh... What's up?

344
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,041
You've heard it all.

345
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,291
Have you anything to say?
We need you!

346
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,791
[TERRY whimpers]

347
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,125
Listen to me.

348
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,500
I don't know what she said
to you five years ago.

349
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,666
But Dahlia Hawthorne
is very much alive.

350
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,416
She used you!
And for what, money?

351
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
That can't be...

352
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,250
If the defense cannot
present evidence of their claim,

353
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,000
this trial need not continue.

354
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,375
[MIA]
Please wait!

355
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,416
Mr. Fawles! This is
our final chance!

356
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,583
You have to tell us
who you met on Dusky Bridge

357
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,041
two days ago!

358
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,500
Try to remember their face!
Was it Valerie or Dahlia?

359
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,500
Testify to the court!

[TERRY]

363
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,083
[TERRY]
Dahlia?

364
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,791
Yes. It's been a while.

365
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:46,166
I hate to ask, but you
didn't betray me, did you?

366
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't need to say anything.

367
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,750
Don't you know the answer?

[gasps]

369
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,666
Careful, my life is
in your hands right now.

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,500
Oh. Dahlia...

371
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,208
Are you okay?

372
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,541
Miss Lawyer lady?

373
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,083
[MIA]
Uh... Yes?

374
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,208
Sorry. My throat's dry.

375
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,541
Could I get some water?

376
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,000
I've got more coffee.

377
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,041
If you don't mind a substitute.

378
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,083
It's a good fit for
your current situation.

379
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,625
Bitter and darker than hell.

380
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,666
Just like what
you're about to say.

381
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,083
You sure know
how to enjoy a cup.

382
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,875
All right, defendant.

383
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,708
Make your final statement.

384
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,583
That day... 4 PM.

385
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,125
I stopped the car
just before Dusky Bridge.

386
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,625
And got out.

387
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,708
She wasn't there yet,
so I decided to wait

388
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,916
on the bridge itself.
It was our meeting place.

389
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,250
Finally, a woman showed up.

390
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,541
And it was...

391
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,708
It was Valerie, no doubt!

392
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,000
Mr. Fawles!

393
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,000
It was her! Not Dahlia, okay?

394
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,041
How can you still cover for her?

395
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,083
After all she's done to you!

396
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,708
Well, you heard it yourself.

397
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,083
It's clear. The defense's
claims were baseless,

398
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,375
as we've all likely guessed.

399
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,083
[MIA]
Is this what you want?

400
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,000
You'll be found guilty, and
you'll go back to death row!

401
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,708
He's under the girl's curse.

402
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,458
I think he's a lost cause.

403
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,625
He'll probably believe her until
he's buried six feet under.

404
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,000
But I...

405
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,791
But you still have a
duty to press him for the truth.

406
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:27,000
That's our curse. The one
we bear as defense attorneys.

407
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,583
[MIA] According to the memo,
you were supposed to meet

408
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,250
at 4:30 PM.

409
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,833
You arrived awfully early,
don't you think?

410
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,708
Did you wait on the bridge
a full 30 minutes?

411
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,041
Terry?

412
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,791
[TERRY] I got there
around 4 PM like I said.

413
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,208
But didn't stick around
the bridge the whole time.

414
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,166
I had somewhere to go.
Someplace special.

415
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,666
[MIA]
Someplace special? Like where?

416
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,791
There's this old temple,
a 15 minute walk

417
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,666
from the bridge.
The path's too narrow for a car.

418
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,916
There, five years ago,
me and Dahlia made a promise.

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,333
We swore to
never betray each other,

420
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,291
and always believe
in each other.

421
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,000
And she gave me a memento
to represent our vow.

422
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,041
She did? Is that so?

423
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,375
[TERRY]
Back then...

424
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,541
...I hid it under the base
of a tree around there.

425
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,833
It's a real
special memory for me.

426
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:24,166
So... I went there to get it.

427
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,000
Your Honor, you heard my client.

428
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,833
He was away for 30 minutes.

429
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,125
Fifteen minutes
there, 15 back.

430
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,000
Meaning, the car was
unattended that whole time.

431
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,541
So. There was time to frame him.

432
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,291
Valerie could have arrived
while Mr. Fawles was gone.

433
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,541
And Dahlia could have
murdered her and hid her body

434
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,541
in the trunk.

435
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,041
It's possible!

436
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,333
[sighs] How much more time
are you planning to waste today?

437

I understand how you feel.

481
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,916
But you can't cry yet.

482
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,541
Remember this:

483
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,791
[DIEGO] It's only okay
to cry when it's all over.

Mr. Armando?

[PHOENIX]
And just like that,

487
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,833
Mia's first trial
came to an end.

488
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,333
It left no winners
or losers in its wake.

489
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,666
Only a deep wound in the hearts
of a young defense attorney

490
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,041
and prosecutor.

A year after this trial,

492
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,541
I got wrapped up in
a separate incident.

493
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,541
The fateful case that
brought me and Mia together.

494
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,541
Only after that did Dahlia
Hawthorne finally get punished

495
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,958
for her heinous crimes.

496
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,750
She was declared guilty.

497
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,541
Yet even in that moment,
she still had a perfect,

498
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,708
angelic smile on her face.

499
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,541
At last, it was all over.

500
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,208
At least, that's what
I thought at the time.

501
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,583
Unfortunately,
it was wishful thinking.

502
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,500
And five years later...

503
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,166
...I would come to learn
just how wrong I was.

Objection!

505
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,250
To help Maya train,
Pearl and I join her

506
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,541
on a trip to a spiritual
retreat at Hazakura Temple.

507
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,458
There, we meet
a nun named Iris,

508
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,750
who looks exactly
like Dahlia Hawthorne.

509
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,416
And trust me, I'm not mistaken.
I'd never forget that face.

510
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,500
There has to be a huge secret
hidden here, I just know it!

511
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,083
The curtain rises
on our biggest case yet!
