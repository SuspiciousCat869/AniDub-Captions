My name is Phoenix Wright.

And I'm a defense attorney.

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,375
I've been building my
reputation over several cases,

make a name for myself.

the case may be,

stacked against us,

stand up for those

in their corner.

prove my innocence!

33
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,791
Yes, and even though all
my friends like to call me

But when you said you'd
help me, I felt my soul rising

from the ashes like
a Phoenix, Mr. Wright!

murdered her lover.

62
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,916
[PHOENIX gasps]
You murdered your lover?

63

[MAGGEY]
No, it wasn't like that!

64
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,583
Constable Prince was more
like a mentor to me.

65
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,250
What makes this crime
even more horrendous

66
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,416
is the victim was a
decorated officer of the law.

67
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,958
Wait, you mean he was a cop?

Please call your
first witness to the stand.

69

Uh, my name is
Dick Gumshoe, Your Highness.

70
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,666
I'm the head detective of
the homicide department

71
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,250
down at the precinct.

72
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,708
[PHOENIX] This guy looks
like he's about to cry.

73
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,041
Constable Byrde.

74
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,458
Well. She's served me
and my squad faithfully

75
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,541
and with respect!

76
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,125
So you worked
under Detective Gumshoe?

77
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,791
Sir! He's been a guiding force

78
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,833
since I was a trainee.
A detective like no other.

79
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,083
Detective. Can you tell us
about the murder?

80
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,208
Sir!

81
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,166
The crime took place
at "Exposé Park"

82
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,833
which is near the precinct.

83
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,125
The victim was a local cop
named Dustin Prince.

84
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,750
There were signs of blunt
force trauma on his body,

85
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,708
and his neck was snapped.

86
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,500
We believe he was
pushed over the railing

87
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,000
from the path
several feet above.

88
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,125
I'd like to add there
was a crucial piece of evidence

89
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,083
found under the body.

90
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,583
Here it is.

91
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,166
It seems during the struggle,

92
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,833
the victim grabbed these
glasses off the killer's face,

93
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,750
and held onto them as
he fell to the ground,

94
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,625
breaking them and his neck.

95
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,208
You think they're
the killer's glasses?

96
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,458
What about those?

97
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,958

I'm wearing my spare pair.

00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,833
[PHOENIX] What? Then does that
mean the glasses are yours?

99
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,000
No, the ones from
the scene aren't mine!

100
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,625
It just so happens that
I stepped on the ones

101
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,833
I usually wear on that same day.

102

of a cross-examination.

that you have amnesia?

I have amnesia?

Look. Just go for it!

Yeah, okay. So. The glasses.

Do you have any
proof these do indeed

belong to the defendant?

124
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,541
The lenses are for
a person with near-sightedness

125
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,458
and are almost the same
prescription as hers.

It's true that this message
does spell "Maggie."

the possibility that the victim

her peculiar spelling?

Surely, you recall
what you said earlier.

also happened to be
his birthday, and Maggey

Yeah, it is!

He was a huge baseball fan and
yellow was his favorite color!

[WELLINGTON] Yes, but first, I'd
like to make a clarification.

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,333
You just introduced my fabulous
personage to the court

as "a drifter taking a walk"!

Oh, well, I suppose I did.

I simply cannot abide
such a biased assessment

of my character.
[speaking speed increases]

229
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,041
True, calling me a university
student would be a bit of

230
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,291
a stretch at this precise
moment in time.

231
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,750
But as a man who will
settle for nothing less

00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,916
than the absolute finest of
everything that this world

myself searching for

Yes! I hope you'll
pardon my confusion!

It was as if the

locked my gaze with a woman

Uh. Bananas? That's very odd.

True. But there they were...

line of questioning.

Since the victim
was left-handed,

this was just a ham-fisted
attempt to frame Ms. Byrde.

That may be the case,

would still have to know

frame her in such a way.

for what seemed like forever.
He needed to head back home.

316

Right after he left,
I heard him scream.

317
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,250
And then I saw him.

318
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,416
[PHOENIX]
Hmm.

319
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,125
[PHOENIX]
Maggey's name. It all adds up!

320
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,875
[PHOENIX] Tell me. Did you also
lose your cell phone recently?

321
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,500
What? Why would that matter?

322
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,541
[PHOENIX] I can assume that you
tried calling your own number

323
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,541
to locate it.

324
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,000
And what does that prove?

325
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,166
[PHOENIX] For one,
that you found out her name.

326
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,083
She answered with
"this is Maggey," right?

[WELLINGTON growls]

328

[PHOENIX] Just hearing the name,
one would think it would look...

329
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,958
...exactly like this.

330
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,500
Since you heard it,
you weren't aware of

331

You killed officer
Dustin Prince.

Why would a scholar like me
want to kill a cop?

342
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,708
Indeed.

343
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,833
Well, defense, do you care to
explain what motive the witness

344
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,375
could have had to
commit such a crime?

They had never met.

348
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:14,333
So, what could the reason
to kill Prince possibly be?

349
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,375
[PHOENIX] There's something
right on the tip of my tongue.

Something about the case,
but I can't remember what it is!

It wasn't easy compiling

Uh, thanks. But what
does it all mean?

all that info?!

The names and numbers
are all of the contacts I found

in the phone
I picked up that day!

And the crazy thing is,

375
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,375
every last one of them belongs
to a ring of local con men!

up your cross-examination.

[PHOENIX] I get it. This is
what I was trying to remember!

Do you know where
that cell phone is now?

381

have it, don't you?

The cell phone the
defendant found that day.

00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,250
When we investigated the
list of contacts stored on it,

396
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,250
we discovered that they were all
part of a ring of con artists.

Say what?!

Tell me. The names

all belong to your

If the witness was told that
it would be returned to him

without incident,
then why on earth would he

have to kill to get it back?

404
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,916
Because of who
he saw waiting for him.

Yes. Constable Prince
was still wearing

his uniform when he met
with Ms. Byrde that day.

410
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,666
Which led you to make
the assumption that she had

411
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,708
brought a cop along to arrest
you, right, Mr. Wellington?

412
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,916
You were worried that
they had checked out

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,666
some of the contacts
in your phone.

414
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,625
And that they knew you were
one of those con men, too.

[PHOENIX]
What?

475
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,416
You did call my phone
number, didn't you?

476
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,583
[MAYA]
Mm-hmm. Hold on.

477
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,625
Wait. Why would
my phone be ringing?

478
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,791
It's quite simple, because
the phone you're holding

479
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,500
now actually belongs to me.

480
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,333
No way!

481
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,833
In case you're wondering,

482
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,916
that lump on the head you gave
me is starting to go down.

483
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,250
[WELLINGTON growls]

484
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,375
It's pretty easy to figure
out how it all happened.

485
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,875
You knocked me unconscious and
tried to take your cell back.

486
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,291
But. You picked up
mine by mistake.

487

[whimpers]

488

The truth is calling and you're
accepting the charges!

[JUDGE]
Now that we've re-convened,

491
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,708
where is your witness?

492
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,291
Well. He was arrested
during the recess, Your Honor.

493
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,000
It's been a while since
I've seen you put on

494
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,666
such a show, Mr. Wright.

495
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,083
[gasps]
Oh, yeah.

496
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,833
I hereby conclude the
trial of Ms. Maggey Byrde

497
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,541
and I am prepared
to hand down my verdict.

498
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,791
Not guilty!

Thank you, Your Honor!

[JUDGE] That is all!
This court is adjourned!

[MAYA]
You had amnesia?

503
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,208
I guess you were acting
pretty weird earlier.

504
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,458
And you don't usually
call me "miss" like that.

505
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,041
Well, I'm feeling better now.

506
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,750
I truly appreciate
everything you've done

507
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,875
for me today. Now that it's
over, I think I'm gonna cry!

508
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,416
[GUMSHOE] Maggey!
Congratulations on the verdict!

509
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,375
Thanks for all the
support in there, Dick!

510
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,333
[GUMSHOE groans] That's fair,
but I never thought

511
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,958
you could have actually done it.

512
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,666
I'm gonna take this
opportunity and turn it

513
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,833
into a new lease on life!

514
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,000
And I'll bet
the next time we meet.

515
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,583
I'm gonna have more good luck
than I'll know what to do with!

516
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,833
Now that's the spirit!

517
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,333
We're gonna have
to start calling you,

518
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,500
the "goddess of good-fortune!"
Right? Don't you think so?

519
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,541
Yep. Totally! Wait a sec.

520
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,166
What's up?

521
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,083
We've met before,
haven't we, miss?

522
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,583
Oh, no way!

523
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,958
Nick, please don't tell me
you still have amnesia!

524

No matter how high
the odds are stacked against us.

It's my job to stand up for
those who have no one else

in their corner.

The phantom thief,
Mask DeMasque,

has stolen the sacred urn
from Kurain Village.

534

Maya's childhood home.

535
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,083
And to make things worse,

536

the stolen urn
goes missing again!

As the plot continues
to thicken, a bizarre detective

the phantom thief
enter the fray.

What's more, the
prosecutor waiting for us

541

in the courtroom is
yet another mystery!
