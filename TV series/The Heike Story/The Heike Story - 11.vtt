It's a deceptively

the Genji warriors

Lord Munemori!

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
Well, according to
what the onmyoji says,

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.666 position:50% align:center
if those dolphins swim
to the Genji side,

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
the Genji shall fall.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:20.046 position:50% align:center
But if they continue over
to our side, then...

[MUNEMORI]
Th-The battle's still undecided.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
Brother... What becomes of
the emperor if we lose?

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
The emperor would most likely
be taken to the capital

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
to conduct a formal abdication.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
The title would then
belong to young Go-Toba.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.661 position:50% align:center
Ah, so his life will be spared.

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO] That may be true,
but all our efforts,

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
our indignities, all we've
done to protect him

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
and the Sacred Treasures
would be rendered meaningless!

What are you saying?

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO] To hand either
over at this time...

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
What would be the
point of everything

we've been forced
to suffer through?

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
We would've sacrificed
for nothing!

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
The battle has not been
decided yet, Mother!

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center

Surviving is a hollow existence.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
What awaits is a life far worse
than this one's become.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO]
It must be done.

[gasps] Mother, no!

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
How poorly do you think
the emperor will be treated

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
once they have robbed
him of his position?

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:41.206 position:50% align:center
And what of you? After they
capture you, I'd expect you

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
to be forcibly married
to some worthless Genji.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center

can protect the emperor?

the emperor is not
on a Chinese ship.

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
We were able to get that much
information from a soldier

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
who's switched sides
from the Heike.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
Is that so? Listen well!

emperor is on a small boat!

[GO-SHIRAKAWA] You were once

For you to live in such
a meager dwelling...

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
Do you not feel disgraced
or constricted by it all?

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I did feel that
way at a certain point.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
However, this is a welcome stop

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
on my long journey

I've made my peace with
where I am for now.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
I was born into privilege
as Kiyomori's daughter,

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
became the emperor's wife,
bore His Majesty's child,

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
enjoyed the endless beauty
of the passing seasons,

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
never knowing the misery
of hunger nor cold.

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
To find myself in such glory
and prosperity by fate's hand,

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
it often felt as if I
were in heaven on earth.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
I fled the capital.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center

together besieged in battle,

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
surrounded by water
we could not drink.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.723 position:50% align:center
I was reminded that
all things must pass.

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
Before my very eyes I
stood and witnessed...

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
...the death of my child.

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
I have endured all
forms of suffering.

have been granted

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
a certain kind of wisdom.

than I could've ever imagined.

was the Sacred Treasures,

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
such profound suffering?

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] You pray. There are
thoughts and feelings

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
that have been sewn into
the fabric of who I am.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
When those begin to come loose,

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
I press my hands
together and pray.

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
I think of the people I love,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
and pray for their peace and
happiness in the next world.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
That small act is
all that I can do.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] The person who
shared that with me

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
is also praying for
the Heike we've lost,

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50% align:center
traveling far and wide
to tell our story.

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] And through those
tales, our clan will live on.
