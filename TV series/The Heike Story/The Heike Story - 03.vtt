[KIYOTSUNE] Brother,
do you think this could be

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
what they call seasickness?

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.532 position:50% align:center
Exactly, Kiyotsune.
Don't be so pathetic, Biwa.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Shut your--

I see it, Father!

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE]
Oh!

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
That thing's huge!

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.887 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE] That's the Grand
Torii Gate, isn't it, Father?

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI] With both wealth and
military might in our hands,

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center
we shall wield them with
confidence and certainty.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50% align:center
And bring about a grand
new age for the Heike.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.291 position:50% align:center
[TOKITADA] Lord Koremori's
dancing is quite beautiful,

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
indeed. His performance
of the Seigaiha

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:53.173 position:50% align:center
at his majesty's banquet last
year was very well received.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
People are still
talking about it.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
You're very kind to say that.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.221 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI] It seems to me
that a warrior being praised

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
for his dancing rather than his
skills in combat is concerning.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:07.312 position:50% align:center
[BIWA growls]

[KIYOMORI]
Tokitada! Munemori! Shigemori!

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
If you have the energy
to make idle chatter,

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
then use it to pray instead!

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
Pray that my Tokuko bears
Emperor Takakura's child.

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
--[TOKITADA] Yes, My Lord.
--[SHIGEMORI] Of course.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
Tokuko...

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.289 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
You have nothing to worry about.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
We'll wait until next time.
That sound good? Good.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Biwa.

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Shigemori.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] I hope that
you're feeling better.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Mm.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
That's good to hear.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Greetings to you,
Lord Munemori.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
There is no need for you
to bow to me, Shigemori,

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
although we are not born
of the same mother,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
that doesn't change the fact
you're my older brother.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
I insist.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
I must say, Itsukushima
is a beautiful place.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI]
It is.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
Luckily we can gather
in such splendor

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
to support Tokuko. However...

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
Despite all our prayers,

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
it seems difficult for her
to carry a child.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
After six years at the palace,
with his majesty turning 16,

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
it was expected for them
to have one by now.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
[BIWA grunting]

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] Biwa,
still feeling ill as before?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] Mm-mm. I'm fine.
Munemori's repulsive.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
Hmph. True.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
Munemori is Grandfather's
second son,

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
but Lady Tokiko's first son.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
I suspect Father's
presence may bring

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
a bit of tension into the air.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
During the Heiji and
Hogen Rebellions,

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
Father earned his reputation
as a great warrior.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
Even grandfather sees him as
the official head of the clan.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
He has the trust of the
retired Emperor, too.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] I know a younger
brother can view a respected,

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50% align:center
capable first son much like
a lump over the eye.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to say that you
view Koremori in such a way?

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
How rude of you.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] I didn't say that!
Our brother is admirable.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
Although, I would say he's
not known for his bravery!

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.784 position:50% align:center
He's more of a dancer
than a warrior.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
You know, with that attitude,

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
you seem more like your
boorish lout of an uncle.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
Uh! Like you have room to talk!

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] With facial hair,
you'd look like him.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE laughs]

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
What'd you say?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] Calm down.
That's enough, you two.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
I know, why don't we
walk closer to the shore?

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
Ah! Sounds great!
All the way to the horizon!

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, maybe not that far.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
That sounds much more
like you, brother!

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
Don't forget that
however far we go,

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
we are still men of the Heike!

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI laughs]
That's true.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE] Come on! Let's get
past the Torii, at least!

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
Not too far!

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
All right.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
[BIWA sighs]

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
Biwa.

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Tokuko!

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO chuckles]

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
It's good to see you!
You're looking well!

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
Thanks. Good to see you, too.
My, you haven't changed a bit.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
It's uncanny.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
Oh, I heard that you
went to Itsukushima.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure did!

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:51.995 position:50% align:center
Ah! You even took a boat.
What could be the reason?

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO gasps]

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
Tokuko...

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.924 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, Biwa. Please,
don't worry over me.

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
You know, perhaps me not
having a child is for the best.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
Obviously, I would love it and
find it adorable. But still...

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
Who could predict what
manner of hardships

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
the child might be up against?

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
Lady Tokuko!

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
What a pleasure to see you!

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sukemori.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
Do you have some business
with Father today?

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
Yes, about the poetry contest.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
But now I'm on my way out.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well, I'd consider it
an honor if you allowed me

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
to accompany you back!

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
Though, I suppose I should
don more appropriate attire.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
I shall return shortly. If you'd
please give me a moment.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
It appears Sukemori

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
has developed certain
amorous feelings

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
for one of my
attendants recently.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Huh?!

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] Emperor Go-Shirakawa
is visiting again?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
[IKO] Yes. I assume
His Majesty has been lonely

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
since the passing of his wife
Lady Shigeko last summer.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
Indeed.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
I know! To be separated from
the one you love dearly.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:32.095 position:50% align:center
It's truly a tragically
lonely predicament!

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
[BIWA grumbles]

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.393 position:50% align:center
[ALL grunt]

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
Tokuko, I'll be
leaving for a bit.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
Oh? But I was told your
father is coming.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKURA] Precisely. I do not
wish to see Father at this time.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
I shall tell him the Emperor
has other business to attend.

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKURA]
Please do.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
Tokuko... I'm sorry.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Safe travels,
My Lord.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKURA]
Hm.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
Are you all right, Tokuko?

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
Not to pry, but is the Emperor
not going to see Lady Kogo?

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] His Majesty has been
feeling a bit stifled

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
and disheartened in recent
weeks. I'm glad that he has

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50% align:center
a place where his heart
can be comforted.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
It's good.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] Well then! Since the
retired emperor is coming,

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
allow me to entertain him.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
[IKO]
Uh...

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO exhales]

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Eh.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you shared
my appreciation

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
for imayo songs, Sukemori!

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] I do, although
your knowledge is far vaster!

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
Remarkably good taste
for Kiyomori's grandson.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
I imagine you must make
Shigemori very happy.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, my son is not a
man of culture like you and I.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center
I dearly miss my Shigeko.

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty,
I think we should sing!

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
Yes! Let us sing
a song together!

[SHIGEMORI]
Tokuko was here earlier?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
I would have liked
to have seen her,

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
but I had some important
matters to address.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong, Shigemori?

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
Well, there was an incident
involving Enryakuji temple.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
A few days ago,
Lord Morotsune of the Fujiwara,

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:55.363 position:50% align:center
who governs Kaga province
with his brother,

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
visited a mountain temple
and demanded use of their bath.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
They refused his demand,
and he became extremely enraged.

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
So enraged, in fact, that
he set fire to the temple.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
That temple was
affiliated with Enryakuji

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
and the head priest, Meiun,
has demanded punishment

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
for Lord Morotsune as well as

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
his elder brother,
Lord Morotaka.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
However, Saiko, their father,

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
is in the service of
Emperor Go-Shirakawa.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
I see. Meiun demands my sons
Morotaka and Morotsune

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
receive punishment for this
offense?

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Correct, Lord Saiko.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
Well, my lord, both of my
sons have been excellent

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
and loyal stewards of the Kaga
province. Surely that counts.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA]
A good point.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
Were you singing
Imayo songs again?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA] One of
Shigemori's sons said he wanted

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
to sing them with me, how
could I refuse such an offer?

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50% align:center
You mean Sukemori?
Apologies, My Lord.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty, please spare
my sons. I beg of you.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Pardon me, Lord Saiko,

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
but I seriously doubt that
will satisfy Lord Meiun

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
and the monks of Enryakuji.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA sighs]
Also a good point.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
Enryakuji monks, My Lord.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
The monks are marching
towards the palace?

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
[MEIUN] Burning a temple
is an unforgivable act!

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
We shall take our
petition to the court!

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
[ENRYAKUJI cheering]

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center
I am here and at your
service, My Lord.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
You certainly
weren't in a hurry!

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
Don't you realize that thousands
of angry warrior monks

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
are heading to the
palace as we speak?

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:37.632 position:50% align:center
Problems like these

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
are the reason why
we retain you samurai!

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
Go, Shigemori!
Take command of the soldiers

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
and protect the palace
gates at any cost!

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Yes, My Lord.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Listen well!

00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
Our objective is only
to drive the monks away!

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50% align:center
Do not aim for vital spots!

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.200 position:50% align:center
And do not,
under any circumstances,

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
shoot the portable shrines!

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
The Mikoshi are
transporting the divine!

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.710 position:50% align:center
[MEN chattering]

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
[SHUNKAN] My Lord, I hope the
fire at the court last month

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
hasn't caused you much strife.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Shunkan, I tell you,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
it was an especially
terrible blaze, indeed.

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
[SHUNKAN]
A tragedy.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
I'd heard that Lord Shigemori's
estate burned down, as well.

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
Could this be retribution
for the shrine?

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
Narichika, I believe
your younger sister

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
is Shigemori's wife, isn't she?

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
And your daughter is
married to Koremori, yes?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
[SAIKO] I feel I must mention
the shrine incident, My Lord.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
Shigemori's bound to
protect the court,

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
but it appeared to me
as though he chose

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
to use too soft a hand
in dealing with the monks.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
In addition, it's becoming
more obvious that power,

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
both political and military,
is in the grip of the Heike.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA]
A fair point, indeed.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
[SAIKO]
If this continues,

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
the influence of the
damned Heike will--

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
[SHUNKAN] Which would mean that
in order to oppose the Heike,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
the only option is to rely
on the strength of the Genji.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
[SAIKO] Really? But they were
beaten in the Heiji Rebellion,

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
and the old head of the clan,
Yoshitomo, was slain after the--

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
[SHUNKAN]
His son, however, is alive.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
Mm... Ah, yes. Yoritomo.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
I know that if you were to
issue the order, My Lord,

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center
the Genji, as well as
numerous other clans

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
that hold grievances
against the Heike,

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
would gladly take up
arms against them.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA] Mm... You think
you could enact a plan

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center
and defeat the Heike?

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.141 position:50% align:center
[NARICHIKA]
Of course.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
For us, even the sturdiest
jug can easily be toppled.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha! What a
delightful metaphor.

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
[SAIKO] To be honest, I find
that response rather lukewarm.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Why settle for merely
toppling the Heike...

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
[SAIKO] ...when you can
snap their necks instead?

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
Very well done.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
[TAIRA NO YASUYORI]
You certainly know how to deal

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
with a problem tool.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.754 position:50% align:center
This talk is
frightfully exciting!

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] What?
Father had both Lords Shunkan

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
and Saiko arrested?

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] Yes. It seems they
were plotting a conspiracy

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
against the Heike at Shunkan's
estate in Shishigatani.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI grunts]

One of the men who
was in attendance

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
secretly told grandfather
out of fear.

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
Saiko!

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
You ignored your sons'
unforgivable transgressions,

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
and now you're trying
to seduce His Majesty

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
into wiping out our clan?

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
How can wretched scum like you
even dare to defy the Heike?

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
Are you, yourself,
not scum, too?

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
A mere warrior cannot just
do whatever he pleases!

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
Promoting only your clan.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
Growing conceited and pompous!

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
You may fool yourself,
the Heike do not own the world!

[KIYOMORI panting]

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.897 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
Once he's made his confession,

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
take him down to the river
and cut off his traitorous head.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] What's more,
I'm afraid my wife's father,

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
Lord Narichika of the Fujiwara,

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
was arrested
with all the others.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
Him, too? Lord Narichika
was involved?

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
It appears he was.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
And what about His Majesty?

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] I believe
he's safe at the moment,

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
but Grandfather's likely
to take him, as well.

[exhales]

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
Koremori, you need to help
me get this message out.

[SUKEMORI]
Brother, are you trembling?

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE] Koremori is
a dancer, not a fighter.

[KOREMORI]
Emperor Go-Shirakawa

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
really tried to
bring down the Heike.

[KOREMORI]
You should all be scared.

it's over.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center

everything will change.

Please, Shigemori,
come back home with me!

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
I can't right now.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
Then let me go with you!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
You cannot.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
You have to let me!

It may be difficult, but you
must not involve yourself.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] That's what Pa said
to me... right before...

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
Hm?

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Ah, Shigemori.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Father,

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
I implore you to halt your
capture of Go-Shirakawa.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
This request doesn't
surprise me in the least.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
Your fortune is at an end.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
Surely you are not
thinking clearly.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
What? Don't be ridiculous!

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
Those at Shishigatani
are to blame!

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
The Heike have long been
faithful servants of the court!

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
Their plot is heinous!

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
I am told His Majesty was
present at the gathering!

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI laughs]
Which is exactly why I want him

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
to come to the estate
without delay.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
And once he does,
he should remain here.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
We must make it clear that
actions have consequences.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
Teach them what happens
when you oppose the Heike.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
[NARICHIKA]
I don't want to die!

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] Father, you should
be aware that I, too,

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
am assembling soldiers.

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
Oh? How very amus--

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] No, they are
not meant to support you.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
Their intention is to
attack you, Father.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
Huh! You would dare oppose me?

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
Clearly, it would
pain me to do so!

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
The status of our clan today
is thanks to His Majesty.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
We're obligated to him,

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
and I believe that our duty
to serve may run deeper

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
than our blood ties.

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
Therefore, if I fulfill my
obligation to His Majesty,

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
it means I would make
my own father an enemy.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
The loyalty to my lord

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
and devotion to my father
are in direct conflict.

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
I fear this dilemma cannot
be resolved peacefully.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] Father,
if you wish to leave here,

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
the only way that can happen is
by cutting off my head first!

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI gasping]
