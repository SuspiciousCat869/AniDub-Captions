I would have liked
to have seen her,

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center

Is something wrong, Shigemori?

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
Well, there was an incident
involving Enryakuji temple.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
A few days ago,
Lord Morotsune of the Fujiwara,

who governs Kaga province
with his brother,

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
visited a mountain temple
and demanded use of their bath.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
They refused his demand,
and he became extremely enraged.

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
So enraged, in fact, that
he set fire to the temple.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
That temple was
affiliated with Enryakuji

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
and the head priest, Meiun,
has demanded punishment

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
I see. Meiun demands my sons
Morotaka and Morotsune

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center

Correct, Lord Saiko.

Pardon me, Lord Saiko,

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center

will satisfy Lord Meiun

it was an especially
terrible blaze, indeed.

[SHUNKAN]
A tragedy.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
I'd heard that Lord Shigemori's
estate burned down, as well.

Could this be retribution
for the shrine?

[SAIKO] I feel I must mention
the shrine incident, My Lord.

Shigemori's bound to
protect the court,

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
but it appeared to me
as though he chose

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
to use too soft a hand
in dealing with the monks.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
In addition, it's becoming
more obvious that power,

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
both political and military,
is in the grip of the Heike.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
[SHUNKAN] Which would mean that
in order to oppose the Heike,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
the only option is to rely
on the strength of the Genji.

must not involve yourself.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] That's what Pa said
to me... right before...

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
Hm?

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
Ah, Shigemori.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Father,

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
I implore you to halt your
capture of Go-Shirakawa.

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
This request doesn't
surprise me in the least.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
Your fortune is at an end.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
Surely you are not
thinking clearly.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
What? Don't be ridiculous!

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
Those at Shishigatani
are to blame!

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
The Heike have long been
faithful servants of the court!

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
Their plot is heinous!

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
I am told His Majesty was
present at the gathering!

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI laughs]
Which is exactly why I want him

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
to come to the estate
without delay.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
And once he does,
he should remain here.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
We must make it clear that
actions have consequences.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
Teach them what happens
when you oppose the Heike.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
[NARICHIKA]
I don't want to die!

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] Father, you should
be aware that I, too,

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
am assembling soldiers.

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
Oh? How very amus--

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] No, they are
not meant to support you.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
Their intention is to
attack you, Father.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
Huh! You would dare oppose me?

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
Clearly, it would
pain me to do so!

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
The status of our clan today
is thanks to His Majesty.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
We're obligated to him,

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
and I believe that our duty
to serve may run deeper

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
than our blood ties.

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
Therefore, if I fulfill my
obligation to His Majesty,

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
it means I would make
my own father an enemy.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
The loyalty to my lord

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
and devotion to my father
are in direct conflict.

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
I fear this dilemma cannot
be resolved peacefully.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] Father,
if you wish to leave here,

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
the only way that can happen is
by cutting off my head first!

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI gasping]
