[CAT whines]

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.569 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Do you remember this place?

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
I found you here in Fukuhara.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Koremori.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
[TAKESATO panting]

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.554 position:50% align:center
[TAKESATO] Lord Koremori's head
was not paraded with the others.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
Seems he wasn't
present at Ichinotani,

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
from what I could gather,
it was due to illness.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
So then...

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.311 position:50% align:center
[TAKESATO]
He is in Yashima.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
Is this "Yashima" place
far from the capital?

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.524 position:50% align:center
He said that Father
has an illness.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:31.443 position:50% align:center
Is he going to recover?

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:34.904 position:50% align:center
I wish that he would come
back here to fetch us soon.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.077 position:50% align:center
It seems a letter has
arrived from Shigehira.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.495 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI] I had heard
that he'd been captured

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.622 position:50% align:center
while trying to escape
from Ichinotani.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.542 position:50% align:center
Is he truly still alive?

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
Yes, he is.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.004 position:50% align:center
But he was captured and
paraded through the city.

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:54.466 position:50% align:center
[gasping] It can't be.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO]
So what does the letter say?

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI] He asks us to return
the Sacred Treasures.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.686 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI] Apparently, that is
Emperor Go-Shirakawa's wish.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
[GO-TOBA laughs]

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:08.813 position:50% align:center
Pretty, aren't they?

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50% align:center
Munemori, if we send the
Treasures to the capital,

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
will Shigehira be returned?

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
It's unclear, Mother.
And although one would

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
certainly hope that would
be the agreement...

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI]
Even if we return the Treasures,

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.749 position:50% align:center
there's no guarantee
Shigehira would be released.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
But we still have to try.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI] Mother...
I think we should stay here

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
where we can protect
Emperor Antoku.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
After all, the capital is
wherever the Emperor resides.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] They won't be
returning the Sacred Treasures.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
That so? And Lord Shigehira?

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] Sent to Kamakura
to meet his fate.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
I see.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] As things stand,
the war will not cease.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
Yoshitsune will lead
more Genji attacks.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
Terrifying.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
You still haven't changed.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
Since we were kids,
you've always been

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
such a scaredy-cat,
no matter what we--

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI sobs]

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
I know. It's our downfall

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
Plummeting to the
depths of hell.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
It is all over. There's no
hope left for the Heike.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
When Kiyotsune jumped, I know
exactly how lost he felt.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
I still have hope,
and I'll figure a way out.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
But I will need you to
make a plan as well.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
[SANEHIRA] I present
Lord Taira no Shigehira.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:50.165 position:50% align:center
This is the man
who burned Nara?

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
[YORITOMO gasping]

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEHIRA] We set fires to
see in the dark of night,

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.675 position:50% align:center
but an ill wind fanned the
flames out of control.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPOPLE screaming]

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEHIRA] I was in command at
the time, however, so that sin

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
belongs solely to me.
I take full responsibility.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
Capture and dishonor is
simply my karmic retribution.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
I have reaped
all that I've sown.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
[YORITOMO]
Oh...

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEHIRA]
It's what I deserve.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
For my violent ways,
and my destruction,

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
and my thoughtlessly
selfish behavior in battle.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
This suffering has
given me enlightenment.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center
[MASAKO]
What concerns you so?

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
[YORITOMO]
It's the tree peony.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
[MASAKO] By that,
you mean Lord Shigehira?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
[YORITOMO grunts]

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I had heard him likened
to the tree peony before.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
I suppose I can see how
that's a fitting name.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
Do you hope to spare his life?

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't forget
that you are still among us

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
because of Lord Kiyomori
and his decision to spare yours.

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
If your ultimate goal is truly
to bring an end to the Heike,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
and you choose to let him live,

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
or any other member of the
Taira clan, for that matter.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
[YORITOMO] You fear one will
rise to end the Genji?

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:22.465 position:50% align:center
Pity might move many to
serve a such genteel flower.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
One that was raised and
blossomed in the capital.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI]
Lord Koremori has vanished?

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
You don't think that
he's decided to flee

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
just to save his
own skin, do you?

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI gasping]

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI gasping]

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
Write to him!

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
Write to whom, exactly?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.087 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] To Emperor
Go-Shirakawa, of course!

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
Lady Tokuko, please,
I know you've

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
long been on good terms
with His Majesty.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
I see. What will I say?

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
Just try to persuade
him to spare us!

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
You can get him to
issue a new decree!

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
That the Genji don't
need to attack the Heike.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
I beg you!

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] I am afraid he is
the same as my father.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
He's not the type of
man that would easily

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
forgive those
who threatened him.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
If this brings about the
end of the Heike, what--

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
I'll protect him.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
[ANTOKU grunting]

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
Whatever's to happen, I swear on
my life to protect the emperor.

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center

[TAKIGUCHI]
Never in my wildest dreams

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
did I expect to see you
here, Lord Koremori.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:00.271 position:50% align:center
So tell me. Why did you
decide to leave Yashima?

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
To become a monk.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGUCHI grunts]

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
You've renounced your
attachments to the world?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] I considered seeing
my wife and children one

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:14.744 position:50% align:center
last time, but if I enter the
capital, I'll be taken prisoner.

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
And what after you've
taken your vows?

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] Truthfully, I no
longer see any merit to living.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
I want to put an end to it.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
The running... All the fear...
The fighting...

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
I realize... this is a shameful
thing, the coward's way out.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
There's no shame. I, too,
came here in order to escape.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
I was running from
the pain of separation,

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
because I could not
be with the woman

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
that I so desperately
yearned for.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
Some may find that trivial,
as I was in no immediate danger.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
Although there are those who can
endure that kind of suffering,

00:08:57.162 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
it may be completely
unbearable to others.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
You've had many hardships
befall you, Lord Koremori.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
Your suffering must be profound.

Biwa! You're all right!

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
You saw this.
You knew it would happen.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's true, I know I can't
change what's about to come,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
but maybe, if you took another
name, you could live in peace.

[gasps]

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
I have to go.

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
Your eyes remind me of my
father's. Clear and bright.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] Koremori. I promise
I'll make your story known.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] My story?
There's not much to tell.

All I did was run.

00:10:57.532 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
I know that there's much more
to you than you'd ever realize.

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
I want to share it.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center

was merit to my life.

[ATTENDANT A] Your Majesty.
Lord Yoshitsune has arrived.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA] That damned
Sukemori asking for compassion

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
and begging for his life.
Use this for kindling.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDANT A]
Yes, your majesty.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA]
Hello, Lord Yoshitsune!

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
Your majesty. Honored to join
the cherry blossom banquet.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.031 position:50% align:center
I'm truly grateful
for this invitation.

[GO-SHIRAKAWA]
How are things in the capital?

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.993 position:50% align:center
[YOSHITSUNE]
Relatively peaceful, thankfully.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
The mild spring soothes
the peoples' spirits.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I am quite happy that I
entrusted the capital to you.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
You don't deploy those
wretched little kaburo

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
like the Heike were wont to,

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
nor do you commit random acts
of violence like Yoshinaka.

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but I am merely
protecting the city

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
Well, today, your only duty
is to enjoy yourself!

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
[TAKESATO] Lord Sukemori. Is
there anything you require?

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
I was hoping something
would come from the capital.

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
And that would be?

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:20.902 position:50% align:center
A note from Emperor
Go-Shirakawa.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
Afraid not, My Lord.

What do you mean?

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] Obviously,
I mean any other letters!

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
You're not very
attentive, are you.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
That must be the reason
why you didn't stop Koremori

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.502 position:50% align:center
from jumping into the ocean.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
You merely sauntered back here.

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
In sharp contrast to all of the
other monks who immediately--

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center

I'm staying right here.

Really? You understand
the situation, right?

[SUKEMORI]
What are you doing?

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center
I decided to see it for myself.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
To be a witness to your future.
The Heike's future.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
You mean witness the fall
of our clan firsthand.

for our hubris, right?

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center

So I can tell the tale.

have a place in that story.

You do.

Especially during the
incident with the regent.

happened with Lord Motofusa?

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center

[SANEHIRA] It seems he's at a
loss about how to proceed,

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
so Lord Noriyori has
retreated to Aki province.

Lord Yoshitsune to eat.

[ATTENDANT C] At last, Lord
Yoshitsune has driven the Heike

from Yashima toward the sea.

Ah! This pleases me greatly.

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDANT C] Reports say that
the Heike continued out to sea,

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.032 position:50% align:center
but Yoshitsune's warriors...

00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
Are there truly only 70 riders?

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
[ATTENDANT C] Hearing this,
the Heike turned back.

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
However, Yoshitsune drove them
out to sea once again.

In a moment of desperation,
the Heike leader

challenged the Genji
to shoot a fan.

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
A man known as Nasu
no Yoichi stepped up.
