00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Sukemori.

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.901 position:50% align:center
Please conduct yourself
accordingly in Ise.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:30.196 position:50% align:center
Reflect on your discourtesy
to Lord Motofusa.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.824 position:50% align:center
I will. I promise.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.751 position:50% align:center
He'll return.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
Is it truly necessary to send
our poor Sukemori off to Ise?

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:49.841 position:50% align:center
He has already been punished

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.760 position:50% align:center
for his lack of decorum
with the regent.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
And he was clearly not the one

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
who ordered the
retaliatory strike.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center
Why would three hundred
soldiers attack only ten?

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center
[KEISHI sobs]

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI exhales]

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI] Apparently,
the incident was enough

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
to reduce Motofusa to tears.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.530 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO chuckles]

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] I have dismissed
the men involved in the attack,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.079 position:50% align:center
and as punishment...
sent Sukemori to Ise.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
I suppose you're just going
to insist on being a bore,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.667 position:50% align:center
aren't you?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
You may not find
my ways amusing,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.587 position:50% align:center
but this incident has only added

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.048 position:50% align:center
to the widespread
displeasure with the Heike.

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:32.801 position:50% align:center
I understand what
you're telling me.

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:35.970 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know. Since I'm
to blame for so much

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.181 position:50% align:center
strife and turmoil
with you personally,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.058 position:50% align:center
I shall gift you with
one of those lanterns

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.810 position:50% align:center
you're so fond of.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.395 position:50% align:center
We've heard rumors
that you've put up

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.272 position:50% align:center
as many as 48 lanterns
around your estate.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:49.567 position:50% align:center
Apparently, some have
dubbed you "Lantern Lord."

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.654 position:50% align:center
Are you truly that afraid
of the darkness?

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:55.031 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Hey, baldy!

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.991 position:50% align:center
What would a pampered man
like you know about

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:59.452 position:50% align:center
all the terrors lurking
in the darkness?!

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Biwa!

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:04.916 position:50% align:center
Just remember, the darkness
is always waiting for us!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI grunts]

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.884 position:50% align:center
I must say, you're
a very amusing one.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.845 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI] Tokiko! Please! Stop!
What's gotten into you?

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
You would dare throttle
Lord Shigemori's child?

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
How can a man of your
station conduct yourself

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.781 position:50% align:center
in such a brutish manner?

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Let me go! Put me down, Shige--

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
Brother?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Tokuko?

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
So, Father said he that wanted

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
to keep you close at hand.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center
Even so, my brother
denied him that request?

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
That's good, though.
I'm glad you're here.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
I'd asked Shigemori
to bring you with him.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
I wanted to have
a little company.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
Six years ago, my younger sister
Moriko was married off,

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
and I've been feeling
rather lonely since then.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
She was only nine at the time,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
but Moriko became Lord Fujiwara
no Motozane's bride.

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
What complicated matters
further is he already had

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
a five-year-old son
with another woman.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
It was political marriage.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.786 position:50% align:center
But as fate would have it,

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
only two years
after they were wed,

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
Lord Motozane passed away.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
That left my sister as a widow
at a terribly tender age.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center
Not only that, she was a
parent to his young son.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
Oh. Lord Motozane
was the older brother

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center
of Lord Motofusa,
whom Sukemori disrespected.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] After her husband's
death, Moriko acquired lands

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:13.104 position:50% align:center
and various assets
of the Fujiwara clan.

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Surely, that all factored
into why the regent

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
was so enraged
over that incident

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
with Sukemori--
there's history involved.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
My father seems to
consider us nothing more

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
than pawns in a
never-ending game.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
And that's not limited
to his family.

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI hums]

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
It's my turn now.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
I shall be getting
married soon, as well.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
Sixteen and arranged to marry
a boy six years younger than me.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
You're both awfully young.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
It's all because
who his father is.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
[sighs] My poor throat,
it hurts.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKURA]
Father, that smells terrible.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
Your father is drinking
garlic chive water

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
because he feels unwell,
so you'll have to bear with him.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
I would imagine his sore throat
is from loudly singing imayo

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
songs all through the night.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center
I know because I could hear him
belting them out from my room.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
A good Imayo song
acts as mirror,

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
reflecting the nature of
the world as it is these days.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
And that one is about twisting
around with a lovely woman.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
What value is there in a mirror

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
that reflects such a
scandalous and trifling thing?

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEKO]
Now, Norihito.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKURA]
If you'll excuse me... Father.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Shigeko, ever since
his coming-of-age ceremony

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
was scheduled,
he's been so mouthy!

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEKO] I find it
reassuring that our boy

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
is confident enough
to speak his mind.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
It means he will be no one's
puppet. Quite a promising sign,

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
since he will be marrying
Kiyomori's daughter, after all.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
I loathe bringing
that man into the family.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
Our Norihito will need
powerful backing, you know.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
The Heike would best
provide that strength.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:24.277 position:50% align:center
I'm aware, but surely Kiyomori
will try to pull the strings.

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
Well, my Lord,
if that situation arises,

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
you'll simply have to handle it.
Kiyomori is like the snail

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
in that Imayo song
you love so much.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
How's he the snail?

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
He dances as you like.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
Yes, or else I'll trample him!

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you listening
to me rattle on, Biwa.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
I needed that, thanks.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.981 position:50% align:center
Please come again.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
No, it's nothing.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh?

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
That Ma?

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50% align:center
Ma! Uh. No, sorry.

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50% align:center
What is your name?

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
Biwa.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
Is your mother
a shirabyoshi, too?

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
That's what my Pa told me.

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
[BIWA gasping]

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
Lady Gio and her
younger sister Lady Ginyo.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
They've come here to
visit with Hotoke-Gozen.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Hm?

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Lady Gio was
once Father's favorite.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
But then he began to
fancy another dancer

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
named Hotoke-Gozen,
and he sent Gio away.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] But recently
Hotoke-Gozen has been feeling

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
a bit starved for company,
so Father started

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
summoning Gio again to
come and chat with her.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.424 position:50% align:center
I hate to think how
Father would react

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
if she were to
refuse his invitation.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
The "Lantern Lord," am I?

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
I've feared the dark
since childhood.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
Because of the awful
things I see.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
The torment of those
wandering spirits.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Tell me.

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:46.586 position:50% align:center
I am curious to know
what frightens you.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
The future.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
It always has.
I'm terrified of the future.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
[BIWA grunts]

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] The darkness of
the future may be frightening.

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
But the glow of
this present moment

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center
is calming and beautiful.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA] You're stepping
down as Major Counselor?

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
Is this because of the
attack on the regent?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
I had thought you were
going to handle

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
Norihito's coming-of-age
ceremony.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] Indeed. My
suggestion is for you to have

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
my younger brother Munemori take
over those duties in my stead.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center
You're thoroughly
wiping up the shit.

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
Releasing all the men
who assaulted Motofusa.

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
