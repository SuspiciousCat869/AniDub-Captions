can play the biwa?

Jump in and join us, Biwa!

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center

got nowhere else to go,

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
you might as well
come along with us!

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Where?

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
I dunno, just all
over the place.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center

we all shall go!

It's strange.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center

Where was she?

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.118 position:50% align:center
In Tango.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
I met her the last time
I was out that way.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
Supposedly, she used to
be a shirabyoshi, too.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.099 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAKA] Since everybody
put their lives on the line

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center

need a hefty reward.

Huh? Whaddaya think, old friend?

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center

[YOSHINAKA laughs]

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA growls]
I gave him that title,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
and he uses it like a shield?

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.575 position:50% align:center
He needs to defeat the Heike
as soon as humanly possible.

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
But they took the young Emperor
and the Sacred Treasures

Temporary though it may be,

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
this is not a place fit to
be an imperial residence.

for now, Mother.

Dazaifu's plain, but still quite
an important office of Kyushu.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:08.308 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO] I've heard rumors
that Go-Shirakawa

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
has had a new emperor
accede to the throne.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI]
They say he's a child

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.606 position:50% align:center
of the late Emperor Takakura
and Lady Shokuko.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he's called
Emperor Go-Toba.

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO] Can there truly be
two emperors?

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
No. There's rightfully only one.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
--Brother! Lord Oga--
--Shhh!

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
Lord Ogata. He's received a
decree to pursue the Heike.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
What? He won't come and attack
us at Dazaifu, will he?

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI] Look, Lord Ogata
once served under Shigemori.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
I say we send Sukemori
as a messenger.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
Koremori has not been himself

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
since that major loss at
Kurihara to Yoshinaka.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:01.194 position:50% align:center
[OGATA] Lord Sukemori. You've
grown into quite a great man!

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
Lord Ogata. Niceties aside,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
I've been told you're
gathering troops

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50% align:center
for the purpose of
attacking the Heike!

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
[OGATA] I'd been ordered to do
so, by Emperor Go-Shirakawa.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
I recall that you'd served
my late father, did you not?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
My lord, please believe me.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
I truly have no desire to take
up arms against the Heike.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
So, I implore you, please.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
Take your family
and leave Dazaifu!

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.555 position:50% align:center
He really said that we need
to get out of Dazaifu? Why?

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
Though he claims to wish
he could refuse,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
he can't go against the palace.

I can't believe it.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
First, we left the capital, then
we're driven out of Fukuhara

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
and now we're being forced
to flee Dazaifu, too?

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
Well, if we don't, he has
no choice but to attack.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
But why. I--

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
We won't show our
backs to the enemy!

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.873 position:50% align:center

[SUKEMORI] Kiyotsune. Why're you
staring into the darkness?

You have to get yourself
ready for battle.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
I can't believe a man
that once served our father

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center

come to attack us.

Tell me why?

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
Why doesn't anyone care
about loyalty, or honor?

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
About keeping your word?
Do those things...

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
Do they mean nothing
to everyone?

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] Do you really think
the Heike value those things?

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
Stop pouting. Just get ready.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA laughs]
You're saying they just fled

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
without putting up
any kind of fight?

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
[CHAMBERLAIN A] They attacked
Lord Ogata's estate

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
but it seems they realized
they stood no chance.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center

Can't we wait for it to pass?

We're traveling to our new home

Things are tough,
but take heart.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
Remember the pledge
that we made.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
You and I would step up and
fight when the time came.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:36.242 position:50% align:center
We'd go and face our
enemies heroically!

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, my lord.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
For now, let us seek
shelter from the rain.

You won't find all of
this at the capital.

There are lots of
other things there.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center

[SHIZUKA] What's wrong?
You don't seem to like it here.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
The sea reminds me of the Heike
and from what I've been able

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
to gather,
they've gone adrift.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
That seems to be the case.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
And after all that boasting
about their influence...

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] We've been walking
forever through the mud

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.971 position:50% align:center
and we're finally
at Hakozaki's harbor.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
But the enemy seems to pop up
every s time we try to land.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
We're going to have to spend
another night out on the boats.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center

Just like fish in a net.

Hm?

How Kiyotsune put it.
Describing our situation.

Are you trying to say
that you don't want

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
to be on the boat
anymore or what?

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
I worry for Lord Kiyotsune.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center

Oh, no. Not again.
First Shigemori, then Kiyomori.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
And I can't do anything
to help. I can't stop it.

Poor Kiyotsune is gone! How I
wish I could do more than see.

You're exactly as I saw.

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
I could see you in my mind's
eye. For all this time.

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
My Asagi.

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
"Asagi," huh?

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
[ASAGI]
That's your name.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] How come Pa never
called me that?

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
[ASAGI] Simple. Because it's
the color of your eye.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
The eye which he greatly feared.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
And now I am known by that name.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
That's what the monk called you.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
[ASAGI]
I've longed for you.

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] If you could "see"
me this whole time,

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
why didn't come looking for me?

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:16.272 position:50% align:center
[ASAGI] I abandoned you and your
father and ran off to live

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
with a lord of the Heike
in Echigo. I'm sorry.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Now I know.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
I should have never come here.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
[ASAGI gasps]
Please, forgive me!

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
[ASAGI] No, you don't have
to do that. Thank you.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:44.509 position:50% align:center
Though I've done
nothing for you...

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
...you found me. My Asagi.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] It's Biwa. That's what
I go by. My name's Biwa.

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
Biwa. I couldn't do
anything to help you.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
My only hope was to pray.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
To pray?

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
For you and your Pa.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
"Please, may he find peace."

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
"Please, may he rest quietly."

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
"Please... Please."

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] May he find peace.
May he rest quietly.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
Even if I can't do anything,
I can pray.

I'm bored!

[ASAGI]
You're leaving?

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] I have to witness
the Heike's fate for myself.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
To see it through to the end.

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
I will do that and put my
prayers and energy into my biwa.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
I can't really do anything
more than that.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, Ma. Thank you.

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:02.754 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] I'll be praying, too.
Like you did for Pa.

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
For your peace.
I pray you'll find it here.

I will always pray.

[SANEHIRA] Despite being adrift
at sea, the Heike defeated

Lord Kiso no Yoshinaka's
army at Mizushima.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
[SANEHIRA] There are tales of
their commander Tomomori's

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
actions and acumen
in this battle.

[groans]

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.580 position:50% align:center
[SANEHIRA] Apparently, he
ordered his men to place planks

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
between their boats and
is said to have fought

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
as ferociously as if
he ruled the ocean.

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
And any news of Lord Yoshinaka?

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
[SANEHIRA] From what I've heard,
Emperor Go-Shirakawa

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
ordered him to attack
the Heike. However...

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
Before we go further, I want
you to make me the Shogun.

Insanity.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
[SANEHIRA] Naturally, this
infuriated Emperor Go-Shirakawa.

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
So, he sought help from warrior
monks to attack Yoshinaka, but--

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAKA]
In case you've forgotten

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
who ran the Heike out of
the capital, it was me!

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
[SANEHIRA] Lord Yoshinaka
burned the palace

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.277 position:50% align:center
and confined both him and
young Emperor Go-Toba.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
Thus, Emperor Go-Shirakawa
now seeks your assistance.

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
[MASAKO]
Goodness.

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.866 position:50% align:center
[SANEHIRA] What's more,
it seems that Yoshinaka

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
intends to make himself
head of the Genji

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
by defeating you, my lord.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
What to do? Should I
attack him first?

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
Yes! What else would you do?

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
[YORITOMO]
Mm... But who should--

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
I suggest you appoint your
younger brother Noriyori

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
as commander, and send
Lord Yoshitsune as well.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.140 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
You're really going west?

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Yeah.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center

Did you hear about Yoshinaka?

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAKA]
Dammit. Come on! Kanehira!

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.111 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] He was killed
by the Kamakura Genji.

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
Who supposedly are
headed west, too.

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:53.948 position:50% align:center

to them launching

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
an attack on the Heike!

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center

Please take care of yourself.

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
I think we'll be in the
capital for a while longer.

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
Hopefully the Kamakura Genji

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center

would be Taira no Sukemori,

but I'm afraid that--

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
Well, if a deer can navigate it,
then why not a horse?

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
Exactly! [laughing]

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:07.105 position:50% align:center
You will recover.
We should hold here for now.

line has already been decimated!

came down the treacherous pass

attacked from behind.
