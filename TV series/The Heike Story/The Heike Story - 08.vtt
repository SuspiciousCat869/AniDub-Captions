[GINYO] You've traveled such
a long way through the snow.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
But Gio and Hotoke-Gozen
are no longer with us.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
I already knew.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
[GINYO] For some time,
we were all able

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
to live here in peace
and tranquility.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
You reminded me.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
There was a shirabyoshi
that came to visit once

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
who mentioned
something worth noting.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.708 position:50% align:center
She described meeting a woman

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
with a rather
distinctive eye color.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
Sounded quite similar to yours.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
[BIWA gasps]

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
Apparently, she used
to be a shirabyoshi.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
Where is she now? Do you know?

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
[GINYO] We can send a
message to the woman

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
who visited and ask her.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.973 position:50% align:center

[ATSUMORI] Ah! You mustn't
eat that, Your Majesty!

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center
Let 's give it back
to Lord Atsumori.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.755 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
So then, Lady Tokuko.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.967 position:50% align:center
Did Biwa ever come here
to stay with you?

00:02:56.051 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center
No. I would've liked
to have seen her.

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
However, cutting ties
with our family

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.686 position:50% align:center
may yet prove to be
in her best interest.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.204 position:50% align:center

It's so cute!

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
Thank you, ma'am.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
Of course. I hope it nourishes
you, despite being so thin.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER B]
Where are you headed, anyway?

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
To a province called Echigo.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
Where is that?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.176 position:50% align:center
Well, according to
what I've been told,

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
it's several mountains
away from here.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.513 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER A]
Goodness.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
But why must you travel so far?

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
My ma may be there.
I hope so.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
Please be careful, dear.
There have been stories

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
that fleeing Genji warriors
may be lurking about.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
There was a battle
near Sunomatagawa,

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:01.074 position:50% align:center
where forces of the Genji
and the Heike were clashing.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
We were beaten.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
[MASAKO]
Show some backbone!

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
This means next time,
we must win!

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.668 position:50% align:center
Can we, though?

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50% align:center
Consider fellow Genji,
Lord Yoshinaka.

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
He's been steadily
gaining power in Kiso.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
As the clan head,
you should not be outdone!

[YORITOMO grumbles]

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.482 position:50% align:center

[YOSHINAKA grunts]

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
[KANEHIRA]
Hey!

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAKA grunts]

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
So they defeated Yoritomo?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
[KANEHIRA] Yeah, but from what
I've heard, the Heike didn't go

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
after the ones who ran away.
It could've been much worse.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAKA]
Hm... Heh...

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll fight those
Heike dogs, too!

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
So whattaya gotta say
about that, Kanehira?

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd say it's no big
surprise, coming from you.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
Yoritomo and Yoshinaka.

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
It's finally time to let
the world know the Genji

have two generals!

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
That's just what I'd
hoped you'd say!

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
When your father and Yoritomo
battled all those years ago,

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
way back then,
you were just a baby.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
I knew I had to gather you up.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
And take you to
safety here in Kiso.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
And to think, now we're plotting
the Heike's demise together!

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
I'll join you! I, Tomoe,
pledge to lend my sword.

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
[MEN grunting]

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
Pretty exciting turn of events,
huh? Right, Yoshinaka?

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
I'll say!

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI] Thanks to
Shigehira and Koremori,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
Yoritomo was soundly
defeated at Sunomatagawa.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
However, Yoshinaka has
conquered Shinano

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
and is attempting
to take Hokuriku next.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
You'll need to act quickly.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
Munemori, are you
even listening?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI]
Huh...?! Who me?

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
Since Father has passed away,

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
you have many
more responsibilities

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center
as the official head
of the Heike!

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
I shall gather my troops
and head to Hokuriku.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
Shigehira, care to share
your thoughts with us?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
Although I agree that proper
action must be taken,

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
I say we wait and
make an assessment.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI] Hm... Well, the
governor of Echigo was supposed

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
to kill Yoshinaka, but it
would seem he died suddenly.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
[MONK A] If you're looking
for the governor of Echigo,

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid you've
missed your chance--

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
as Lord Jo Sukenaga
recently passed away.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
When he rode off
to battle Yoshinaka,

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
a voice was heard,
seemingly from the sky.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
"Apprehend him who
allies with the Heike,

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
burners of the great
Buddha," it said.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center
Then, suddenly, he toppled
from his horse.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
He was a very important man

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
from what's known
as the Echigo Heishi.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
A woman lived with him,
a former shirabyoshi.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
Who, from what I've heard,

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
is said to have an eye
quite similar to mine.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
Hm... Oh!

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
I believe the one you're
referring to would be Asagi.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
They say she had once
lived in the capital.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
Can I meet with her?

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, after
Lord Sukenaga passed away,

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
she then left Echigo.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
I believe that she was
returning to the capital.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50% align:center
No way, after I traveled
so far to get here...

The opposition's
forces are growing.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
Etchu, Kaga,
and Echizen sent men.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
All are flocking to
Yoshinaka's side.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
Yet the head of our clan
sits here in revelry!

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
His main concern
is getting drunk!

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
If this keeps up,
we're done for!

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
Yoshinaka will storm the
capital before Yoritomo can!

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50% align:center
We must do whatever
we can to prevent that!

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
A "winding stream party?"

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
That's what Lord Munemori
is calling the gathering.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
The premise of it is,
you have to compose a poem

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
before the sake dish
floats past you.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.713 position:50% align:center
So Lord Atsumori and I are
trying it out beforehand.

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
It's fun. Still though,
while we play games,

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.343 position:50% align:center
Lord Koremori is
leading troops to battle

[KIYOTSUNE] It's like Brother
has become a different person.

A far cry from the boy
who fled from birds.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
Word is he took Hiuchi
castle in Echizen.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
As for me, I wish I could've
joined in the fight.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I'd much prefer
the winding stream party.

--[ATSUMORI] Huh...
--[KIYOTSUNE] Hmm...

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
It's quite the luxury.

as he's faced with
a pivotal battle.

All I'm trying to say
is that I'd rather have

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
to rely on my brains over
my brawn, you know.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
Either way would be
a losing situation for you.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
Stop, you two! Let's pray
for Lord Koremori's victory.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
We have a hundred thousand.
They have half that.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.802 position:50% align:center
And with Brother's
newfound courage,

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.846 position:50% align:center
there should be nothing to fear!

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
So wait for me!

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
[TADANORI] I had heard
that Yoshinaka was a rather

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50% align:center
unrefined man. It's surprising
he extended that courtesy.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
He may be the monkey of Kiso,
but seems he's been

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
trained to honor some
sense of ceremony.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
[HEIKE SOLDIERS laughing]

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
This "monkey' took Hokuriku.
He's shrewd. Don't forget that.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
As soon as dawn breaks, we'll
need to advance our forces.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
Yes. The terrain's unfamiliar.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
We're not accustomed
to the mountains.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I think
it would be best

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
to engage the enemy on open,
level ground.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
Lord Koremori's assessment
is exactly correct.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
Well then, we should retire and
rest up for tomorrow's battle.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAKA chuckles]

00:10:55.447 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
[GENJI SOLDIERS yelling]

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
[yelling continues]

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
No. That sound...

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
It's the enemy!
Prepare for battle!

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center
Now! Hurry!

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
[HEIKE SOLDIER A]
Make haste!

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
[HEIKE SOLDIER B]
You heard him! Get ready!

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
Everything according to plan.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
Such a brilliant strategy--ten
thousand men on their flank!

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I knew those polite
idiots who always play

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
by the rules would
never see this coming.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
Now we drive 'em down
into the valley. Let's go!

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS shouting]

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
[HEIKE SOLDIER C screaming]

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
[HEIKE SOLDIERS shouting]

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI panting]

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:16.087 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI] Seventy thousand
soldiers fell into the valley?

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
That's insane...
What do we do now?

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI gasping]

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
Now, we prepare for Yoshinaka's
march on the capital.

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI gasping]

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:30.560 position:50% align:center
My god. That was hell!

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
[NOBLEMAN A] Hurry! Yoshinaka
is on his way! So move!

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSWOMAN A yelps]

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
We're to leave the capital?

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center
Take the emperor
with you, as well as

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
the three Sacred Treasures,
of course!

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
All signs point to Enryakuji
temple siding with the Genji.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
which means that we
will surely lack

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
sufficient forces to
oppose Yoshinaka.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:57.712 position:50% align:center
Uh, there are still a number

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
of remaining Heike
allies in the west!

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
So we'd best regroup, and then
face Yoshinaka, you agree?

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
Hear that, Emperor?

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.098 position:50% align:center
It's time to get ready
to go on an outing.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
But where to?

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
First, we will go to Fukuhara.

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you don't remember
the time you've spent there.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
But it's been your second home.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.108 position:50% align:center
I refuse.

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
But why? Trips like
these are so much fun.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
[ANTOKU grumbles]

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:25.699 position:50% align:center
Well then, shall your mother
and I travel there without you?

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:29.786 position:50% align:center
[ANTOKU grunts, cries]

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
[ANTOKU]
I will go. Prepare my carriage.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center
We can only bring
essentials with us.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:03.319 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] Sukemori, I assume
you were visiting Lady Iko?

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
I was.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:07.949 position:50% align:center
She unfortunately
has chosen to remain here.

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
Has she now.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.829 position:50% align:center
It seems that many are leaving
behind wives or children.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
Although this city will soon
be the Genji's capital.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center
Not true. The capital is
wherever the emperor resides.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
It's not bound to this place.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
Anywhere the emperor and I can
live in peace and tranquility

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.891 position:50% align:center
will be enough.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO grunts]

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
Has he gone?

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:43.777 position:50% align:center
Yes, the emperor was
able to depart safely.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
Was Emperor Go-Shirakawa
traveling with them as well?

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
There's been no sign of him.

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
It would appear that he snuck
out of his estate last night.

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA]
Go to Fukuhara with the Heike?

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
Surely, you'll grant me
refuge here in Kurama.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
I don't understand!
We won't stand and fight?

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50% align:center
Even if we could beat back
Yoshinaka's invasion,

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
then the monks of
Mount Hiei would attack us.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
Most likely with Yoritomo
right on their heels.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
If we choose to
all fight together,

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
I know we can defeat the Genji!

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
Have you seen Koremori?

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
We have to leave
this place right now.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKIYO]
Father,

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center
you'll be coming back to
fetch us soon, won't you?

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
We'll be waiting for you.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI sobs]

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
Here you are.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You need to
get moving. Now. Go!

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
It's because of my failure.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't lost so many
warriors at Kurikara Pass,

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
none of this would be happening.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.805 position:50% align:center
So I can never face
the clan again.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
I have absolutely no right
to flee the capital with them!

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
Brother, none of this
is your fault!

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
We are going to the west,

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
where we'll raise a stronger
army to fight back!

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
We're not just leaving the
capital for the enemy to take!

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
Kiyotsune...

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI sobs]

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI]
Light it up!

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEHIRA]
Did we truly need to burn it?

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
We can't simply let the
Genji have it, now can we?

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
By the time they
enter the capital,

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:33.720 position:50% align:center
all they'll find is 50,000
piles of ash to claim.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
This is just terrible!

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
I never dreamed Lord Kiyomori's
precious Fukuhara

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
would become such
a desolate ruin.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.075 position:50% align:center
Oooh get it off of me!

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
Such disarray! What a shame.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose three years of
neglect have taken their toll.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
We can stay here for the night,

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
and first thing tomorrow
we'll sail off to Dazaifu.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
Dazaifu, huh?
That's so far away.

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
It's surely far enough
to escape Yoshinaka.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
My Lord. I imagine this
will be your first time

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.971 position:50% align:center
staying in a place
like this, won't it?

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
Will there not be ghosts
that scare us in the night?

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
If there are, I will make sure
that they don't bother us.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
But I'll need you to
be brave, Emperor.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
Then, let's stay!

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI]
That's the spirit!

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI laughs]

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
[ATSUMORI]
Lord Kiyotsune.

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
Lord Atsumori.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
I knew it. Surely I
would find you here.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
I remember we used
to play on this beach.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
Yes, even Lord Shigehira
joined us.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.882 position:50% align:center
Such good memories.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
Feels like an eternity ago.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
Lord Kiyotsune.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Before we left our home,
Koremori was in such a state.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
He places the blame on himself.

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
But this just can't be
my brother's fault alone.

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.067 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
Our once proud clan has
been driven out like rats.

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
We've been forced to stay
in this desolate place.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
Why is all of this
happening to us?

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
Lord Kiyotsune, please try
to pull yourself together.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
The time has now come
for us to join the fight!

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
We went from a hundred thousand
troops to seven thousand.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
We have no chance
against the enemy.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
We'll be crushed.

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
I still choose to fight!
It's in your blood.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
You should never forget that.

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
Lord Kiyomori and
his father were fighters!

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
But tonight we can make music.

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I can't right now.

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
Amongst this desolation,

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
the sound of a flute
would just be too sad.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
