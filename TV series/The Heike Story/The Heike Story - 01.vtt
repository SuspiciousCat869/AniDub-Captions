You've heralded the dawn of
the Taira Clan's preeminence.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
Lord Shigemori is Palace
Minister and Left Commander.

Lord Tomomori is third rank
and a captain.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
Lord Koremori is fourth rank
and a lieutenant.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
Our clan boasts
many senior nobles,

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
over 30 trusted courtiers
and 60 officials,

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
including provincial
governors and guard officers.

at this time,

the Heike governs more than
30 of the empire's 66 provinces.

it's as if government
has no place

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center
for those outside the Heike.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:34.371 position:50% align:center
No. Humanity has no place
for those outside.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center

Go-Shirakawa's ultimate victory.

I shall reside in Fukuhara.

[gasps] But why?

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
Fukuhara is a good day's
journey from the capital.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
Not to mention there's
absolutely nothing in the area.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
There's the sea.
It's the perfect location

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
for me to construct a
harbor for large ships.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.750 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI] All trade with Suo
will now move through Fukuhara,

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.336 position:50% align:center
away from the mountains
of Dazaifu.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
The sea brings wealth.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
With both wealth and
military might in our hands,

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
we shall wield them with
confidence and certainty.

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
And bring about a grand
new age for the Heike.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
Thus, we offer our
gratitude to the sea...

has given us.

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
For now, let's prepare a room
and some fresh clothes.

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to spend as much
time here as you may require.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Hmm...? Hmph.

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
[LADIES]
My word!

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
[LADY A]
Oh, my!

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
[LADY B]
Goodness!

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
[LADY A]
Oh, my...

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
[LADY B]
Goodness...

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
A girl, you say?

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
[LADY A]
Indeed.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
Could she be a court lady?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
She did tell us that she
refuses to dress like a girl.

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
I believe her exact words were,

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
"Pa always made me dress
like a boy, so I am a boy."

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I see. Well,
I imagine her father

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
must've insisted
on boys' garments

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50% align:center
out of concern for her safety.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI gasping]

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
[LADIES]
Oh, my...

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
[LADY A]
Goodness...

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
[LADY B]
Where does it all go?

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
[BIWA grunts]

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, why don't you show her
a few things about etiquette.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
[LADIES]
Of course.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
Now then, child.
What is your name?

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
Biwa.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.943 position:50% align:center
My Pa never called me
by any other name.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:24.322 position:50% align:center
So that's the only one I know.

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
Chose it myself.

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
I see. It suits you.

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
It's because I love
this instrument.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
Almost as much as I love Pa.

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
Biwa, do you think you'd
like to stay here with us?

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
[BIWA grunting]

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
I am asking for you
to please stay,

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
for both your sake and mine.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
Your eye. I want you to
share what it shows you.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
That most valuable knowledge

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
could help me prevent
the fall of my clan.

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
No, I won't. Never for you.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] Because Pa always told me
never look at the future.

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI exhales]

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] Everyone's here,
Father. What is it?

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] Biwa, I'd like you
to meet Koremori,

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
Sukemori, Kiyotsune,
and Arimori.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center
Please welcome our guest, Biwa.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.025 position:50% align:center
Who is this kid?

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
Biwa will live with us here.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll get
along splendidly.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
A warrior's kid, right?

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
No.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
A biwa musician's kid!

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--Heh.

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
So, low birth.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Say what? People like
you make me so angry!

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Biwa! Try to calm down, please!

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
Biwa, I sincerely hope
you'll accept my friendship.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
Bow, Sukemori.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
[BIWA grunts]

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:03.815 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Hm?

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
[BIWA growls]

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
What? Is something wrong?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
The future...
I won't look at it.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
It just struck me how I
find the color of your eye

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
uniquely beautiful,
and how I can't recall

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
ever feeling that way
about my own.

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not beautiful.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
Pa always thought
my eye was scary.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
I find mine frightening, too.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
Because all I can see are souls
who have left this world

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
wandering through
the darkness, lost.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.589 position:50% align:center
Shigemori.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
I know you want to
come with me, don't ya?

00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
Uh. Not really.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
Uh! Your loss! Hmph.

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.772 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
Hello, Sukemori.

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] Lady Tokuko!
She's Father's younger sister.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
To what do we owe this pleasure?

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] Father will be
visiting from Fukuhara.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
Grandfather's coming? Well,

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
I'll bring him back something
amazing from the hunt!

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
Be careful not to be chased
by something amazing instead.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI gasping] I shall
take my leave! Get moving!

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
Now, then. You're a girl, right?

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
I can tell.

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
I'm curious if there's a reason
why you're dressed like a boy.

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.812 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
It's probably better
for you this way.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
We women are...

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
[BIWA gasping]

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
[BIWA panting]

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
You failed to dismount

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
before His Highness the regent?

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
Coming home from the hunt,
I was in a hurry.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
Onward! Faster!

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.058 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
They said I was disrespectful.

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
[MOTOFUSA]
How rude!

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
I believe they should treat a
child with more understanding.

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:49.647 position:50% align:center
But still, you know
better than to behave

00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
in such a way. We've taught you.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] Lord Motofusa
is Emperor Takakura's regent--!

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
Well, now. Perhaps
apologizing to him

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50% align:center
and the Emperor would be--

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
Wait. Hear me out, Shigemori.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
Rokuhara's warriors
can resolve this issue

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
quickly before it
comes to a head!

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
Although the regent
may have overreacted,

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
this response was
beyond the pale!

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
It was necessary to show
the strength of the Heike.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
Moreover... It's quite amusing!

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA] He always does
whatever he pleases! Even now!

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
I'd thought him leaving
the capital meant

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
I would no longer be
made to suffer his antics.

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
What will the court have
to do to save face now?

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
They made a fool of
the Emperor's regent.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
This behavior simply
cannot be allowed!
