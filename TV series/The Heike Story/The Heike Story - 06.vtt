I'm sure they won't attack
tonight. Get some rest.

[HEIKE SOLDIERS chattering]

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
Did the enemy run away
before the battle began?

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
It seems they were
startled by birds,

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
which caused them all
to flee immediately.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
Really, now?

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
What a disgrace!

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
Even losing the fight
would've been honorable!

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
Koremori, since
Shigemori passed on,

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
you've got nobody
left to back you!

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
I was trying to hand you
some real achievements!

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
Which is why I
made you commander!

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
Behead Tadakiyo!

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
[TADAKIYO gulps]

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
And exile Koremori
to Kikaigashima!

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI gasps]

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Father!

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
Lord Tadakiyo is
the very same man

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
who commanded the vanguard
in the Hogen Rebellion!

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
For years, he's been an
immense help to the Heike!

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEHIRA]
I must speak up as well.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
Have mercy. Koremori
is new to warfare.

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
I believe that he still has
many victories ahead of him!

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI] Yoritomo is our
enemy! We must unite as a clan.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
It's the only way we can
hope to defeat him!

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI gasping]

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE] Somehow he
was able to avoid exile,

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
but I must say, as his brother,
I'm embarrassed.

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
Don't be. But when
the time comes for us

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
to go to war, let's make a
pledge to fight heroically!

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
[cat meows]

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Hm?

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
Please don't be scared.

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] You're so cute.
Biwa's got you now.

[KOREMORI grunting]

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
Koremori.

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.040 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
I'm glad that you're--

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
I was scared.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
When I thought about being
overrun by that many soldiers,

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
I was terrified.

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Mm.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI sniffles]

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] Koremori, I'd absolutely
love to watch you dance again.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
Just like at Itsukushima.
On the beach.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
I'm through dancing.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
The capital has changed.

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
And I must change, as well!

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] Instead of dancing,
from now on, I'll have to fight

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.575 position:50% align:center
as a brave Heike warrior!
