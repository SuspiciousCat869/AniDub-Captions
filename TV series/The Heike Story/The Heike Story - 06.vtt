Do you think Brother might be
taking a bit too much with him?

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.194 position:50% align:center
I say we take everything
we possibly can.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.654 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE]
Oh, Biwa!

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.115 position:50% align:center
Have you had the chance to
pack up all your things yet?

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Mm-hmm.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
Wow, well, you certainly
packed light!

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] Ugh. I wish
Grandfather hadn't decided

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
to move the capital all
the way to Fukuhara.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE] If we stay here,
we could be caught up

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
in another rebellion.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:47.297 position:50% align:center
But things are
different in Fukuhara.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.631 position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.633 position:50% align:center
With the sea in front and
the mountains behind,

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.219 position:50% align:center
the Heike can
protect everyone! Ow!

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:56.973 position:50% align:center
Not packing a lot of thoughts
in there, are you?

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
All that'll be protected
is the Heike's power.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.228 position:50% align:center
This relocation is
happening too fast

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
for people to build homes.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
But I know anyone who
stays here will be seen

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.235 position:50% align:center
as somehow going
against the clan.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.571 position:50% align:center
That's why people are
tearing apart their houses

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
to take the timbers with them.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.828 position:50% align:center
Just you watch.
The capital will be a ruin.

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:57.302 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE] Fukuhara is
wonderful, I've missed it!

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes! Everything about
this place is just divine!

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] I have to admit,
I'm a little envious

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
of your ability to
completely clear your mind.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
You sure you don't want to play
in the water, Sukemori?

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm too old for that!

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] Liar! You're dying
to splash around!

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
How about I drag you in?

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
[ATSUMORI] Might you happen to
be Lords Sukemori and Kiyotsune?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
I'm the son of Taira no
Tsunemori. My name is Atsumori.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:26.289 position:50% align:center
I don't recognize him.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
His father is one of
Grandfather's younger brothers.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
[ATSUMORI]
When I came to the estate,

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
they told me I'd
find you out here.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
You didn't need to come all this
way just to greet us, you know.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
In truth, I wanted to
meet Lord Kiyotsune.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
Who, this guy?

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.596 position:50% align:center
[ATSUMORI]
Indeed!

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
The tales going around say
he's a master of the flute.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's the famous flute
known as Saeda, isn't it?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.231 position:50% align:center
If I'm not mistaken,
it was passed down

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
by Emperor Toba himself.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:53.817 position:50% align:center
[ATSUMORI]
Yes.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
Well, if it's no bother to you,

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
I would love to hear
you play, Atsumori.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I was hoping to
hear you play, though.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
I know! We should meet
here later tonight,

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
for some moon viewing!

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
a delightful idea!

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
The moon's so lovely.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's quite lovely.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50% align:center
I realize that this
comes rather late,

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
but my condolences
on your father.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
To think it's been a year
since his passing.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
You see, I've long held
Lord Shigemori's accomplishments

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
as a warrior in high regard.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
I recall his words
in the Heiji Rebellion.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
"This is our time!
The era is Heiji!

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
The capital is Heian.
And we are the proud Heike!

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
Now men. Let's show them
what that means!"

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
All my life I've been
enthralled by the stories

00:04:56.588 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
I've heard about him, and how
he was able to inspire his men!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE]
I appreciate your words,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
and I'm positive Father would
feel honored, as well.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] Did we come here
to just flap our gums?

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
I thought there would
be flute playing.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Lord Sukemori!

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
Oh. My brother does
have a tendency

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
to be rather coarse
and vulgar. Pay no mind.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI grunting]

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center

What an honor. My name is--

Atsumori.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
[ATSUMORI]
Incredible! I have heard tales

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.128 position:50% align:center
of your many great achievements,
Lord Shigehira!

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
The men talk about how
magnificently you performed

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
in the battles
at Uji and Onjoji.

[grunting]

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Well, this talk of war will
surely cloud our view

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
of the moon. So, I'd rather
listen to the voice of Saeda.

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
Right!

â™ª

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA] From the size and
confining nature of this place,

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
it's no mystery why it's
known as the "Cage Palace."

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
I will ask my father to
move you somewhere else.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
A man of your stature
needs space.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
As if that bull-headed fool
would honor such a request.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
For now, please try to endure
it a little while longer.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.703 position:50% align:center
You know what they say about
clarity of heart and mind.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
It arises at the sight
of a collapsed temple.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.334 position:50% align:center
Oh? Quoting Imayo
to me, are you?

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
Yes.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose the
Cage Palace could be fun.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
For the time being,
I think can endure it.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
I've heard that my son
has been feeling unwell.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it's merely the fatigue
of this sudden relocation.

[TAKAKURA grunts]

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
You do not need to bother
yourself with that, Tokuko.

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
Not a bother.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
for you to apologize.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
Well then... "I am grateful."

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
You're being so considerate.
Please, do not worry about me.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
They tell me that you've
even been making visits

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
to see my father recently.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:49.052 position:50% align:center
You've taken such wonderful
care of me from the very start.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
I was incredibly young and naive

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
when you first came
to live with me.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
I admired you immensely.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
You were so wise and beautiful.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
Quite a contrast
to me at that time.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
Back then, I knew nothing of the
world or how to carry myself.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.987 position:50% align:center
I was just a child.

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:12.701 position:50% align:center
I feel extremely grateful
for all you've done for me.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:16.663 position:50% align:center
Hearing these kind words
fill me with such happiness.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center

strange occurrences as of late.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
A pine tree withering
in a single night,

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
and in the tail of the finest
horse in the eastern provinces,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.587 position:50% align:center
a mouse had made itself a nest.

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center

I hear your father is a poet
and quite a skilled one, too.

Indeed, and you should come
to his next poetry contest.

I'm willing to bet there
are more of these stories

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.492 position:50% align:center
about spirits and the

It's obvious that people simply
want to go back to the capital.

who's also in the capital,

is that woman you fancy.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should use
your gift for poetry

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
to write her a letter.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
I realize that you just
don't understand,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
but matters of love
are very complex.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
I can't see her, so my only
option is to get my own bride.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
Ah... Are you serious?

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, Biwa.
Lord Kiyomori requests you.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
He wants Biwa?

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
[LADY A]
Yes, my Lord.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
What? I don't recall
asking you boys to join me!

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they
must've come here

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
out of concern for Biwa,
isn't that right?

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
I'm here because Sukemori
asked me to come with them.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
Why're you concerned?

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI whistles]

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
You didn't know exactly
what sort of plan

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
the old man had
in mind for Biwa.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
Oh, come now.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
I wanted to calm the
spirits and thought

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
that some biwa music would
do the trick quite nicely.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
I see. I trust
that's all there is.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI grunts]

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
[BIWA laughs]

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
I sleep soundly without
meeting any restless spirits.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.360 position:50% align:center
In fact, I think I
should retire now.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
I'll leave the ghosts
in your capable hands.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
Please, Biwa, will you play?

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
I can't help but think

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
that this is the music
Shigemori heard.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
Though he may have been
a boring and sober man,

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
he was the only one
who had the fortitude

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
to tell me what
he truly thought.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
What a shame to lose him
when things had just begun.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.148 position:50% align:center
The nobles spent money
they didn't have

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
to simply laze about. And when
uprisings would occur,

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
they did not have the
power to quell them.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
The world has been run
by the idle aristocrats

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
and sanctimonious priests.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
Coasting on status to
assert their authority.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
That changed with the Heike!

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
We alone breathed fresh air
into a suffocating world,

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
with our wealth and our power!

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
What?

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
It's just, as of now,
the Heike are...

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
Whenever there is great change,

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
there will always be
those who oppose it.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
They simply reject it
out of hand.

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.523 position:50% align:center
That is why we must
work together as one.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
Why our clan must
strive for unity!

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
In this new capital, with our
port open to the world,

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
we will build upon our wealth!

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
And with that wealth,
we'll gain extraordinary power!

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
Our world will grow such that
the sun will never set on it.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
[MONGAKU] Lord Yoritomo, this
is the skull of your father.

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It truly is?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
[MONGAKU]
After the Heiji rebellion,

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
it lay in front of the prison
covered in dirt and moss--

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
until I took possession of it.
How frustrated he must have been

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
with no one to pray
for his soul.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
And you're certain
that it's him?

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
Prince Mochihito set his sights
on bringing down the Heike

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
and it cost him his very life!
Yorimasa and Nakatsuna

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
committed suicide
in their disgrace.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
You are the only one who can see
their mission to its completion!

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
The Heike claim that they
created a new world of warriors,

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
but all they really did
was take over the court!

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.251 position:50% align:center
Allowing only their
clan to prosper!

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
Yes, I suppose that's true.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
You alone have the power to
change things, Lord Yoritomo.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
[YORITOMO] That may be the case,
and in contrast to Kiyomori,

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
I could promote warriors
from outside my clan,

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
creating a new world, while
still preserving the court.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
That lofty goal would convince
many men to follow you!

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
[YORITOMO]
However,

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
Lord Kiyomori granted mercy
and spared my life.

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
To return that by raising
troops against him...

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
[MONGAKU]
Not to worry!

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
I recently visited Fukuhara
and was given

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50% align:center
a decree from
Emperor Go-Shirakawa.

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
[GO-SHIRAKAWA] The Heike has
taken to ignoring the court

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
and self-dealing.

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
Appointing only their own
to positions of power.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
You must see them
brought to ruin.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
The Heike is our enemy,
root them out.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
It's genuine?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
I assure you, my Lord, it is.

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI] Yoritomo's raising
an army against us?!

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI] He left Izu with his
father-in-law Hojo Tokimasa.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center
I spared that man!
Sent him to exile!

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
He's alive only because
of my generosity!

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
Well, according to my men,

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
he engaged Heike forces
at Ishibashiyama,

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
but fled with seven or eight
riders after losing the fight.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
Then we must strike
him down before

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
he has a chance to rally
with the other Genji.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
I know. Koremori will
command the attack!

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.670 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
Do you believe he's ready?

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI] At Koremori's age,
Shigemori had since notched

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
several decisive
military victories.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
Koremori can do it, too.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
Let us show them all
the power of the Heike!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI grunting]

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.436 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEHIRA grunts]

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
Wait here for the Genji?

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
Would it not be better to cross
the river and Mount Ashigara?

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.574 position:50% align:center
That way, we could
engage the enemy

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
in the open eastern
fields instead.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
Lord Kiyomori has
entrusted me, Tadakiyo,

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
to decide what strategy to take.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
The soldiers and
their horses need rest.

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
And since we are short on
provisions, I say we wait here.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
[TADAKIYO] We have gathered
70 thousand riders, my Lord.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
With that in mind,

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
we should operate carefully
and deliberately.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
Report, sir.

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:15.141 position:50% align:center
The Genji have assembled
200 thousand riders!

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI gasps]
They have that many?

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
A month has passed since
Yoritomo began to raise

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
his army. Genji warriors
must have come running

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
from all over to join him.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center
--Sanemori.
--[SANEMORI] My Lord.

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
They've told me
that you're familiar

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
with the eastern warriors.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
[SANEMORI] I have fought
alongside the Genji

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
several times in the past.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
What is your
assessment of them?

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
They're extremely
fierce and spirited.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
I have never seen one
fall from his horse.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
Even if their parent or their
own child had been taken down,

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
they would just ride over the
corpse and continue fighting.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.508 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:50.885 position:50% align:center
That may be, but surely
there are none among

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
their ranks who can wield
a bow as powerfully as you?

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
Not true, the Genji have scores
of highly skilled archers

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
who can easily pierce two
or three suits of armor

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
in one single shot.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
[SANEMORI] The Genji of Kai
and Shinano provinces

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
know this area quite well.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
I cannot stress how important
is to remain vigilant,

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
lest they flank us.

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
[TADAKIYO] Why did you
say those things to him?

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
It was abundantly clear the
troops were not motivated

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
or on guard.
I had to light a fire.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
The Heike of today have grown
accustomed to an easy life

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
of privilege and have since
lost their edge and ferocity.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.717 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER B]
Look! What is that?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center
Over that way!

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.386 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI gasps]

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.263 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS chattering]

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER D]
How could this be?

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER E]
There are countless soldiers.

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER F]
In the river!

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER G]
They're everywhere!

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
The exchange of arrows will
begin by early tomorrow morning.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they won't attack
tonight. Get some rest.

[HEIKE SOLDIERS chattering]

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
Did the enemy run away
before the battle began?

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
It seems they were
startled by birds,

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
which caused them all
to flee immediately.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
Really, now?

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI]
What a disgrace!

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
Even losing the fight
would've been honorable!

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
Koremori, since
Shigemori passed on,

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
you've got nobody
left to back you!

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
I was trying to hand you
some real achievements!

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
Which is why I
made you commander!

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
Behead Tadakiyo!

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
[TADAKIYO gulps]

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
And exile Koremori
to Kikaigashima!

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI gasps]

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Father!

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
Lord Tadakiyo is
the very same man

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
who commanded the vanguard
in the Hogen Rebellion!

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
For years, he's been an
immense help to the Heike!

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEHIRA]
I must speak up as well.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
Have mercy. Koremori
is new to warfare.

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
I believe that he still has
many victories ahead of him!

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI] Yoritomo is our
enemy! We must unite as a clan.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
It's the only way we can
hope to defeat him!

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI gasping]

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[KIYOTSUNE] Somehow he
was able to avoid exile,

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
but I must say, as his brother,
I'm embarrassed.

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
Don't be. But when
the time comes for us

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
to go to war, let's make a
pledge to fight heroically!

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
[cat meows]

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Hm?

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
Please don't be scared.

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] You're so cute.
Biwa's got you now.

[KOREMORI grunting]

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
Koremori.

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.040 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
I'm glad that you're--

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
I was scared.

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
When I thought about being
overrun by that many soldiers,

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
I was terrified.

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Mm.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI sniffles]

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] Koremori, I'd absolutely
love to watch you dance again.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
Just like at Itsukushima.
On the beach.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
I'm through dancing.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
The capital has changed.

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.732 position:50% align:center
And I must change, as well!

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI] Instead of dancing,
from now on, I'll have to fight

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.575 position:50% align:center
as a brave Heike warrior!
