Biwa?

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
Biwa.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
Biwa!

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

[ANTOKU laughing]

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine. I'm sure.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:12.172 position:50% align:center
I'll live to protect my child.

[ANTOKU laughing]

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] His Majesty will
be watching over us, too.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
I know it.
And I will never forget

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
the kind words
he shared with me.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
I feel extremely grateful
for all you've done for me.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] At the time,
I was disappointed

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
because what he said didn't seem
like a declaration of love.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
Though, my time at
His Majesty's side

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
was quite meaningful.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
It helped me grow as a person.

could see this, too.

[MUNEMORI]
Kiso no Yoshinaka?

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI] Right. Seems he's
a distant cousin of Yoritomo.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.195 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI]
He's a Genji, then?

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI] Yes, but there's a
complicated family situation.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
He grew up in Kiso,
after his father was killed

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.495 position:50% align:center
by Yoritomo's older brother.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
[MUNEMORI] And this Yoshinaka
was able to raise an army

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
in Shinano?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
A crass opportunist.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
All he did was follow
Yoritomo's lead.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Why is it
that everyone wants

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
to go out of their way
and defy me these days?

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
Even my own daughter.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
To think after working a
lifetime to lift up the clan,

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.017 position:50% align:center
that I would be met

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
with such rampant
scorn and hostility.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
[TOMOMORI] Father, there will be
time to lament your treatment

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
after you strike down the Genji!

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
Uh! That is absolutely correct!

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
Those outside the Heike
are not people!

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
Just what I needed
to hear, thank you.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
I cannot believe this heat.
I feel like I'm being roasted.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO]
You're this hot in winter?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
[ATSUMORI] Word is that people
siding with the Genji

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
have cropped up in Kawachi,
Kyushu, and Kumano.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
Uncle Munemori said
he'll be mobilizing forces

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
to quell these uprisings
without hesitation.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
It would appear after
the fire that raged in Nara,

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
Lord Shigehira has lost
his taste for battle.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
But Lord Munemori...
Is he up to the task?

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
What? Father is unwell?

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
Hot. I'm burning up. Hot.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO] I don't understand
what's happening.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center

We have come to your

of great King Enma.

King Enma?

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
[HORSE DEMON] Sent here to
collect Kiyomori's impure soul.

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:35.917 position:50% align:center
He has set fire to temples,
burning the Great Buddha,

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
and for his sins, he is now
being roasted in flames.

[OX DEMON] Uninterrupted
suffering awaits him

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
[TOKIKO] Lord Kiyomori,
if you have any final wishes,

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center
please, share them with me now.

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
Only that you spread
my ashes at Fukuhara,

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
so I can become
one with the tides.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
I was able to fulfill all my
desires in this life. Except...

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
I wish I could've
had the pleasure

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center
of seeing Yoritomo's lifeless
head at the end of a spear.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:42.025 position:50% align:center
I need no halls or pagodas
erected in my honor.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
I have no use for
a funeral service.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
All I want is for
Yoritomo to die.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
Send someone to go
and cut off his head.

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
And in place of my grave marker,
hang it for all to see.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center

she's not still upset with me.

How could this happen?

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] Shigemori. I'm so sorry.
Now, your Pa is gone, too.

[BIWA] I don't know what I'm
supposed to do.

Everybody dies one day.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
I'm going to keep losing people.

become of the Heike?

what's to come!

it is, I want to know!

Brother!

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
Look. Right now you need
rest more than anything.

[KOREMORI] What I need
is to know our fate!

In all directions are those who
chose to side with the Genji.

Father is gone.
Grandfather is gone.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
There's no one to show us
the way forward.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center

who runs at the sound of birds.

forward, could you face it?

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
I don't think so.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
But, Sukemori! How can you
say that to him?

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
Brother is tired
from the journey

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
and from Grandfather's funeral.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center

Biwa,

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
forgive my outburst.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
Leave. Go away.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
From the first moment
I saw you, I thought you

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
and your weird-colored
eye were creepy.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center
And the sound of your
biwa makes me sick.

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
Brother, you're being so cruel.

[SUKEMORI]
After father passed away,

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
we should've thrown
you into the street.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
You don't belong here now

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
and I don't think
that you ever have!

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
Stop.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] Is that clear?
I want you gone before spring.

[KIYOTSUNE]
Brother!

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Biwa.

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
Please don't worry.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
I know Sukemori's heart,
and I can handle myself.

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
At long last my confinement

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
is lifted and I'm back
in my own home.

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] I am truly sorry
for all the hardships

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:39.012 position:50% align:center

to see Kiyomori's head

bowed in such a way. Alas,

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
even if he fell to the
lowest depths of hell,

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he's clawing
his way up.

She is quite beautiful,
but far too quiet for my tastes.

You, on the other hand,

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
would've made a great

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
Then I will continue to
visit you when I can.

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
Unless there's an objection.

Oh, will you now?

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that'll be a comfort
to the poor woman.

in an unwanted marriage
