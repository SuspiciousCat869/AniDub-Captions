Tokuko.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
Away with you.
Please, stay back! No!

What'd you see?

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:58.475 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] I beg you. You can take
me but spare my child! Please!

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
Tokuko.

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.529 position:50% align:center
At last, Tokuko is with child,

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50% align:center
but she suffers,
and constantly so.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.660 position:50% align:center
Take heart. Don't let
that darken your thoughts.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:43.913 position:50% align:center
I'm certain Tokuko will
safely bear your child.

By the way, Lord Shigemori.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center
I must express my deepest
gratitude to you.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.880 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKURA] Regarding the
situation with my father.

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:54.591 position:50% align:center
When Lord Kiyomori had
intended to confine him,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
you intervened at risk
to your own life.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.389 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.
His Majesty. He's well?

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKURA]
Having lost many advisors,

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
he devotes most of his time
to compiling imayo.

[exhales]

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
My father is a great man
and it is rather painful

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
to see him brought so low.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
I understand and ask that you
send him my regards and prayers.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.372 position:50% align:center
We of the Taira clan are honored

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
to be faithful servants
of the court,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
and that will never change.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.681 position:50% align:center
Shigemori. What did you see?

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.769 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
I saw Lord Saiko.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
And Lord Narichika, who died
during his exile in Bizen,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50% align:center
which I failed to prevent.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
Also the ill will of those
exiled to Kikaigashima.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
Quite strange.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50% align:center
Biwa, I must go now and
pay a visit to my father.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
He's briefly left Fukuhara
and is in the capital.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
I ask that you please return
home with Sukemori.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
Lady Iko! Your affections.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
I desperately want
them all to myself!

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
Please, Lady Iko.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
No, wait, don't go!

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI sighs]

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI sighs] It would
appear that my Lady Iko

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
has feelings for another man.
I'm snubbed.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
This man is nearly
20 years my senior,

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
and is said to be skilled
in both art and song.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
Oh! Why must she play
with my heart so?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
It's too much for me!

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
[grunts] It is a lot.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
Please, don't feign
your empathy, Biwa.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI] I seriously
doubt you've ever been

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
madly in love like I am.
Besides, you dress like a boy.

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
I what?

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.279 position:50% align:center
It is quite strange.
And everyone's noticed.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
In fact, when you first
arrived to our home,

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
I thought that you were a boy.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see now. Yes, of course.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
Mmm-hmm, that's what
I should do.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:36.628 position:50% align:center
I simply need to find
someone else, too.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
Her heart will be
broken into pieces,

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
the same as mine,
and she'll cry out.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
"Lord Sukemori is the one
I love after all!"

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
Then she'll be mine!

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
How about it, Biwa?

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
Give me your company
tonight, and help me--

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
[slap]

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.395 position:50% align:center
[SUKEMORI]
Ow!

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI] You truly believe
that Tokuko's troubles

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
are the result of those punished

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
for the Shishigatani
plot on my life?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50% align:center
Yes. I suggest holding
a service for the dead,

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
as well as granting
amnesty to the men

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
who've been exiled
to Kikaigashima.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
[KIYOMORI grunts]

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
It's for Tokuko and
the birth of her child!

As part of the prayers

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
for Tokuko's safe childbirth,
pardons have been granted.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
Does that mean we get to
return to the capital?

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
Lord Shunkan, your name is not
included on this document.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
Oh, no...

[SHUNKAN gasping]

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
Please don't leave me
here--take me with you!

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
Father steadfastly refused
to forgive Lord Shunkan.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.278 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI]
Do you know why?

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.656 position:50% align:center
I would assume it's because the
plan was hatched at his estate.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
That's likely the root of
Father's deep resentment.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
And what's more...

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI] Apparently, the
other two men expressed

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
their remorse by sending a
thousand sotoba into the sea.

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
Lord Shunkan did not.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.839 position:50% align:center
This would not endear
Father to his plight.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
However, I'm told Lady Tokuko's
condition has greatly improved!

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
Biwa, let's go visit and
congratulate her properly!

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center

[TAKAKIYO laughs]

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
Father, spin it again!
Spin it again!

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you should
give it a try?

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKIYO] Oh, yes!
Father! Mother, watch this!

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
Koremori, you're a father.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
Nothing like that
childish Sukemori.

[KOREMORI'S WIFE]
Be patient.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
The woman he loves is beautiful,

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
as well as a rather
masterful poet.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
I imagine she has many
suitors to choose from.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
Sukemori is likely upset,
but undaunted.

By the way, Biwa.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
I would appreciate it if you
would play a bit for my wife.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it will
bring her comfort.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
Yes. Father intervened
with grandfather,

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
and thus Lord Narichika,
was ultimately spared

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
a death sentence for the plot.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50% align:center
Though he was exiled to Bizen,

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
where he perished from
lack of proper sustenance.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
Once Lady Tokuko gives birth,

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
Grandfather's influence
will undoubtedly grow.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center

will come of that.

Poor Moriko.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50% align:center
She was only 24 years old.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
Married off at nine
and made a widow

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
only two short years later.

of Taira no Kiyomori's
