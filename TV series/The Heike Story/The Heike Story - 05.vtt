yet another child
with Lady Shokuko.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it has me
feeling rather down.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
I thought you didn't
even want to marry him.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
Not at first. But something
in me changed.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
One time, some of the
servants used fallen leaves

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
of his beloved maple trees as
kindling to warm their sake.

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
Everyone was aghast.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.366 position:50% align:center
[TAKAKURA] Warming sake with
fallen leaves in the forest.

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
What a beautiful thing.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO] That was his honest
response, no rebuke or anger.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
His kindness is endearing.
But still.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
Emperor Takakura does not
find comfort in my company

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
and prefers to his spend
time with other women.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
Not with a daughter
of Kiyomori of the Heike.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
Although they had
different mothers,

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
Prince Mochihito was
his older brother.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
My father, with full
support of the Heike,

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
attacked and murdered him.

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
[BIWA]
That's terrible.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
[TOKUKO]
I choose to forgive them all.

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
Emperor Takakura,
Go-Shirakawa, even Father.

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
Perhaps that sounds
sanctimonious.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:44.661 position:50% align:center
But someone has
to offer forgiveness,

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center
or we'll only have
hatred and conflict.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
I'd like to believe the world
isn't all pain and suffering.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
So I'll keep choosing to
forgive, no matter what.

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
I'll forgive.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:07.600 position:50% align:center
[BIWA] Pa? I want to know.
Did you forgive?

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
[BIWA gasps]
Shigemori, did you forgive?

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
[SHIGEMORI]
Did you forgive, Biwa?

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
[BIWA gasping]

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
[KOREMORI gasps, panting]

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
