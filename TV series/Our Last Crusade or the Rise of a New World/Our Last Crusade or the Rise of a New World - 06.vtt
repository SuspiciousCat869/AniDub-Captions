WEBVTT

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:13.472
[ALICE sighs]

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.280
[RIN]
Is something wrong?

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:31.615
[ALICE]
What do you mean?

00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:34.785
I wasn't thinking about Iska,
that's preposterous.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.161
Iska?

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.496
[ALICE]
Uh... Wait.

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.790
Honestly, whatever you're
thinking is wrong.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.793
My mind was just wandering!
About the plight ahead.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.296
I understand.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.924
If this swordsman is
plaguing your thoughts,

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.926
then you have the right idea.

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:54.471
Arranging a private battle
would be for the best.

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:55.639
Really?

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.975
Yes. We've met him three times.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.310
And always in
the neutral city of Ein.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.145
If we wish to make
further contact,

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.147
we should keep visiting.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.983
Thanks so much, Rin!

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.693
Ooh, this is perfect!

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.445
He has no idea what's coming!

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:11.863
Yes.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.282
I must agree, ma'am.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.211
For shame. Minus 200 points.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.088
[MISMIS]
I'm so sorry!

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.048
Captain, please stop this.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.134
There's no reason
to beat yourself up.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.636
[MISMIS]
That's not true.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:00.430
In fact, I don't know if I can
ever apologize enough.

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:02.474
Now that I agree with.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.393
Being captured and
kidnapped by the spy

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.520
Shanorotte was unforgiveable.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.481
But falling into the vortex
and passing out?

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.066
Forcing Iska to save you?

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:12.234
A fatal error.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:20.575
Forgive me for causing
you so much trouble.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.993
It was all my fault.

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.331
You good?
You seem okay.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.166
We made it out just fine.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.877
So please stop
worrying, Captain.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.297
I'm just glad that
you're safe now.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.133
Aw. Thanks, Iska.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.096
Something wrong?

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.097
Your arm?

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.474
If it hurts, I have a cold pack.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.892
[MISMIS]
Oh, no.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.145
I'm not in pain, exactly.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.105
My shoulder just
feels kind of weird.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.983
Hi!

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:55.110
I came to visit
my favorite unit!

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:58.029
Everyone ready for new orders?

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.490
We're infiltrating
the Sovereignty?

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:01.491
Yes!

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.952
That's the secret mission
I mentioned the other day.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:06.830
Under my command, you'll
breach the enemy's border.

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:07.789
Best part?

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.417
Your job's to capture
Queen Nebulis.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.210
Uh...

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.213
I'm afraid your exaggerated
joke isn't landing.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.007
It's just too outrageous.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.675
I agree with him.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.093
What's with that face?

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.263
You never give me
disapproving looks, Issy.

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.223
[ISKA] I'm used to
unreasonable demands,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.893
but what you're asking
for can't be done.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.020
I trust you'll
complete the mission.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.814
All of you are such
talented soldiers!

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.734
In that case, I assume
you must have a plan.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.736
It would have to be genius.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.238
How would we even get
into the Sovereignty?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.407
Right, they screen
for astral power.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.409
You bring up an excellent point.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.536
In the Empire,
having an astral crest

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.705
on one's body was seen
as damning evidence

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.415
during witch trials.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.958
The Sovereignty,
on the other hand,

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.336
used astral crests
as a sort of passport

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.172
to allow passage
to their new nation.

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.341
People without a witch's
mark who try to enter

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.968
are suspected of being
spies from the Empire,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.470
so they rarely get through.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:06.515
But fear not.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.767
There is a way for
people from the Empire

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.685
to infiltrate the Sovereignty.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:11.645
Which is?

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.355
[RISYA]
You'll find out in three days.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.190
After we've finished
prep work for the op!

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.499
Lady Alice.

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:34.793
Would you please
take the parasol?

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.294
You'll get too much sun.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.004
It's bad for your skin.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.382
We've been waiting in this
square for three days.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.133
I must insist.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.177
Yes. Three days.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.137
And yet we've seen
no sign of him.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.556
It's ridiculous.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.432
Why hasn't he shown himself?

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.435
We always ran into each
other here in the past.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.063
Until this point,
it was special.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.399
Are you saying that
fact has changed?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.609
No. Forgive me, ma'am.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.529
Though, if the swordsman
was unable to escape

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:06.074
the vortex's eruption,
then it's possible

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.200
he didn't survive‐‐

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:09.119
[ALICE]
He's alive!

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.162
Iska's not dead.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.915
And we're going to get
to fight one‐on‐one.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.629
Yes, of course.
It is as you say.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.132
We'll cover more
ground if we split up.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.050
I'll take the main thoroughfare.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.344
Contact me immediately
if you find him!

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:37.522
[RIN] Lady Alice, you are in
line to be our next queen.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:41.067
But there is conflict within
the Nebulis Sovereignty.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.695
Allied factions
circle like hawks,

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.990
watching for an opportunity
to take the throne.

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:50.493
Your sisters are also appearing
in public more often.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:54.122
Vying for attention.
Seeking to secure power.

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:56.249
Now is the time to be
gaining more supporters

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.835
and preparing for the future.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:02.839
You should not be so fixated
on an Imperial soldier.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:06.051
But I will take care of you,
as I always do.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.511
And sever your ties
with this swordsman.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.015
[NENE]
I wonder what Risya has in mind.

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.893
I can't even begin to imagine
how we might sneak in.

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:16.895
You're right, it's pretty
difficult for even

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.940
Neutral citizens to be
approved for entry.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.359
It should be downright
impossible for Imperial soldiers

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.526
to get close.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.823
Captain. How's your arm?

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.076
A bed sore?

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.744
From sleeping way too much?

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.537
Don't be ridiculous, Jhin!

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.415
Girls don't get disgusting
things like that.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.626
It's probably just a bug bite!

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:42.212
[JHIN] Again, you're too
old to be called a "girl."

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:45.048
[MISMIS] Why do you always
insist on being so mean to me?

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.800
Maybe first aid?

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.594
You're right. Captain,
take off your jacket.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.434
[MISMIS]
How embarrassing.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.186
I wonder what bit me.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.105
[NENE]
Where'd I put‐‐

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.439
Ah, here we go!

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.130
Oh. That's weird.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.925
Funny, right?

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:32.012
I've never seen a bug bite that
looks like this one before.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.478
Please.
Don't look at me like that.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.688
Okay?

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.648
This isn't what you guys think.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.361
Captain, you're fine.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.071
First, you need
to take a breath.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.825
I'm going to ask you a question.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.744
Do you know how you got this?

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.662
[MISMIS]
I'm sorry, I don't.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:00.081
Then it must have
come from the vortex.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.708
Based on what
you described to us

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.418
from your time
trapped inside it,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.920
you met an astral spirit.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.424
Then, it must have possessed
our captain's body.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.093
[JHIN] This doesn't happen
to 99% of people,

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.971
no matter how strong
the astral spirit may be.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:17.182
You just happened to be
a suitable host for it, Boss.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:27.108
So... I've become... a witch?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.569
The enemy?

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.572
It's the only thing that
astral crest could mean.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.532
You could get confirmation.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.452
Maybe the research
institute can investigate.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:38.912
[NENE]
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.747
That's the last thing
she should do.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.999
If they find out she's
been turned into a witch,

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.417
she'll be executed!

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.504
[JHIN] If she turns herself in,
they may just imprison her.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.922
[NENE]
Like that's much better.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.799
And what would
we do without her?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.471
[ISKA]
Captain.

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:02.060
We still follow your orders.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.895
The choice is yours.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.356
[MISMIS]
What choice is there?

00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:07.398
Listen.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.693
If you turn yourself in,
you'll be jailed,

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.113
and we'll try to get your
sentence reduced.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.906
You'll always be under watch,

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.407
but they might allow you
to live somewhat freely

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.284
outside the capital.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:19.536
That's one option.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:26.668
Or, we can keep this crest
hidden and you remain

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.420
as our captain, as always.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.297
In that sense,
things won't change much.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.722
Hold on.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.267
If we're caught,
you'll all be in trouble!

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.435
Don't give a second
thought to that.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.479
We're your unit, Boss.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.398
Give us your orders.

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.316
We'll make sure
they're carried out.

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.068
I'm for sure on board!

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.324
[MISMIS]
Really?

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.412
I can't lose you guys.

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:03.872
Not now.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.832
I need my team.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:09.085
And we just got back together.

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.670
Is that wrong of me?

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:13.548
[ISKA]
No.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.303
It isn't wrong.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:20.388
If that's what you've decided,

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.640
you can count on us
to have your back.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:30.899
Thank you all.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.744
[ALICE groans]
A third day down with no luck.

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.538
[RIN] Perhaps it's time
for us to change tactics.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.208
We could give up on Ein
and try someplace else.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.876
What are you saying, Rin?

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.586
I refuse to give up already!

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:56.424
Where could he be
loitering in the city?

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.843
Ah! Maybe in this district.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.137
Oh! We should canvass
this area, too!

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.607
Knock knock.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:17.237
How is she?

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.114
[NENE] Well, I think she's
calmed down a bit.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:23.368
I'll spend the night with her
just in case she freaks out.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.994
Smart move.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.955
So, then. What do we do now?

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.415
We need a way to hide her crest.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.627
A Saint Disciple would be
able to spot it instantly.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.462
What if Risya finds out?

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.005
[JHIN]
You know the answer.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.549
Most astral mages who're
found in Empire territory

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.343
are executed on the spot.

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.428
But the captain
is a different case!

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.764
The optics are awful.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:48.476
She's been seen in Shanorotte's
good graces recently.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.353
They'll treat her as
a spy once they find out

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.230
the two of them are friendly

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.399
whether we conceal
the crest or not.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.234
If we have to hide that,

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.444
and the fact that
she has a mark,

00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.696
it will never work.

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.046
[KIDS laughing]

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.256
[BOY A]
Let's go!

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.133
[BOY B]
Hold on, wait for me!

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:22.135
[ISKA]
I'm sorry.

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.803
This must look bad.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.014
Like we're trying to hide you.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.640
Mm‐mm.

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:31.561
Ein's the safest place for me.
You were smart to bring me here.

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:34.689
Besides. I feel less
stressed now.

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:36.274
We're in a neutral city.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.567
I'll be fine.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.452
[ISKA] I wonder if this is
what the Empire was like

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.703
100 years ago.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.204
What do you mean?

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.791
We practically dominated
the world in those days.

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.002
Something like 60%
of the world's nations

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.463
were tributary states.

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.215
Were all of them this peaceful?

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.967
Before things changed.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:06.846
When we discovered the Secret
of the Celestial Body.

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:09.432
An energy of astral spirits.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.892
Pure power.

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:13.603
It turned ordinary
people into witches.

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:16.898
Something the Empire
chose to be afraid of.

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:21.027
That fear killed free citizens
and drove countless others out.

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.073
But... things can change.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:28.659
We can still end
this senseless war.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.204
A day will come when you won't
have to hide that crest.

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:32.789
I promise.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.499
You think so?

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.042
Nene, Jhin, and me?

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.877
We're all in this with you.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.170
You'll see.

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:41.422
Come on.

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.549
You're gonna make me cry again.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.010
You know I'm a softie for
speeches like that.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.015
Happy thoughts:

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.310
We're here, so we might
as well enjoy the city!

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.854
I think now's a good time
to get some drinks.

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.032
[ALICE]
It's so tranquil here.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:12.203
There are no weapons firing, no
scent of gunpowder in the air.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.038
I wonder if peace like
this will ever come

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.165
for the Nebulis Sovereignty.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.292
An era when none in
this world are called witches

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.335
or demons.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.713
A day when this war will end.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.055
[ISKA] Now Captain Mismis
is also a victim

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.849
of the Empire's fears.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.811
Somehow we have to put
a stop to this conflict.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:37.895
And yet...

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.190
Your job's to capture
Queen Nebulis.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.984
[ISKA] If we succeed in
abducting the queen,

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.735
we take another step back.

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.405
The Eight Great Apostles will
never set her free.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.282
It'll only fuel the war.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.702
[ISKA]
What do I do?

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.170
[ALICE sighs]

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:08.551
[ALICE]
Excuse me.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.682
Would you mind?
I would love to rest my feet.

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:17.727
Wait, Alice?

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.400
[ALICE]
Iska?!

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.236
I found you!

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:30.031
What? It's not like
I was hiding from you.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.116
I'm just sitting here
out in the open.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.869
[ALICE]
Fool! You have no idea, do you?

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.746
I've spent days
walking these streets

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.581
trying to track you down!

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:39.999
You've been looking for me?

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.754
Forget I said that.

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.756
Now back to the matter at hand!

00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:47.924
Which is...

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.008
Oh, that's just great.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.927
I had an entire diatribe
in my head for when

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.429
we met again. and now
I'm drawing a blank!

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.473
Um... Well, then.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.488
You... could sit?

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.365
[ALICE]
No, of course I can't.

00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:14.659
You and I remain enemies.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.494
Besides, Rin is nearby.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.163
I'd never hear the end
of it if she saw that.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.790
[ISKA]
Okay. Then I'll get up.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.419
Don't.

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:27.171
Stay in your seat.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:30.466
We'll share the bench so that
we're on equal ground.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:32.260
It's the only option.

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.182
Sit.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.392
All right. Sure.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.156
I'm glad you're alive.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.827
I haven't seen you
since the vortex.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.620
Ahem.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:02.915
Why are you in
Ein today, anyway?

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:05.960
I dunno.
Trying to clear my head.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.878
Recently a strange
problem has come up

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.089
and it's got me kinda stumped.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:14.093
[ALICE]
Ooh! Go on! What is it?

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:15.720
No way can I tell you.

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:19.223
[ALICE] Don't worry. I'm
wonderful at keeping secrets.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.642
Rin is the only person
I tell them to.

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.978
Yeah, that's not reassuring.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.272
Come now, we know each other.

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.982
Because we're enemies.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.692
Yes, I know.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.944
But this is the Neutral city.

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.446
"A temporary truce."

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.326
Please?

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:43.581
Lady Alice.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:44.957
[ALICE gasps]

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:47.376
Rin! Uh...

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:50.713
Whatever you're thinking,
it's wrong, this is nothing.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.590
[RIN] The two of you
certainly seem close

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:55.092
for it to be considered
"nothing."

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.553
He's the one you should blame.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:58.929
How is that?

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.057
I see you survived the vortex.

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:02.183
I'm delighted.

00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:06.187
No matter.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:08.606
I was looking for you, ma'am.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.983
I thought you might be
in need of a break.

00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:12.943
Here, this is for you.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.070
[ALICE]
Thank you.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.407
Refreshment.

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:21.619
Think of it as a generous
offering from My Lady.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.412
Thank you?

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:25.956
My, my, Rin.
How thoughtful.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.375
Neutral city, and all.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.220
Apple, huh? That's interesting.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:42.973
It's lemon apple.
What, not a fan?

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.101
[ISKA]
I've never heard of it.

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:48.479
Speaking of drinks, the
captain's been gone for a while.

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:49.689
I hope she's okay.

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:56.612
Go on.
Tell me about your big problem.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:57.738
It's a se‐‐

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:02.952
Iska?

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.580
[ALICE]
Are you feeling okay?

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.006
Iska?

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:18.467
My Lady. I am sorry.

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:22.138
I laced the swordsman's drink
with a sleep‐inducing agent.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:23.472
You did what?!

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:25.891
Rin! Don't you know
where we are?

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:28.018
It's not as it seems, I swear.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.187
I never thought he'd
actually accept it.

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.523
Much less take a drink.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.442
But why, then?

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:36.569
Simply for appearances.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.196
If he thought you were
trying to drug him,

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.574
then he'd view you as a threat

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:44.034
and stop speaking to you
in such a friendly manner.

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.498
A wasted chance.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.418
I should've spiked it with
a deadly poison instead.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.461
Rin!

00:20:58.382 --> 00:20:59.925
What a mess. Ugh.

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.552
How could you do this?

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:04.597
This wasn't at all how today
was supposed to go!

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:07.224
[RIN] There is only
one thing to do now.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:10.227
Take him into custody.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.687
[ALICE]
Hold on just a moment.

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:13.230
You can't be serious!

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.356
[clattering]

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.653
What are you...?

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.995
‐‐[MISMIS] Iska‐‐
‐‐[ALICE] Don't move.

00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:30.164
This swordsman is
my sworn enemy.

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:31.707
We're taking him in.

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.959
What'd you do to him?

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.836
How dare you abduct him in Ein!

00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:38.756
Do your people have
no respect for the laws?

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.591
I don't have to
explain anything to you.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.181
Give back Iska!

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.061
Freeze!

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.111
Rin. We're leaving.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.081
[RISYA] It appears that Iska,
the Successor of the

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:14.458
Black Steel,
has been kidnapped

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.126
by the Ice Calamity Witch.

00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:20.840
What would you have
us do, My Emperor?
