WEBVTT

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.975
[ALICE]
Surely you jest.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.102
We can't hand him over
to the Sovereignty!

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.271
He's an ex‐Saint Disciple.

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:22.356
Imagine.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.149
They'd lock him up for life.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.360
No. Torture him for intel.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.820
Then end up putting
him to death!

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.323
Rin. This is a direct order.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:32.491
Stop this.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.369
He mustn't be taken
to the Central Province!

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.120
If for no other reason
than to keep him

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.497
from the palace.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.041
Imagine the devastation
if he broke free.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:45.712
[RIN]
I understand.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.881
We'll head to the Nebulis
territory we're closest to

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.800
at this time.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.302
[ALICE]
Okay, which would be...

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:53.470
You're kidding.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:29.358
[RISYA] Iska, Successor
of the Black Steel,

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.235
has been kidnapped
by the Ice Calamity Witch.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.237
In the neutral city
of Ein, no less.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.324
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
An unfortunate turn.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:39.493
But it does not
change our plans.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:42.120
Continue to focus on
the secret operation.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.538
Well, sir.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.415
That was my intention.

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:46.541
But no.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.628
His Excellency has insisted
I hold off for now.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.921
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
What?!

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.839
[F GREAT APOSTLE]
The Emperor is quite fickle.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.842
[GREAT APOSTLE B]
Then what would you do, Risya?

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.303
We have witnesses who saw
Iska being transported

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.138
in a vehicle.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.848
Based on the route,
we're fairly certain

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.725
where they're taking him.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:08.105
To Province 13,
also known as "Alcatroz."

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.856
It's the Prison Sector.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.984
Where Salinger the Heretical
Demon is being held.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.945
You'll recall that he rose
up against the former

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.197
Queen Nebulis.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.074
If we can free him,
he could end up being

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:21.451
a useful asset for the Empire.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.038
[GREAT APOSTLE B] It will be no
easy feat to woo Salinger

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.749
the Transcendent to our side.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.793
[F GREAT APOSTLE]
But it's worth trying.

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.713
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
Risya, act as you will.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.589
[RISYA]
I plan on doing just that.

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.437
Sorry, guys, thanks for waiting!

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.360
What a tough break, am I right?

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.404
That's putting it mildly, ma'am.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.156
Of course, it's horrible.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.198
What now?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.325
We can go rescue Iska, can't we?

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.744
You may.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.912
But it will be a tough mission.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.039
You must pass the power trial.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.543
Otherwise, you stand no
chance of crossing the border.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:12.961
That's where these come in.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.966
I told you I had a trick up my
sleeve to get you inside.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.804
[JHIN]
Is that astral energy?

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.181
[NENE]
I don't get it.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.557
Fear not. Just watch.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.641
Your hand, please.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.227
There.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.437
What're you doing?

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.946
Hold on. Am I a witch now?

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.823
On a surface level.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.034
The mark fades in a week.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.828
The crest emits
concentrated astral energy.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.747
It should be sufficient
to gain you access

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.415
to the Sovereignty.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.293
It's disturbing, but it's smart.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:56.296
Our top‐secret researchers
have outdone themselves.

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.507
[NENE] So we're going
undercover as astral mages

00:04:58.548 --> 00:04:59.966
to get across the border.

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:00.884
I get it.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:02.719
‐‐[RISYA] Mm‐hmm.
‐‐[JHIN] A wise plan

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.264
[JHIN] Boss, give me
your left shoulder.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.307
What?

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:23.949
[JHIN]
This should be suitable.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.741
Don't you agree?

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:25.700
[RISYA]
Oh, wow.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.619
Looks pretty believable to me.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.329
It's just like the real deal.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.039
[MISMIS chuckles]
Please.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.500
Don't be ridiculous, Risya.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.589
[NENE]
Jhin, where do you want yours?

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:40.757
[JHIN]
My ankle.

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.429
[RISYA] After you cross the
Nebulis Sovereignty's border,

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.889
you'll head for Alcatroz.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:51.476
Stay covert and figure out
where Iska is being held.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.853
And once we've found him?

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.940
Wreak havoc.

00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:58.191
While you're doing that,

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.402
other undercover agents
I'm coordinating with

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.529
will create similar diversions.

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.823
We'll take advantage of the
confusion and send units

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.867
to infiltrate the palace.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.660
So then you're not
abandoning the plan

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.537
to capture Queen Nebulis?

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.830
[RISYA]
I'm counting on you!

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.465
[RIN] Lady Alice,
we've arrived in Alcatroz.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.050
Head to our lodging.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.135
At once.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:30.348
[ALICE] So. What am I
supposed to do with you?

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.773
I wonder how long you'll be out.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.323
My. You're more
muscular than you look.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.365
Poke.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.203
My skin is softer than yours.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.543
That's one win for me, at least.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.888
It's disconcerting.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.349
You're my enemy.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.934
But you make me forget that.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.228
[RIN screams]

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:19.898
[ALICE]
What just happened?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.483
[RIN]
A cat darted out.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.152
I apologize, ma'am.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.445
Be careful.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.077
No! Oops. Sorry.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.245
[RIN]
Lady Alice?

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.456
I'm perfectly fine, Rin.

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.249
You just keep your
eyes on the road!

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.213
[ALICE]
You're awake?

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.091
Where am I?

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.175
What's going on?

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.177
You assured me that
he would be unconscious

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.388
until at least tomorrow morning.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.515
[RIN]
He should still be out!

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.226
His tolerance must be far
higher than I expected.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.650
Oh. Looks like
you've remembered.

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:06.528
We have taken you
into our custody.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:07.612
Also...

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.155
Don't be mad at me
because you're the one

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.408
who sipped from
the spiked drink.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.618
Really? Alice?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.787
[ALICE]
What's wrong?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.707
I'm disappointed in you.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.875
To think that a princess
would resort to using

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.252
such a dirty trick.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.422
That's not true!
I had no idea what was going on!

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.174
Blame her!
She did this of her own accord.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.718
Yes, but, Lady Alice!

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.637
This was not the outcome
I had in mind.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.389
It's your fault,
Imperial swordsman!

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.349
How dare you be
fooled so easily?

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:38.727
[ISKA] Are you seriously blaming
the guy who got poisoned?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.696
[INSPECTOR] You're free
to enter. Move along.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.204
That's one obstacle we're past.

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.123
[INSPECTOR]
Next. Show your crest.

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.087
Sorry for the wait, Jhin!

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.883
How'd you get through so fast?

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.343
You girls are slow, that's all.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:16.473
Now, then. Let's move.
Be on your guard.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:17.891
Right.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.852
We're coming. Stay safe, Iska!

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:29.069
[RISYA] As expected,
you did an excellent job.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.571
That went off without a hitch.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:32.655
But soon...

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.699
I'm afraid you'll
be on your own.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.035
I have other matters
to attend to.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.457
[RIN]
Lady Alice. We've arrived.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.756
Take heed, prisoner.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.300
You're now inside
the Sovereignty.

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.552
You have no allies here.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:58.056
It would be smart
to follow our demands.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.266
Remember your place.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:01.684
Now, follow me.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.359
Whoa...

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.534
This is a prison?

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:23.248
[ALICE sighs]

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.749
I'm so tired.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.793
I have never been in
such a tense car ride

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.753
in my life.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.380
[RIN]
Worry not, my lady.

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.006
I assumed we would
need a holding cell

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.467
for the prisoner,
so I reserved another room

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.803
for the detainee.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.929
Did you?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.515
No doubt you chose
the smallest room.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.059
I don't want any rumors
spreading that a princess

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.103
treated her prisoner poorly.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.940
But please think.
He's a dangerous enemy!

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:52.402
We must keep him locked
up and far away from you.

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:53.820
[ALICE]
He has no weapons.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:55.655
Even without a sword,

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.574
he'll try to attack you
when your guard is down

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.242
or while you're sleeping.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.494
Trust me, all men are animals!

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:03.121
[ALICE, ISKA]
What does that mean?

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:08.543
As you wish.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.587
I'll keep watch over
the prisoner in here

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.213
and ensure he's no trouble.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.632
You can take the presidential
suite next door.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.634
That sounds much better.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.969
Thank you.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.139
You take good care of him.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.515
[RIN]
Of course, my lady.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.946
[phone beeping]

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.533
Hi, everyone!

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.869
I'm thrilled to see
everyone made it.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.287
[MISMIS]
Risya!

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.497
[RISYA] How's your
first visit to Alcatroz?

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.666
The stories I heard are true.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.461
This whole province
is covered in prisons.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:52.629
[RISYA]
Very much so.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.881
You see, convicts from
all over the world

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:58.343
are transferred to
Province 13 for safekeeping.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.928
The witches here
in the Sovereignty

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.804
are well compensated
for playing warden

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.849
to violent criminals from
all across the nation.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:07.060
[JHIN]
The prisoners are astral mages?

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:08.561
Most all of them.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.730
And some of them
are rather infamous.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.148
Like the Transce‐‐

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.316
Oh, oops.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.275
[JHIN]
Hm?

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:15.276
[RISYA]
Never mind.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.736
Jhin‐Jhin, take your next left.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.198
Then keep going straight.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.950
Wait. Does that mean...

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.576
...you can actually see us?

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.870
[RISYA] Ah!
Nothing gets past you, Nens!

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:36.631
Hi!

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.468
I don't understand‐‐
why are you here?

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.637
[RISYA] How could I possibly
let my precious Mismis

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.765
go on this mission without me?

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:49.686
So. Now that you're caught up,
we should begin. Yes?

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.062
[NENE]
What do we do?

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.982
[RISYA] We're headed to
where Issy's being held.

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.775
At Ollelugan Tower.

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:56.818
It's a prison!

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.285
The last time you and I were
alone was in the forest.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.412
What's your point?

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:10.498
[RIN] This is the hotel
favored by Nebulis royals.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.375
Alice would keep you
here until we decide

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.751
what to do with you.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.672
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.799
And why not?

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.344
It's far too risky.
You are a threat.

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:27.098
But Lady Alice seems to
continually disregard this fact.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.182
Pity.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:38.985
What are you doing?

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.903
This is what happened.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.947
You lunged for the
knife on the table,

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.742
and before I could react,
you attacked me.

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:48.036
My injuries will
prove that's true.

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.912
Hold up, you're framing me?

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:53.207
I had no choice but
to act in self‐defense.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:56.461
An Imperial soldier cannot
be simply monitored.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:59.547
He must be imprisoned
or put to death.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:00.631
[ISKA]
Don't do this.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.468
Iska of the Empire.
It's over for you.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.136
[ISKA]
Are you serious?

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.472
There is no other way, you dog!

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.058
You're the greatest obstacle
standing between Lady Alice

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.809
and her goals!

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.937
Think about it another way.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.147
With your death,

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.358
your dream for peace
will come true as well.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.068
You are a sacrifice!

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.737
Sorry, but I plan to live
to see that future!

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.244
Maybe we'll have a nice cold
tomato pasta for dinner.

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.627
No, that won't do.

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:41.047
Rin would not be pleased if
she made the connection.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:44.092
Now that Iska's my prisoner,
I have to be careful.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:46.260
I can't treat him too nicely.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.013
Hey, Rin?

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.681
I was going to
order some dinner‐‐

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:53.226
[ISKA grunting]

00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:57.855
Impressive that you stopped
my attack despite

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.816
being handcuffed.

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:02.026
You won't kill me that easily.

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.653
Oh? Alice!

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.988
I doubt your master is pleased
about what she's seeing

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.240
right now.

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.117
Ha! Don't be an idiot!

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:12.203
I won't fall for what's
obviously a desperate ruse.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:15.540
If Lady Alice is here, why
hasn't she stopped me?

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.875
[ALICE] Feel free to ask
me that directly, Rin.

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:20.878
Mind if I join?

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.172
It would appear you're
having a good time.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.969
Oh, hi... My Lady.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:42.108
It's heavily guarded,
even for a prison.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.527
We wouldn't have gotten in
without Miss Saint Disciple's

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:45.778
help.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.739
I agree. But then she ran off.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:49.949
Poor Iska.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:53.119
Are we sure this is where he is?

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.913
Saint Disciples are
the Emperor's guards.

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.499
It's rare that they
leave the capital city.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:03.963
If Risya joined the mission,
he must be here. Though...

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.966
I suppose it's possible
she has a different agenda,

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.801
something we don't know about.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.475
[RIN] Lady Alice.
Everything is in order.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:20.480
I must say this plan
gives me pause.

00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:23.608
You're the one who can't
be trusted to watch Iska.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.318
You are dismissed.

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:27.945
Right.
Please be careful, My Lady.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.118
From now on,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.121
I will be acting as
your personal warden.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.790
You should feel honored.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:40.917
[ISKA]
One question.

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.126
Go on.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.170
We're going to stay
chained like this?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.463
[ALICE]
Naturally.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:48.257
Rin said you cannot be trusted
with handcuffs alone.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.803
Why the groan?

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.388
It's just...

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.974
I have some basic
practical concerns.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.059
Save your breath.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.186
You can't talk your
way out of this one.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.772
Plus, Rin has the keys, so...

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.273
How do we use the bathroom?

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.194
Huh?

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.363
Or bathe, or sleep at night?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.916
This is bad!

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.543
You're bringing that up now?

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:26.671
Wait, was this your
diabolical plan all along?

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.839
I never pegged
you for a pervert!

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.050
[ISKA] You didn't think
this through, did you?

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:32.176
Well, I...

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.264
You all right?

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.266
[ALICE]
I realized when you mentioned‐‐

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:42.812
that I haven't "gone" since
this whole ordeal started.

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:43.896
[ISKA]
You mean to the bath‐‐

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.982
You're just making it worse!

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:48.901
Rin. Bring the keys!
It's an emergency.

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.321
You sent her away, remember?

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.744
[ALICE]
Rin?

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:16.053
[RIN] Don't even think of doing
anything lecherous.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.888
Take one step
toward the bathroom,

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.224
and you'll be in the ground
before you know it.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.977
[ISKA] Why do you keep
thinking I'm that guy?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.438
Look, now that we're alone...

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:27.523
Tell me what you have planned.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.567
[RIN]
Mine is a simple desire.

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.902
To see you locked away.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.404
Blame yourself.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:37.700
You could have joined us,
but you chose the Empire.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:41.203
Because of that fact,
I do not trust you.

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:44.498
However, Lady Alice
will decide your fate.

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:46.792
[ALICE]
Ah...

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:49.795
I feel so refreshed after
such a long day.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.089
Rin, did you lay
out fresh clothes?

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.470
[ALICE screams]

00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:00.097
Stop! Don't look!
Avert your eyes! Please!

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.974
I forgot you were
in here with us!

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:05.978
[ISKA]
Your crest.

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.194
[ALICE]
Iska...

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.781
What do you think
when you see this?

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:21.869
That it's the sign of a demon,
an unknown disease,

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.580
a mark that denotes
me as a monster.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.999
I know that's what
the Empire thinks.

00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:29.210
Lady Alice!

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:31.545
[ALICE]
Don't misunderstand me.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.714
I don't care what Imperials say.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:36.175
I don't care if you
think it's a curse.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:39.095
I am proud of my astral crest.

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:42.390
But... For some reason...

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:44.684
I want to hear your thoughts.

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:45.976
How do you view my mark?

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.734
There's this captain
in the Empire

00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:56.320
who recently became a "witch."

00:19:56.362 --> 00:20:00.533
That person is still a
valued soldier in our ranks.

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:03.953
I don't care if she has
an astral crest now.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.246
I still respect her.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.750
Are these marks the
reason why this conflict

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:11.961
has continued for
a hundred years?

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:15.214
Could something so
simple drive a war?

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.340
[ISKA]
No.

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.759
Fears and prejudices divide us.

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.512
I'm from the Empire and
you're from the Sovereignty.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.682
We're products of our nations.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.184
The astral crests
have nothing to do with it.

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.898
[ALICE]
I see.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.819
So, you're saying you
don't care about my mark?

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.404
You know that I don't.

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:42.241
Then, what do you think of me?

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.285
Huh? What am I?

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:47.121
A fierce rival.

00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:56.088
[RIN]
Insolent fool!

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.800
How dare you, a lowly soldier,
consider her as a rival!

00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:02.052
‐‐[ALICE] It's fine.
‐‐[RIN] The boy is a worm.

00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:09.143
I feel like a weight has been
lifted from my chest.

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.519
Thank you.

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.730
That's the answer I hoped for.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:15.232
You don't treat me
like I'm special.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.486
That's bold,
but how it should be.

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:22.406
Alice.

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.950
I have something else
I want to say.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:26.285
[ALICE]
What is it?

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.745
Just that...

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:30.581
I'd really appreciate it if
you'd put some clothes on.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.249
[ALICE screams]

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.250
How dare you!

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.169
I can't believe you
were ogling me!

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.213
You're the one who
was standing there naked.

00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.423
[ALICE] Because I got
lost in my thoughts.

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:40.758
This isn't fair.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.886
If we're equals,
show your naked body, too!

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.346
Take off your clothes!

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.181
[ISKA]
That makes absolutely no sense!

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:49.558
[RIN] Lady Alice,
have you lost your mind?

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.310
[ALICE]
Don't you run away from me!

00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:10.788
[MAN] You may introduce
yourself, Saint Disciple.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.123
I'm Risya of the Empire.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:16.418
I'm afraid I don't
have an appointment...

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.338
...Transcendent Demon, Salinger.
