WEBVTT

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.692
I'll never get to sleep.

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.664
[MISMIS]
Iska, are you feeling okay?

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.416
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.294
But... I have had
trouble sleeping.

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:08.253
You know...

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:11.381
I feel bad I don't always
get to assist you in battle.

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.257
Which means...

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.468
I want to help however
I can otherwise.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.346
Look at that face!

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:18.472
There's no hiding it.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:22.392
I can tell something
is majorly bothering you.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:23.685
Is that true?

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.103
It is!

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.607
So, go ahead and spill
those guts, soldier!

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.233
Our last battle.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.069
It's haunting my thoughts.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.155
Maybe because
it ended in a draw?

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:38.867
Or it could have scarred
you emotionally, right?

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.327
[ISKA]
Like, a trauma?

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.328
Yes.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.538
After going through
an intense battle,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.832
it's possible your psyche
is injured or bogged down

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.834
in subconscious fear.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:50.379
I mean, you fought
the Ice Calamity.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.465
That would have a lasting
effect on anyone.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:54.966
Yeah. 'Bout that...

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.009
[MISMIS]
Yes?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.930
No. It's nothing.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.306
Huh.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.393
I wonder how we can
get you to feel better.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.812
I know what always picks me
up when I'm down.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.897
Barbecue and a good
night's sleep.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.108
Which luckily go hand in hand.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.193
We may be different
in that respect.

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:15.487
Fair enough, but I still
think a change of scenery

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.073
is a good idea.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:19.199
I know!

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:26.331
It's a little messy,
but come in.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.917
[ISKA] Your stuffed animal
collection has exploded.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.878
[MISMIS laughs]
Right? They're so cute.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.048
Yeah. But, um...

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.593
Those... are new. Sorry.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:39.845
I didn't mean to see.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.263
[MISMIS]
No!

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.267
[MISMIS]
Ahem. Right then.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:48.311
You won't get any better
if you're cooped up inside.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.231
What you need is
a little vacation.

00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:52.941
[ISKA]
A ticket to the opera?

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:56.027
It's the "Tragic Love of
Female Knight Beatrix."

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.613
They perform it in
Neutral City every year.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.198
It's one of my favorites.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.910
I've used nine out of ten of
my season tickets already.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.620
This last one is for you!

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.039
Uh... but when would I go?

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.208
Soon, before our next mission.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.085
Like, tomorrow!

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:13.378
Yeah. Great.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.588
Have fun!

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.506
That's an order from
your captain.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.600
[CROSSWEIL]
Keep them safe.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.060
Those swords are the only
hope we have of restoring

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.687
this fractured world.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.485
[NENE]
Look who's awake.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.153
We're almost to Ein.

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:39.780
Already? How?

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.072
You've been out cold.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.326
I've basically been talking
to myself the entire drive.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.452
[ISKA]
Sorry.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:47.788
I was actually dreaming
of my Master.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.873
Or, maybe it was a nightmare.

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:53.043
Jhin and I were going through
some intense training.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.753
[NENE]
That brings back memories.

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:58.131
I thought you hadn't dreamt of
Master Cro in forever, though.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.509
[ISKA] Probably because I
haven't used the astral swords

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.760
in a while.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.518
Goodbye, Beatrix.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.895
My dearest,
I cannot be with you.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:14.898
Yes. Goodbye, Azel.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.026
When we meet again, it will not
be in a church like this,

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.861
but on a battlefield.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.780
[ALICE]
Azel, you fool.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:24.616
How can you do this to
the woman that you love?

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.743
[RIN]
Please keep it down.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.620
Where is your handkerchief?

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.956
[ALICE] I'm afraid it's
already soaking wet.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.666
[RIN]
Contain yourself.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.292
[ISKA] The performance seems
to have devastated the girl

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.460
in front of me.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.046
I can't focus on anything else.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.923
Here, Miss. Please, take mine.

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:41.174
[ALICE]
Oh?

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.884
Why, thank you so much.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:48.431
[AUDIENCE claps]

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:55.438
[ALICE] Um... I apologize,
but I think this is ruined.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.524
Please, allow me
to pay you, sir.

00:05:57.566 --> 00:06:00.151
[ISKA]
Oh, no, it's not a big deal.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.695
It was cheap and I've got‐‐

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.493
Hold on. What're you doing here?

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.245
Did you follow me to this seat?

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:12.956
The Empire's reached a new low.

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:15.292
Fine. I'm ready for round two.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.377
Lady Alice, you mustn't.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.045
We're in a Neutral City.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.799
Conflict between our factions
is strictly prohibited.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.885
I am well aware.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:27.470
If I attacked him now, all the
rest of the Neutral cities

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.598
would doubtlessly
turn against us.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.474
It would be a catastrophe.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.434
That said...

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.311
I can't believe that
you're stalking me.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.771
No wonder I felt so unsettled.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:37.564
Oh?

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:40.233
Is that why you spent the
entire performance weeping?

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.068
[ALICE]
Huh?! What?

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.987
No, my eyes were just sweating.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.615
You'll forget what you
saw today. Got it?

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.741
Lady Alice.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:51.244
Raising your voice will
only draw more attention.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.789
Yes. Right. We should go.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.541
Good day to you, Iska.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.544
Uh, sure. To you, too, I guess.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:02.631
My Lady.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:03.924
[ALICE]
Oh, uh...

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.509
Don't look at me like that.
It was a force of habit!

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.930
[ALICE] I think my heart
stopped when I saw him.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.098
[RIN] You took the words
right out of my mouth.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.516
Though I was more concerned
that you were going

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.560
to start a war.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.646
He'd better not follow us.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:20.440
No. The swordsman
didn't move after we left.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:24.152
We should be far ahead of him
by this point, my lady.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:28.198
I'm still in shock.
The audacity of that swordsman.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.201
[RIN] We should have guessed the
Empire would try something.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.953
Yes, I suppose.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:35.246
Let's forget about this
and find some food.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.166
There's a famous pasta place
right around the corner.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:44.631
[WAITRESS A] I'm sorry, ma'am,
but all our tables are reserved.

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.424
If you don't mind sharing
with someone else,

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.968
I can seat you at
a booked table.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.219
Is that all right?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.303
Yes, that's fine.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:57.602
[WAITRESS A]
Here we are.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.314
Thank you.

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.942
What? No! Are you kidding me?

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.069
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.322
[coughs] My water went
down the wrong pipe.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.907
Try to breathe.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.909
Coward! You'd ambush us?

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.285
[ISKA]
No, you've got it wrong.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.413
[RIN] What else would
you be doing here?

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:19.541
This was just the closest
restaurant to the opera house.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.543
It's got great reviews.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.629
Besides, I had a reservation
booked, you can ask the host.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.967
What do you think? We leave?

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.593
He does have a point.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:33.847
Don't let your guard down, Rin.
He's a fiend.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:37.142
Um... You do realize
I'm still here.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.393
And you're not whispering.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.149
Lady Alice. Is this wise?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.026
This is neutral territory.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.528
But to dine with an
Imperial soldier is...

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.988
If we left at this point,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.823
it would look like we
were frightened and ran.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.324
Yes. It might.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.617
Let's just order.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.121
My apologies.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.331
Oh, no. It's my fault.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.251
So, um... Please. Go ahead.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.754
I will allow you
to look at it first.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.882
I can wait. Don't take all day.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.467
[ISKA]
Here. We'll do this.

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.267
Hey...

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.978
What? Is there some
kind of problem?

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.355
Do you know what you want?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.650
Yes, I do. I think we're ready.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:28.693
[WAITRESS A]
Coming!

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.113
[ALICE, ISKA] Salmon and
zucchini over noodles with

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.198
heavy cream.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.950
I'd like the pasta to be
cooked ben cotta.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.911
I'll have tea after
the meal, please.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:41.081
One sugar cube.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.583
The two of you seem
to be in perfect sync.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.834
You must be quite close.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:45.877
[ALICE, ISKA]
Not at all!

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.008
So, then. You like pasta?

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.093
Me?

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.053
Who else would I be asking?

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.429
Yeah, I do.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.890
It's probably my favorite food.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.601
I love it with a rich sauce
like what we're eating,

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.521
but it's also great with pepper.
Tossed in oil.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:07.023
Oh, yes. You're so right.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.609
A simple but delicious plating.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.027
And when it's hot out,

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:14.197
cold noodles make for
the perfect refreshing dish.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.200
Really?
I'm a big fan of that, too.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:20.453
If I find cherry tomatoes
at the market, I add those!

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:21.663
[ALICE]
Now you're talking!

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.039
Cold pasta and tomatoes?

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.666
That really hits the spot.

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.626
I swear I could eat that
every day in the summer.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.419
Lady Alice.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:32.382
It appears that you
have stopped eating.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:35.343
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.594
Yeah. Me, too.

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.308
Also, pasta should always
be cooked al dente.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.936
You have unrefined palates.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.646
[ISKA, ALICE]
Ben cotta is best for sure!

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.946
[RIN] It might be wise to keep
the day's events to yourself,

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.865
Lady Alice.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.825
Though, normally, I would
report the incident

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.368
to Her Majesty.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.620
There was no fight,
but we still encountered

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.539
an Imperial Soldier.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:08.459
No need to remind me.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.461
[RIN]
That belongs to an enemy.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.130
Best to throw it out.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.298
[ALICE]
I know, but...

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.508
That swordsman is a beast.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.218
Given his ferocity,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.264
he could one day become your
most significant opponent.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.726
[ALICE] Don't act as if you're
not to blame for what happened.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.686
[RIN]
What do you mean?

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.062
Have you forgotten?

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.064
You made that rude
comment about how pasta

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.858
should be cooked al dente.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.069
It forced me to form a
culinary alliance with him.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.822
[RIN] I merely stated
a well‐known fact.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:41.409
Al dente is preferred.
No chef would argue that.

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:42.493
[ALICE]
Shut up!

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.846
[ALICE, ISKA]
This is torture.

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.265
Why is it so hard
to fall asleep tonight?

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:51.354
[MISMIS panting]

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:58.569
[MISMIS]
Water... I need water!

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.196
[JHIN]
So drink some.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.906
You should be training
to hydrate without breaking

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.533
your stride.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:06.035
[MISMIS] But I already
finished all of mine.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:10.164
Please, Jhin. Just a little sip.
I'm begging you!

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.958
[JHIN]
You'll get a cramp.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.419
[MISMIS]
Why are you such a meanie?!

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.753
[RISYA]
Hey, there!

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.005
[MISMIS yells]

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.175
Oh, it's just you, Risya.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:25.638
Issy, Nens, Jhin‐Jhin!
Hi, guys! It's been a while!

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.098
[ISKA]
Oh, hey!

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.183
I heard you're the Special
Defense for Humankind HQ's

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.978
special counsel now.
That's amazing.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.147
[RISYA]
It's not overly impressive.

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.106
[JHIN]
Perfect.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.608
What kind of trouble have
you brought for us today?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.944
Well, it's good news.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.237
Starting with the next mission,

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.656
your unit will be serving
under my command!

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.283
Aww.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.868
What? Aren't you thrilled?

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.036
It's just that...

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:50.705
You've got such a
gigantic brain, Risya.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:53.833
What if I don't understand
your strategies?

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.543
Please, you'll be fine.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.463
I reviewed your reports on
the engagement in Nelka.

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.132
It's obvious, your unit's
abilities remain as sharp

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.217
as ever.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.553
I've also heard that you've
been having a difficult

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.139
time sleeping, Issy.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.891
Just a little.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.518
Did you not have a
good time at the opera?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.105
Oh, no, that was perfect.
I appreciate it.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.816
A tragic love story
can still be happy.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.235
Even though Risya
thinks they're boring.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.446
I simply don't have a
disposition that's inclined

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.074
to appreciate or understand art.

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.077
Speaking of...
Why don't you take this?

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.915
The Salil Viblanc art exhibit?

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.501
[RISYA] I won the ticket in
a game with a subordinate,

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.711
but it would be wasted on me.

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.171
Use it. I insist.

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:43.132
In Ein, huh?

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:52.392
Apologies, Mother.

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:54.352
I know I'm late.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.730
[MILLAVAIR]
Alice. We need to talk.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.983
You recently battled against
an Imperial swordsman.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:03.736
I'm told he was as fierce
as a Saint Disciple.

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.196
[ALICE]
That's right.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.239
You're sure?

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.199
Soldiers of that rank
are strong and protect

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.660
the Emperor himself.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.454
You believe he was
that talented, yes?

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.248
What's the matter?

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:17.208
Why do you seem so alarmed?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.752
[MILLAVAIR]
Look above, daughter.

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:21.337
One hundred years ago.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:24.507
The Founder fought tens of
thousands of Imperial soldiers

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:27.051
on her own, and yet...

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:30.680
...life still courses
through her body.

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.724
The Founder had a
younger twin sister.

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.394
None other than
Nebulis the First.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.896
The royal bloodline
began with her.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:42.483
She is our noble ancestor.

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:46.154
Of course, the Empire never
knew that the so‐called

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:49.949
"Grand Witch" had a sibling.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:53.578
Thinking their most feared enemy
had left this mortal plane,

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.497
they rejoiced when Nebulis
the first passed away.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.877
[RIN]
The bind is weakening.

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:02.670
How is that possible?

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:05.548
[MILLAVAIR]
We first noticed recently.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.466
Alice.

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.634
When you fought against
the swordsman of the Empire

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.178
in the Nelka forest,

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.305
something changed in her.

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:14.474
[ALICE]
What does that mean?

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.559
[MILLAVAIR] Astral power
responds if its host is

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:18.060
in danger.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.729
Records tell us that long ago,

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.523
when the Imperial Army
reached the Sovereignty,

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:27.028
many types of these energies
reacted in tandem.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:30.573
The Founder's astral power
could be doing the same thing.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:33.326
An omen of her awakening.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:36.662
Alice, do you know what
could have caused this?

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:39.373
Awaken.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:45.546
[MILLAVAIR] Many mysteries
remain in regard to the

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.423
Founder's powers.

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.675
I will have the Astral
Institution look into this

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:51.385
at once.

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:52.678
Daughter,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.723
you shall refrain from
going into battle.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:58.267
At least until we know
who this swordsman is.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:59.477
[ALICE]
Understood.

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.401
My Lady, are you troubled?

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:10.112
What? Oh... No.

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:13.574
I have to stop overthinking
our recent concerns.

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.535
I'm not getting enough sleep.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.662
I need a change of scenery.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:18.913
Don't tell me.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.873
The Neutral city again?

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.917
What if Imperial agents
are waiting?

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.752
I won't go to the opera.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:27.213
And that was just a coincidence.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:30.883
This time I'll actually
enjoy my time away.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:33.761
[RIN]
What do you have planned?

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.972
[ALICE]
This is absurd.

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:38.975
I can't believe you're
still stalking me!

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:41.352
[ISKA] Wait, Alice?
Why are you here?

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:44.230
We're even going to
the same exhibition?

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.232
I don't understand your goal.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.568
Why are you in the
Neutral city so often?

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:51.320
Shouldn't you be back at
home protecting the Empire?

00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:52.989
Do you know who Viblanc is?

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.616
An impressionist painter
from the Empire.

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:58.119
I'm happy to support his show.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.830
It's stranger that you're
supporting an Imperial artist.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:03.499
Art has no borders, you fool.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.668
Yeah. That's true.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.878
I think the museum
is pretty close by.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.589
Shall we?

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.881
Sure.

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:14.176
Wait, back off! You tricked me.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:15.803
I'll go my own way.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.305
Hey, wait. But that's not...

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.231
[ALICE gasps]

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.190
Jeez.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:30.276
This may be known
as the city of art.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:33.613
But it's definitely not
a picture of cleanliness.

00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:34.822
[yells]

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:41.454
Rin. Help me. I think I'm lost.

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:56.886
[ISKA]
Alice?

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.012
What?

00:18:58.054 --> 00:18:59.889
Why do you keep popping up?

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.016
Didn't you go to the show?

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.726
[ISKA] Yeah, I walked
through most of it.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.728
But I didn't see you around.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.690
So I kind of figured that you
might've lost your way.

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:10.941
I'll take you there.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.109
[ALICE]
We mustn't!

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.737
I'm the princess of
the Nebulis Sovereignty,

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.573
and you're a swordsman
of the Empire!

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.617
[ISKA]
Right. A princess.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:20.826
I'd almost forgotten.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.582
There's no reason to try
and hide it now, I suppose.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:29.210
Anyway. You and I are enemies.

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.630
It's inappropriate for us
to consort with each other.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:35.549
I thought you told me
art has no borders.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.009
Or do you not believe that?

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.647
[ALICE]
I wanted to see this piece.

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:56.320
Iska?

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:57.738
Yes?

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.074
[ALICE] Tell me.
Why do you like this artist?

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:05.830
[ISKA] See how the paint
is extra thick in this spot?

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:08.708
It's only my imagination,
but maybe he paused

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:10.710
for a moment right here,
then added more

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.670
with a painting knife.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.588
And here, look at this.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.966
That's a completely
different shade.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.300
A re‐do.

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:20.177
I wonder... did the image
change in his head

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:21.554
as he worked?

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.222
What drove the changes?

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:25.558
What spark fired in his brain?

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:27.727
Viblanc only paints landscape.

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.438
Cities, streets, boating docks.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.481
There are no people
in his works.

00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:35.025
But they're alive nonetheless.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:39.113
His subjects are inorganic
and the palette is dark, but...

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.240
You can still feel his passion.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:42.450
Right.

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.202
I can see his
personality in his art.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.621
I think that's why I like it.

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:49.832
I get that. I agree.

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:57.006
Here, for showing me around.

00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:59.133
You didn't have to do that.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.260
I don't want to owe anyone.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:03.179
Especially you.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:08.142
It wasn't a big deal, honestly.
And it's not like I'm broke.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.560
What is it?

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.188
Turns out... I was wrong.

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:13.481
You're so foolish.

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:17.193
Just enjoy the drink. 'Kay?

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.402
Now we're even.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.364
Hey, how old are you, anyway?

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:23.824
Sixteen, and you?

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:26.076
I'm older, though not by much.

00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:35.628
Sorry, I was tired.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.148
[ALICE]
We're enemies. Idiot.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.318
In fact, if I wanted to...

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:02.071
I could end you right now.

00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:43.797
[GREAT APOSTLE] That concludes
deliberations for the day.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.845
We will reinstate Iska, the
Successor of the Black Steel,

00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:51.805
as a Saint Disciple.

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:53.515
Under the condition
that he captures

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.975
the Ice Calamity Witch.
