WEBVTT

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:22.856
[RIN] You're saying you honestly
don't know who this man is?

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:24.608
Truly?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.861
No. Not a man. A demon.

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:30.197
A traitor who rose
against our late queen.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.282
Then stopping him
is my ticket home.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:35.911
Make me a promise.

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:39.748
If I take him down,
you let us leave.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.417
You allow my friends
and I to cross the border.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.628
All we want is to leave
the Sovereignty.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.425
That sounds like a "yes."

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.971
[SALINGER]
I fail to understand.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:57.558
Why would someone from the
Empire protect the likes of her?

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.978
Why draw your swords against me?

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.063
No, don't think too hard.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.983
Your answer means
nothing either way.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.150
I'll crush you.

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:11.071
[ALICE]
Move with haste!

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.802
[SCHWARTZ]
Ah, so this is where you are.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:03:00.055
Please, come inside.
The alert is still in effect.

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.432
It's not safe out here.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:04.476
[SISBELL] Do you know what
this is all about, Schwartz?

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.812
[SCHWARTZ] We believe the
Empire's assassination force

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.855
was spotted within our borders.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.857
How they got past is unknown.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.526
As if that weren't enough.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.945
Salinger the Demon has
broken free of his cell

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.071
in Alcatroz.

00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:18.532
Which is perhaps an
even graver threat.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.784
We're unsure if these
two events are related.

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.869
But rest assured we're
using all of our resources

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.955
to investigate.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.415
[SISBELL]
I see.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:30.168
[SCHWARTZ] There is another
thing that concerns me.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.713
I am told Princess Aliceliese
is at the prison

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.757
and has taken command
of the situation herself.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.300
It seems too much
of a coincidence

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:40.762
that she just so happened
to be in the Province.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.472
[SISBELL]
My sister's involved?

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.854
What's this?

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.230
Interesting.

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.357
Some have been able
to block my astral art,

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.317
Roaring Song, before.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.071
But no one has ever
literally sliced through it.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.948
Sound‐based powers are invisible

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.451
and destructive
forces by nature.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.953
You couldn't possibly
have seen the attack.

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.414
[ISKA] It wasn't the attack
itself that I observed.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.753
He saw the fire flicker.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:13.795
Impressive.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.797
You're able to sense
the slightest changes

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.507
in your surroundings.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.050
A useful trait.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.970
I wasn't born with this ability.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:25.807
[SALINGER] Is it a side‐show
skill, or a gift from god?

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.809
Is it a talent?

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.936
Or simply a fluke?

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:30.979
No matter.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.648
I'll enjoy finding out
as we fight.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.776
Swordsman, you must
be on your guard.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.986
That power is called
water reflection.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.739
It captures astral
spirits and steals‐‐Gah!

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:41.782
Rin!

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.035
Do not ruin my fun, maid.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.204
I'd prefer to play with
this Imperial alone

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.705
for the time being.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.585
[SALINGER]
Solid reflexes.

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:55.921
How did you evade that attack?

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.506
Instinct.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.217
But that will only
get you so far.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.468
What a pity.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.594
Enough.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.306
I'll finish this
with one strike.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.390
What are you?

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.601
A human, or a beast in disguise?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:16.942
[SALINGER laughs]

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.986
That gave me a fright.
What a treat.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.822
A barrier of wind?

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.532
[SALINGER] That was your
one‐in‐a‐million chance

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.575
of catching me by surprise.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.286
Those swords will never
get that close again.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.081
You're wrong.
And that shield won't save you!

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:34.167
Taste the dirt, you worm.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.347
Astral spirit of earth.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.765
Scorch the ground.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.351
Channel your fury
into a deadly blast!

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:53.937
Jump, quick!

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.075
[ISKA]
I owe you.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.077
Don't read into my warning.

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.162
I had no choice.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.247
Truth is...

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.499
It's fortunate that you're here.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.167
I have no idea
how many more cards

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.003
he has up his sleeve.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.379
But we'll stop him.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.090
[SALINGER]
More cards, you say? Ha.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.259
Your naivete shouldn't
surprise me,

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:26.511
but I haven't revealed
the scope of my abilities

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.598
in the last 30 years.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.266
Listen closely.

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:33.643
Let me broaden your horizons.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:36.688
The true power of the
astral spirit is far greater

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.189
than you can imagine.

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:42.736
You have yet to
glimpse its potential

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.571
and will die in the dark.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.244
[ALICE] Emergency response
teams, search for Salinger!

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.330
Police officers will take
care of the injured!

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.749
Leave me to deal with the fire!

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.208
Prison guards,
you'll join the search

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.044
for the escaped demon.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.838
We cannot allow him
to unleash more chaos.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.923
We'll stop him!

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.132
[NAMELESS]
How pointless.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.019
Salinger will wreak havoc

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.271
because no one can
stand against him.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:21.024
Saint Disciple.
Called Nameless.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.692
This nation is my home.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:26.279
A lowly assassin is
not welcome here.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.406
[NAMELESS] How ludicrous
for a witch to think of me

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.367
as inferior.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.202
[ALICE]
Is this your doing?

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.371
Attacking the prison
and releasing Salinger

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.122
is an absurd gamble.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.583
[NAMELESS]
Does that matter right now?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.628
Focus on what's in front of you.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.672
The prison tower is in flames,

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.882
and Salinger the Transcendent
will once again

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.009
wage war against the
Sovereignty.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.594
That's what should worry you.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.388
I won't allow it.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:52.973
[NAMELESS]
Is that so?

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.058
[ALICE]
Pierce him!

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.229
[NAMELESS] Did you think
you'd have an advantage

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.981
since this is your realm?

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.148
You're hiding?

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.150
That doesn't seem your style.

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.944
Step forward and fight me.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.071
[NAMELESS]
As you wish.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.323
But not until
Salinger is finished.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.578
For now, my mission is over.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.705
Come back!

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:17.789
[explosion]

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:24.838
[ALICE]
It's him.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.019
[RIN] Astral spirit
of water reflection.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.646
[SALINGER] This power allows me
to split another astral spirit

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.981
in half.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.274
Fire and water.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.608
Earth and wind.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.110
Yin and yang.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.863
By combining the two
contradictory concepts,

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:53.158
the elements both
gather more power.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.618
It is the state of refinement
that no individual

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.079
astral spirit can
hope to attain.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.415
Freezing fire!

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.840
[ISKA]
Fall back, Rin!

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.474
The blaze grew stronger?

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.310
You disrupted the balance
between fire and ice.

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.228
A fatal mistake, I fear.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.440
Now you die.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:29.944
Iska!

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.039
Salinger. You monster.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.750
Is this the reason you
collect astral spirits?

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:44.876
[SALINGER]
Not quite.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.045
This is just a happy by‐product.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.589
In fact, combining one
astral spirit with another

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:53.051
is within the power of any mage.

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.471
What I see on the horizon
is something much greater.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:10:00.683
My goal is to combine
human and spirit.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:03.103
You would fuse the two together?

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.938
[SALINGER] Only two people
in history have reached

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.856
that level of ascendance.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.818
One was Founder Nebulis.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.070
[RIN]
What are you saying?

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.239
[SALINGER] I'll rule this world,
but as something more

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.490
than a king.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.659
I will ascend to a pulpit
of power that none

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.452
have ever reached before.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.789
You're insane.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:25.500
Hear me, traitor!

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.502
You're an enemy
to the royal family!

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.379
And must be put down!

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.256
[SALINGER]
You still wish to fight?

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.884
You've saw how poorly that
skilled swordsman faired.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.679
[RIN]
You know nothing about Iska.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.765
My master has faced him,
and she acknowledged

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:43.518
that he is her only true rival.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.979
Furthermore, he defeated
the Founder,

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.939
someone you hope to surpass.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.482
You underestimate him.

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:52.652
Really? Well, I doubt
that very much.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.320
Perhaps you're lying.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.156
[RIN] It'd take more
than an attack like that

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.699
to take Iska out.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.492
So I'm playing my part.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.036
Listening to your
egomaniacal speech to stall

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.706
for his recovery.

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:05.999
What a bore.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.918
I've grown tired of your face.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.296
You can join him.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.381
[ISKA]
Wrong target, Demon!

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.095
But how?

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.728
[SALINGER]
You couldn't have survived that!

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.897
[ISKA]
These astral swords are a pair.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.357
The black blade can cut
through an astral art.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.193
Then the white sword

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.528
has the power to
replicate it one time.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.077
[SALINGER]
Hold on.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.296
You used your sword
to cut through the ice

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.423
and then used the other
to freeze yourself

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.508
in order to escape the blaze?

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.677
Are you a madman?

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.887
Just lucky.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:05.099
Alice trusted me.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.560
And I swear I won't
let her down!

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.772
Luck, you say? I think not.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.941
You're just a
senseless berserker!

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.946
Air and lightning.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.907
Combine! Dance for me!

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.493
A sandstorm?

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.871
Earth Golem! Come forth!

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:33.503
Rin!

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.130
Don't worry about me!

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.966
You can't let him defeat you!

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.467
How dare you!

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.470
Common trash.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:49.477
What?

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.855
[ALICE] You will not
harm her any further.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.525
My Lady.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.323
[ALICE]
You did well.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.908
Thank you for persevering.

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:09.872
Iska. I knew you would help me.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.170
You won't prevail!

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.922
Don't be such a fool!

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.133
A mere swordsman could
never hope to stand

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:22.302
against someone of my stature!

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.886
I won't allow it!

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:42.989
[SALINGER laughs]

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.907
How very amusing!

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.243
Fate granted me a truly
formidable opponent

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.578
at last.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.705
But this attempt to
stop me from reaching

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:54.459
new heights as an
astral mage will fail.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.210
Mark my words!

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.296
Nothing can hold me
back or stop me

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.423
from achieving my goals.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:04.802
[SALINGER laughing]

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:39.170
[RIN] Lady Alice, we've
confirmed the prisoner count.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.923
No one escaped.

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:45.051
[ALICE]
Good. That's a relief.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.678
Rin. How are your injuries?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.930
I'm fine, ma'am.

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:52.683
Oh? So this scrape doesn't hurt?

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.560
Ow! What would you do that for?

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.813
[ALICE]
You don't have to act so stoic.

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.689
This is me you're talking to.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:14:59.816
You can be honest.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.404
I am in a little pain.

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.531
[ALICE chuckles]
Was that hard?

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.451
[ALICE]
Brief me on the situation.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:11.702
[RIN]
Of course.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.996
Things have settled down
around the prison.

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:16.916
It's likely that the Imperial
soldiers have retreated.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.670
We've already sent preliminary
reports to Her Majesty.

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.463
[ALICE]
All right. In that case...

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.006
I'll give her a full
account of events

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.550
once we're back at the palace.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:31.472
Iska.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.391
You could have fled this
province as soon as you

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.269
unlocked your handcuffs.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.770
But you didn't.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.611
[ISKA]
I kept my promise.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.238
We're good, aren't we?

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.997
[ALICE]
No! We're not good!

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:57.540
[RIN]
Lady Alice?

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.293
I almost thanked him,
but that wouldn't be right!

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.753
Iska was obligated to help me!

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.547
Those were the unspoken
terms of the deal.

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:08.843
Now. Let's go!

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.470
There's so much I need
to report to Mother

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:12.138
and we're wasting time.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.723
[RIN]
Um... Right.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.166
[NAMELESS] You struggled more
than I thought you would.

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:51.594
[RISYA sighs]
Woo, I was burning up in there!

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.889
I thought I was gonna die
from heat exhaustion.

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.891
I will never wear
another airtight metal

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.060
fiber suit as long as I live.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.686
I could barely stand
to fight for more than

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:01.896
a couple minutes.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:04.649
This thing wore me out
and I had to retreat.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.401
[NAMELESS] Risya, you don't
even need a toy like that

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:09.529
to defeat an opponent.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.697
It's all part of my research.

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:13.699
How'd things go with you?

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.244
[NAMELESS] Two special forces
succeeded in infiltrating

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:18.454
the Central Province.

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:21.374
We can now begin
to surveil the palace.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:23.251
That's lovely news.

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.169
The Apostles might even
be in a good mood

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.380
for a few days.

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.465
[NAMELESS]
I assume you're off to report.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.758
To the Emperor?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.844
That I am.
Can't keep him waiting.

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.097
You know who he's
really interested in?

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:39.475
The former prisoner Iska,
Successor of the Black Steel.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.231
[GREAT APOSTLE B] Risya and
Nameless have returned from

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.525
their missions.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.735
[F GREAT APOSTLE A] The Nebulis
Sovereignty is shaken.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.780
The ordeal with Salinger
caught them off guard.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:56.117
[GREAT APOSTLE B]
Count it a success in our favor.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.785
[GREAT APOSTLE A] It would
be ideal if the purebred

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.454
had been captured,
but all in due time.

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.459
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
The stage is set.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.722
Wow, good news.

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.433
It was a real pain getting
inside, but leaving there

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:21.767
was a piece of cake!

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:23.269
You guys are crazy.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.564
I can't believe that we met
up in the Sovereignty.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.690
Honestly...

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:30.443
I'm surprised you made it past
the border in the first place.

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:31.569
Yes, I agree.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.239
Thank goodness for
our researchers.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.491
They're the reason
this was a success.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:38.701
The special crest?

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.870
Right. Our trump card.

00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:43.748
Risya says they should
disappear in a few days.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:46.083
Time was not on our side.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.293
I see.

00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:50.171
[MISMIS]
Huh?

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:52.798
Big sigh. You must be so tired.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.508
[ISKA]
Nah, I'll be fine.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.346
I can push through until
we return to the Empire.

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.473
But yeah. I am exhausted.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.026
[ISKA]
Hey, wait!

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.820
It's Alice's fault
that I'm so beat.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:16.739
What was that? Alice?

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.157
Oh, no, no, nothing!

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.617
I was half asleep.

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.538
I'm glad to see you're
doing all right, Captain.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.581
Oh, yeah!

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.333
I'm just happy to have you back!

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.085
Me, too. So, uh...

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:31.003
What about your astral crest?

00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:33.381
You probably figured out
what to do about it, right?

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:36.884
Captain?

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.095
[MISMIS]
No! Don't remind me!

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:40.513
I haven't been able
to come to terms

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.264
with my situation yet.

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:43.474
[whines]

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:44.934
[ISKA]
Don't tell me you forgot.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.895
[MISMIS] I was too
worried about you, Iska!

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.648
You'll think of a plan when
we get back, won't you?

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.525
Yeah, of course!

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:53.526
Don't worry.

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.111
It's my turn to help you.

00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:56.404
I won't fail.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.366
[ALICE]
Rin.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.535
You fought well and
stood your ground.

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.830
I couldn't be prouder of you.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.581
Ma'am, I am humbled
by your words.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.127
[ALICE]
What is it?

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.294
It's just...

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.587
I tried my best.

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.089
But I couldn't have
beaten the demon

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.508
on my own.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.634
[ALICE]
I know.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:27.435
Then how exactly
do you feel about me?

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.270
What am I to you?

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.771
A fierce rival.

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:35.067
Iska.

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:36.193
My Lady.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:39.029
I'm concerned I just heard
you say an unsavory word.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.656
[ALICE]
Think nothing of it!

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:42.450
He and I are official now!

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.368
We're official rivals!

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.579
It's fine for me
to say his name.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.331
[RIN]
Quite the opposite!

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:51.667
Though... I guess...

00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:54.879
That Imperial swordsman
did save my life.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.715
I must admit,
however reluctantly,

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:02.928
that even though he's our enemy,
he's a respectable warrior.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.221
So!

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:06.056
You get where I'm coming from.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:07.683
In a way.

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:10.936
But you still must refrain
from speaking his name.

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:12.605
Especially when you're here.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:13.939
But, Rin.

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.150
I'll tell Her Majesty.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.401
Fine.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.696
[RIN]
What is it?

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:21.781
Nothing.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:23.282
You just worry too much.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.659
[RIN]
I'm only stating the obvious!

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:26.911
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.704
You always have a level head.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:34.460
Iska? An Imperial soldier?

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:37.922
Alice is interested in
this person as her rival.

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.965
Who is it?

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:42.343
That name. Iska.

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.269
No way.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:55.105
It can't be him.

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.690
That's impossible.

00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:05.491
Stars of fate.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:08.035
I will not succumb
to your temptation.

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:13.165
But... If I could see
that boy again...

00:22:15.209 --> 00:22:19.964
Just once. Please. Make it so.
