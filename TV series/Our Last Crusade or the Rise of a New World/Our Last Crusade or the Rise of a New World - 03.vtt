WEBVTT

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:15.974
[MISMIS groans]

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:19.186
[ISKA]
Captain Mismis.

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:20.979
[MISMIS]
Huh?

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.732
[ISKA] Here. I bought you
that soda you like so much.

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:24.858
It might help.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.569
Yay! It's ginger ale!

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.072
[ISKA chuckles]
Got some for you and Nene, too.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.657
Figured we could use a break.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.493
How kind of you.
Even bottles instead of cans.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.124
Yeah. I didn't even
think about it.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.336
Hey there, guys!

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.922
Wait, Mismis?
Where are you hiding at?

00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:48.048
[MISMIS]
Risya?

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.716
[RISYA]
How's the prep going?

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.718
I trust you're not whining
about the materials

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.304
you have to memorize, are you?

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.516
Anyway, I'm really
calling to talk to Issy.

00:00:57.558 --> 00:01:00.185
Could I pull you away
for a brief meeting?

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.312
Do you mean at your place?

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:03.939
Not quite.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.524
At the Imperial Senate.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.414
[GREAT APOSTLE A] Iska.
Successor of the Black Steel.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.291
We reviewed your report.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.001
[GREAT APOSTLE B] You fought
against the Ice Calamity Witch

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.378
and survived.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.129
You are truly skilled.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.172
[ISKA]
Thank you.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:55.008
But I failed to
protect the reactor.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.802
[GREAT APOSTLE A] The mission
we gave you was to defeat

00:02:56.843 --> 00:03:01.390
a powerful enemy.
Not to protect the reactor.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.100
[GREAT APOSTLE B] We now
know the Empire has the fighting

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.686
ability to hold off
our purebred foe.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.396
That intelligence
alone is vital,

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.023
and well worth the cost
of our lost property.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.235
We even discussed reinstating
you as a Saint Disciple.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.653
I am honored.

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.238
[GREAT APOSTLE A] Your
determination toward attaining

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.573
peace is well known to us.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.784
As a Saint Disciple,
you could gain an audience

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.786
with His Excellency.

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:25.539
[GREAT APOSTLE B] However, you
have been marked as criminal

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.208
within the Empire.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.877
[GREAT APOSTLE A] We offer
one way to clear your name.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.337
It's simple.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.424
Bring in the Ice Calamity
Witch‐‐ alive.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.802
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
We are counting on you.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:47.978
[ALICE]
Tell me.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.564
Why do you like this artist?

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.567
Hey, how old are you, anyway?

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.902
I'm older, though not by much.

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:04.202
[MISMIS] You want to skip
tomorrow's training session?

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.996
Are you not feeling well?

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.707
I have an errand. Over in Ein.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.583
[MISMIS]
Oh?

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.293
Didn't you already
use Risya's ticket

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.503
to the art exhibition, though?

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.505
[ISKA] I'm not going there
to see the sights.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.300
There's somebody
I'd like to meet with.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.552
[MISMIS] And you want
me to cover for you.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:23.305
Yes. You mind?

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.390
[MISMIS] I guess I can't say
no if you feel it's something

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.351
you have to do.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.978
Thanks, Captain.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.481
[MISMIS]
But under one condition.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.859
I'm going with you tomorrow.

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.444
Look at the window.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:42.616
Can you see your reflection?
I bet you look concerned.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.618
I can't let a team member
in that condition

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.661
face the world alone.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.914
It's my duty to
ensure your safety.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.461
I get that.
Please, come with me.

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:56.129
[MISMIS]
I'd be happy to!

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.107
[ALICE]
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.943
This is to repay you
for showing me the way

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.361
to the museum.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.737
Think nothing of it.

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:25.992
[RIN]
Lady Alice.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.621
I have a dossier
on the swordsman.

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:30.831
Shall I read it to you?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.708
[ALICE]
Uh, yes. Who is he?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.001
[RIN]
A Saint Disciple.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.169
That can't be.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.840
[RIN] Apparently the youngest in
history to achieve the rank.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.467
I've no doubt he's one of
the most dangerous soldiers

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.095
the Empire has ever created.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:48.056
[ALICE] Then why didn't
I meet him before?

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.933
[RIN]
You never had the chance.

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.893
After his promotion,
he never set foot

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.645
on the battlefield.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.480
He was stripped of his
title and imprisoned

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.148
for a year.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.400
For what crime?

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.155
[RIN]
Treason.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.575
Apparently, he freed an astral
mage who had been captured

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.118
by the Empire.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.414
I don't understand.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.457
It was obvious that
Iska was after me

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.251
in the Nelka forest.

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.545
This makes no sense.

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:21.548
Rin, find me the identity
of the astral mage

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.924
he set free.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.759
[RIN]
I'm already on it, my Lady.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.553
I'll need few more days.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.096
Please be patient.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.648
[MILLAVAIR] It seems you're
quite interested in this

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.984
enemy soldier.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.027
[ALICE]
Mother!

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:49.451
[MILLAVAIR]
The Empire hates our kind.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.120
It is a nation that views
us as monsters

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:55.999
whom they would
persecute into extinction.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:58.293
They have been relentless
in the past.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:02.005
Countless astral mages fell
victim to their cruelty.

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:06.176
The suffering they've
inflicted is unfathomable.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.762
To defeat and overthrow
the Empire is the greatest

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:12.641
wish of the Sovereignty.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.769
Imperial artists are
as bad as soldiers.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.104
Witch hunts and witch trials
are often celebrated

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.856
in their paintings.

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:22.734
They, too, are pawns
of the Empire.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:26.196
It is inexcusable to have them
on your walls and shelves.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.281
[ALICE]
Of course, Mother.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:29.699
[MILLAVAIR]
It's late,

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.994
so I'll leave you to
consider these truths.

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:34.663
I have taken enough
of your time.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.259
Rin, are you there?

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.302
Yes.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.599
What did Her Majesty need?

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.226
Lady Alice?

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:59.270
Make preparations to leave
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.147
We ride to Neutral City.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.482
I must protest!

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.943
What if we bump into that
imperial swordsman again?

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.445
[ALICE]
I'm counting on that happening.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.115
I want to know his
true intentions.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.700
He will tell me.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.039
[MISMIS]
Now that we're on the road,

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.874
care to tell me who it is
you've arranged to have

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.835
a special meeting with?

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:24.170
Actually... I have no plan.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.880
Then why are we going?

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.508
[ISKA] I just get the
feeling she'll be there.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.844
You know, I've never
really believed in fate

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.721
or destiny in the past.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.974
But for some reason,
I'm positive we'll meet again.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.517
What's your goal here?

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.810
A conversation.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.770
There's something I want
to understand.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.525
[MISMIS]
Look, an albatross!

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.901
That's unexpected!

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.571
Not many live in Empire
territory anymore.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.656
Though, I think a few
villages on the outskirts

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.992
tame and train them
for different uses.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.580
Captain, keep driving
until we get to the gate.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.540
Then stop the car.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.167
[MISMIS]
Um... Sure.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.184
We obviously have a connection.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.393
I wonder.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.270
What kind of a star
were we born under?

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:26.483
Who is this?

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:29.569
My boss, Captain Mismis.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:30.612
So.

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.989
You brought some backup
with you today.

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.824
Iska, quick question.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:37.327
Who is the pretty girl?
A friend?

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:38.369
It's hard to‐‐

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.581
[ALICE] Allow me.
I can introduce myself.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.958
Hello, soldier of the Empire.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.919
My name is Alice.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.755
Aliceliese Lou
Nebulis the Ninth.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.256
Miss Alice?

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.759
Wait. You said Nebulis?

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.427
You know my other title.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.971
Your people refer to me
as the Ice Calamity Witch.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.476
No, no, that can't be right‐‐
what's going on?

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.897
It's crowded here. Follow me.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.611
Sometimes when visiting
this Neutral City,

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:15.907
it's easy to forget the
hatred between our peoples.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.409
I have a question for you.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.954
One year ago, an Imperial
soldier was arrested

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.997
for treason.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.250
Not just anyone,
but a Saint Disciple,

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.918
one of the nation's best.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.753
You freed a mage.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:29.921
Is that the truth?

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.756
Yes, it is.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.008
[ALICE]
I want to know why.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.636
That witch was
just a little girl.

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:41.266
Maybe 12 or 13,
with hardly any astral power.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:44.227
Problem was...
the Empire didn't care.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.729
They view every witch
as an enemy.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.398
I'm not like that.

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:51.067
And yet you still
fight for them.

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:52.861
You came looking for me.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.697
Your whole goal
was to take me down.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.740
I know what I speak is fact.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.868
But you expect me to believe
you freed this mage

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.327
because you pitied her?

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:05.456
[RIN]
Lost your voice?

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.417
What's wrong, swordsman?

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.668
[ISKA]
It's all true.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.794
What?

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.504
[ISKA]
And my goal hasn't changed.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.673
It's the same as
it was a year ago.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.091
[ALICE]
What do you want?

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:18.052
[ISKA]
A peace treaty.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.138
I want to end the war,
but the Empire's

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.265
not interested in my ideas.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:25.143
As an enemy of the Sovereignty,
I'm certain your leaders

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.020
wouldn't entertain them either.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.563
[ALICE]
Of course not.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.481
[ISKA] So my plan is to
take a direct descendant

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.192
of Nebulis hostage.

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:33.651
A bargaining chip.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.070
A powerful astral mage,
or purebred,

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.239
as the Empire calls them.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.699
With you in danger,

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:43.077
the Nebulis Sovereignty would
be forced to listen to us.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.747
Your people would
be concerned for you.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.207
At that time,

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:50.168
we could start
peace negotiations.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.379
I do think you're being
honest with me.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.548
But you're wrong.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.508
That plan would never work.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.718
[ISKA]
Why not?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.762
You could take me
as a hostage right now.

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.513
Mother would not react.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.183
This war would continue
to rage on.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.518
Peace is nothing
but foolish dream.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.396
You've never been to
the Sovereignty before.

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.899
You have no idea how
much the people there

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.734
loathe your kind.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.570
We're raised that way.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:18.780
That said...

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.323
I never knew there
were people like you

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.574
in the Empire.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:23.826
I find it quite the shock.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.788
Within your barbaric,
warmongering nation,

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:28.748
I would not have expected
soldiers who fight

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.501
for the end of this conflict.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.294
Yes.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.880
I think I understand
you better now, Iska.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:41.177
Hence... You should
serve under me!

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.056
What's that?

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.183
Wait, Lady Alice,
please think about this!

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.060
You don't know what
you're suggesting!

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.687
This is not what we discussed.

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:53.356
How could you say
something so blasphemous?

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:54.857
The thought just came to me.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.110
What you're suggesting
is insane!

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.237
Please. What would
your sisters think?

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:03.116
To say nothing of Her Majesty,
who would never agree to‐‐

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:06.077
[ALICE] We'll deal with those
problems when they arise.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.579
I'll guarantee you a
position in our ranks.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.291
All you have to do is
defect from the Empire.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.628
Please. Iska, wait.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.508
An attack?

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.968
Rin. What's this?

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.512
[RIN] I don't know, but my
astral power is startled

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:25.763
as well.

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:30.768
The sky.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.687
Captain, fall back!

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.362
[THE FOUNDER]
The treacherous.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.489
Astral sword.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:47.368
Wretched blade of the star.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.329
It's the... Founder.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.543
[MISMIS]
No way.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.755
Iska, did she just
say the Founder?

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:00.798
[ISKA] I think that's what
we're looking at, Captain.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.800
The Grand Witch
Nebulis is alive.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.510
She didn't die 100 years ago

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:07.096
when she turned the Empire
into a sea of flames.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.183
No fair!

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:12.268
This is an ambush and
there's only two of us!

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.063
No, please!
I didn't do anything!

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.776
The Empire. So corrupted.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:22.987
You ruin this planet
and its astral power.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.781
All of you must perish!

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:29.035
Obliterate them.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.039
[ALICE, ISKA grunt]

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.006
Astral power is resonating.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.800
I can feel it.

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.385
What is the meaning of this?

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.140
[MILLAVAIR gasps]

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.558
The Founder is gone.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:57.688
But then... That's good news.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:03.027
With her power on our side,
the Empire's defeat is imminent.

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:11.744
Captain? Are you okay?

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.873
Thank God.

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.960
I thought the Founder
was your ally.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.670
Why would she
attack you as well?

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.673
[RIN] We call her the Founder
because she created our nation.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.217
The depths of her powers
are unknown, though.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:30.054
It would be sheer arrogance
to call her an ally.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.348
Still, why would
she attack Alice,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.560
one of her own descendants?

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.062
[ALICE] It's the astral power's
auto defense system.

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.273
Though, I don't know
what it's reacting to.

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:41.524
[RIN]
Lady Alice!

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.109
How frustrating.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.777
[ISKA]
That's your response?

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:45.945
You see...

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.738
It was my hope that we
could settle this matter

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.907
between the two of us.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.326
Ever since I met
you at the opera,

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:56.205
I've had this confusion
inside of me.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.500
But I have duties as a princess.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.378
I came here today
to quell that feeling.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.714
I was actually
looking forward to it.

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:06.466
For once I could
handle things without

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:07.925
other people meddling.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.136
On my own accord as I saw fit.

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:12.805
Then, of all people,
the stupid Founder

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.433
waltzes in to interrupt
us and ruin things!

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.809
[RIN]
You can't call her that!

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:19.520
[MISMIS]
What?

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:20.521
[ISKA]
Captain!

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:23.399
Simply standing here
won't solve anything!

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:24.525
Stand back.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.236
You must stop!

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.155
Please, Founder!

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:33.367
An astral mage has the
audacity to get in my way?

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:36.078
If you are joining
forces with the Empire...

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:38.498
Oh, no!

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.459
...then you will die
along with them.

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:53.471
Rin, no!

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.102

00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:01.938
Come on, answer me!

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.732
Rin! Open your eyes! Please!

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.734
[ISKA]
Alice. I have an idea.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:07.735
Iska?

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.570
Encase her body in your ice.

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:11.364
Your power can save her.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.996
Captain.
Take her to the hospital.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:22.458
If you can, find an astral
injury specialist to help.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.544
Huh? But Iska...

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:26.003
[ISKA]
The city is in danger.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.547
Sound the alarm.

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:29.257
Evacuate the residents.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.259
Get them far away
from this area.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.718
[MISMIS]
Right. On it.

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:41.561

I'm sorry about this.

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:42.770
[ISKA]
Don't be.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.943
[THE FOUNDER] Are those the
swords that have awakened me?

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.195
Those blades belong
to Crossweil.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.655
Crossweil?

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.824
How is it you know my Master?

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.702
I see. You're his pupil.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:58.911
No matter.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.330
You cannot possibly
stand against me.

to side with the Empire.

Scream for mercy.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.140
It will not absolve
you from your sins.

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:32.153
You're also an astral mage, but
didn't hesitate to attack Rin.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:33.321
You hurt her.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.865
You're no longer
the Sovereignty's hero!

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.116
A hero?

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:40.786
You can't rely on an idea
like that to save the world.

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:45.207
I will become so much more
and destroy the Empire.

hoped for your return‐‐

that it might preserve them.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.633
But they were wrong.

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:56.385
Seeing you here now,
I understand.

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:57.887
In this era...

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.746
You have no idea
how many astral mages

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.915
were oppressed by your kind.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:28.376
Be on guard.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.544
[THE FOUNDER]
Die.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:49.522
Fire, ice, and earth, as well?

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:50.648
Quick! Jump!

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:52.858
Ice Calamity!

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.367
Feel this planet's wrath.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:12.378
You have to let me go!
Otherwise...

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.713
[ISKA grunts]

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.676
Don't you realize
we feel the same way?

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:22.012
Alice, you're upset because
Rin was hurt, I know.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.056
And we can't negotiate
peace if the Founder

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:26.392
is rampaging through the land.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:29.812
This is neither the Empire
nor the Sovereignty's fight.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.522
It's neutral territory.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.399
We share the same goal.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.025
That's all that matters.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.902
Join me!

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.196
Is this really happening?

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.781
Can I trust you?

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:47.204
Ice Calamity:
Flooding Snow Lights!

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:50.458
Launch. Stars of Ice!

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:02.386
Attack!

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:04.430
So aves cal pile.

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:12.938
[ALICE yells]

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.195
Crawl the earth
like a pathetic worm.

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:20.738
That's what you are.

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.115
[ISKA grunts]

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.703
Keep running!
I'll make a path!

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:31.749
[ISKA]
You're mine!

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.418
[THE FOUNDER]
Insolence!

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.086
You have no idea
the hatred I have

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.963
for the Empire‐‐

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:40.424
Your vendetta brought
about this conflict!

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:42.134
You're the reason nobody
can stop fighting

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.469
this damn war!

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:44.553
[THE FOUNDER]
Silence!

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:48.724
Alice, now!

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.142
Ice Blossom!

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:55.439
It can't be!

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.568
[ISKA yells]

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:08.077
[ISKA]
Go back to sleep, Nebulis!

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.746
The next time you
decide to wake up,

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.456
the world will be better.

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:13.958
If only slightly.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.312
[ISKA] Alice, about
what you said before.

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:36.981
Yes?

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:38.983
[ISKA] I can't just convert
to your side.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:43.237
Oh. Right, of course.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:45.781
Then... You and I
will remain at odds.

00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:52.246
But... I do have an idea.

00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:53.289
[ALICE]
Okay.

00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:58.711
A truce.
I'm way too tired to fight you.

00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.379
No objections here.

00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:03.173
Only for today.

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.633
I know.

00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:09.263
Tomorrow, we're back to being
mortal enemies once again.

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:10.431
[ISKA]
All right.
