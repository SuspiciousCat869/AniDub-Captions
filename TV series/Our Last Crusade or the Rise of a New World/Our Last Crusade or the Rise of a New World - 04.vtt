WEBVTT

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.689
What? That's not fair!

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.567
I coulda sworn it was
gonna stop on the seven!

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.237
Fortune's not with
you today, either.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.155
I don't trust this machine.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.657
I bet it's rigged.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.825
It's called gambling
for a reason.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.327
[MISMIS]
I'm not giving up yet.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.622
I'll find another game,
and this time I'm gonna win big.

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:39.748
[ISKA]
Wait, Captain!

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.293
That's the trap every casino
wants you to fall into!

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.254
Will she be okay?

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.089
Doubt it.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.675
Anyway... Question.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.010
Why did she bring us
here in the first place?

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.525
[MISMIS]
A last‐chance vacation?

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:31.443
[RISYA]
That's right.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:32.903
Your unit's working
under my orders

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.863
for the foreseeable future,
and joint training's

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:36.114
around the corner.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.201
It would be wise to enjoy
the free time while you can.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:42.329
You won't exactly have much
of it once I put you to work.

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.539
What? That sounds bad.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.000
Bye! Have a wonderful time!

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.502
[MISMIS]
Risya, wait!

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.254
Don't leave on that note!
Please!

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.339
[RISYA laughs]

00:02:53.924 --> 00:02:55.842
[NENE] Does that mean our
next mission is going to be

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:57.260
super dangerous?

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.805
Is this vacation
our last hurrah?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.307
[ISKA]
I wonder what we'll be doing.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.187
[MISMIS] She said she'd surprise
us with the details next week.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.313
[JHIN]
Honestly..,

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.524
I think you're reading
too much into this.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.109
Keep your head on, Boss.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.778
There's no good reason
to be alarmed yet.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.363
Thanks, Jhin!

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:17.864
We could die at any time.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.408
Mission or not.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.702
Could you be any
less comforting?

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.704
Hey, we're good.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:27.749
But still. Why did we
end up at a casino?

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.751
[MISMIS]
For the jackpot.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.378
You mean money?

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.547
So it's funds then.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.966
Great. What're you buying?

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.301
[MISMIS]
A Merkava tank model MI62,

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.387
manufactured by Francesco.

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:41.388
Oh, wow!

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.266
You're trying to nab us
the latest battle tank?

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.059
I figured if we hit
a jackpot here,

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.936
I could get one for our unit.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:49.980
That way we could easily
escape a dangerous

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.524
situation when
we're in the field.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:53.900
So that's it.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.193
Sounds about right.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.280
She always has
unconventional ideas.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.406
Well...

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:00.866
At least you picked this
place for a reason

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.284
other than pleasure.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.827
[MISMIS]
Yes! Of course!

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.746
Let's keeping playing
the machines!

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.998
Together, I know
we can score big!

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.999
Go team!

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.084
Get that battle tank money!

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.753
Maybe I'll have enough
to buy a house.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.796
[ISKA] Maybe focus on
one thing at a time!

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.054
Here we are, my lady. Welcome!

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.307
Jurak is the city of pleasure.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.225
A favorite of the nobility.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.352
As a prestigious
resort destination,

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.897
it's a perfect getaway for you,
wouldn't you agree?

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.443
I've no interest in gambling.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:39.488
I made it very clear I wanted
to go to the Neutral City Ein.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.655
Absolutely not.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.909
Are you trying to run into that
cursed Imperial soldier again?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.994
No. Of course I'm not.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.913
I'm well aware of my duty.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.581
To honor my people.

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.000
I will fight Iska
when next I see him.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.211
[RIN] Then it would be best to
meet him on the battlefield,

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.963
not in a Neutral City.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.757
Now, shall we explore?

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.473
[RIN]
Wonderful.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.475
Slot machines are ideal
for a first‐timer

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.143
such as yourself.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.813
[ALICE] Hmm...
Then let's begin with those.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.239
[ALICE] Rin. Is this becoming
of a princess?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.115
[RIN]
Don't worry, my Lady.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.159
The goddess of victory
will smile upon you,

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.828
even when gambling.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.288
Victory. That reminds me.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.790
I need to think ahead.

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.458
I wonder when the
perfect date would be

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.544
for my battle with Iska.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.962
A date?

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.256
I wonder what day
will work best for us.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.216
Let's see, I don't
have much next week

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:42.843
on Mercurday.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.678
Oh, but the stars
show misfortune then,

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.263
which is the last thing
I'd want looming

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.806
over our fight.

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.809
I can pick the next
holiday when I'm free.

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.270
I'll also need to
reserve a venue.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.646
Lady Alice...

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.815
You sound as though you
are planning a wedding,

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.233
not a battle.

00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:00.151
A wedding?!
No, don't be foolish!

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.362
Iska and I? Of course not.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:03.613
[RIN]
Yes. Foolish.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.948
And yet, you're blushing.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.742
[ALICE] Because you just
said something ridiculous!

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.078
[RIN] Perhaps you should
focus on the slots instead.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.041
[ALICE]
She's right.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.502
I probably won't see him
again soon, anyway.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.881
[ISKA] I can't just convert
to your side.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.679
[machine ringing]

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.973
[ALICE]
Huh? Did the machine break?

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.517
[RIN] You won the top
prize on your first try!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.436
You should be far more excited!

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.106
Wait here. I'll find the staff!

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.865
Incredible, you hit the jackpot!

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.366
So cool!

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.369
Is it?
I don't understand this.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.330
If we had this many coins,

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.457
we could easily afford
the Captain's tank.

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.213
Take these.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.884
I'm afraid I don't have need
for this much money.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:07.260
Are you sure?

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.638
Yes, it was meant to be.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.097
Thank you!

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.353
[NENE]
You guys!

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.188
Someone hit a
jackpot over there!

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.648
And she shared her winnings!

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.068
You see, Jhin?

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.155
What'd I say?
The jackpot does exist, huh?

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.532
Just not for you, I guess.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.910
Man, talk about
a generous person.

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.745
Probably an oil tycoon.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.915
[NENE] Mm‐mm.
I didn't get that vibe from her.

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:39.960
She was blonde and
so pretty and elegant.

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.712
She looked more like royalty.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:43.964
No way.

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:04.109
[ALICE]
Rin. What kind of place is this?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.778
[RIN] I'm assuming they
read fortunes inside.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.242
[FORTUNE TELLER]
Welcome, my child.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.703
What would you like
me to tell you?

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.162
[ALICE]
Oh. Um...

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:20.125
Well, there's this boy.
He's a year younger than me.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.752
Ah. Is he your boyfriend?

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.379
Of course he's not!

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.423
Why would you ask that?

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.341
[FORTUNE TELLER]
Are you certain?

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.509
I'm positive.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:34.222
But I'm wondering when and
where I'll see him again.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.558
Like just the two of us.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.476
[FORTUNE TELLER]
The cards will know.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.025
This is definitely an
interesting reading.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:49.112
These cards tell a clear story.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.781
There's no doubt that
the person you're waiting for

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.408
is close by.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.617
Huh?

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.829
[FORTUNE TELLER] In fact, he
will always be near to you.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.374
You are two souls connected
by a powerful bond

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.460
that no ill‐fate can break.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:06.379
Right now is the perfect
time to seek him out

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.964
if that is your wish.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.058
[RIN]
That was fast. How did it go?

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.560
She had a few
plausible predictions.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:24.314
But her interpretations
were mostly quite vague.

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:25.940
[RIN]
That's fortune telling for you.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.528
Well.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.988
Shall we continue on?

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.221
[FORTUNE TELLER] So what would
you like to know, young man?

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.098
[ISKA]
I'm looking for a girl.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.142
Ah? Perhaps she's
your girlfriend?

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.977
It's not that.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.314
[FORTUNE TELLER] What is
her relationship to you then?

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.982
Good question.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.860
We met on the frontline.
Fighting.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.196
It was during a big mission.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.405
[FORTUNE TELLER]
I see.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.825
So this person works with you.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:17.992
Sure.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.204
The next time we met,
it was at an opera house.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.914
Then we ate pasta together.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.416
And later we went
to an art exhibition.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.168
[FORTUNE TELLER]
No need for details.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.838
The cards will tell me
everything of importance

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.464
that I need to know.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.174
A‐ha.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.386
This is definitely an
interesting reading.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.972
These cards tell a clear story.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.391
There's no doubt that
the person you're waiting for

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:42.684
is close by.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.067
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
Thank you for coming, Risya.

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.069
Let me get straight
to the point.

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.321
Do you know about the vortex?

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:56.739
[RISYA]
Yes.

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:59.200
Observation Facility 47
reported one

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.995
just Southwest of Mudor Canyon.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:05.039
But I thought that Nameless
was attending to it already.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.542
[GREAT APOSTLE B] It appears we
need more reinforcements

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.295
if we're to be successful.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.005
Let me guess.

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.507
You mean the Third Division.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.385
[GREAT APOSTLE A] Yes, the
successor of the Black Steel

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:21.514
Gladiator, Crossweil,
would be perfect for this job.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:22.807
[RISYA]
I understand.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.935
You want me to send
Unit N07 there.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:28.563
[GREAT APOSTLE A] We'll leave
the justification to you.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.065
This falls on me because
I'm friends with Mismis.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.234
They won't be happy with this.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:36.654
I guess that means I'll have to
play the villain for nothing.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.281
[GREAT APOSTLE A] Didn't you
reach this position because

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.158
you steeled your heart
and pushed ahead

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.077
of your colleagues?

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.038
I'll do it just this once.

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.000
[MISMIS yawns]

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:54.130
[RISYA] Hi!
Morning, how's my favorite unit?

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:55.506
Hope you're great!

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.051
Sorry to be calling
you so early.

00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:00.762
[MISMIS]
Oh, hi Risya.

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.180
[RISYA]
First thing's first.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.932
Did you happen to read
through the details

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.808
regarding your
upcoming training?

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.019
Yes. All done. Thanks.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.438
Actually, forget all about that.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.232
What?

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.067
[RISYA] This call is to inform
you about another mission

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:15.276
I'm sending you on.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:16.527
It's a higher priority.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:19.697
As I'm sure you're aware,

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.867
our witch and magic problems
started 100 years ago.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.036
That's when a drift of
astral energy created

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.456
what we eventually
started calling a vortex.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:31.084
Without the vortex,
we never would've had

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.752
Grand Witch Nebulis.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.338
And the Sovereignty would
not have been formed.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.798
Now we have an issue.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.842
We've found another vortex.

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:43.096
It'll be a pain if our
enemy gains access to it.

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:46.724
If they did, we could be
facing more powerful witches.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:50.019
Luckily, your unit can
stop that from happening.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.438
We are putting
our full faith in you.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.314
After all,

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.650
you did manage survive
the Ice Calamity Witch

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:56.943
when you faced her.

00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.988
Bye! Good luck out there!

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.251
I forgot to give this back.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.212
[door opens]

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:19.424
[RIN]
Lady Alice, excuse me.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.758
This is important.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.137
A message. It just arrived
from your sister.

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.556
[ALICE]
From Sisbell? What is it?

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:29.350
They've detected a disruption
in astral energy.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.561
Possibly a vortex
in Mudor canyon,

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.896
which is located
southwest of here.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:37.900
The Empire is sending
troops to the location.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.236
How could that be?
We didn't know?

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:41.738
That makes no sense.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:42.989
The Zoas.

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.199
They're intentionally
delaying their report.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.327
Her Majesty just found out.

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:49.787
I'll never understand it.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:53.624
The Lou family.
The Zoas. The Hydras.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:57.462
How can the three royal
families be so at odds?

00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.673
[RIN] Mudor canyon is located
in Zoa's jurisdiction.

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:03.092
It's also close to
the Empire's border

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.928
and Astral forces are
always stationed there.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.057
If they didn't want us
to know about this, then...

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.684
The Zoas want the
vortex for themselves.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:13.770
They won't share its power.

00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:15.396
Correct.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:18.191
All right. I'll attend to this.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.917
Not much of a welcoming
party for a princess.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.460
Did they not know I was coming?

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.506
Stop.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.591
That's close enough,
Masked Lord.

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.516
[ON]
How very impressive.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.644
You've sensed me, Rin. Bravo.

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:57.188
An amateur would have
noticed your presence.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.190
You're not subtle.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.318
What's this about,
Masked Lord? Tell me.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.903
[ON]
Oh, I meant no harm.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.947
Please, think nothing of it.

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:09.158
You see, my astral
power is weak.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.744
I carry a blade as a precaution.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:14.956
You can't be too careful.

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:17.458
So, what brings you here today?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.877
The vortex.
We know about it.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.838
Where's the Zoa family's report?

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.048
[ON] Well there's no
proof that it's a vortex.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.426
It could be a flux in
magma temperatures

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.970
or perhaps a buildup
of underground gas.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.930
Of course, it would
be smart to send

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.433
the troops over,
just to be certain.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:34.475
Yes.

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:37.103
It also would have been
smart to tell the Queen.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.563
Worry not.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:41.858
The head of the family
just left to report to her.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.569
It took a while for us to
prepare the proper documents.

00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:49.198
[ALICE]
Is that so?

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.409
I don't think we're
getting anywhere.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.995
This has been a
waste of my time.

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:57.498
You'd be smart to keep
a low profile, Princess.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.101
[MISMIS]
Whoa.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:24.942
Captain Mismis.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.861
Hey! What's up?

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:30.281
I was wondering, did you report
what happened in Ein?

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.366
[MISMIS] Oh, that.
It was kind of an ordeal.

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.368
The higher‐ups weren't pleased.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.579
"Why don't you have
a recording of the witch?

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.039
Huh? Huh?"

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.957
It was pretty scary.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.042
I'm sorry.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.210
[MISMIS]
Don't worry about it!

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.545
I get in trouble all the
time for report omissions

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:45.755
or mistakes on forms!

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:47.173
I'm used to it.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.427
[MISMIS gasps]
Noro!

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:54.430
Over here! Hi!

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.182
[SHANOROTTE]
Mismis, is that you?

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:57.517
[laughs]

00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:59.769
When did you return
to the Third Division?

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.229
[BOTH giggling]

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.396
Just recently.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.317
Come meet my team.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.153
They're lovely subordinates!

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.696
[SHANOROTTE]
I'm Shanorotte Gregory.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.908
Your captain's a friend.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.869
We met when we were
low‐ranking soldiers.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.871
Although, it doesn't look
like you got any taller

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.831
since then.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.250
I grew two millimeters!

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:25.503
[CAPTAIN A]
Soldiers! Line up!

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.724
That guy's intimidating.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:42.728
That suit.
Cutting‐edge optical camouflage.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.481
He's from the Empire's
Assassination Force.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.441
Saint Disciple of
the eighth seat.

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:48.651
Nameless.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.611
[NAMELESS] Let me start by
telling you that I will not

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:54.031
give specific orders
at this moment.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:57.451
With that understanding,
your missions are as follows.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:04.083
One, to secure the vortex
before the Sovereignty does.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.044
Two, to destroy
the vortex if you fail

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.422
your initial objective.

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:13.217
And three, do not get in my way.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.429
My goal is to crush
the astral power forces.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.681
I will not allow anyone
to stop me.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:19.932
That is all.

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.142
[CAPTAIN A]
You heard him!

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:22.893
Continue searching
for the vortex!

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.356
[JHIN]
From what we understand,

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:30.067
the vortex is a mass
of astral energy.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.277
See anything?

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.947
[MISMIS] Mm‐mm.
Nothing that looks like that.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:36.824
[ISKA] No readings
of astral energy, either.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:50.546
[MISMIS]
Noro? What is it?

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.340
[SHANOROTTE] One of the
units searching the vortex

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.133
is missing in action.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.385
We also lost contact
with two other units

00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:59.305
that went to investigate
their disappearance.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:02.933
Maybe the astral power
force found them?

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.060
[SHANOROTTE]
If that were the case,

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:07.229
there'd be signs of a struggle.
But there's no evidence.

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.899
It's like they just vanished.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.069
Whatever the case is,
we'll return to base.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.821
They probably have
new orders for us.

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:17.615
[NAMELESS]
Forget them.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:21.035
Of our 32 units,
only three are missing.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.120
There's no need to
dispatch a rescue squad

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.331
for so few soldiers.

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:28.793
Continue to focus on
locating the vortex.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.045
[CAPTAIN A]
You heard him. Dismissed!

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.717
He could've at least
given better justification.

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:39.261
I know, what do you make
of his orders, Captain?

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:42.890
Over ten people are missing.
That's real strange.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.601
Is he just going
to abandon them?

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:48.521
I can't say I agree with that.

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.398
Right. I'll ask.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.775
We were both Disciples.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.860
[MISMIS]
Maybe not a good idea!

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:58.781
Excuse me.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.866
Huh? What do you want, boy?

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:03.160
To speak with the commander.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.787
[CAPTAIN A] If this is an
emergency, have your captain

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.080
report.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:07.873
[NAMELESS]
Seems I have an odd guest.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:14.213
I don't remember your name,
but I know I've seen you before.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:15.798
[ISKA]
It's been a year.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.718
[NAMELESS] Ah, yes.
The traitor of the Empire.

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:21.095
You have some nerve,
showing up here.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.139
[ISKA] As a soldier
stationed at this base,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.015
I have a question.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.976
[NAMELESS] You don't
have the appropriate rank

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:32.273
to address me personally, grunt.
Get lost.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:35.443
[MISMIS]
Um, well, if that's the case...

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:36.652
Allow me.

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:38.863
I will happily speak
on his behalf.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.114
If you don't mind.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.699
Captain?

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.576
Sorry, Iska.

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:46.287
I'm gonna have to
take it from here.

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:49.373
At least let me be a
hero off the battlefield.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.877
My name is Mismis, sir.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:56.881
Captain in the Third Division,
and my unit is N07.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.467
I mean no disrespect,
but why are we not

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.761
sending a rescue squad?

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:05.181
[JHIN]
Let me guess.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:09.727
Big Mr. Saint Disciple didn't
say a word in response, huh?

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.396
[NENE] I wonder if there's a
secret op we don't know about.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:15.775
Possibly.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.528
[MISMIS]
That was refreshing!

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.989
Now, where did I put
my glass of juice?

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:26.827
You're short, but at least
your body looks mature.

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.001
No! It's not what you think!

00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:35.669
I didn't mean to come out naked!

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:37.713
I was so nervous about
what happened today,

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:40.007
and the shower got me
relaxed and I just‐‐

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:42.218
I wasn't thinking!

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:44.845
Don't get upset. It's fine.

00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:47.348
[MISMIS]
No one will ever marry me now!

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:49.892
Jhin, you have to
take responsibility!

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.310
[JHIN]
That makes no sense!

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.691
[RIN] Are you sure about
heading to the canyon?

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.487
Yes. I must.

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:03.989
[RIN] Is this an excuse to
seek out that swordsman?

00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:06.408
Of course not!
Iska wouldn't be there.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:11.247
It's simply my duty
as a princess.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:19.797
[ON]
Well... The time has come.

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:24.718
Kissing.
