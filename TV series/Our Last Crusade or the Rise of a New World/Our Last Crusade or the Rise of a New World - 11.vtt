WEBVTT

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:19.645
[SISBELL] It's been a year,
Saint Disciple Iska.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.606
You're the girl from prison.
The one I freed.

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:24.942
Yes, my name is Sisbell.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.612
It happened so fast
I'm honored you remember.

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.405
I do apologize for
breaking into your room

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.865
at such a late hour.

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:33.909
That said, um...

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:38.997
I'm not exactly accustomed
to being treated so roughly.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.123
[ISKA]
Huh?

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.417
[SISBELL] I would appreciate
it if you would get off of me.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.628
Oh, sure, sorry!

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.865
[ALICE]
Wh‐Wh‐Why...

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.700
[RIN] Lady Sisbell must
have been investigating

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.077
the swordsman.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.037
But I can't imagine her motive.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.121
Oh, no!

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.458
Could she have seen the two
of us meet in the neutral city?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.377
What if she used
her astral spirit?

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.462
Please calm down, My Lady.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.172
Your sister has strict limits.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:55.467
She can see for a
300‐meter radius.

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.845
It's impossible that she
witnessed the events in Ein.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.056
Then she might have
heard our conversations

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.599
in the palace.

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:06.311
Despite all of my precautions.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.230
Worst case scenario,

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:11.358
Lady Sisbell suspects you
and the Empire are connected.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:23.578
Iska.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.455
If you don't mind me
calling you that.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.459
I'm truly sorry for letting
myself into your room

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.378
and frightening you.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.879
On a larger note,

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.424
I regret not thanking you
when you freed me.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.758
You were kind.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.886
And I didn't utter a
single word of gratitude.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.513
I must admit...

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:42.681
That night...

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:45.684
I thought the Imperials
were playing a trick on me.

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.562
So please, let me show
you my appreciation now.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.358
I can't accept this.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.610
I didn't save you
expecting a reward.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.408
Later,

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.201
I read about you
in the newspaper.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.247
A direct subordinate of
the Emperor admitted

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.624
to the crime of freeing a witch.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.210
You can imagine how
quickly that story spread,

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.671
even through the
neighboring neutral cities.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.339
Is that why you know my name?

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.632
[SISBELL]
Yes.

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:20.302
And now I'm here
to return the favor.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.387
You lost your status and honor.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.264
Just because you helped me.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:26.600
But I can return it to you.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.977
And guarantee your safety.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.020
Iska!

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.981
Please, would you accompany
me to the Sovereignty?

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.490
What role do you play there?

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:46.119
I live within the palace.
That's all.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.370
Well, then tell me.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.371
Yes?

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.873
Why are you here?

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:55.796
If you're close to the court,
you must have people under you.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.423
[SISBELL]
No. At least, not really.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.842
The truth is,
I can't trust anybody!

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.349
Apologies.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.060
I let my emotions
get the better of me.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.145
I'll come back for your answer.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.814
I'm glad that I saw you.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.334
[ISKA]
Well, this is great.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.216
[RIN]
Your Majesty.

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.760
We could not find anything.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.136
Understood.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.681
[RIN] However, I would
like to offer a plan.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:48.849
What is it?

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.353
It's simple.
Reunite these sisters.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.024
Lady Sisbell is on a mission
in a foreign nation.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.485
She cannot retreat to her
bedroom and lock herself away,

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.905
hiding her feelings
and concerns.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:07.033
If My Lady talks to her alone,
far from this palace,

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.618
she may confide in her.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.245
As sisters are wont to do.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.419
Alice. Could I ask that of you?

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.297
[ALICE]
Yes, Mother!

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.798
Rin. Arrange it.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.924
Ma'am.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:29.014
[ALICE]
Sisbell. What is this?

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.265
What are you up to?

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.731
[SISBELL] Why do I feel like I
have no idea what I'm doing?

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:40.108
It is so unlike me.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.694
I've imagined this
scenario so many times.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.990
I'll try again.

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.825
I will not give up on you.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.418
[GREAT APOSTLE B] We received
new intel from our ally.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.419
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
Oh?

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.213
A purebred witch is in
the independent nation.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:06.051
Not only that, she's a
daughter of Queen Nebulis.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.510
[F GREAT APOSTLE A]
Alone?

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.512
[GREAT APOSTLE B]
She took only one servant.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:13.099
Without guards,
she's practically helpless.

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.602
[F GREAT APOSTLE A]
What does our ally say?

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:17.896
[GREAT APOSTLE B] That they'll
hand her over to the Empire.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.189
[GREAT APOSTLE C]
What?

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.732
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
Is that true?

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.943
[F GREAT APOSTLE A]
This is a splendid day.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:25.987
Capturing a purebred
is our primary goal.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.906
We must not fail.

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.991
[GREAT APOSTLE A] Shall we
deploy the Object, then?

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:31.576
[GREAT APOSTLE B] That weapon
cannot be tied back to us,

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.827
after all.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.498
[F GREAT APOSTLE A]
And nothing can stop it.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.002
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
Let the witch hunt begin.

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.843
[MISMIS]
This is the life!

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.596
What a treat to have
barbecue for breakfast.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.306
When we were still
in the Empire‐‐

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.100
Stop talking and help, Boss.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.977
Sure thing, I'll grill the meat!

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.812
[NENE]
No, wait! Not yet!

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:02.482
You have to start with veggies
that take longer to cook.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.733
Here. These.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:06.861
[MISMIS] Aww!
Come on, don't spoil the fun!

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.322
A little meat for
an appetizer is fine.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.448
Right, Iska?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.575
Veggies first. Right, Iska?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.334
[NENE]
Someone's distracted.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.425
[MASKED LORD] Thank you
for joining me, Elletear.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:32.512
Now then.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.848
I've been thinking
about what you said.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.599
It would help if
you told me more.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.980
I'm afraid the ones trying to
get in touch with the Empire...

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.361
...are my darling sisters.

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:54.409
[laughing]

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.244
[MASKED LORD]
You must excuse me.

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:59.581
I was not expecting those words
to come out of your mouth.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.000
Coming to me with such
a scandal puts your family

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:04.044
in a bad light.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:08.006
Are you certain you want
to continue this conversation?

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.884
Yes. Our nation is at stake.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.636
The Sovereignty is far more
important than the election.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.766
I agree.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.976
Consider me at your service.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.604
How can I be of assistance?

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:26.232
If my sisters are planning
to betray our people,

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:29.152
I must put a stop
to their schemes.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.654
However, when the time comes,

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:35.075
I may not be able to do what
is necessary to stop them.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:39.120
I fear that my feelings might
get in the way of my duty.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.914
Which is why...

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.457
You need a judge.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.460
Someone without your attachments
who'll take necessary action.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.383
Breathe, my dear.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.928
It must've been difficult
carrying this weight.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.846
You have my word.

00:09:56.888 --> 00:10:00.225
I'll see to it that
the truth is uncovered.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.976
Thank you.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.562
Please take good
care of my sisters.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.732
Rest easy knowing that
you made the right decision.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.234
I will not fail.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.282
[GUIDE] Desert creatures
have gone through considerable

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.243
evolutions to survive
the harsh environment

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.911
of this area.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.330
And the reigning king
of the food chain here?

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.832
I bet you can guess.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.876
That huge beast,
the basilisk.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.712
[ALICE] It's been years since
I travelled without Rin.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.673
[GUIDE] Even if we do
encounter one today,

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.258
we have a specialized
hunter on board

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.592
to protect us.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.927
[PASSENGERS gasp]

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:45.728
[GUIDE] Uh, we're terribly
sorry about that.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.522
A flat tire?

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.357
I've spotted some
large footprints.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.775
Let me investigate.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.449
[GUIDE]
Excuse me, Miss!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.784
You shouldn't leave!

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:07.417
[ALICE]
Not a basilisk.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.464
That smells like oil.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.806
I've a bad feeling about this.

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:33.610
Where's this new hotel?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.445
Are we getting close yet?

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:38.698
I'm so tired I can barely
take another step.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.325
It's just up ahead.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.452
Ugh. I would've been
fine staying at

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:44.537
the same place again.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.165
But if you think it's smart
to change rooms,

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.626
then I guess
I'll trust you, Iska.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.544
I'm thinking of the budget.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.463
Once you get outta downtown,

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:57.258
you can stay at a nice
hotel for less money.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.136
Mostly I'm worried that girl
will show up again, though.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.934
I don't want everyone
else involved.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.188
[NENE]
Hold on a sec, Captain.

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:12.857
Let me fix this.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.238
Oh, no! I forgot.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.032
We have to figure out
what to do with my crest.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.533
I doubt you'll
solve the problem,

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.952
so focus on having fun.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.787
Stop being so mean!

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.997
We've brainstormed
but got nowhere.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.250
Let's not worry for now.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.418
We'll come back with fresh eyes.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.421
Maybe then we'll think of
something we missed before.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.257
We still have 60 days.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.926
Yeah.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.430
But, if you're still concerned,

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:46.933
I guess we can go
over to the market.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.476
And buy what?

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.353
Remember where we are.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.855
They sell all kinds
of goods in this city.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.650
Things we don't have.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.902
You mean they have
stuff from the Sovereignty

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:00.029
that might help.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:03.116
Yeah, just like the
sticker Shanorotte had.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.788
We'll buy the same thing.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.083
It may have technically
been created by our enemies.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.584
But we can utilize it.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.795
[MISMIS] I knew you'd come
up with something!

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.548
Great! We'll hit the big
market tomorrow morning!

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:27.974
[ISKA]
Ta‐dah!

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.979
Right. I'll go exchange
currency so we can shop.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.731
You guys can relax.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:37.817
It'll be dinner time soon,
so make sure you hurry back!

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.110
Roger, Captain.

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:43.614
Iska. Your bags?

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.159
[ISKA]
Oh. Thanks.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.638
No sign.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:11.225
[SISBELL]
Good evening, Iska.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.898
[ISKA] What kind of
magic trick did you use?

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:20.401
I told you I would
return to talk.

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:23.363
I won't be giving up on you.

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:24.739
Okay.

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.449
Let's find somewhere quiet.

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:40.338
I didn't decide to change
hotels until today.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.382
But you found me.

00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:44.342
How's it possible you
knew where I was?

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:49.639
Is this related to
your astral spirit?

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.140
Yes, you're exactly right.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:59.482
My astral spirit has the
ability to display the past,

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.110
as if someone filmed it.

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.196
Today around noon,
you called the new hotel.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.448
I saw and heard as you
repeated the room numbers

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.118
and asked when
you could check in.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.162
It was simple enough
for me to replay.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.664
[ISKA]
That's something.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:18.793
A rare astral spirit that
interferes with space and time.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.170
Seems like pretty crucial intel.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:24.715
You sure it's okay to be giving
it to an Imperial soldier?

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:27.510
It is my way of extending trust.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:31.431
When we spoke yesterday,
I wasn't honest about something.

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:32.640
You lied?

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.729
My name is Sisbell Lou
Nebulis the Ninth.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.857
A possible successor
to the throne.

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:46.821
[ISKA]
Nebulis? She's Alice's sister!

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:49.031
You don't believe me.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:52.201
No, I do.
Which is why I'm so surprised.

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:54.704
And also even more confused.

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:56.330
You're the Queen's daughter.

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.374
What would you
really want from me?

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.460
And why?

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:02.211
One of the Founder's
descendants is plotting

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.464
against our people.

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.716
They plan to take
my mother's life.

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:11.137
Hold on.
But you're all royal blood.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.931
Yes. But this person does
not intend to uphold

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.142
the status quo of our nation.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.060
They seek something disastrous,

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:21.898
further bloodshed
and destruction.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.150
Understand that
if the queen dies,

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:27.862
then a full‐scale war will be
waged against the Empire.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.117
[ISKA]
We'd annihilate each other.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.952
[SISBELL]
That's their plan.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.455
To drag the Sovereignty
into war and eliminate

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:40.958
the royal family in the
midst of the confusion.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.002
[ISKA]
They're after you, too?

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.295
[SISBELL]
Yes.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:48.216
I was able to learn of this
plot with my astral power.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:49.634
The thing is...

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:52.887
I can't be sure
who's behind this.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.306
That's why I can't bring
myself to trust anyone

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:56.724
in the palace.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.771
Iska. I need you!

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.190
You're the only
one who can help!

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:06.734
Do you wish for so many to die?

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.486
For a future in which
both the Empire

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.530
and the Sovereignty
are wiped away?

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.907
Is that the doomsday
you want to see?

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:15.660
No way.

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:18.120
Then the choice
before you is obvious!

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:21.082
Come to the Sovereignty
and be my protector!

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:25.002
If I can end this plot,
we can avoid that scenario!

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.964
I won't ask you to betray
the Empire in spirit.

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.423
But nevertheless...

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.509
I want you to change the future!

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.142
[ALICE]
I'm behind schedule.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.520
It took far too long
to get here.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.481
This should be the
hotel my sister's at.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:46.857
[SCHWARTZ]
Lady Alice?

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:52.321
[SCHWARTZ]
I was right! It is you.

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:53.990
Thank goodness.

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.199
Oh. Schwartz!

00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:59.328
Fancy meeting you here.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.871
Please, tell me.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.540
Have you seen Lady Sisbell?

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:03.833
[ALICE]
Huh?

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.835
She went off on her own
saying she had a task

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.086
to complete.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.713
But she's not back.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.215
And I'm afraid I can't
find her anywhere.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:22.810
[ISKA]
I see your point.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.770
And I absolutely don't
want an outright war

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:27.064
between our two nations.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.275
[SISBELL]
I knew you would understand.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.944
[ISKA] But I'm afraid
I can't go with you.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:35.865
What do you mean?

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.533
I told you, if the Queen dies,

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.243
all of the Sovereignty
will fall into the hands

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.120
of a vile traitor.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.331
The entire world,
even the neutral nations,

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:45.958
would become a fiery
warzone overnight.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.793
We have to stop that.

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:51.797
[ISKA]
This is where you and I differ.

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:54.634
I obviously want
to avoid this war.

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.177
But that's not all.

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.679
I want to resolve
the 100‐year‐conflict.

00:18:58.721 --> 00:18:59.805
Completely.

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:01.682
But how can you?

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:04.060
[ISKA]
Peace negotiations.

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.061
You're wrong!

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.896
We can't forgive the
Empire for everything

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:08.439
they've done to us.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.817
You tortured and killed
our kind; it's inconceivable.

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.778
You may think that.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:16.447
But it's still the
ultimate goal I fight for.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.248
[ISKA] It's not just me.
There's someone else.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.752
Someone within the Sovereignty
that you can rely on.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.922
[MASKED LORD]
How disappointing.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.174
This must be such a
heart‐wrenching outcome

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:38.803
for you, Lady Sisbell. A pity.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.096
[SISBELL]
Masked Lord?

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:41.639
Why are you here?

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.809
[MASKED LORD] What, a noble
can't take a vacation to escape

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.937
the hustle and bustle
of everyday life?

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.563
There's nothing odd with that.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:55.486
[ISKA] He's the one who kicked
our Captain into the vortex.

00:19:57.905 --> 00:20:01.909
[MASKED LORD]
What is strange is you, Sisbell.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.078
Who is the boy
standing next to you?

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.788
[SISBELL]
A stranger.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.581
[MASKED LORD]
Don't bother lying.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:10.418
I've had an unfortunate run‐in
with that Imperial soldier

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:11.961
in the past.

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:15.506
The queen will be devastated
to learn of this.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.551
Her precious daughter is
scheming with the Empire.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.469
You jump to conclusions!

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.470
Trust me.

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:23.889
I'm not the one who's
betrayed the Sovereignty.

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.141
In fact,

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:28.477
I'm trying to save
the integrity of our nation!

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:30.438
You speak nothing but lies.

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.613
[SISBELL] So that's
what you're doing here.

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.699
The Zoas don't care
about the truth,

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.451
as long as they have
supposed evidence

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:46.120
that will gain them an
upper hand in the election.

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:48.497
Coward.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:51.709
You're free to assume
what you like, I suppose.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.586
I'm taking you in.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.463
On suspicion of treason.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:57.423
Your family will be mortified.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.095
[MASKED LORD]
Oh?

00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:05.389
You certainly are the queen's
daughter if you still

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.308
have the will to resist.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:09.268
Be a dear and give up quietly.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.021
Go.

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:17.443
[ISKA]
Masked Lord, was it?

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.570
Aren't you on the same side?

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.364
[MASKED LORD]
A traitor deserves no mercy.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.992
Especially one connected
to an Imperial soldier

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:27.036
like you.

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:29.663
[ISKA] You're not interested
in her reasoning?

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:31.582
[MASKED LORD]
It doesn't matter.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:35.419
Betraying the Sovereignty
is a crime like no other.

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:38.339
Now, I'm going to
ask you to disappear.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.803
My grand game
is almost complete.

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.504
[ISKA]
It can't be.
