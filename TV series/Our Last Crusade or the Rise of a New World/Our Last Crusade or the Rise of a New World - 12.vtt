00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.063
An Imperial robot? No way.

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:27.444
What an unfortunate guest.
No matter.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:28.695
Arrest Sisbell!

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.114
Stop!

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:35.452
I will deal with you.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.295
[MASKED LORD] You're far
too weak to stop me alone.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:48.298
Sisbell won't escape this city.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.259
[ISKA]
She's part of the royal family.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.760
Don't you think she must
have a good reason

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:55.013
to risk talking to
an Imperial soldier?

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.140
[MASKED LORD]
Her motives are irrelevant.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.476
As a princess,
any unapproved communication

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:01.603
with an enemy like you
is against the rules

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.438
of the Sovereignty.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.941
Such a crime will
surely dethrone her.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.068
[gunshot]

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.488
[JHIN] I'd say it's also
criminal to make so much noise

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.365
at night.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.033
You're disturbing the peace.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.285
Stand down.

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:27.296
[ISKA]
Jhin?

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:30.257
[JHIN] I could tell something
had you preoccupied.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.010
Didn't expect to find you
with thugs, though.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:33.927
[MISMIS]
I know him!

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.887
He kicked me into the vortex!

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.973
[MASKED LORD]
Hello there, Captain.

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.558
You appear to be well.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.268
[MISMIS]
What are you doing here?

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.854
[MASKED LORD] Unfortunately,
I have pressing concerns

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.439
to attend to.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.608
There's no time for chit chat.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.321
[NENE]
Is that Object?

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.031
Why would the Empire
choose to deploy its

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.574
experimental weapon?

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.409

Six witches observed.

Iska! It picked up on the
Captain's astral crest!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.216
Crap.

Ignore the machine!

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.021
Bring Sisbell to me
and we're gone.

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:27.898
[OBJECT] Obstacles will
now be eliminated.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.596
[MASKED LORD] I could not
have foreseen this fight.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:01.723
But I can spin it
to work in our favor.

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:10.440
Not one more step.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.819
Is this necessary?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.904
We're only here to arrest
someone who betrayed

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:17.406
our people.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.700
Why would you make
moves to protect her?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.535
[JHIN]
I don't care about that.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.912
All that matters to me
is that you kicked our boss

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:25.914
into an astral vortex.

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:28.417
For that reason alone,
I plan to pummel you.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.336
Kill them.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.052
Lost his cool pretty fast, huh?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:42.931
He's crazy!

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:44.766
This isn't a battlefield.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.768
It's an independent nation!

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.520
Not to worry, dear.

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:51.523
The losing side will take
the blame for any damage.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.446
Remember that as you
take your last breaths.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.374
[ISKA]
Are you okay?

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.792
[SISBELL]
Iska?

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:15.172
Not good. We can't let it
send back any data.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.382
See if you can buy me some time.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.508
[ISKA]
Roger that!

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:24.514
It's strong!

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.043
[ISKA]
I'm gonna take it out.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.377
Stay back.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.838
Why are you suddenly
helping me now?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.632
You said you
couldn't be my ally!

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.717
Did you change your mind?

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.385
I have my own reasons.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.846
There's stuff I didn't
get around to telling you.

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:05.931
But know this.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.891
I don't plan on giving
you up to the robot

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.309
or Masked Lord!

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:20.904
[SISBELL]
Iska, this isn't fair.

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:23.949
If you show me such kindness...

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.617
...how do I pay you back?

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.120
Nene!

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.789
[NENE] I've got the
coordinates entered!

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.332

Piercing Shot!

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:51.268
That sounded like Nene's work.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.602
Yeah.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.271
We need to hurry up and regroup.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.564
That'd be wise.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.233
But you'll never make it.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.743
You must not know
of my astral power.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.788
[JHIN grunts]

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.501
So much for that trigger finger.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.337
I don't need it!

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.088
[MASKED LORD]
What?

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.172
[gunshot]

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.142
I admire your quick thinking.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:36.104
However, the tides still
haven't turned in your favor.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.649
The evidence to prosecute
Sisbell is likely lost,

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.236
but fortune continues
to smile upon me.

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.280
[JHIN grunts]

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:46.531
You all right?

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:01.880
That's gasoline!

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:04.466
[MASKED LORD] One hundred
years ago, our great founder

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.051

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.428
Consider this a reenactment.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.430
An avenging sea of flames.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.349

your astral fire art.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.321
Hold on.
What is this wind?

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.290
I see. The irony.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:41.419
An Imperial soldier gained
power from the vortex.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.172
You'll make an excellent
research subject.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.133
[JHIN]
Shut it.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:50.595
Don't you dare violate our boss
with your disgusting ideas.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:54.933
[MASKED LORD]
Hmm, well...

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.643
Time to be on my way.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:00.146
This pursuit is no longer
worth the rewards.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.357
It was a fun evening.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.984
I'll see you again soon.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.245
Did you destroy the beast?

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:18.331

I'm not sure but I don't
think it's using fuel

You're going down!

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.752
[ALICE]
Ice Calamity!

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:34.087
Flooding Snow Lights!

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:43.680
[ISKA]
Alice?

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.558
Why're you here?

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.978
I could ask you the same thing.

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:54.232
Give me back my sister!

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.449
Ice Vines!

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:09.789
Icicles!

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.584
Iska!

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:14.669
[ISKA]
Right!

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.050
[ISKA grunts]

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.971
How'd it do that?

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.188
[ISKA] Do you have
any idea what this is?

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.110
A spirit.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.155
[ISKA] If that's the case,
what does the Empire plan

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:43.406
to do with it?

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.504
Quick! Blossom!

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.423
[ALICE]
What are you talking about?

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.799
That's my shield.

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:04.927
[ISKA]
Now!

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.308
Ice, bloom forth!

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.694
[ASTRAL SPIRIT]
So lu reinen xel.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.738
Is it speaking?

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.323
A spirit's language.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:28.534
[ASTRAL SPIRIT]
Elmei shel feo mielles.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.010
It's going to level the city!

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.847
Iska.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.350
I still want us
to fight each other.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.602
But... Now's not the time.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.148
[ALICE] This wanton
destruction is meaningless.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.984
It is not the future
I strive for.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.821
[ISKA]
You know I'm battling for peace.

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:07.407
For one night, we'll join hands.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.748
[ISKA]
Let's do this!

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.671
[ASTRAL SPIRIT]
Ris sia sohia ahz cia r‐teo.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.426
Pierce through!

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:34.809
Wall!

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.693
[ALICE]
Ice Calamity.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:44.819
[ISKA]
Stars.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:50.700
[ASTRfAL SPIRIT]
Ez xiss clar lefmihas xel.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.329
Fans and Swords Dance!

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:57.582
Awaken!

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.484
Now you're finished!

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.990
[GREAT APOSTLE A] We've lost
contact with the Object.

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.826
[GREAT APOSTLE B]
An unexpected setback.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.287
It seems we must pay more
mind to the Successor

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:19.747
of the Black Steel.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:24.877
[GREAT APOSTLE A] For now,
we move to the next stage.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:38.724
Thanks for your help.

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.104
[ALICE gasps]

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.730
Nope. So wrong.

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:48.776
What am I saying?
You're my sworn enemy.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:51.195
We should be fighting
against each other, not with.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.863
[ISKA]
You make it sound so bad.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.323
[ALICE]
Because it's the truth!

00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:57.368
Our rivalry is not going
to settle itself, you know!

00:17:58.578 --> 00:17:59.870
[SISBELL]
Is that you?

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.915
Sisbell.
Tell me you're not hurt!

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.966
‐‐[SISBELL] Sister.
‐‐Yes?

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.385
You know this soldier,
don't you?

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.512
Huh?

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:19.307
[SISBELL] To be honest,
I've been trying to figure out

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.767
what your relationship is
to him for a good while now.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.026
Well, I guess‐‐

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:32.862
Wrong. I've no idea who he is.

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.238
What?

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.074
Oh, come on!
There's no use lying.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.076
It's the truth. Isn't it?

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:45.916
Oh. Yeah. Right.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.878
I have no clue who
she is either. Heh...

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.633
Interesting.

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:55.593
You're trying to tell me
you're complete strangers‐‐

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.345
not even acquaintances?

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:58.929
Correct.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.306
That's perfect.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.349
[ISKA, ALICE]
Hm?

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.935
[SISBELL]
I've come to a conclusion!

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.271
You're my knight!

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:08.564
Promise. Please.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:11.567
That you'll always protect
Sisbell Lou Nebulis the Ninth.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.402
The future queen!

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:15.613
Huh? No. Wait a sec.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.573
What are you going on about?

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.700
This has nothing
to do with you, Sister.

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:22.828
She can't just recruit you!

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.288
Tell her "no."

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.956
This is so weird.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.584
[NENE]
Iska!

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:32.421
[MISMIS]
Hello? Where are you?

00:19:32.463 --> 00:19:33.881
My friends are calling me.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.883
I should, uh, probably go.
See ya!

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.595
[ALICE]
You're leaving?

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:40.846
Iska!

00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.140
I will never give up on you!

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.767
You have my word!

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.167
[RISYA] Well, that was
certainly a night.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.421
The experimental weapon
met an unexpected opponent.

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.673
My Issy is full of surprises.

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:19.468
[NAMELESS] Hm...
Where is the Emperor?

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.179
[RISYA]
Who knows?

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.723
It's been a while since he left.

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:25.307
I'm sure he's enjoying himself.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:30.229
Also, I have a feeling
a secret or two

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.106
are about to come to light.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.785
I've not felt such
tranquility in some time.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.331
Imperial swordsman.

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:51.625
I've grown bored of this world,

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.669
but you managed to intrigue me.

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:01.635
Huh? What could that be?

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:06.974
This energy.

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:10.186
I didn't think you'd come
see me in the open.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:13.105
Show yourself!
Emperor Yunmelngen!

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.400
[YUNMELNGEN]
Hi.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.278
I have something fun
to share with you.

00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:31.624
Welcome home, Uncle.

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:33.542
Thank you, dear Kissing.

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:36.921
It was quite an
inspired excursion.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.589
Good for me?

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:40.549
Have no fear.

00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.593
Let's prepare you
for the election.

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:51.393
[ELLETEAR]
You called for me, My Queen?

00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:53.938
[MILLAVAIR] I apologize for
summoning you here.

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:56.232
But I have an
important question.

00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:57.566
[ELLETEAR]
What is it?

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.610
[MILLAVAIR] It was you who
leaked intel about Sisbell's

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.154
foreign travels, am I wrong?

00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:07.910
And there's one other thing.

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:12.122
Are you even the real Elletear?

00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:21.215
My Lady.

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.314
It makes no sense.

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:40.025
Why do we keep on
meeting like this?

00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:42.194
I have no idea either.

00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:43.487
Listen up.

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:44.989
You have to pretend
you don't know me

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.032
in front of people
from the Sovereignty.

00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:50.244
That includes my little sister.

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:51.704
I got it.

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:55.749
You know what?
This is actually exciting.

00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:57.835
We have a shared secret.

00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:00.337
Sounds like you're
enjoying this.

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:02.089
You are sorely mistaken,
you fool!

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.156
Right, then.

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.075
See you when I do.
