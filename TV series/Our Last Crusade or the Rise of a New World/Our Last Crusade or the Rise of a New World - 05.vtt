WEBVTT

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:19.019
[M MAGE A gasps]

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:20.771
It's Lady Aliceliese!

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.314
Greetings, my lady.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:24.483
What brings you out here?

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.902
[ALICE] I had some business
in the neighborhood.

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:28.195
[M MAGE A]
Wait, please!

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:29.696
This area is off limits!

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:41.917
[ALICE]
It's the vortex.

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:43.919
[RIN]
Yes. There's no mistaking it.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.758
[ON] Oh, it's only you two,
what a relief.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.301
So, Masked Lord.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:53.679
Do you plan to keep
this for yourself?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.723
Of course not. I'd never.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.477
As I said, we only just
confirmed our findings.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:01.895
Yes, in fact...

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.605
We were just about
to report the finding

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:05.023
to Her Majesty.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.987
Ah. What perfect timing.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.364
Kissing, my dear,
please join us.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.756
Come now, Kissing.

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:54.508
Alice is your relative.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.260
You don't remember?

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.971
Ah, well, it can't be helped.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.766
You were so little back then.

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:04.726
Anyway, Alice.

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.645
Don't worry about the vortex.

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.480
I shall defend it well.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.440
[ALICE] Are you implying
she alone can stop

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.651
the Imperial Army's attack?

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.529
I believe her talent could
surpass even yours.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.698
No disrespect, of course.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.741
I didn't intend to cast
doubt upon the Zoa's

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.326
treasured child.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.162
But still, there's the matter
of the vortex's power.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.081
What does your family
plan to do with it?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.585
Do you wish to engage
in an all‐out war

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.587
with the Empire?

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.173
Of course! Don't we all?

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.092
It's what every astral
mage has wanted

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:39.136
for the last century!

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.517
[MISMIS]
Say that again, Nene?

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.519
Did I really hear that
there are astral power

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.020
readings from the base?

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.815
HQ's analyzing it now,
but they do know

00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:54.192
that it's different
from the vortex.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.902
[ISKA]
Could it be from an astral art?

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.279
[beeping]

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.367
Unit N07. Mismis.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.828
Huh? Right. Understood.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.707
HQ confirmed the readings
from the base.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.917
They were from an astral art.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.544
So that means the
astral power forces

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.671
have infiltrated our base.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.923
I bet they kidnapped
those units.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.384
Who knows if we'll
ever find them.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.136
Do we have our orders?

00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:23.263
As of right now,
they're closing ranks,

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.098
which means moving all
of the important stuff

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.558
to a closer base.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.560
As for us, we're supposed
to keep searching

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.187
for the vortex.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.772
What else, Nene?

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.148
Well, a reading.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.066
There's a power source nearby.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.903
We'll search the area
with a fine‐toothed comb.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.446
Boss, you lead.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.448
Oh, yes, of course.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.075
Um, that way!

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.042
It's astral light!

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.710
Over 2,000 lunas!

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.004
Nice, Captain! We found it!

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.715
That's gotta be
the vortex, you guys!

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:01.593
So that means we're the unit
that made the discovery?

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.428
We might get commended for this!

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.849
Hate to break it to you,
but it looks like

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.018
we aren't the first
ones here, after all.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.240
Oh, good, it's Noro's unit!

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.366
[laughs]

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.494
Hey, Mismis!

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:30.038
Did you see the light
from the vortex just now?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.248
I did!

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:33.959
How unfortunate.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.252
[MISMIS]
Huh?

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.755
A good while before
you guys spotted it,

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.966
the Sovereignty set up
a wicked little trap

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.051
in the bottom of the canyon.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.387
Our plan was to capture
any Imperial troops

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.972
headed this way.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.349
Looks like it worked!

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.684
[MISMIS gasps]

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.852
Captain!

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.728
Stay right where you are!

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.737
[NENE]
She's a witch!

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:03.947
[SHANOROTTE]
That's right!

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.533
I am what you mongrels
call a witch!

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:08.952
Along with every other
soldier in my unit!

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.582
No way. Who are you?

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.917
What have you done
with the real Noro?

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.128
Haven't you been
listening to me?

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.964
You're even stupider
than I thought.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:24.009
But your idiocy's
what I love about you.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.720
The real Shanorotte Gregory
was born and raised

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.722
in the Nebulis Sovereignty.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.807
From our very first meeting,

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.434
you've been acquainted
with a mage,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.060
the one and only "Noro."

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:40.984
[NAMELESS]
Out of my way.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.864
Fifth Division Unit 004.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:47.365
You will now be prosecuted.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:56.583
[NAMELESS] Filthy witches,
sneaking into the Empire.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.543
I'll handle her.
You stay back.

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.796
Hi, Nameless.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.215
[NAMELESS] Did you really think
I wouldn't notice a traitor

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.051
within our ranks?

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.636
Oh, that's right.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.429
Big, Bad Mister Saint
Disciple is from

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:12.015
the Assassination Force!

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.850
But I can't afford
to be captured here,

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.436
so I'll take my leave.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:17.812
[NAMELESS]
You will be prosecuted.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.333
‐‐Jhin!
‐‐On it!

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:49.177
[NAMELESS] Soldier,
have you lost your mind?

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.595
[ISKA]
You forced me.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.846
You were going
to hit Shanorotte

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.015
and our captain, too.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.893
[NAMELESS] Insubordination
against a commander?

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.937
Do you want to go
back to prison?

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.563
[JHIN]
Saint Disciple, sir.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:03.024
Don't you think we
should be tracking them?

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.193
We have a pretty good idea
where they're going.

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:09.280
[NAMELESS]
Your mission remains unchanged.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.409
We can't allow the vortex
to fall into enemy hands.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.743
[JHIN]
You serious?

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.286
[NAMELESS]
Once I return to base,

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.330
we'll bomb their
whole operation.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.750
They'll be annihilated, and that
will be the end of that.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:38.184
[ON] It doesn't appear to be
as large as I expected.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.104
[ALICE] Since we're dealing with
a smaller than normal vortex,

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.857
the reality is, only
a few mages could reap

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.192
the benefits, even if
they jumped in.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.277
[ON]
Yes.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:50.613
One or two could gain a little
strength, but no more.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:54.159
Alas, it would be of no use,
the astral energy'd be spent.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.000
[F COMMANDER A] My Lord, comrade
Shanorotte has returned.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:08.840
[ON]
Ah. What've we here?

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.176
You've captured
an Imperial soldier!

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.343
Excellent work.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.720
[SHANOROTTE]
I'm honored, My Lord.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.641
[MISMIS]
Huh?

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:19.809
What?

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.315
[ALICE]
This isn't good.

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.192
No one knows about
my meetings with Iska

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.277
in the Neutral City!

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:30.570
Hold on.

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.197
I think I've seen you before.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.449
[ALICE]
No! You must be mistaken.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.035
Oh! That's right!

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.203
I remember!

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.621
You're the girl Iska‐‐

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.794
How could you be so careless?

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.547
Even bound, an enemy
soldier shouldn't be here.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.424
[SHANOROTTE]
Yes. My apologies!

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.845
Thanks. That was close.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:59.015
Yes, but what are
the odds of this?

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.226
The captain and the swordsman.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.894
I simply can't believe
how many times

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.270
they've stood in our way.

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.316
I believe we've hit the jackpot!

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.359
[RIN]
We have?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.777
Comrade Shanorotte.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.529
I'll take it from here.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.573
All I need is the location of
the Imperial Army's camp.

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.330
[RIN] Lady Alice,
what's your plan, exactly?

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.499
[ALICE] This is my
one‐in‐a‐million chance!

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.460
I may not get another
opportunity to fight Iska!

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:28.419
[RIN]
What?

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.297
Lady Alice, have you
lost your mind?

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.715
Quite the opposite, actually.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.178
I'm coming for you, Iska!

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:52.485
[NENE]
Footprints!

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.782
[JHIN] The tracker's pointing
right at the vortex's location.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.035
They must have taken Boss there.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.537
[NENE] We've only got
two more hours before

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.621
they launch a missile.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:08.543
‐‐Damn.
‐‐There it goes!

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.753
A short‐distance missile
from our base!

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.797
I guess they decided
to launch early.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.215
When's the next?

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.509
In 30...

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.636
...maybe 20 minutes.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.138
And based on the
ballistics data they got

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.224
from that one, their
accuracy's gonna improve.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:24.475
[ISKA]
There's no time.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.685
Let's move.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:28.855
Don't panic!

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.316
We knew the Empire
was going to bomb us.

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.860
All troops!
Retreat to the second base!

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:50.168
Noro, please, stop this.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.004
Oh, don't look at me with
those sad puppy dog eyes.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.798
It just makes me want to yank
your leash harder.

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.680
I'm taking our captain back.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.224
I don't think so, soldier!

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.103
You stopped my lightning?

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.688
How dare, you, scum!

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:13.983
[SHANOROTTE]
Impossible!

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.026
[KISSING]
Th‐‐

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.029
Th‐‐

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.660
Thorns... hurt.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.578
[SHANOROTTE]
Lady Kissing!

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.206
Does this mean you're swooping
in to lend me your aid?

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:31.876
Come Thorns.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.341
Eliminate.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.229
[KISSING]
Elimination complete.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.855
See, Uncle?

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:56.859
My first mission complete.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.947
Oh, Lady Kissing,
you're amazing!

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.825
It's clear you truly carry
the Founder's blood!

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.078
[KISSING]
Imperial soldiers.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.663
Eliminate.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.206
Those are my orders.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.920
[ISKA]
Get behind me, Captain.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.422
But Iska!

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.132
She's a purebred.

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.300
And a powerful one.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.068
[ALICE] Don't you think it's
odd that no one's home?

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:42.697
Lady Alice!

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.783
[ALICE]
Rin!

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.036
[NAMELESS]
Good instincts.

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.332
A Saint Disciple. Be careful.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:54.083
An Optical camouflage suit.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.793
I've heard all about you.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.920
"Nameless," is it?

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.340
[NAMELESS] I see you got
intel from Shanorotte.

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:01.674
[ALICE]
Pleased to meet you.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:04.969
Forgive my abruptness,
but I'm extremely upset.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.471
[NAMELESS]
About what?

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.765
[ALICE] Why, about you
injuring Rin, of course.

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:10.600
And the circumstances
which caused me

00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:12.852
to just miss someone with
whom I have business.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.604
Bad luck, surely.

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:15.521
Anyway.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:19.567
I hope you won't mind if I take
all my anger out on you.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.662
He avoided my attack?

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:38.711
Become a star.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.464
Random attack?

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:58.272
[KISSING]
This is unexpected.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.899
A strong opponent.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.984
Saint Disciple.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:05.238
Liberate my ability. Recombine.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.660
[ISKA]
She can regenerate objects?

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.161
[KISSING]
Imperial soldier.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.496
Disappear.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.094
Ice Calamity.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.512
Thousand Thorn Blizzard!

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:33.808
Pierce through!

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.976
[NAMELESS]
Too slow.

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:40.648
This can't be!

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.817
[NAMELESS]
Allow me to return the favor.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.199
Apologies for overstepping.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.451
Not at all.

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:52.660
I am grateful.

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:57.457
[NAMELESS]
Oh? Did I kill your bravado?

00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:59.459
[ALICE]
Forgive my impertinence.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.295
Saint Disciple of the
eighth seat, Nameless.

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:05.381
I had my doubts about
your strength.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.301
Allow me to express
my sincerest apologies.

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.639
Now I'll show you my true power.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.397
Great Ice Calamity.

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.917
[RIN]
It seems he got away.

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:46.714
[ALICE]
Let's go back.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:48.216
What a waste of time.

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:55.723
Was that near the vortex?

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.945
[KISSING]
Elimination complete.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.324
[ISKA]
Oh? Who did you eliminate?

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.786
He's okay!

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.120
What happened?

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.372
How could he escape?

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:26.420
[KISSING] The black slices
through the astral art.

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:29.298
And white...
white resurrects it?

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.259
Counters.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.302
[ISKA]
Never mind that for now.

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:35.513
I want to know who taught
you such a self‐destructive

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.806
way of fighting.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:41.561
Liberate. Dragon of Thorns!

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.002
[ISKA]
You are a formidable opponent.

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.712
But you mark my words:

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.214
That doesn't mean that
you can win every time.

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:27.607
[MISMIS]
Oh, Iska!

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:30.484
I'm so glad you're okay!

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:31.569
I knew it!

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.280
I had no doubt you'd rescue me!

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.115
We have to retreat now.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.200
I had better carry
this purebred back.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.660
[ON]
I don't think so.

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:44.915
You twisted away just in time.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.752
Amazing reflexes
and bodily control.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:50.421
[ISKA]
Who are you?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.467
[ON]
Don't worry about me.

00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:57.261
You should be concerning
yourself with your captain.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.727
Please excuse me.
We'll meet again.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:07.396
Imperial soldier whose
name I don't know.

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:11.901
Captain!

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:16.781
Captain!

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.200
[ALICE]
Iska!

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.921
[ISKA]
Captain!

00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.130
Come on!

00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:45.184
[ALICE]
Iska!

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:48.187
You owe me an answer!

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.231
[ISKA]
Alice!

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:57.488
You fool, where have you
been this whole time?

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.615
I went all the way to
the Imperial camp,

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:00.991
but you weren't there!

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.661
I, for one, blame that
fraudulent fortune teller.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:06.122
She's the one who told me
that you'd be nearby!

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:07.540
Fortune teller?

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.291
Ugh! Never mind that now!

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:11.419
Here, grab my hand! Quickly!

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.545
[ISKA]
Uh...

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:14.880
I'll only help you
under one condition.

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:16.632
As soon as we get
our feet on the ground,

00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:18.175
you have to fight me.

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.010
That's the sole reason
I went looking for you

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.387
in the first place!

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.183
[ISKA] If that's your condition,
then I accept.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.560
I'll hold you to that.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:43.075
[ALICE]
Spirals! Light the way!

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:56.505
[F SPIRIT A]
So e lu emnue xel noi es.

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:58.340
Oh, no!

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:00.926
The astral energy is
increasing way too quickly!

00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:28.037
[RIN]
Lady Alice! Are you all right?

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.998
[ALICE] How dare the astral
spirit get in our way at

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.583
that moment!

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.169
It was like the
worst timing ever!

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.754
Huh?

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.048
And just when I finally
got to see him again!

00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:43.803
You'd better stay alive
until you and I

00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:45.304
can have our fight.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.022
[NENE]
Iska! Captain Mismis!

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.899
[JHIN]
Iska. You good?

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.151
[ISKA]
Yeah, barely, though.

00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:01.570
We both fell into the vortex.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.364
What? How'd you survive that?

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.418
[ISKA]
I guess I owe her one.
