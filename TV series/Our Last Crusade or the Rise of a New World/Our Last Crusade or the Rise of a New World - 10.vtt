The only treasure
is the emperor.

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.920
The Successor of the
Black Steel is safe.

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:48.173
Salinger is who we
need to discuss now.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.133
Let's skip that part.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.345
The Eight Great Apostles always
have the most troublesome plans.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:56.598
Are they still trying to take
a purebred into custody?

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.560
[RISYA] You could stop
them with a single word.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.020
[YUNMELNGEN] Please.
It's not worth my time.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.315
Besides, something exciting
has captured my attention.

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:07.859
That hasn't happened
in a hundred years.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.987
It's too rich, isn't it?

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.989
A direct descendant
of Founder Nebulis

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.199
has exposed a grave weakness.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.327

I do hope we've found you
in the best of health.

Ah, Princess Sisbell
is here, too.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.503
What an honor it is to
stand in your presence.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.819

Her Majesty is asking for you.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.738

What does Mother want?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.865
Sisbell, my third daughter.

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.742
I'm ordering you
to go to Alsamira

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:41.078
on an important mission.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.622
Unlike Ein, Alsamira is
an independent nation

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:46.500
that hasn't declared neutrality.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.460
We have intelligence
that they may be fostering

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:51.797
a relationship with the Empire.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.091
I need you and your
astral spirit to figure out

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:57.010
if they're going to officially
side with our enemies.

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:59.137
This is dire.

[MILLAVAIR]
This could be dangerous.

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:06.311
Would you like to take
my guards for this quest?

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.146
[SISBELL]
I'll be fine on my own.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.190
Please focus on your own safety.

Did they find anything wrong?

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.400
[ISKA]
All clear.

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.402
After the physical they
just kept asking if I was

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:59.865
tortured or interrogated.
You guys?

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.451
They want us to have
another check‐up in a week.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.996
That way they can
look at our fake crests.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.123
It's the best way to
verify there isn't any

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:09.541
lingering energy.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.170
[JHIN]
She's lost in her head.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.880
We have no plan.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.966
And her astral crest isn't
going to disappear like ours.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.761
We have a week.
Not much time.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.430
[MICHAELA] I can't believe
these flagrant violations.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.515
I'll be reporting you

So, um, was there a
problem with our physicals?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.293
[MICHAELA]
Something is very wrong here.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.420
I've reviewed your
mission reports closely.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.178
The four of you are logging
far too many hours.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.388
Military law limits
Third Division units

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.683
to no more than 30
consecutive days in combat.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:13.355
We only extend that period to
45 days for special operations.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.233
In other words,
you work too hard.

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:22.948
Under someone's
irresponsible command,

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.534
you fought against
the Ice Calamity Witch

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.452
and then immediately
performed a series of other

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.579
high‐risk missions.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.207
If the public found out,
they'd demand to audit

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.125
our work practices.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.627
[RISYA]
You're overreacting.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.629
We just won't get caught.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.464
[MICHAELA]
This is no laughing matter.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.842
Right, so...
What does this mean?

You're taking leave.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:44.928
That's a direct order.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.055
Sixty days with no assignments.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.765

Sixty days?

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.018
[MICHAELA]
That is all.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.896
You're coming with me. Now.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.607

Wish I could get some time off.

They're putting us
on forced leave!

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.620
That means the
astral crest check‐up

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:13.039
will be postponed,
too, won't it?

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:17.043
Don't mistake this
as kindness from HQ.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.879
Think of our recent missions.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.047
Any other unit would
have been killed in action

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.382
during them.

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:25.051
I think we're getting these
60 days as an attempt

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:28.430
to make up for sending
us off to our deaths.

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.515
Okay, now I'm less excited.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.184
But this is a boon for us.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.062
We have more time
to deal with Boss's crest.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:37.939
We'll still need to be careful.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.941
We could leave the capital.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.443
How does that sound to you?

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.945
I'm on board! Smart move.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:47.115
It'll look natural for us
to go away on a vacation.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.743
Let's book a resort.
It'll be perfect!

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:03.882
Finally done.

00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:07.844
That stack was from
two weeks ago.

Then she's back sooner
than I would have expected.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.347
She must be confident in
how her campaign is fairing.

Yes.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.141
Lady Aliceliese,
the Second Princess,

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.893
is the favored candidate
to take her mother's throne.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:47.605
Meaning we need to make
a move sooner rather than later.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:50.900
The palace is full of
scheming people like them.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.068
I trust you.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.320
But I won't put that faith
in anybody else.

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.117
[SISBELL]
My nightmare will come true.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.870
There's a monster trying
to take over this nation.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.580
Someone is coming after Mother.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.960
I have to steel
myself and be brave.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:12.964
After all, I'm the only one
who knows what is happening.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.215
Problem?

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.217
No. I'm fine.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.468
Let's go, Schwartz.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:22.640
Mother. I promise
I will protect you.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.977
So please be safe
while I'm gone.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.353
Stay on your guard.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.905
[MASKED LORD]
It seems Sisbell has departed.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:40.700
I haven't spoken
to her in some time.

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:43.286
Of the three royal sisters,
you're the only one

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:46.289
who visits us
with any regularity.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.708
[ELLETEAR]
Is my presence welcomed?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.918
[MASKED LORD]
Most certainly.

00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:53.963
Princess Elletear.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.221
You've been busy.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.430
From what I've heard.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.391
I'm delighted a Lou would
take time to visit me,

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:08.353
a Zoa, so shortly
after your return home.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.687
Of course.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.272
But don't dwell on names.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.733
Lou or Zoa, it shouldn't matter.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:16.694
Especially at a
troubling time like this.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.031
Is something the matter?

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.909
I'm afraid the situation
is most dire.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.160
Oh?

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.330
Someone close to us
is involved with the Empire

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:28.831
behind the scenes.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.000
Did you know this?

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.294
[MASKED LORD] What an
interesting thing to say.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:36.339
That could topple our nation.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.049
[ELLETEAR] I don't think this
person has become a pawn

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.510
of the Empire yet.

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:42.512
But still. This must end.

00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:45.265
I'm fraught. What do I do?

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.601
[MASKED LORD] An intelligent
woman like you doesn't know?

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.395
Perhaps I can help.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.188
Who are you speaking of?

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.459
[JHIN] The independent
nation of Alsamira.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.836
If rumors are to be believed,

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:17.672
they may formally ally
with the Empire soon.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:20.049
[ISKA] I'll believe that
when it's official.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.175
[JHIN]
Agreed.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.219
They're making too much
money with these resorts.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.266
[MISMIS]
So hot!

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.600
It's not like summer.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.686
I feel like I'm standing
on the sun!

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.187
This is so great!

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.982
I've been dying to go
to a tropical resort!

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.651
Already having fun.
Good for them.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.778
Yeah. The Captain's safe here.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.323
They deserve to
cut loose a little.

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:45.325
[ISKA]
But this isn't just a vacation.

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.201
We have to figure out
how to hide her crest

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:48.953
before we return.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.621
[MISMIS]
Hey, Iska.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.790
Blow these up for us, will ya!

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.500
Putting me to work already?

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.086
We barely got off the bus
and haven't even unpacked.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.630
There's the Marine Hotel
and Isberia.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:02.216
and the Grand
Illumination Group, too!

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.260
They're all super famous spots!

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.137
This is a total dream!

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.556
Let's go see 'em!

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.016
Wait for me, Captain!

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.519
Well.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:14.771
Let's take a day.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.529
Beautiful.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.157
[NENE]
Sorry for the wait!

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.369
[MISMIS] It took me a while to
inflate my tube, but it's done.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.996
[NENE]
What do you think, Iska?

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:35.750
Do you like our suits?
Cute, huh?

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.585
Uh, yeah.

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:38.669
[BOTH laugh]

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:43.925
[MISMIS] Okay, let's start out
with a hundred‐meter race!

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:47.220
Last one in's a rotten egg!

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.763
I hope the water's nice!

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.640
[JHIN] You can't even
swim that long, Boss.

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:05.363
I didn't expect the
breeze to be so cold.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.865
Nights can get chilly
in the desert.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.992
I wonder if the Captain's okay.

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:12.703
The beer completely
knocked her out.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.914
She's rarely one
to indulge in drinks.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:18.835
[NENE] Jhin, could you
take Captain to the hotel?

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:20.294
We'll pick up food
at the supermarket

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.505
and meet back there.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:23.881
Don't end up lost.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:30.138
Iska. Can you wait here?

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:32.765
I drank a lot of juice
and could use a bathroom.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:33.808
Sure.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:35.893
[NENE]
I'll be quick!

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.403
[ISKA]
Are you all right?

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.781
[SISBELL]
Ouch. Please excuse me.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.408
I'm afraid I've lost my way.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.784
I was focused on my map.

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:55.997
Wait.

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:01.544
It's you.

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.174
You're that girl.

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.426
[SISBELL]
Uh...

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:09.594
Um, are you...?

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.053
[NENE]
Don't worry. I'm back.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.307
Huh? Why that face?

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:16.225
[ISKA]
It's nothing!

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:20.354
See, this girl behind me
asked for directions.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.647
[NENE]
I don't see anyone.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.153
Are you good?

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.825
Yeah. Anyway, we should
grab some dinner.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:33.868
Let's go.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.210
[SISBELL]
Is this possible?

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.256
The Saint Disciple Iska's here!

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:48.466
But why?

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:53.638
[SCHWARTZ]
Milady!

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.767
I was looking for you.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:01.187
Please be more considerate
to this old man's body.

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.272
[SISBELL]
I found him!

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.317
Listen, Schwartz!
I found my dream knight.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.445
The one I've been looking for.
I just saw him!

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.156
I need to fill you in
on what's happening.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.116
Let's go back to the hotel.

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.662
What is going on?

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.038
We'll wait for night.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.044
[ALICE]
I'm utterly exhausted.

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:26.504
[RIN]
You worked hard.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.548
Rest up for the meet and
greet at 5 AM tomorrow

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:30.341
in the Queen's Hall.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.385
Twenty people, including
guests from foreign nations

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.303
and ministers, will be there.

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:36.514
You'll need to speak
with each of them.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.307
When did you become my torturer?

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:40.685
‐‐[knocking]
‐‐[MILLAVAIR] Alice.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.687
Huh? Mother's here?

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.522
Quick. Get the door!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.107
[RIN]
Yes. Of course!

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.948
[ALICE] Good evening,
is something wrong?

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.158
Stop whatever you're
doing and come with me.

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:11.882
[SCHWARTZ] There aren't many
people out in this cold.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.050
[SISBELL]
Keep your guard up.

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.137
I'll only be a moment.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:20.516
Stars, show me
the past you witnessed.

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:26.480
Are you good?

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:27.398
Yeah.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.401
Anyway, we should
grab some dinner.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:31.485
Let's go.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:38.409
Milady. Are you really going
to ask this boy for help?

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.410
Yes.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:40.494
Right now.

00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:45.082
Where are we headed? And why?

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:50.212
That's the key to
Lady Sisbell's bedroom.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:51.130
Yes.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:54.216
She's not currently at the
palace, so she left it with me.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.770
Alice, what do you make
of your younger sister?

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.773
Speaking as the queen.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.733
It's my wish for the
two of you to represent

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.069
the royal family with dignity.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.362
And yet...

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:17.323
I have different
priorities as your mother.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.116
Right now, the officials
of the Sovereignty

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.410
do not have much
faith in Sisbell.

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:24.288
It would be difficult
for her to win the election,

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.582
but that cannot be helped.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:29.043
And so my concerns are
of a parental nature.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.923
My Queen. If I may...

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:36.884
Is that why you sent her
out on a foreign mission?

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:37.802
[MILLAVAIR]
No.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.471
That was because she
was best suited for the job.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.724
Still. I'll make the most
of her absence.

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:46.352
I'm worried about Sisbell.

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.896
What is she doing
cooped up in her room?

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:51.190
Out of sight all day.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.026
A mother wonders.
It's only natural.

00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:58.948
We're by your side. Let's go.

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:07.039
This hotel's owned by
the Jarmrick Company.

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.791
It's a well‐known site.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.752
Considered to be
somewhat upscale.

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:13.754
[SISBELL] Where an Imperial
soldier might stay on his

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:15.339
vacation?

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:16.590
[SCHWARTZ]
Yes.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.801
If they're here on a secret
op from the Empire,

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.011
it would be wise
to choose a nice hotel

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:24.890
or one with an affiliation
to their homeland.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:27.101
Even better.

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:28.477
Proceed as planned.

00:20:49.415 --> 00:20:51.000
[MILLAVAIR]
We'll take what time we need.

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.252
The two of you can
search together.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.962
[ALICE]
Right. Lead the way.

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.688
'Scuse me. Hi?

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.939
[ISKA]
An assassin?

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:15.691
[SISBELL grunts]

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.748
I never thought I'd end
up snooping around

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.541
my little sister's bedroom.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:46.555
[ISKA]
Who do you work for?

00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:48.057
The Sovereignty?

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:50.684
[SISBELL] No, this is a
misunderstanding! I swear!

00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:57.107
You again?

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.651
That's right.

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:01.821
I didn't come here to harm you.

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:05.783
[ALICE]
Impossible. Sisbell knows Iska?

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:07.076
But how?

00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:11.580
[SISBELL] Saint Disciple,
there's something I need

00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:13.624
to talk to you about.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:14.750
[ISKA]
Go on.

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:18.337
I have a request.

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:20.297
Come back to the
Sovereignty with me.
