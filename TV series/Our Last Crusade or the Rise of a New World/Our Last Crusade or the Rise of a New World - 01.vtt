WEBVTT

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.181
[ISKA] There is a strange
force that slumbers

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:17.434
within this planet
called astral power.

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:20.187
It is too strong for most
humanity to wield.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.984
[ALICE] There are some who
can harness this energy.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.321
As a result, they are feared
as witches or mages.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.281
Persecuted by those
in the Empire.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.082
[ISKA] The Empire is home to
many who have been harmed

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.834
by this extraordinary power.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.379
[ALICE] And bordering it is
a paradise ruled by

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.715
the innocent witches,
the Nebulis Sovereignty.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.260
[ISKA] These two nations are
pitted against one another.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.096
[ALICE] In a conflict
that seems endless.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.848
[ISKA] I'm going to bring
this war to a close.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:04.022
[ALICE] I will establish a land
that is free of oppression.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.900
[ALICE, ISKA] And so, the
crusade that will change our

00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:08.819
world now begins.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.523
You're wearing an armband.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:47.649
Stay back!

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.866
Why would a
Saint Disciple free me?

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.409
Quick. Come with me.

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.669
Take this. It's not much.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.214
You have to run.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.567
[GREAT APOSTLE A]
Raise your head.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.031
Prisoner Iska. Age 16.

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.241
The youngest person
in history to be granted

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.619
the title of Saint Disciple,
and yet,

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.204
a year ago you
were caught aiding

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.290
an imprisoned witch in escaping.

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:48.960
As such, you were stripped
of your ranking.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.754
Is that all correct?

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:51.880
[ISKA]
Yes.

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:53.173
[GREAT APOSTLE A] Today,
you're being released from

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.384
this facility.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.469
[GREAT APOSTLE B] Our nation has
been at war with the witches

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.179
for a hundred years.

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:02.140
Your crime was a treasonous one.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.058
[F GREAT APOSTLE A]
However.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.935
We are providing you
with an opportunity

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.687
to correct your mistake.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.397
[GREAT APOSTLE C]
We have a mission for you.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.941
Our longtime witch enemies
now call themselves

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.776
astral mages.

00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:15.153
[GREAT APOSTLE A] You will be
taking one of them down.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.822
[GREAT APOSTLE B]
But not just any witch.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:20.951
She is a direct descendant
of the Grand Witch Nebulis.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.869
[GREAT APOSTLE C] Nebulis was
responsible for turning our

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:26.164
Empire into a sea
of flames in the past.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.792
Her descendants are
called "purebreds."

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.962
These foes harbor
terrible astral power.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:32.963
[ISKA]
That's true.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.340
I've battled against
them many times.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:38.427
[GREAT APOSTLE A] Your target is
the fiercest among them.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.012
The "Ice Calamity Witch."

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.681
The "Ice Calamity Witch."

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:50.105
[GREAT APOSTLE A] Iska.
Successor of the Black Steel.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:52.858
For the time being,
you are free.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.943
You will find a transit vehicle
waiting to take you

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.529
to the frontlines in 17 hours.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.907
We will provide any resources
you may require.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.201
There're three members
I'd like in my unit.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.710
[CUSTOMER A] Hey, Nene, what
table do you want me to sit at?

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.754
[CUSTOMER B] We haven't
gotten our order yet, Nene.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.297
Did you put it in?

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:16.465
[CUSTOMER C]
Nene!

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.632
[NENE]
I heard you!

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.386
Just give me a second.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.017
Welcome, sir!

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:32.773
Jhin?

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.734
This is wonderful!

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.486
Did you come just to say hi?

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:41.239
[JHIN] It hasn't been that
long since I saw you.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.866
I have news.

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:46.369
He's been released.
Make your preparations.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.246
[NENE]
Wait, you don't mean that...

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.080
I do.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.751
At zero hundred, we'll be
heading to the front lines.

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.836
You're for real? The front?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:05.013
Just like the morning sun,
the night sky

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.681
didn't change over
the last year.

00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:11.561
[JHIN] It's four minutes and 30
seconds until we're set

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.063
to leave.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.022
[ISKA]
Jhin!

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.107
Thanks for getting a hold
of everyone earlier.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.943
It was a big help.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.403
I'm accustomed to you
giving me short notice.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.539
Iska! I can't believe
you're here!

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.459
Congratulations!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:38.463
Nene, you don't have to
literally jump for joy.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.507
Oh! I think I saw the captain.

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:42.092
Hey! We're here!

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:46.096
[MISMIS panting]
You guys!

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.640
I'm so sorry I'm late!

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.980
[NENE]
That looked like it hurt.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.690
[JHIN]
Some things never change.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.987
[MISMIS]
Look at you, Iska!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.114
It's been such a long time!

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.616
Wow. I think you've
grown even taller.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.243
So, we're just ignoring
that you fell.

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:09.536
[ISKA]
You think?

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:11.663
I guess a girl like me
has no hope of ever

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.331
getting any bigger.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.000
What do you mean by "girl"?

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.793
You're too old to
call yourself that.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:20.672
Hey! What are you talking about?
I'm only 22, you jerk!

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.509
Still, it is good
to see you all!

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.387
I bet Iska's the same
sweet boy he always was.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.931
While Nene has somehow
grown even prettier.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.641
And, of course, Jhin's
sharp tongue brings back

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.476
some fun memories.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:34.728
My what?

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.479
Anyhow...

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.399
Defense for Humankind.
Third Division.

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.526
Unit N07 is back!

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.200
[NENE]
Aw, yeah. Off we go!

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.164
[NENE]
Okay, so spill.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.291
What kind of mission
are we on this time?

00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:57.918
Witch suppression.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.378
That's the only thing
our unit ever handles.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.339
This job could give us
some trouble.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.591
She's a descendent
of the Grand Witch.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:05.675
A purebred.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.510
You're kidding.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.054
You've heard of the
Ice Calamity Witch,

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.263
haven't you, boss?

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.515
Huh?! That's who we're after?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.976
Uh, Iska. Is that the truth?

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.227
[ISKA]
Yes.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.480
Apparently the reason I was
released was so I could

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.566
capture this Ice Calamity Witch.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.651
Oh, dear.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:26.446
It sounds like the Eight
Great Apostles set you up.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.323
[ISKA]
How do you mean?

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:29.991
If I remember correctly,

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.619
she first appeared
at the front in Yubel.

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:34.704
She broke through the
northern line and ravaged

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.790
our troops by herself.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.416
And that was just the beginning.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.502
Some are saying she's the
most powerful astral mage

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:41.670
who ever lived.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.629
Yes.

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:45.674
But she doesn't know
what Iska is capable of.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:46.800
You're unknown.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.760
The Nebulis Sovereignty
should have no intel

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.428
on your life.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.556
In their eyes, you don't even
register as a threat.

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:54.599
That's right!

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.936
Iska was imprisoned right after
he became a Saint Disciple.

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.021
Correct. Which means...

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.606
Their guards will be down.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.192
The bigwigs are probably
counting on that.

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:05.360
But still.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.238
Relying on you after
throwing you in prison?

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.823
This mage must
have spooked them,

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.533
and they've gotten desperate.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.077
It's all starting to make sense.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.453
So, Iska.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.497
You're really going
to try to catch her?

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:18.873
Obviously.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.126
It's my chance to stay free.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.670
So, if you fail the mission
you'll go back?

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.756
I'm trying not to
even consider that.

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:30.218
I'd rather focus on putting
an end to this hopeless war.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.345
It's all I can think about.

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.305
Not only right now.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.307
It's why I acted
a year ago, too.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.153
[MISMIS] This weapons reactor
appears to be brand new.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.571
[ISKA]
Yeah, I think you're right.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:50.989
[MISMIS]
It's kinda strange.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.951
They have such a huge reactor,
but not many troops deployed.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.578
Oh. I bet‐‐

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.079
Did you guys miss me?

00:08:58.121 --> 00:08:59.622
[MISMIS]
Whoa, that was loud!

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.458
Nene, don't surprise
us like that.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.667
[NENE laughs]

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.128
The transport is all checked in.
We're good.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.296
Oh, and see that tent?

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:08.631
I spotted the commanding
officer in there.

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.884
Word is the reactor's
not finished yet.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.303
Since there've been so many
astral mage strikes lately,

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:15.180
most of the troops are busy
defending the front

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.557
instead of finishing
projects here.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:18.641
[ISKA]
I figured.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.686
That's the reason the place
seems like it's pretty deserted.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.855
I could tell something was off.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.066
The reactor is shaking way
too much when it's up

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.358
and going.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.944
And there's a lot of rumbling
in its operating hum.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.988
Spoken like a
top‐notch engineer.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.907
That's our Nene.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.825
Also, check out
the exhaust vent.

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.036
The steam is the wrong
color and smell.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.121
The pressure unit is running,
but the control ring

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.664
is just about at its threshold‐‐

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:44.626
[JHIN] What a vicious cycle.
The Empire builds a reactor.

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:47.754
Then the Sovereignty shows up
in force to destroy it.

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.589
So we build more weapons.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:53.468
The same sequence has repeated
for a hundred years.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.471
Isn't that what Master
was always saying?

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.640
Whatever has triggered
this war‐‐

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.935
It's now being fueled by blind
fanaticism and emotions.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.563
It's not going to be stopped
by logic alone.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.315
Someone must put an end to it.

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:10.819
Forcibly, even if they
end up being hated.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.946
[ISKA]
Forcibly, huh?

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.656
The peace talks a certain
someone is pushing

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.574
for are one option.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.576
But I can't imagine
they'll be successful.

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:27.210
Right. Heard loud and clear.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:28.294
Who was that?

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.879
A unit at the frontlines.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.757
They're not engaging enemy
forces at the moment,

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.135
and look forward to our arrival.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:36.177
[yelps]

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:42.058
Nene! Would you please
drive more carefully?

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.185
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.729
I could handle this lil baby
with one eye closed.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:49.983
[MISMIS] I'm begging you,
look where you're going!

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.317
Get out!

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.861
Captain. Hold on.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.288
A Nebulis power force.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:06.124
No way!
We're still on Imperial land!

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.584
[ISKA]
They broke through our defenses.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.503
There's probably a powerful
astral mage close by.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:11.963
[NENE]
Incoming message.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.756
It's a request for any
and all backup from

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.092
the Nelka force
communications team.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.802
There's no time to waste.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.304
We're the sneak attack.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.348
But that won't matter if an
enemy battalion finds us first.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.558
Jhin! Dodge!

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.950
Did he just cut through
astral power flames?

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.744
I spot two mages.

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:44.078
Everyone be careful.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.956
Obviously, and don't
shout orders like that.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:48.583
It calls you out as a captain.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.293
Worry about yourself instead.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.462
Now's not the time
for your backtalk!

00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:53.630
[JHIN]
We'll handle this.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.301
They're wind mages.

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.143
More of them?

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.561
It appears so.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.314
Their presence was hidden
since they were underground.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.982
[ISKA]
That would take a massive spell.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.318
They have a fairly
powerful astral mage.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.695
I don't get how you two
can be so calm!

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.781
Because we anticipated a trap.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.866
Iska, can you cut
through them all?

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:25.536
I'm a bit rusty.
It could be difficult to manage.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.038
But we'll live.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.540
I'll just need some help
from you, Nene.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.959
[NENE]
Roger that!

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.295
Anti‐astral power flares,
deploy!

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:47.141
Right flank.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.940
Astral power raging inferno!

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.903
Incinerate!

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.707
[F ASTRAL MAGE A]
You jumped out of its path?

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:12.208
There's no way that's possible!

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.921
Why do you think
I did so much training?

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.719
Jhin. How goes it?

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.804
[JHIN]
All clear.

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:27.473
[MISMIS]
Amazing. That was so fast.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.351
You boys never fail to impress.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.520
[JHIN] A year ago, we might've
left everything to Iska

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.647
and gone ahead without him.

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:37.066
Though, you never were
one to rush into battle.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:42.947
Earth power.

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.073
That's a golem.

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.159
And a quickly created
one at that.

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:49.954
[RIN]
How unexpected.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:53.374
You dealt with the unit before
I had the chance to arrive?

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.752
You're not some ordinary squad.

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:56.919
Arise.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:08.890
[ISKA]
I'll handle this, Captain.

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.767
Take Nene and Jhin
and assist the soldiers

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.101
on the front lines.

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.479
[MISMIS]
Huh? But Iska...

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.940
[ISKA] This fight won't end any
faster with you three helping.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.109
[MISMIS]
If you're sure. Be careful!

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.115
It's healing?

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:34.540
[RIN]
You broke my attack?

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.125
Are you a Saint Disciple?

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.461
[ISKA] I have no intention
of answering you

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.296
unless you tell me
where I can find the one

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:42.298
known as the Ice Calamity Witch.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.133
[RIN]
Silence, you Imperial dog!

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:47.220
I won't even allow you
to look upon her beauty!

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.596
I figured.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:51.432
Unfortunately, I have
business with her.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:52.642
[RIN]
Not a chance.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.902
[ISKA]
It's over.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.779
Tell me. Who are you?

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.614
Tell me where the witch is.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:07.615
No.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.742
I would rather die right now
than give information

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.744
to a war monger.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:14.330
Being a corpse is preferable
to being your prisoner.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.170
Did you think a close‐range
attack would rattle me?

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.797
I'm trained with
a blade as well.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:23.923
Now die!

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:27.927
No. You couldn't.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.228
Lady Alice.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.229
[ISKA]
Wait.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.481
Don't tell me you're
the Ice Calamity.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:41.524
[ALICE]
Yes.

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:48.865
That is what they call me.

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:54.120
You doubt me?

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.621
Then I'll prove it to you.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:58.583
Ice Calamity.

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.014
Rin, are you all right?

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.223
[RIN]
I am, My Lady.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.146
Incredible.

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.898
Please be careful.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.066
This man's sword is capable
of blocking and destroying

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.943
our astral arts.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.820
[ALICE]
Duly noted.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.572
You did well to distract him.

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:30.740
Distract?

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.537
The reactor!

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.830
[ALICE]
Now shatter.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.002
Your attack was
just a diversion!

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:43.961
[ALICE]
Who are you?

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.088
How could someone who's
not a Saint Disciple

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.423
overpower Rin?

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.592
[ISKA] I'm the person who's
come to capture you.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.719
Idle threats are
a waste of breath.

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.930
If you don't wish to feel
every drop of your blood

00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:55.806
freeze and burst...

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.433
...surrender to me.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.771
[ALICE] Swordsman of the Empire,
you have still given no name.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.315
[ISKA]
Iska. And you are?

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.984
[ALICE] Aliceliese Lou
Nebulis the ninth.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.736
Though you already
know me by the title

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:11.113
the Imperials have
bestowed upon me.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.157
The "Ice Calamity Witch."

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.498
Walls. Fly forth!

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.003
Ice Calamity.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.630
Thousand Thorn Blizzard!

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.717
Pierce him!

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.939
Pity. You're done.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.983
No. Awaken.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.741
He can use the
astral arts as well?

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:57.243
That can't be!

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.911
You're right.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:00.621
It's the astral sword's power.

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.166
Blossom.

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:11.465
It's impenetrable.
You should give up.

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.092
No way I can stop.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:17.430
If I give up now, who'll put an
end to this senseless war?

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:24.770
[ALICE]
Vines!

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:37.158
She jumped back. My Lady.

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.743
So persistent.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.286
Surrender while you can.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.579
[ISKA]
Why don't you retreat?

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.415
I will not stop fighting until
I defeat the Empire

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.334
and unite this broken world.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.877
[ISKA]
That's what you want?

00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.630
I seek everlasting peace
for this land.

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:51.631
No fear.

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:55.051
That is what I, as heir to
the Nebulis Sovereignty,

00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:56.177
Aliceliese‐‐

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.606
[ISKA]
Uh, you okay?

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.316
Oh, yes. Thank you.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:17.823
Wait.

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.034
Hold on, fiend, what do you
think you're doing?

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.369
You fell.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.870
[NENE]
Iska!

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.418
[ALICE]
Rin. We shall retreat for now.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.670
[RIN]
But Lady Alice, we can still‐‐!

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.177
Iska, was it?

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:39.762
Pray we never meet again.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.525
[MISMIS]
Iska! There you are!

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:55.820
I'm so glad you're safe!
You had me worried!

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.530
Please tell me you're not hurt!

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.656
What'd she do?

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.116
Are you in pain?

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:02.243
[ISKA] Hugging a subordinate
who's injured may not be

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:03.703
the best idea.

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:05.663
[MISMIS gasps]
Sorry!

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:09.917
Hey, Jhin. Did one witch
really do all of this?

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.419
[JHIN]
The rumors were true.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.046
Looks like she's an
extraordinary astral mage.

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:15.673
The ice almost reached
our rendezvous point

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.091
in the frontlines.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:34.692
[RIN]
Lady Alice.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.278
Have you been in the bath
this whole time?

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:38.904
Let's get you dried off.

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.836
[ISKA] If I give up now,
who'll put an end to this

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.421
senseless war?

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.471
Ugh! I won't sit here moping!

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.931
I need a change of scenery!

00:21:05.973 --> 00:21:07.308
What's your plan?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.439
Sounds fun, right?

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:17.443
I see that you already
have tickets.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:18.569
Of course.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.613
You want to run off
to Neutral City again.

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:26.327
[ALICE]
Oh, Beatrix!

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:29.205
To fall in love with
an enemy knight.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:33.083
A forbidden desire that can
never end in happiness.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.504
Why is there so much pained
romance in this world?

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.506
Azel, you fool.

00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:40.841
How can you do this to
the woman that you love?

00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.968
Shh. Please keep it down.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.762
Where is your handkerchief?

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:48.098
I'm afraid it's
already soaking wet.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.267
[MALE VOICE]
Miss, why don't you take mine?

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:53.103
Oh? Why thank you so much.

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.483
[AUDIENCE claps]

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.201
[ALICE]
Um... I apologize.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:08.661
I think this is ruined.

00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:10.913
Please sir, allow me to pay you.

00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:13.165
[MALE VOICE]
Oh, no, it's not a big deal.

00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:14.917
It's was cheap and I've got‐‐
