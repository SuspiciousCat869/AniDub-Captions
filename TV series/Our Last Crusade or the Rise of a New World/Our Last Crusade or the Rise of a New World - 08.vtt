WEBVTT

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.892
[RISYA]
Salinger the Transcendent.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.521
The Sovereignty's demon,
imprisoned 30 years ago.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.857
That's how the Emperor
described you to me, but...

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.527
You look a lot younger
than I expected.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.070
Are you really him?

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.823
You've got some nerve,
speaking to me so casually.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.784
Does your confidence
come from knowing

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.119
you have the emperor's support?

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.413
No, not at all!

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.791
[SALINGER] I must say,
you're a pleasant surprise.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.585
I'm curious, though:
how did you manage to get in?

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.170
[RISYA]
It was nothing, really.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.672
I have Sovereignty citizenship

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.508
precisely for
situations like this.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.010
Anyway, I won't beat
around the bush.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.179
I'm here to help you
escape from this place.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.559
The Empire is on
the cusp of launching

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.186
a large‐scale invasion
of the Sovereignty.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.939
We thought we might
benefit from your help.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.274
[SALINGER]
Your objective?

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.276
[RISYA] The current queen,
Millavair Lou Nebulis

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.570
the Eighth, is our target.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.196
She captured you when
you fought against

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:14.783
the previous queen and
locked you away, no?

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.911
[SALINGER] You want me to seek
revenge to suit your ends?

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:20.163
How dull.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.623
That being said...

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.376
I have grown a bit tired
of living underground.

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:25.419
[RISYA]
Good.

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:30.924
[SALINGER]
I suppose I'll transcend.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.053
Into something more than a king.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.532
[ALICE]
You can't sleep either?

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.283
You must feel uneasy here.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.994
After all, you are
in hostile territory.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.163
[ISKA]
No. Looks peaceful.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.916
I was just admiring the view.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.251
Indeed.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.878
But things aren't always
what they seem.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.548
It may look tranquil,
but most of those buildings

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.967
hold violent criminals.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.511
Dangerous astral
mages, you mean?

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.387
No.

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:44.725
Not all of the prisoners here
have powerful astral spirits.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.685
Though there is one of note.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:47.853
[ISKA]
Who is that?

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.023
[ALICE] See that huge,
foreboding structure there?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.942
That's the Ollelugan
Prison Tower.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:56.611
It's the highest security
facility in the Province,

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.364
and on its deepest level,
this nation's worst offender

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.074
is imprisoned.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.368
His name is Salinger the Demon.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.705
Huh. You call him that
'cause he's a criminal?

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:08.123
[ALICE]
What do you mean?

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:10.917
"Demon." That term is just so...

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.755
[ALICE] I don't like that term,
either, but those are the rules.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.965
He called himself
"The Transcendent."

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.593
And then he attacked the queen.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.970
The traitor earned the
"demon" moniker due to his

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.805
subversion against our nation.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.893
Oh, dear.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.770
I've said far too much.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.897
You had better not
tell Rin about this.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.024
If she finds out I told
you the Salinger story,

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.567
‐‐I'm done for‐‐
‐‐[RIN] Lady Alice.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:36.943
[ALICE yelps]

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.279
Why in the world did
you yelp like that?

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:43.241
Really, you must remember
that you are royalty, ma'am.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.076
Did something happen?

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.495
Why're you up?

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.538
The Empire may've infiltrated.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.499
Someone's crossed the border.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.792
[ALICE]
What? But how?

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:56.546
Hey, don't look at me.
My hands are bound.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.590
There's no way
I could've done it.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.718
And besides.
I've had my eyes on him.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.095
With the exception
of the Central Province,

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:07.182
suspicious groups have been
reported across the land.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.976
There's a high likelihood it's
the Empire's covert force.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:12.729
A warning's been issued
to our military.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.899
To be clear,
that includes this province.

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.651
[alarm blaring]

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.905
Have we been spotted?

00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:24.908
No, if we triggered this alarm,
it would've gone off

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.202
when we stepped in.

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.412
[MISMIS]
Could it be Risya, then?

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:31.957
Hush! Be quiet, you two,
I hear footsteps!

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.049
The guards?

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.719
No, the prison's emergency
response team.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.597
Their gear looks
like our army's.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.976
I bet they're outfitted to
handle astral mage prisoners.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:51.810
Right.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.604
I think it's safe to assume
nobody's after us.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.398
Risya could be in trouble!

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.692
This is bad!
We have to help her!

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.236
[GROUP gasps]

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.197
[NENE]
What's happening?

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.740
[JHIN]
I'd wager nothing good!

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.993
[phone rings]

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.244
[RISYA]
Ah, hi there.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.996
Hey, Mismis, you doing okay?

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.873
It's Risya!

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.416
[RISYA]
Sounds like you're safe!

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:15.625
That's a relief.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.503
Anyway, did you guys hear
all that racket just now?

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.006
A wall got blown out
to gain underground access,

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.883
and then an earth
astral spirit blasted

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.135
an enormous hole
in the ceiling, too!

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.221
I mean, wow!
Astral arts are incredible!

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.348
[MISMIS]
Hold on a second, Risya!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.767
Did you find out
anything about Iska?

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.896
Ah, right. Sorry about that.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:37.898
Apparently, Iska isn't here.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.609
But I did find a big,
bad demon who went on a rampage,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.153
causing major
chaos and confusion.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.779
Whoopsie!

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.407
Uh, well, okay.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.701
[RISYA] I guess what I should
say is, "everyone retreat!"

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.244
And also, do your best
not to get captured

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:52.537
by the prison guards!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.584
What is wrong with her?

00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:00.086
Complain later. Let's go.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:06.134
Jhin, do you think she
may have used us as bait?

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.636
No point in speculating.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.480
Our real problem is them.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.065
‐‐[CERTS] Yes, sir.
‐‐[CERT A] Unit C, go left.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.316
[CERTS]
Yes, sir.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.612
[JHIN]
It seems we're trapped.

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:26.613
Dammit!

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:29.074
If only she'd contacted us
two minutes sooner!

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.625
Well, that can't be good.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:39.626
Agreed.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.297
Yes. Understood.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:48.343
My Lady, there's been
an explosion at the tower.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:51.304
The blast created a giant hole
in the ground at the site.

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.515
Apparently, there's a massive
amount of destruction

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.767
and debris. It's bad.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.311
The guards have reported
they heard a loud roar

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.146
from an underground level.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.941
They're guessing it came from
Salinger the Demon's cell.

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.234
It can't be!

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.068
Yes.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.820
We're currently trying
to reach the emergency

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.446
response team there.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.906
We must act, Rin!

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.283
If that demon escapes,

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.953
he'll go after Mother's
astral spirit!

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:17.038
Is that even possible?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.873
I'll head that way.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:22.585
[RIN]
But Lady Alice! He's dangerous!

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.963
Who else is there
that could stop him?

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.759
Rin, go, now.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:32.595
Prepare our vehicle
to leave at once.

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:33.972
Yes, understood.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.727
[ALICE sighs]

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.062
So, as you heard,
I'll be heading out

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.148
to the prison tower now.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.191
And since I'm an
Imperial Soldier,

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.569
you can't share the details.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.905
Right.
You're our enemy, after all.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:54.409
And yet, if I could tell
you I would feel a whole

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.202
lot better, y'know?

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.956
Hey, Iska?

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:03.793
If I were to ask for your help,
hypothetically,

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.296
would you be inclined
to accept my request?

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.383
Never mind.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.010
I'm going to get changed.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.226
Oh, yes,
since I have the chance...

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.854
You may think it gauche
of me to present this to you

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.647
while you're in our captivity.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.192
But I had to do it when
Rin wasn't around.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:32.489
I would give back your old one,
but I'm afraid I ruined it.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.449
I'm sorry it had to be replaced.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.623
If you don't like this one,
just leave it behind.

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:42.707
That said,

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:46.753
I hope you do like it and accept
it with my warm regard.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:47.962
Goodbye, Iska.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.470
[ISKA]
What the heck?

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.275
There's no way we can
take these guys head‐on.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:12.028
I need you both to stay here.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.988
I'll go out and
attract their attention.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.865
As soon as they
let their guards down,

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.575
take them out in a single sweep.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.701
Got that?

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.662
Wait! You should take them out!

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:23.081
You're way better
at that than me, Jhin.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.166
Makes more sense
for me to be bait.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.584
[JHIN]
No offense, but...

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.670
I honestly think I'd be better
at grabbing their attention

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:29.754
than you.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.215
[NENE]
Well, I disagree.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:34.717
[MISMIS]
We're wasting time. I'll do it.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.765
I mean, I am a witch right now.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.060
[NENE]
Captain.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:46.312
But Boss. You can't.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.523
A bunch of witches are being
held captive in this prison,

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:49.649
aren't they?

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.152
Here goes!

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.406
Ha! I've finally broken free!

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:58.032
[CERT A]
We've found an escapee!

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.535
[CERT F] Is this witch
responsible for the blast?

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.829
[CERT A] There's an astral
crest on her shoulder.

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.831
Everyone, in position!

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.917
[MISMIS] Don't move!
I'll take you all out!

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:11.087
My astral spirit is
incredibly powerful!

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:14.299
I will end every
one of you at once!

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.926
[CERT A] We'll show no mercy
to an escapee witch.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.970
Under Article 19 of
the General Prison Law,

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.972
you'll be executed!

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.765
All units, advance!

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:31.316
This is something only I can do;
there's no turning back now!

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.486
[MISMIS gasps]

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.783
[MISMIS yelps]

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.286
I won't give them the
satisfaction of killing me!

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.915
[CERT E]
Over there!

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.209
They cut me off?

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.587
[MISMIS yelps]

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:02.013
[CERT A]
Give up. You're caught, escapee.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:05.433
Ha. Or should I say,
failed escapee?

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.019
We could execute you here,
but if you tell us‐‐

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.781
[JHIN] You're s'posed to hit the
floor in situations like that.

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:22.867
That was the last
of them on this level.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:27.205
Ah! Nene! I was so scared!

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.791
If you guys would've shown up
a few seconds later,

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.918
I might have been a goner!

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.128
[JHIN] I gotta admit, you were
actually helpful this time,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.296
Boss.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.923
You did good, for once.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:40.260
I almost died, you know!

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.804
Anyway, we'd better
get out of here!

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:44.389
If we make it out of
this alive, then I say

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.059
we force Risya to treat us
to a nice barbecue dinner!

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.519
[NENE]
Does that include Iska?

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.520
[MISMIS]
Of course!

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:51.854
[alarm blaring]

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.733
What the heck is going on?

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.195
I could help if not for these!

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.407
[phone ringing]

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.284
Wait, that ringtone.
Sounds like...

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.335
[ISKA]
I knew it!

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:15.920
Alice had my phone on her.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.464
Hello?

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.717
[MISMIS]
Uh... Iska?

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.552
Captain! It's me!

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:23.928
[MISMIS]
Thank goodness!

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.096
Jhin! Nene!

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.597
I finally got ahold of him!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.975
[JHIN] Yeah, congrats,
now stop wasting time.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:35.565
[MISMIS] Right.
What's your situation, Iska?

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.984
I'm not totally sure,
to be honest.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.028
No one in my immediate area.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:43.698
I'm being held in a hotel,
on the top floor, I think.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.908
[MISMIS] That's good.
And the Ice Calamity Witch?

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.203
She took off to the
Ollelugan Prison Tower.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.496
[MISMIS]
Ollelugan?

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:54.208
That's where we are
right now, actually.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.460
Wait a sec, Captain!

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.628
Why is our unit there?

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.006
[MISMIS]
Jhin, Nene, I have bad news!

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.508
The Ice Calamity Witch
is headed our way!

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.678
[JHIN]
Give me that. Iska.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.473
I'll explain later, but we're
within the Sovereignty,

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:09.891
and in a tight spot.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:11.684
Just focus on finding us.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:12.769
Roger that.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.855
[JHIN] Okay.
Can you make your way outside?

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.815
[ISKA]
Unfortunately, probably not,

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.942
especially because
I'm in handcuffs.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.903
[JHIN] Any way you can
break out of them?

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.238
[ISKA] Trust me, if I could
I'd be free now.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.157
I mean, there's nothing
in here I could use;

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.492
they thought of everything.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:42.882
Unless...

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.469
Would she?

00:14:55.645 --> 00:15:00.316
Alice. I'm an idiot.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:01.901
Why didn't I figure
it out sooner?

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.870
[ISKA] I'll be right there.
Don't worry.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:13.830
[JHIN]
Iska?

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.415
Hey, Iska! What's wrong?

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.752
[ISKA] Jhin, stay where
you are if you can.

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:21.087
Help is on the way.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.932
[RIN] Lady Alice,
we'll be arriving soon.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.976
[ALICE]
Good. Let's do this.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.064
Could that be Imperial forces?

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.941
They're aiming for us.
Get out!

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.284
[CERT G] The maximum‐security
cell in basement 11

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:52.618
has been destroyed!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.953
We're assessing now.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:56.497
We believe Salinger the
Demon may have escaped!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:57.707
[CERT H]
Never mind that!

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.000
Where are the firefighters?

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:00.626
[CERT I]
Get the onlookers out of here!

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:02.670
Imperial soldiers
might be among them!

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.550
[RIN] If the Imperial Army did
indeed inflict this damage,

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:09.594
how did they get
across the border?

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.681
It seems they've outsmarted us.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.809
Salinger's escape
isn't the only problem.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.729
They've also caused mass chaos.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.230
[ALICE]
They will regret it.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:23.608
We'll resolve this one
problem at a time.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:28.237
Contain the blaze.

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.533
[CERTS gasp]

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.869
Hold your fire!
Show some respect!

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.371
Don't you recognize who this is?

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.332
[CERT G]
Princess Aliceliese?

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:40.958
[CERT H]
Wait, what is she doing here?

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:47.757
As first in line to the throne,
I will now assume

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:50.718
full command on behalf
of Queen Nebulis.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.388
All units, follow my orders,
and I will lead us safely

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.431
to victory!

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:56.474
[CERTS]
Ma'am!

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.809
[ALICE]
Rin.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:00.436
[RIN]
I am ready.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:01.812
Time's wasting.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.815
It's dangerous, but I know
you can handle this.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.317
Please take care.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.402
You're our only hope
of stopping him.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.365
I understand. I won't fail you.

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:22.333
The blaze isn't
from an astral spirit.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.126
Could it be a firebomb?

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:25.586
[MISMIS]
Iska!

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:26.629
[NENE]
Iska!

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.841
Captain! Nene! Jhin! Hey‐‐

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.885
[MISMIS cries]
I'm so relieved!

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:36.138
I'm sorry. If only I'd
been strong enough!

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.473
No. Not at all.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.476
I am 100% to blame
for everything.

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.853
The fire is going to
get us if we don't hurry.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:43.729
Let's go!

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:44.939
Wait, hold on, Jhin.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.983
You two as well.

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:48.276
[NENE]
What is it?

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.071
[ISKA]
Captain, If you would.

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:55.074
May I have my astral swords?

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.450
[MISMIS]
Here you go.

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:05.668
[ISKA] Thank you.
I need about 15 minutes.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.088
I want you to take these people,

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.716
get behind that big hotel,
and remain in place.

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:12.758
I'll meet you there!

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.635
Uh... What?

00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:15.928
Iska, wait!

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:23.352
[RIN]
Salinger! Show yourself!

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.938
[SALINGER]
How disappointing.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.982
I was expecting a warm welcome,

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.484
complete with cheers
and applause!

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:34.030
Instead, I get one measly
brown‐haired maid?

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:39.327
[RIN]
Salinger!

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:43.289
[SALINGER] Oh.
You may look like a maid,

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.958
but your form belies
that occupation.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.419
You're more than just
a domestic servant.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.047
[RIN] I won't explain
myself to a criminal!

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.174
A traitor! A dog.

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:55.635
A mage who attempted to
steal the beloved queen's

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.470
astral spirit!

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.263
For that you will die!

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:02.058
Steal it?
More like "collect" it.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:05.394
Being thought of as thief is
downright offensive to me.

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:06.771
What?

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:09.774
[SALINGER] A king collects
taxes from his people, yes?

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:10.775
I'm not a thief.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:13.361
I'm a mage king collecting
astral spirits as a form

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:15.946
of taxation.
Don't you see?

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.740
[RIN]
I only see a pretender.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:21.118
[SALINGER] To be precise,
for now, I am merely a king.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.663
Once I have amassed
all astral spirits,

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:26.165
I'll be something
far more powerful.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:27.583
That's enough!

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.794
You're nothing but a common,
conniving reprobate

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.254
who stole countless
astral spirits and arts!

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.715
You won't transcend
the Nebulis blood,

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.509
because I'll not let you!

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.344
[SALINGER]
We'll see about that.

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:41.097
[RIN] I think I've heard
more than I can stand.

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.640
Now get ready.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.934
Because you're going
back to your cell!

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:48.813
A wind element.

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:56.195
[SALINGER]
You're not half bad for a maid.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.826
[RIN] Clod of earth,
pulverize this man.

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.495
Hammer his maddening
face into a pulp!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.998
[SALINGER]
A Golem?

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.252
Ah, I see, so you're
an earth astral mage.

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:29.687
My, so fragile.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.654
I will bury you.

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:40.906
I heard you like it underground.

00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:02.344
[SALINGER] Sorry, but the
earth astral spirit I wield

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.263
is that of the purebreds.

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.640
Unfortunately for you,
your power is nothing

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.726
compared against mine.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.604
So you admit it?

00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:13.981
You stole from the royal family?

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:18.736
Salinger! How dare you?

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.363
If you lived forever,
you'd still never atone!

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:22.990
[SALINGER]
Stop barking, servant!

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:24.742
Just look at the
royal family now.

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.828
Born into extreme privilege,
they lack the strength of will

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.165
to elevate their astral spirits
and reach their true potentials.

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.958
How are they worthy rulers?

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.252
That is why I aspire to
reach heights they couldn't

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.712
even imagine.

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:40.966
Sing for me, pretty.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.182
[SALINGER]
How boring.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:50.726
This feels like torturing
a defenseless animal,

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:53.270
not fighting a worthy adversary.

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:57.274
You dare glower at me
in your condition?

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.609
I shall finish you.

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:06.200
What?

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.494
He slashed through
my invisible blast?

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.666
[RIN]
Imperial swordsman. You...

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:16.168
[ISKA]
I'll help, just this once.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.254
This white‐haired guy.

00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:20.714
He is Alice's enemy, right?
