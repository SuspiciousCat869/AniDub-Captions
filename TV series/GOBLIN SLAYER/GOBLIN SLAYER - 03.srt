00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,458
[NARRATOR] Long, long ago,
when the world was darker

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,083
and the sky lit by fewer stars,

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,833
the gods of light, order,
and destiny

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,541
and the gods of darkness,
chaos, and chance

5
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,291
vied to see which side

6
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,500
would be granted dominion
over the world.

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,750
Their struggle was played out
not in battle

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,541
but with the roll of the dice.

9
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,583
Their game continued for ages.

10
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,625
The gods rolled the dice over
and over and over again,

11
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,666
until they grew weary
and tired of their contest.

12
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:17,541
-Oh, wow. Look at her!
-Down boy.

13
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,166
Right. I'm sorry.

14
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,166
It looks like she's a high elf.

15
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,541
They're direct blood descendants
of the fairies.

16
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,791
Those ears,
just look how long they are.

17
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,291
Much longer than other elves.

18
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:32,250
-Where can I find Orcbolg?
-Oak? Like the tree?

19
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,208
No. Orc, as in "Orc."

20
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,250
Orcbolg.
I heard that he was here.

21
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,958
Are you referring
to an adventurer?

22
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,000
You fool. We're in the realm
of the humans now.

23
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,958
Your fancy long-ears talk
isn't going to help.

24
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,083
Oh? Then what exactly
should I call him?

25
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,458
His proper name, of course:
Beard-Cutter.

26
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,250
Sorry, there's no one here
by that name, either.

27
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,625
There isn't?

28
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,458
You dwarves have
as much imagination

29
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,041
as the rocks you work.

30
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,791
Always convinced you're
the ones who are right.

31
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,416
Ha! And what do you know
of the world?

32
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,666
With a heart as small
as your chest is flat.

33
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,541
At least I'm not barrel-shaped
like your dwarf women.

34
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,625
-I think you mean voluptuous!
-Now, please.

35
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,541
-Uh...
-If your quarreling isn't over,

36
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,583
I beg of you,
kindly go elsewhere

37
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,000
and spare the rest of us.

38
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,166
If my companions have
caused you trouble,

39
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,958
-I apologize.
-It's fine. I'm used to it.

40
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,958
[GUILD GIRL] Still, this is
quite an odd party:

41
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,416
A high elf traveling
with her ancestral foe, a dwarf,

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,541
and a member of the rarely
glimpsed lizardman race.

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,250
Plus, they're all silver-ranked.

44
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,625
As my comrades have said,
the one we seek is known

45
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,916
by the names Orcbolg
and Beard-Cutter.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,333
Sadly, the human tongue is not
my specialty, but translated...

47
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,291
I believe he is known
as the Goblin Slayer.

48
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,666
-[GUILD GIRL] Oh! Goblin Slay--
-Hmm?

49
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,750
-[footsteps approach]
-[armor clinking]

50
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,041
Wait! Hold on!

51
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,958
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] We're done.
-That's wonderful!

52
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,000
-Welcome back, Goblin Slayer!
-[gasping]

53
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,916
Our quest was successful!

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,041
I'm glad to see
you're both safe.

55
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,625
Well, more or less.

56
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,375
You were talking about goblins.
Where are they?

57
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,708
Um, well... ask them.

58
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,208
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Are you goblins?

59
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,125
Of course we're not.
But are you Orcbolg?

60
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,666
‘Cause you certainly
don't look it.

61
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,125
Why would I?
I've never been called that.

62
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,125
Sir Goblin Slayer, if we might
have a moment of your time,

63
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,875
there is something we would like
to discuss with you.

64
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,666
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Fine.
-In that case,

65
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,166
we do have some meeting rooms
available for use upstairs.

66
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,000
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Let's go.

67
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,500
Um, should I come
along with you?

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,458
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
You need rest.

69
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,958
Don't worry.
We'll have him back soon.

70
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,291
[patrons chattering]

71
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,541
[patrons chattering]

72
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,333
[sighs]

73
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,291
-Um, priestess?
-Yes?

74
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,166
Look, why don't you join us?

75
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,083
You're porcelain-ranked,
too, right?

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,708
Oh. It's very kind
of you to offer,

77
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,250
but I'm already
working with some--

78
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,416
Yes, the brooding one
who never removes his helmet.

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,083
We know that, but something
seems off about him.

80
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,416
He's silver-ranked,

81
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,791
but all he ever wants to do
is kill goblins.

82
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,583
Silvers would usually go
for bigger prey than that.

83
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,583
[CLERIC] I've heard that he's
just dragging beginners

84
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,666
around to use as goblin bait.

85
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,458
-That's not true!
-Now, now.

86
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,583
You're not spreading
rumors, are you?

87
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,416
[WARRIOR] I'm just trying
to warn her about him.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,958
[WITCH]
How noble. You go on.

89
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,166
I'll take it from here. Okay?

90
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,541
Now, dear. Tell me,

91
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,958
You're travelling with
the helmed one, is that true?

92
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,500
It is, ma'am,
when he allows it.

93
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,125
(chuckles)

94
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,083
[WITCH]
When he allows it, hmm?

95
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,125
That man,

96
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,291
he seems like a handful.

97
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:09,166
Rather dense, too, yes?

98
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,958
Inflammarae.

99
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,583
That's a powerful word
to throw around.

100
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,291
You think I'm wasting
a spell, hmm?

101
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:25,625
The thing is, dear, your friend
asked a strange favor of me

102
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,458
-once upon a time.
-(gasps)

103
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,375
You're imagining something
naughty, aren't you?

104
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,958
No. I'm not.

105
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,000
Apparently,
he required assistance

106
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,375
with a certain scroll.

107
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,750
It's hard,

108
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,500
travelling with a man
like that, is it not?

109
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,166
A bit.

110
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,583
It's taking everything I have
just to keep up with him.

111
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,166
And all I do is
cause him trouble.

112
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,333
And naturally, there's the fact
that he's a bit crazy, yes?

113
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,541
(coughs)

114
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,208
He's good, of course.

115
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,583
His only interest is
in slaying goblins,

116
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,583
but he's been honing his blade
for years now, you know?

117
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,541
There's no denying that he helps
to make the world a safer place,

118
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,000
much more so than those
of lesser skill

119
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,125
-who go after greater prey.
-(sneezes)

120
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,083
However, that being said,
it wouldn't hurt to hunt

121
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,250
something different
every once in a while.

122
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,625
The world is full of monsters.

123
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:30,000
Take the capital-- it's
positively overrun these days.

124
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,333
Demons.

125
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,416
If you want to help, you can.

126
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,750
Join those other two.
Why not?

127
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,250
There's more than one choice.

128
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,791
I could, but, it's just...

129
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,625
Little one, I'm sorry. I am.

130
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,708
There are so many paths. Yes?

131
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,916
And no clear answer, truly.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,750
It's difficult, life.

133
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,541
Still, if you are going
to accompany him,

134
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,750
take my advice,
and know your own mind.

135
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,500
Know my own mind?

136
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,291
[ARCHER] Are you truly an
adventurer of the silver rank?

137
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,083
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
The guild thinks so.

138
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,291
Then the guild must be wrong.

139
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,583
You look weak, and your
equipment is so shabby.

140
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,041
What do you know?

141
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,875
Before you speak, long-ears,
take a closer look.

142
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,208
That leather armor makes
for easier movement,

143
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,500
and the chain mail
and helmet provide protection

144
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,541
against blades
and blows to the head.

145
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,208
His sword and shield
may be small,

146
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,375
but they're also easy
to maneuver in tight spaces.

147
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,291
Well, it certainly
wouldn't kill you

148
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,125
to keep your equipment clean.

149
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,625
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It's a precaution to cover

150
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,833
the smell of metal.

151
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,666
Those bastards have keen noses.

152
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,416
Listen, you may be a high elf,

153
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,166
but you're still
an inexperienced whelp

154
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,291
who's out wandering the world
because she got bored

155
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,708
and doesn't have the sense
to listen to her elders.

156
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,666
I'm 2,000 years old.

157
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,875
And you're how old?

158
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,666
[SHAMAN]
One hundred and seven.

159
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,166
[giggles] Oh, my!
Is that all?

160
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,916
-You look older, much older.
-[grumbles]

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,333
Those wrinkles!
Poor man.

162
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,666
[groans] That's more than enough
talk about age.

163
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,666
It shames those of us
with shorter lifespans.

164
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,000
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
What's your business with me?

165
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,708
I'm sure you've heard by now

166
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,916
about the growing number
of demons in the capital.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,375
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] No.
-Leading them is a demon king.

168
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,000
He's been resurrected.

169
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,291
Now, he's gathering forces

170
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,250
because he wants
to take over the world.

171
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,083
-I see.
-That's why we came.

172
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,791
We need somebody
with your skills--

173
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,250
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Ask someone else.

174
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,333
I have no interest
in anything but goblins.

175
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,458
Don't you understand?

176
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,916
I'm saying hordes of demons
are going to attack!

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,541
Do you realize the entire world
is at stake here?

178
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,958
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yes.

179
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,250
But before the demons
destroy the world,

180
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,416
the goblins will destroy
the villages.

181
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,166
They can't be spared simply
because the world is in danger.

182
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,250
-How dare you!
-Easy!

183
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,666
Think about why we're here.

184
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,583
We didn't track him down
to ask for his help

185
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,583
dealing with the demons
themselves, remember?

186
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,250
Sir Goblin Slayer, we've come
to ask for your aid

187
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,333
with an infestation of goblins.

188
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,541
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
All right. Then, I accept.

189
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,500
Where are they?
How many?

190
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,666
How big is their nest?
Do they have a shaman or a hob?

191
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,375
What's with this guy?

192
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,125
[SHAMAN cackles]

193
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,166
As my companion has mentioned,

194
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,875
in the wake of
the demon king's resurrection,

195
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,875
an army of his minions
has gathered

196
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,291
and is preparing
to make its move.

197
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,458
So the chieftains of my kind,
the kings of men,

198
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,500
and the elders of the elves
and dwarves

199
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,666
have decided
to hold a conference.

200
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,416
[SHAMAN]
And we're the adventurers

201
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,833
who've been hired to act
as their representatives.

202
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,458
Eventually, a great battle
is going to be fought.

203
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,083
Although I'm sure you don't
care about that.

204
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,916
The goblins we mentioned
to you earlier

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,666
are currently becoming
more active on elven lands,

206
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,875
making a real nuisance
of themselves.

207
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,500
Have any champions or lords
emerged among them?

208
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,000
Champions? And lords?

209
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,583
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Goblin heroes or kings,

210
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,625
basically equal to
platinum-ranked adventurers.

211
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,750
I'm afraid I cannot answer that.

212
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,583
However, our search has turned
up one enormous nest.

213
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,250
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
And as usual,

214
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,541
the military won't deploy
for goblins.

215
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,458
The human kings may see us
as allies,

216
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,208
but they don't see us
as equals.

217
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,833
If we brought our soldiers
into this,

218
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,666
they would think
we were plotting something.

219
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,166
Which is why they sent us
adventurers.

220
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,458
But we still require a human
with goblin-slaying prowess.

221

So, out of everyone else,
we've chosen you, Orcbolg.

to offer you a mission?
