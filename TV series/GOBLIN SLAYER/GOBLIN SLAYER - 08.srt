[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Master, what should I do today?

3
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,791
[BURGLAR]
What should you do?

4
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,083
What kind of question is that,
you little idiot?

5
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,208
[grunts]

6
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,500
You got hit,
so now you hit back.

7
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,125
Destroy the goblins!

8
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,833
Those filthy critters
are smarter than they look.

9
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,250
Think you'll be able
to kill them, boy?

10
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,750
-I will.
-[BURGLAR laughs]

11
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,583
This from the useless
little wretch who just watched

12
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,750
while the goblins made his
darling sister their plaything.

13
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:11,375
Why didn't you attack
the goblins and make them stop?

14
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,541
Why didn't you take
your sister and run?

-[grunts]
-[rock clatters]

16
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,125
You were powerless,
so you chose to do nothing.

17
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,541
Did you think
it would be different

18
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,916
if you became stronger?

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,708
Because it won't, maggot!

20
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,875
Even if you do gain
a little power,

21
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,375
it'll just be for show.

22
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,291
Here one moment
and gone the next!

23
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,583
It's your actions,
not your strength

24
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,333
that will lead you to victory.

25
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,750
Yes, boy.
The moment you make the decision

26
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,500
to do something and act on it,
you win.

-[flame whooshes]

What you need is luck,
wisdom, and courage.

29
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,666
First decide whether or not
you're going to do something,

30
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,125
and then do it!

31
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,333
-Yes, master.
-[BURGLAR] Look above you.

32
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,166
I'm going to give you a riddle.

33
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,833
If you don't want to die,
answer quickly.

34
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,125
-Yes, master.
-[BURGLAR] Very good.

35
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,750
More just than the gods,

36
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,250
more vicious
than the evil deities,

37
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,250
the rich need me,
the poor need me not! What am I?

38
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,458
Better not get it wrong.
You'll be crushed if you do!

39
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,625
[GOBLIN SLAYER] It's nothing.
The answer is nothing!

40
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,166
[BURGLAR]
Correct! Time for another!

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,791
He may appear before you
at any time and in any place.

42
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,666
He will utter not a word,

43
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,000
and from his grasp
there can be no escape.

44
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,666
He is beside you even now.
Give up?

45
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,541
I know what the answer is.
It's Death!

46
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,500
Yes. Well done.

47
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,125
Finally, answer me this.
What am I carrying in my pocket?

48

[gasps]

49
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,833

[SWORD MAIDEN]
It appears you are awake.

56
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,458
Tell me.
How did you find the experience,

57
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,666
sharing a bed with me and her?

58
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,666
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Fine, I guess.

59
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,750
So I benefited from
the Miracle of Resurrection

60
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,458
by sleeping next to a virgin.

61
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,666
I see. So you've heard
about it before then.

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,458
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yes. I have.

63
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,041
[SWORD MAIDEN] Although, sadly,
unlike this young priestess,

64
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,208
I cannot be considered
pure anymore.

65
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,583
Was it goblins?

66
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,500
[SWORD MAIDEN]
Yes. It was about ten years ago.

67
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,750
I was captured
by a group of them.

68
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,708
[cries] I'm sorry.
This is hard to talk about.

69
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,583
Should I tell you
what they did to me,

70
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,458
after they took me
to their cave?

71
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:21,875
-I already know.
-I cried like a child,

72
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:26,333
screaming "It hurts! It hurts!"
over and over again.

73
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,666
I can still see, you know,
just a little.

74
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,750
It's blurry, but I can make out
the shape of your body.

75
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,625
Like a shadow,
that's how I perceive the world.

76

Suggestions of forms,
outlines of people

77
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,416
who seem like they might
slip away at any moment.

78
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,708
We're such weak creatures,
aren't we?

79
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,708
We humans.

80
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,666
I try not to let it show,
but I'm frightened.

81
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,208
Isn't that strange?
[chuckles]

82
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,041
I'm the Sword Maiden
and yet, I'm terrified.

83
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,125
I spend night after night
trembling with fear

84
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,500
and feeling
absolutely helpless.

85
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,541
Because this is the world
we live in.

86
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,500
No matter how much help we have,
it's never enough.

87
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,750
Though, I'm sure, no one else
would understand.

88
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,458

Really?

Huh?

"Really?" he says.

00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,041
Is something funny?

93
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,291
You don't see
the absurdity of it?

94
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,750
I'm an archbishop,

95

the woman who defeated
the Demon Lord.

96
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,416
And yet I'm scared to death

97
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,625
of wretched little creatures
like goblins.

98
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,708
Please.

99
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,750
Will you help?

Yeah. Don't worry.

Are you...

maybe pushing yourself too hard?

114

Why do you ask that?

you seem different somehow.

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
No. Nothing has changed.

118

Okay. If you say so, I guess.

How are you?
Better?

Seems they healed up
well enough.

123
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,083
Those were some pretty
nasty wounds, though.

124
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,666
A close call.

Thank goodness the resurrection
was performed in time.

much closer to dying

than any of the rest of us were.

you wouldn't tell him that!

Well, with the two of you
feeling better,

we should be able to continue

it would be better

That's right. We had a promise,
don't you remember?

After the battle, we'd all sit
down and enjoy a meal together.

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Hmm?

keep your promises.

00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,625
We'll head back underground and
continue scouting the sewers.

160
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,625
-[PRIESTESS] Uh, but--
-With the shape your gear's in,

161
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,208
you'd be a liability down there.
We can't risk it.

162
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,125
I guess you're right. Thanks.

163
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,958
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Thanks.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,416
[villagers chattering]

165
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,916
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Want me to carry that?

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,791
No, it's fine. I've got it.

167
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,458
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see.

168
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,875
[PRIESTESS]
The others will be okay

169
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,375
down there without us, right?

170
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,875
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah.

171
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,958
And, um, you feel fine?
No pain?

172
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,166
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah.

173
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,583
Good.
Don't push yourself too hard.

174
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,083
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah.

175
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,375
What's wrong?

176
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,708
[PRIESTESS] "What's wrong?"
Are you kidding me?

177
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,083
What's wrong is you seem
incapable of answering me

178
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,166
-with anything other than yeah!
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] I see.

179
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,833
-And not just today.
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] I see.

180
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,083
[PRIESTESS]
You say that all the time, too!

181
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,166
[GOBLIN SLAYER sighs]
I... I'll try to stop.

182
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,833
See that you do.

183
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,041
[giggles]

184
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,916
So, earlier you mentioned

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,041
there were some errands
you wanted to run?

186
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,666
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah.
-[grumbles]

187
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,375
I'm going to look at weapons
and armor since mine

188
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,791
since mine were damaged
in the battle.

189
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,125
What are you going to do?

190
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,708
My chain mail got torn,

191
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,208
so I was hoping I'd be able
to find an armorer in town

192
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,458
who could repair it for me.

193
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,625
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It'd be faster to replace it.

194
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,708
[PRIESTESS]
Maybe, but I'd rather not.

195
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,583
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Why's that?
-Well, it's special.

196
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,708
You know what, this chain mail
is the first thing

197
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,333
you ever complimented me on.

198
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,750
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see.

199
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,875
I guess you're right.

200
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,166
[BLACKSMITH]
This has a huge hole in it.

201
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,083
You'd be better off
buyin' a new one.

202
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,000
No. Please, sir. I'd really
prefer to have it repaired.

203
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,208
Yeah, Yeah.
You're the customer.

204
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,333
[coughs]
Mm-hmm!

205
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,375
Maybe I should do
a fitting, too.

206
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,750
Huh?
No! No, thank you!

207
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,916
-Mmm-- [grunts]
-[bag thuds]

208
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,708
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I need these repaired.

209
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,250
[BLACKSMITH] Whoa.
A silver rank?

210
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,708
[GOBLIN SLAYER] It's leather
armor and a round shield.

211
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,458
I need it done
as soon as possible,

212
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,166
along with that chain mail.

213
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,416
Um, sure, but for a rush job,
the fee will be a bit higher.

214
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,833
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] That's fine.
-[coins clink]

215
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,916
Oh! That ought to do,
thank you, sir.

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I'm going
to look at your swords.

217
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,541
This one.
It's a bit long,

218
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,208
but I'll shorten it myself
with your whetstone.

219
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,875
I'd choose another, sir.

220
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,291
Killing goblins is the only
thing that's sword's good for.

221
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,875
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I'll be using it
to kill goblins.

222
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,333
Uh...

223
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,541
[MERCHANT]
Fruit for the little one?

224
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,625
-[bell ringing]
-Hey, kids.

225
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,666
Who wants some tasty ice cream?
Nice and cold!

226
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,000
Get your ice cream here!

227
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,541
-[laughing]
-[PRIESTESS] Ice cream?

228
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,583
-I wonder what that is.
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] I'm not sure.

229
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,791
But considering how many kids
are gathered around that stall,

230
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,333
it's likely something sweet.

231
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,291
[PRIESTESS]
Hmm?

232
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,916
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Go ahead.
-Oh, really? Thank you so much!

233
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
[giggles]

234
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,541
[kids chattering excitedly]

235
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,625
-[boy] Look!
-[girl] Oh, it's sprinkles!

236
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,708
[gasps] Amazing!

237
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:45,333
It's so cold and sweet.
I've never had anything like it!

238
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,833
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] It's good?
-Yes! Wonderful!

239
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,750
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see.

240
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,000
Hmm...

241
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,500
So it's a type
of frozen dessert.

242
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,791
I've never seen
a spell like this.

243
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,333
How is it accomplished?

244
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,208
[MERCHANT] Well, it's
pretty fascinating, actually.

245
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,500
A scientist found
that adding a certain mixture

246
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,458
-freezes it right up.
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Huh.

247
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,250
[MERCHANT]
So that got me thinking.

248
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,208
What would happen
if I froze up some milk?

249
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,041
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see. That was very helpful.

250
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,041
Give me one. Keep the change.

251
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,250
[MERCHANT gasps]
Thank you, sir!

252
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,000
-[PRIESTESS chuckles]
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] What?

253
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,166
Nothing.
I've just always wondered

254
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,541
where you learned
all of those random facts.

255
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,583
Guess now I know.

256
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,583
[water trickling]

257
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,625
[PRIESTESS]
It's strange, isn't it?

258
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,333
No one here has any idea

259
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,625
that goblins are running around
right under their feet.

260
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,250
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah.

261
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,583
[PRIESTESS] Though there were
those attacks in the city.

262
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,583
I'm sure plenty of people
were scared after that.

263
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,666
You know?

264
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,583
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
When I was young,

265
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:51,750
there was a time when I thought
if I took a single step,

266
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,166
the ground would open up
beneath me and I would die.

267
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,166
It got so bad that eventually,
I was scared to walk at all.

268
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,083
Such a thing isn't impossible,

269
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,583
but it's not something
anyone ever worries about.

270
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,750
That was strange to me.

271
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,250
Plenty of people
laughed at me for it.

272
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,375
But eventually, I realized
I still have to walk,

273
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,208
no matter how scared I am.

274
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,375
Is that something
you still believe?

275
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,458
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yes. It is.

276
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:26,166
Even now, years later,
I'm still terrified.

277
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,958
I am thankful
that you're helping me.

278
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,750
But you know
you're not required to.

279
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,208
Hmm?

280
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,583
I told you, I'm going to do
whatever it is I want to do.

281
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,500
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Did you?
-Don't tell me you forgot.

282
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:55,125
You know,
you are absolutely hopeless.

283
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:00,583
-[GOBLIN SLAYER chuckles] Sorry.
-I didn't ask for an apology.

284
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,083
[GOBLIN SLAYER laughs]
Sorry.

285
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,500
[PRIESTESS]
I sort of understand, though.

286
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,166
We can't help the things
we're scared of.

287
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,791
-[yelps]
-That's cold!

288
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,833
[sighs]

289
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,916
[gulps]

290
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,583
[whimpers]

291
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,416
We should probably be
on our way. Shall we head back?

292
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,166
[SPEARMAN]
There you are, Goblin Slayer!

293
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,041
You've got some nerve
summoning us here with a letter.

294
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,416
You're lucky I didn't
mention it to the Guild Girl.

295
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,333
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Mention what?
-That you keep going on

296
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,375
overnight trips
with another woman.

297
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,750
[WITCH]
Calm yourself.

298
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,083
Remember, it was I
who was summoned, not you.

299
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:42,458
-Um... Hello.
-[WITCH] You seem well.

300
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,791
That makes me happy.

301
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,750
Yes! I'm fine.

302
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,208
We had some business
near this town,

303
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,208
so he came too.
Now...

304
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,625
-go on.
-Woman!

305
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,458
[grunts] There.

306
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,333
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Thanks. This will do.

307
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,791
[SPEARMAN]
I'm not a delivery boy, damn it.

308
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,083
I'm not doing
any more errands for you.

309
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,708
[WITCH]
But why did you send for this?

310
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,291
You could have
