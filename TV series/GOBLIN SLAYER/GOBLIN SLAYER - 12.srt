you're both so naive.

pretty frightening

there's a goblin slayer here.

to whoever that is

that it's even possible
for the festival to happen?

indeed, Beard-cutter.

319
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:54,317
Come on! Would ya
get outta the way?

320
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
As I suspected, he's a
rather handsome fellow.

321
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:00,067
Yes? Nice.

322
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,775
All I can think is I've
seen him somewhere before.

323
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:05,442
[SPEARMAN growls]
Pisses me off!

324
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:08,108
[GUILDSMAN 12A] Hey, Goblin
Slayer showed his face!

325
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,608
We need to look at
the ol' betting pool!

326
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:11,733
[GUILDSMAN 12B]
Damn it!

327
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:14,108
I thought he'd turn
out to be a woman!

328
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:16,400
[GUILDSWOMAN 12A] Well, I put my
money on him being a goblin!

329
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,775
[GUILDSMAN 12C] Crazy! Did
anybody actually get it right?

330
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:22,108
'Cause whoever did is
buying the next round!

331
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:26,650
[PRIESTESS] Everyone here
tonight, they all helped.

332
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,442
Remember that in the future.

333
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:30,775
People are kind.

334
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:32,108
What I'm saying is,

335
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:35,192
it's not about luck, you know?

336
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:38,525
I hear you.

337
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,942
I hope you're right.

338
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:27,942
[NARRATOR]
This adventurer appeared to be

339
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:30,150
just an ordinary young man,

340
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,942
the kind of person that
could be found anywhere.

341
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:36,275
And although the gods may
be seemingly in his favor,

342
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:39,567
they were not expecting
greatness from him.

343
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,525
For if a man such as he
could be found anywhere,

344
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:45,275
what special traits
could he possess?

345
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:47,525
However, this
particular adventurer

346
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:49,942
does have something
unique about him:

347
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:51,692
his single-mindedness.

348
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:54,067
His brain is
constantly in motion,

349
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,192
always thinking of strategies.

350
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,150
And what's more, he's constantly
training for action

351
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:01,400
and never runs from a challenge.

352
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:03,733
He's not the type
of person to sit back,

353
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,817
let the gods roll the dice,
and be content with that.

354
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,358
One day, the gods finally
realized something:

355
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:13,358
this adventurer would likely
never save the world

356
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:16,525
or even change things
on a meaningful level.

357
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,192
They thought him a pawn,

358
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:21,108
and the world is full
of people like him.

359
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,692
But still, he would
never sit idly by

360
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:26,817
and wait for the gods
to roll the dice.

361
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,067
And that's why even they,
in all their divine wisdom,

362
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,858
could never plot his course.

363
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:35,525
They can't know the fate of
this particular adventurer.

364
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:39,192
[NARRATOR] The only
thing that is certain...

365
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:43,983
...somewhere out there,
his battle still continues.
