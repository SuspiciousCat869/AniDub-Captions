When I was a child,

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,000
I thought I'd grow up
to become an adventurer.

3
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,916
I'd leave my village
and fight the monsters

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,541
that were tormenting people.

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:31,583
Eventually, I'd become strong
enough to defeat even dragons.

6
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,583
I'd become a hero,
a platinum-ranked adventurer.

7
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,458
Right. Once this is over,
I want us to go to a festival,

8
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,541
back in the village,
all three of us.

Everyone has wishes like that,

to accomplish,

[GOBLIN SLAYER] Even if
I couldn't become a hero...

17
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:15,625
I thought someday I'd travel
afar as an adventurer.

If only I could leave behind
the older sister

After that,
I even get to go shopping!

24

I can't wait to see what
they have at all the stores!

25

My mom even gave me money
to buy something!

I wonder what all
I should get.

I just told you,
I don't want anything.

You don't have to be

I just wanted
to do something special

to the city before.

Still, you shouldn't have
gotten so angry with her.

You have to protect
those smaller than you.

if you envy others,
you'll become a goblin.

-Really? A goblin?
-[SISTER] Yes.

If all you ever do is dwell
on what you don't have,

your heart and body will warp
into something ugly,

and you'll take your anger
out on other people.
