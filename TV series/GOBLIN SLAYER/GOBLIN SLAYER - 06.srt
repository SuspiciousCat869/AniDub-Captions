00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,333
out on an errand late at night.

166
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,333
Her corpse was discovered
in an alleyway the next morning.

167
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,500
The reports said it looked
as though

168
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,083
she was sliced apart
while still alive.

169
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,625
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Still alive?

170
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,000
-So it happened right there?
-[SWORD MAIDEN] Mm-hmm.

171
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,375
Did the goblins eat parts of her

172
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,625
or was she only murdered?

173
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,791
[HIGH ELF ARCHER sighs]

174
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,083
Just let her talk.

175
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,083
Continue.

176
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,250
That attack was
just the beginning.

177
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,041
I had the city guard
extend their patrols,

178
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,125
but our crime rate
rapidly increased.

179
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,958
Women assaulted.

180
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,541
Children kidnapped.

181
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,166
And all, apparently, the work
of cutthroats or thieves.

182
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,583
But after one such attack was
interrupted by an adventurer,

183
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,791
a shocking discovery was made.

184
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,458
The corpse of
the small would-be assassin

185
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,666
wasn’t human.

186
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,541
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
A goblin?

187
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,541
Goblins, huh?

188
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,791
And more than a few of the nasty
things by the sound of it.

189
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,166
How do you think that many of
them have gotten into the town?

190
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,625
Surely they would have
been stopped

191
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,250
if they’d tried to enter
through the gates.

192
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,708
[DWARF SHAMAN] Maybe they
tunneled up from underground,

193
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,166
or used the waterways.

194
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,708
Seems like a lot of casualties

195
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,000
if they were just
passing through.

196
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,916
Goblins always make their nests

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,666
beneath the surface,
do they not?

198
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,250
This town was built on top
of an old settlement,

199
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,708
so there are probably some ruins
below the newer construction.

200
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:34,083
[GOBLIN SLAYER] If I were them,
I would settle there.

201
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,458
They aren’t bright creatures,
but they’re not total fools.

202
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,708
There you go again.

203
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
You’re always thinking
like a goblin.

204
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,958
Of course I am.

205
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,416
If I didn’t know
how they thought,

206
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,833
I wouldn’t be very good
at fighting them.

207
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,583
[SWORD MAIDEN]
Like you,

208
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,666
we concluded that they
were living under the city,

209
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,250
and sent out a quest for the
Water Town adventurers, but...

210
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,583
[PRIESTESS]
What happened to them?

211
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,708
Oh...

212
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,416
-I see.
-And that was when I heard

-the ballad of the brave

214

and honorable Goblin Slayer,
the hero of the frontier.

215
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,708
What ballad?

216
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,625
You mean you didn’t know?

217
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,666
You’ve been
immortalized in song.

218
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,875
Meeting you in person
was pretty disappointing.

219
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,083
That’s not my problem.

220
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,208
Come now, Sir Goblin Slayer.

221
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,541
Tales of bravery survive thanks
to the bards who sing of them.

222
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,041
Why does that matter?

223
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,875
Do you truly not understand
how these things work?

224
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,333
The more that word of your deeds
spreads throughout the land,

225
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,208
the more requests
you’ll get to do the goblin

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Hmm...

228
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,708
I beg of you.

229
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,416
Kind sir, will you please save

230
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,750
Water Town from these creatures
and their depravity?

231
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,541
Your town may already be lost,

232
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,500
but I’ll kill some goblins.

234
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,916
Can’t you be
a little more tactful?!

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,250
It’s the truth.

236
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,166
[PRIESTESS]
And that’s exactly why you

237
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,666
should be more sensitive!

238
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,541
Shall we head to the sewers,
then, Sir Goblin Slayer?

239
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,875
Yes.

240
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,708
We’ll need to be careful
and thorough.

241
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,541
It would be annoying
if one of them got away.

And remember, no using water,
fire, or poison!

-I know.
-Hm.

Forgive me for asking,
but why have you not ordered

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,333
the city guard
to eradicate them for you?

246
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,708
Admittedly, there is much

247
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,500
I do not know about
this town and its ways,

248
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,833
but surely that would fall
under their jurisdiction.

[SWORD MAIDEN]
Well...

250

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Were you told there was no point

blame them.

There are still plenty of demons

running around the capital,
after all.

256

With the military spread thin,

257
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,083
goblin slaying is a job
for us adventurers.

The difficulties that arise
from money and politics

never cease to amaze me.

I believe that your best option

will be to access the sewers

by going down the well
behind this temple.

Mostly.

270
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,000
It’s an old sketch dating back

to when the temple
was first built.

272

But still, the waterways
should be intact there.

it won’t be too severe.

00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:30,125
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I was told not
to use water, fire or poison.

486
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,125
My options were a bit limited.

487
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,750
[HIGH ELF ARCHER]
They may not be smart,

488
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,375
but I can’t believe
that’s all it took to fool them.

489
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,916
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
The goblins learned to associate

490
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,458
light with groups of adventurers

491
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,041
because we always travel by it.

492
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,625
[HIGH ELF ARCHER]
Really?

493
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,250
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I’m not sure
when they figured it out,

494
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,333
but it’s commonly
known among them now.

495
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,375
Their kind are nothing
more than scavengers.

496
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,000
They’d never think of building
anything on their own.

497
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,750
Again, they aren’t
bright creatures,

498
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,250
but they’re not total fools.

499
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,791
They learn how to use
items quickly.

500
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,208
If they were shown a boat,

501
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,208
it wouldn’t take them
long to learn to use it.

502
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,208
Well, aren’t you
Mister Knowledgeable?

503
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,958
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I’ve studied them.

504
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,541
This is why I make sure never to
give the goblins any new ideas.

505
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,083
I kill them instead.

506
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,083
You think...somebody showed them

507
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,791
how to use the boats...
intentionally?

508
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,041
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Yes.
-[PRIESTESS] But...

509
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,666
isn’t it also possible
they had a goblin shaman

510
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,375
who figured it out for them?

511
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,000
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Could be.

512
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,041
But if their numbers increased
naturally down there,

513
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,875
why didn’t they know
about the...

514
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,250
what was that thing
called again?

515
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,875
[PRIESTESS] The, um,
swamp dragon, you mean?

516
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,333
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah, that.

517
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,125
The goblins didn’t
know about it.

518
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,375
If they had, I don’t think they
would’ve dared to use boats.

519
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,208
They’re cowards by nature.

520
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,083
[LIZARDMAN PRIEST]
What exactly are you suggesting,

521
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,666
Sir Goblin Slayer?

522
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,208
The goblin population here

523
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,375
isn’t the result of them
multiplying naturally.

524
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,625
Someone...or something

525
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,791
orchestrated this infestation.

526
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,708
[growling]
