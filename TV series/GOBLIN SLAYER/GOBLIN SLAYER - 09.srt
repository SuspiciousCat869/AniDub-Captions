162
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,416
Time to work, you crafty gnomes.

163
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,791
Mash grains of sand together
to form mighty rock!

-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Thanks.

-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Use Holy Light!

Okay. Hear me,

167

171

Turn upside down
and spill to the ground.

-[ARCHER panting]

180
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,166
[ARCHER] No thanks to
Mr. Strategic Genius over there.

181
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,041
Was that your plan, Orcbolg?

182
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,458
[PRIESTESS]
It was a little scary.

183
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,375
-That's all you have to say?
-I guess, I mean,

184
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,416
I think I'm getting used
to this adventuring thing.

185
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,166
-[whines] This isn't normal.
-[PRIEST] My heavens.

186
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,500
We had the gate mirror
to protect us, thankfully.

187
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,916
It absorbed most of the debris
and falling rubble,

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,250
though it did prove
to be rather heavy.

189
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,875
Yes. You held most of the weight
back there, Scaly.

190
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,791
I almost feel bad for
the unsuspecting creatures

191
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,125
on the other side.

192
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,208
I wonder if this is how people
traveled long distances

193
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,875
in the olden times.

194
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,500
Eh, Beard-cutter?
What do you think?

195
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,500
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] I don't know.
-We're very lucky

196
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,791
we weren't underneath
the city when we did that.

197
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,583
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
If we had been,

198
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,791
I would have thought
of another plan.

199
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,333
-So...
-What is it?

200
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,291
[GOBLIN SLAYER] No fire, water,
poison or explosions.

201
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,333
True.
Do you want a little reward?

you've returned safely.

209
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,333
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I have a question.

210
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,208
Yes? What would you like to ask?

211
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:36,083
If it's within my power
to answer you, I will do so.

212
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,958
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
You knew what was down there.

213
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,666
-Didn't you?
-[SWORD MAIDEN gasps]

214
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,708
[SWORD MAIDEN]
Yes. You're exactly right.

215
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,541
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see.

216
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,041
[SWORD MAIDEN]
But how did you figure that out?

217
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,833
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I didn't.

218
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,875
I planned to ask everyone who's
in a position to know the truth

219
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,541
until I was satisfied.

220
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,083
Oh.

221
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,083
Well, then,
I gave myself away.

222
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:04,500
Perhaps in the future, I will
learn to be less forthcoming.

223
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,625
It is somewhat flattering
you'd ask me first.

224
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,291
I assume you had your reasons.

225
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,041
May I ask why you suspected me?

226
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,875
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Several reasons.

227
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,958
The white beast.
What was it called?

228
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,375
[SWORD MAIDEN]
The alligator?

229
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,833
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yes, that's the one.

230
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,583
I don't believe it was
an accident we encountered it.

231
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,041
[SWORD MAIDEN] You're suggesting
someone controls it?

232
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,500
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It tried to chase us away, yes.

233
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,291
But it also attacked
the goblins.

234
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,458
Listen to you.

235
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,583
Are you observant
or simply paranoid?

236
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,875
[GOBLIN SLAYER] Well, despite
how elaborate the ruins are,

237
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,125
you provided no precise maps.

238
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,916
And there are
no rat-killing quests.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,833
In fact,
adventurers avoid the sewers.

240
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,250
But something was
patrolling down there.

241
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,791
You seem rather knowledgeable
about our adventurers.

242
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,000
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I did my research.

243
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,791
[SWORD MAIDEN sighs]

244
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,416
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Back to the point:

245
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,583
I knew something had to be
guarding the sewers.

246
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,333
That creature...

247
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,958
it's your familiar.

248
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,625
Shameful, isn't it?

249
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,500
That the messenger
of the Supreme God

250
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,833
should protect the city,
and the city alone.

251
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,000
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
You must have known.

252
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,916
Killing women, ripping out
entrails on the street,

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,500
and then leaving
the corpses behind--

254
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,208
that's not what goblins
usually do.

255
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,375
Indeed.

256
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,208
[SWORD MAIDEN] They bring
their prey back to the nest,

257
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,041
so they can toy with them.

258
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,500
Death is not something
that comes quickly.

259
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,041
The minions of the Demon Lord
were doing

260
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,541
their master's bidding.

261
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,416
They were plotting to do
something with the mirror.

262
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,916
But now their lord...

263
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,791
no longer exists.

264
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:14,750
Thanks to a hero
in an entirely different place,

265
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,375
and in another time.

266
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:23,208
And yet, if goblins
were to attack me here,

267
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,041
I would surely break.

268
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,750
I would not fight, only weep.

269
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,916
I knew they were moving
under the city.

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,458
And I'd heard that
the Evil Sect was to blame.

271
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,791
They long for revenge.

272
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,916
I could face that,
but not goblins.

273
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,208
But, then, who could I tell?

274
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,250
I'm the Sword Maiden after all.

275
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,875
How could I ask for protection
from mere goblins?

276
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,541
No one would take me seriously.

277
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,833
So, what now?
What will you do with me?

278
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,791
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Nothing.
-[gasps]

279
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,416
Because you're not a goblin.

280
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,291
[SWORD MAIDEN] Is that why
you're not going to ask

281
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,541
for my motives?

282
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,833
[GOBLIN SLAYER] If you want
to talk, I'll listen.

283
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,541
I longed for understanding.

284
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,583
[wind whooshing]

285
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,125
I wanted people to know my fear,

286
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:31,291
and that the world is a painful,
terrifying place.

287
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,291
They need to know
what to be afraid of

288
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,250
and that no one is safe.

289
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:40,708
There is much malevolence and
such atrocities in this world.

290
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,125
But in the end,

291
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,291
no one gave a second thought
to the goblins.

292
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,791
You may have the gate mirror
if you like.

293
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,625
Just tell me you understand.

294
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,708
Of all the people
on this planet, surely you do.

295
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,333
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I got rid of the mirror.

296
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,875
[gasps]
That was an ancient relic,

297
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,125
a priceless treasure
worth a fortune.

298
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,916
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Best to get rid of it

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,500
before other goblins learn
how to use it.

300
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,791
We encased the mirror
in concrete

301
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,416
and sank it in the canal.

302
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,416
It'll make a good bed for...

303
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,333
whatever you call
that white beast.

304
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,708
[SWORD MAIDEN gasps]

305
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,250
[laughs softly]

306
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,958
Naturally,
you never cease to amaze me.

307
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,041
I dare say
you may be unstoppable.

308
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,791
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Perhaps.

309
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,583
[SWORD MAIDEN] Please,
may I ask you one more thing?

310
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,458
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I can't promise an answer.

311
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,500
Has anything changed

312
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,708
since you started
slaying goblins?

313
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,416
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Like what?

314
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,208
If the hero is able
to slay the Demon Lord,

315
