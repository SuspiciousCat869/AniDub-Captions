00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,583
[COW GIRL]
Hey!

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,000
I’m gonna go into the city.

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,875
One of the cows
on my uncle’s farm

4
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,833
is giving birth
and I wanna be there.

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,333
I’m going all by myself!

6
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,583
After that,

7
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,208
I even get to go shopping!

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,208
I can’t wait to see what they
have at all the stores!

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,208
My mom even gave me money
to buy something!

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,791
I wonder what all
I should get.

11
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,541
Is there anything you want me
to look for?

12
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,625
I’d love to buy you a gift--

13
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,625
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
No.

14
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, are you sure?

15
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,291
There’s gotta be--

16
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,208
I just told you
I don’t want anything.

17
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,541
You don’t have to be mean
about it.

18
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,666
I just wanted to do
something special.

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,708
Since you’ve never been
to the city before.

20
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:47,791
‘Cause that’s what friends do.

21
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,375
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Shut up.

22
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,166
Just go to the city or whatever
it is you’re doing.

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,500
Why are you so angry?

24
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,791
-I’m not angry.
-Yes, you are!

25
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,458
-Calm down.
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Sis.

26
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,583
The two of you
shouldn’t be fighting.

27
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,458
[GOBLIN SLAYER ] We weren’t.
We were only talking.

28
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,791
-Right?
-Sure. That’s right.

29
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,750
[OLDER SIS]
You’re sure you’re okay?

30
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,208
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah, it’s nothing.

31
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,666
[OLDER SIS]
All right then.

32
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,875
If you say so.

33
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,458
[COW GIRL MOM] Please take
good care of her for me.

34
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,875
[COW GIRL UNCLE]
I will.

35
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,041
How long are you
going to pout for?

36
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,333
I thought you were looking
forward to going into the city.

37
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,958
[COW GIRL]
Yeah, but...

38
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,166
I wanted to go with him.

39
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,166
Or, if he couldn’t come,
I wanted to buy him something.

40
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,000
But then he got really angry.

41
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,666
And for no reason, either.

42
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,833
[COW GIRL UNCLE] I’m sure
the boy wanted to come as well.

43
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,625
Think of how he must feel.

44
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,333
Did you two make up?

45
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,791
If not, you should
when you get back.

46
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,833
[COW GIRL] I wanted us
to not be fighting.

47
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,958
I wanted to apologize.

48
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:58,500
But, sometimes it can be hard
to say you’re sorry.

49
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,583
[COW GIRL]
Even now.

50
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,416
It’s not easy.

51
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,708
[yawns]

52
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey, there!
Morning!

53
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,666
I see you’re up early again.

54
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,000
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah.

55
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,291
[COW GIRL]
The weather’s so nice today.

56
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,625
The sun feels great on my skin.

57
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,916
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,500
Do you know if my uncle
is awake already?

59
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,333
-I don’t know.
-Oh, well.

60
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,916
If he isn’t around by now, then
I’m sure he will be pretty soon.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,666
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
S’pose so.

62
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,208
You must be hungry.

63
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,625
I’ll go start on breakfast.

64
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,416
We can eat together.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,041
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Sounds good.

66
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,375
[COW GIRL]
It’s the same thing every day.

67
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,208
Goblins usually move around
at night

68
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,208
and return to their nests
in the morning.

69
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,125
So, at dawn, he checks
our land to see

70
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,791
if he can find
any footprints.

71
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,416
Goblins always scout the area
they plan to attack,

72
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,166
so any disturbance is
a warning of trouble.

73
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,166
If he sees any sort of tracks,

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,958
then we’ll know to be
extra careful for a while.

75
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,041
He always checks the fence, too.

76
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,958
Just to see if there are any
parts that have come loose

77
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,000
or been damaged
since the day before.

78
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,291
‘Cause, of course,
that’s a bad sign.

79
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,166
If anything is broken,
he makes the repairs himself.

80
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,000
He keeps our farm
and everyone in it safe.

81
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,708
Our valiant guardian.

82
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,000
It’s been this way
for five years,

83
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,250
since he first
came to stay with us.

84
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,000
His daily routine.

85
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,333
And, here you go!

86
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,250
[COW GIRL UNCLE]
Smells good, as usual.

87
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,916
-Thank you.
-Eat it while it’s still hot!

88
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,500
Huh?

89
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,375
[GOBLIN SLAYER slurps]

90
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,916
Taste good?
I hope you like it.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,083
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah.

92
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,458
-[slurping]
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Here.

93
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,250
Rent money.

94
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,333
It’s heavy this month.

95
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,708
Being an adventurer must
be pretty lucrative.

96
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,166
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Sometimes.

97
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,625
I’ve had a lot of work lately.

98
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,000
[COW GIRL UNCLE]
Apparently.

99
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:35,208
Right, so, will you be
going out again today?

100
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,375
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yes. I’m visiting the guild.

101
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,875
They’ve got plenty of work.

102
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,125
Not surprised.

103
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,625
Well, don’t push yourself
too hard.

104
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,416
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I won’t.

105
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,833
Hey!
I need to make a few deliveries.

106
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,000
I should go with you!

107
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,750
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
If you’d like.

108
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,291
Well, in that case,

109
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,833
I’ll go get the wagon
ready for you.

110
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,875
[COW GIRL] Don’t worry, Uncle.
We’ll be fine.

111
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,666
I know how overprotective
you can be.

112
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,000
I’ve got this.

113
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,125
I’m a lot stronger than I look,
you know.

114
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,625
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Do you need help?

115
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,958
I’m fine.
It’s not that hard.

116
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,750
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Okay.
-[COW GIRL] Thank you, though.

117
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,041
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It’s nothing.

118
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,666
So, how have things been lately?

119
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,041
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Too many goblins.

120
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,500
Really?

121
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,791
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
An unusual amount.

122
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,875
-You must be busy.
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah.

123
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,541
You have been going
out more, much more.

124
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,708
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Yeah.

125
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,250
Having lots of work
is a good thing.

126
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,333
-You make more coin.
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] No. It’s bad.

127
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,416
What do you mean?

128
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,416
[GOBLIN SLAYER] It’s better
when there are no goblins.

129
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,666
[COW GIRL]
Right. Of course.

130
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,750
[MAYOR]
Please, you gotta help me.

131
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,958
Those goblin critters
came to my village.

132
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,000
If somethin’ don’t happen,
they’ll eat my cows

133
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,416
an’ burn my fields to ashes!

134
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
So you need an exterminator.

135
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,958
No problem.

136
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,125
I’ll just need your completed
form and payment.

137
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,708
Yes.
Of course, ma’am.

138
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,250
Here you are.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,333
Seems like everything
is in order.

140
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,875
I’ll just have to count out your
payment to confirm the quest.

141
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,416
Two. Four. Eight. Ten.

142
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Twelve.
Great.

143
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,125
Looks like it’s all here.

144
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,750
So rest assured an adventurer
will come out to your farm

145
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,291
to take care
of the problem soon.

146
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,750
Is it really true those
little monsters treat women

147
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,208
like their playthings,
and then eat ‘em up afterwards?

148
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,791
Well, yes, there have been cases
reported of that happening.

149
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,625
[GUILD GIRL sighs heavily]

150
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,416
Another goblin quest?

151
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,583
That makes three already.

152
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,625
What’s the pay?

153
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,875
Welp.

154
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,125
Hope they don’t want someone
with experience.

155
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,916
‘Cause that’s pretty pathetic.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,875
[GUILD GIRL]
No, he'll still take it.

157
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,875
Money’s not an issue to him.

158
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,625
Thanks for the prompt delivery.

159
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,500
[COW GIRL]
No problem!

160
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,583
It was my pleasure.

161
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:05,458
I need to get a signature over
at the reception desk.

162
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,583
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
All right.

163
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,916
Get this.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,875
There was this troll, right,
a huge sucker.

165
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,875
But I was able to
dodge his attacks.

166
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,291
Got ‘em with my spear
before he knew what hit him.

167
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,791
[GUILD GIRL]
Oh, wow. Nicely done, sir.

168
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,250
I’m well-aware that trolls
are powerful foes

169
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,916
and that I should
be impressed by this.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,916
I took down a troll with nothing
but my bravery and a spear.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,458
I’m not bragging,
it’s just true.

172
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,625
Uh-huh. If you’re feeling tired,
I’d recommend this.

173
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,041
Our new stamina potions
are best-sellers here.

174
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,583
I’ll take whatever
you’re selling.

175
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,041
[gasps]

176
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,958
Ah! The Goblin Slayer?

177
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,750
[MALE ADVENTURER]
That’s him?

178
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,375
[ELF] He’s the weirdo who only
takes goblin-related missions.

179
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:51,000
That big idiot gives
silver-ranks like us a bad name.

180
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,666
If all he hunts is goblins,

181
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,750
I doubt he could
handle anything bigger.

182
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,125
I’m surprised
they even ranked him up.

183
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,500
Just ignore that guy.

184
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,833
Our paths’ll never cross.

185
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,125
I know!

186
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,458
What a slob.

187
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,333
I’ve never seen
such filthy armor before.

188
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,250
[ROOKIE MAGE]
Even our equipment

189
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,041
is better than
what he’s carrying.

190
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,708
[ROOKIE CLERIC WARRIOR]
Don’t be so judgmental.

191
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,833
He must still be a rookie,
just like us.

192
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,416
I’d feel bad if he heard you.

193
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,416
[thud]

194
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,958
Good morning, everyone.

195
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,458
Who’s ready to see all
the available quests today?

196
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,208
[ALL]
Yes, finally!

197
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,291
Come on!
I want to slay a dragon.

198
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,333
Heroic feats like that are the
fastest way to gain experience.

199
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,750
There’s no way.
You don’t got the equipment.

200
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,291
How ‘bout you just stick
to taking out bandits.

201
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,833
That usually pays well, too.

202
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,416
Man, look at these awful
porcelain-ranked quests.

203
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,916
They hardly pay anything.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,041
And I don’t wanna have
to clean ditches.

205
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,458
You can’t be too picky
when you’re just starting out.

206
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,291
Oh, hey.
What about that one there.

207
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,583
Goblins are easy, right?

208
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,750
Sounds like a good rookie
quest for us.

209
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,083
[APPRENTICE CLERIC]
No way.

210
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,875
You heard what the Guild Girl
told us.

211
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,125
We should start with the sewers
and work our way up.

212
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,416
Move, kids, let the real
adventurers through.

213
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,833
You idiot.
Don’t push.

214
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,750
The big quest is ours,
little spearman.

215
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,500
Look somewhere else.

216
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,916
That’s no way to talk to the
greatest warrior in the room.

217
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,041
[chuckles]

218
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,083
[GUILD GIRL]
Please, settle down, everyone.

219
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,583
There’s no reason to fight
amongst yourselves.

220
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,416
[COW GIRL] He’s not even gonna
go look at the quests?

221
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,458
He did say
there’s no reason to rush,

222
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,291
since none of
the other adventurers

223
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,458
like killing goblins.

224
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,958
Sir.

225
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,375
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Hello.

226
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,250
About what I was saying
to you a few days ago.

227
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,375
I still don’t think
it’s a very good idea

228
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,250
to use flammable liquids,
especially if it’s in a cave.

229
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,916
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Your thinking is flawed.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,500
What would you prefer: that we
just let the goblins live?

231
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,208
[PRIESTESS]
Well, no, of course not,

232
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,083
but think of the consequences.

233
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,500
What if you caused
an avalanche or a cave in?

234
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,916
[GOBLIN SLAYER] The goblins
are a bigger problem.

235
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,500
[PRIESTESS] I know they are,
but every cause has an effect,

236
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,833
and we’ve got
to consider the risks.

237
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,125
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see.

238
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,416
Please at least try
to find another way.

239
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,666
[COW GIRL]
He said he’d formed a party

240
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,083
with someone
about a month ago,

241
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,000
but I didn’t think
it’d be with a girl.

242
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,291
And, also,

243
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,000
when we’re covering up
our scents,

244
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,875
can we use something
besides blood?

245
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,500
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
No. What times of day

246
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,583
do we usually attack goblins?

247
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,958
Um, early morning,
or early evening.

248
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,625
[giggles]

249
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,208
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Tell me why.

250
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,333
Because early evening for
goblins is early morning for us.

251
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,750
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Correct.

252
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,875
So, their afternoons are
the middle of our nights.

253
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,750
That’s when they’re
most guarded.

254
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,291
Next, what are the steps
to approaching them?

255
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,125
[PRIESTESS]
Uh, well, if possible,

256
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,625
we’ll smoke them out with fire.

257
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,166
That’ll throw off
their defenses.

258
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,750
Plus, it’s dangerous
inside their nests.

259
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,166
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
That’s right.

260
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,708
The only reasons
we would ever enter a nest are:

261
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,125
if there’s no other way,

262
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,625
or we’re certain
we can kill them all.

263
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,000
Well done.

264
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,541
Oh, good morning Goblin Slayer,
it’s so nice to see you.

265
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,000
[GOBLIN SLAYER] Are there
any quests that involve goblins?

266
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,833
[GUILD GIRL]
Ah, yes, of course.

267
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,583
We have three goblin quests.

268
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,875
There’s a swarm in
the western river village.

269
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,375
And a small nest
in the southern forest.

270
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,500
And then, an old mountain fort
that’s been claimed by goblins.

271
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,000
That one will be really tough.

272
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,833
It’s a castle
that’s been fortified.

273
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,166
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
They’ve settled there?

274
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,375
Yes. And there’s been
a few casualties.

275
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,125
The younger sister of the person

276
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,833
who requested help
was kidnapped.

277
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,791
No one’s heard
from the adventurer

278
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,458
who went into the castle
to find her.

279
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,125
He’s completely disappeared.

280
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,500
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
It’s too late for them.

281
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,916
But I can kill the goblins.

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,250
That will prevent further deaths
at their hands.

283
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,333
[GUILD GIRL] We’ll be counting
on your success, then.

284
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,833
I wish you the best of luck.

285
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,208
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
One last question.

286
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,541
Did anyone else
take goblin-slaying quests?

287
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,916
[GUILD GIRL] Yes, a party
of rookies went off on one.

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,166
They’re headed
to the river village.

289
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,041
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
What was their party like?

290
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,125
Um...

291
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,875
One warrior, a wizard,
and a priest.

292
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,458
Each porcelain-ranked.

293
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,625
Like I said,
they were all pretty new.

294
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,416
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Not a bad balance.

295
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
[PRIESTESS] If it’s the three
I heard earlier,

296
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,791
they’re in way over their heads.

297
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,083
Even my party had four members.

298
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,125
Yes, I did try
to explain that to them.

299
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,708
They’re going to die.

300
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,625
We have to stop them
from going there.

301
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,333
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Do as you please.

302
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,416
I’m going to destroy
the mountain castle.

303
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,666
You’re going to abandon them?

304
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,708
[GOBLIN SLAYER] If you believe
you can save that group,

305
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,250
feel free to try.

306
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,416
[PRIESTESS] But that would mean
you’d have to face

307
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,666
this horde of goblins
on your own.

308
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,333
That’s far too dangerous!

309
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,125
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
That wouldn’t be anything new.

310
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,333
I’m just saying this seems
way too risky.

311
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,541
Honestly.

312
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,666
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Are you coming?

313
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,958
Of course!

314
