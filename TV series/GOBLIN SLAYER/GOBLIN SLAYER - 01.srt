[PRIESTESS]
I want to be an adventurer.

-[WOMAN] Good morning!
-[MAN] Everyone off your horses.

00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,875
(villagers chattering)

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,666
[GUILD GIRL] And do you know
how to read and write?

11
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,208
I do. Those were skills
taught at the temple.

12
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,041
Perfect. Then please fill
this form out for me.

13
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,208
[MAN] How'd it go
with that manticore at the pass?

14
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,208
[WOMAN]
Eh, you know, it wasn't too bad.

15
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,041
[MAN 2] I hear the capital's
the place to go

16
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,666
if you're lookin'
to make some coin.

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,458
Apparently,
a demon lord showed up.

18
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,083
[MAN 3]
How strong are we talkin'?

19
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,541
Figure I could handle
a low-level one myself.

20
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,208
[laughter]

21
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,125
Okay, you're 15 years old.

22
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,291
And it says you've trained
to be a priestess?

23
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,625
That's right.
And now that I'm an adult,

24
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,083
I want to become an adventurer

25
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:40,000
and help out
as many people as I can.

26
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,250
Here. This will serve
as your guild identification.

27
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,291
Now, there are ten ranks
for adventurers.

28
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,791
Platinum is the highest rank,
following that is gold.

29
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,125
However, the highest-ranked
people you'll encounter

30
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,333
out in the field
are the silvers.

31
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,750
If you'll look at your tag,

32
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,541
you'll see it indicates
that you're a porcelain,

33
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,333
which is the lowest-ranked
among our adventurers.

34
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,208
This tells people
that I'm a beginner?

35
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,166
Correct, and should anything
go wrong on a quest,

36
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,958
it can also be a means
of identifying you.

37
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,375
-Hold on to it.
-Right!

38
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,541
Well, that's it
for your registration.

39
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,750
This board is
where quests are posted.

40
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,375
You're welcome to look
through them

41
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,000
for one that's suitable
for your rank.

42
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,541
Another option
would be joining

43
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,833
-a veteran adventurer's party--
-Hey.

44
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,791
We're gonna go on a quest,
do you wanna come with?

45
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,833
Yeah, she said
you're a priestess, right?

46
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,666
My adventuring party's
missing a healer,

47
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,583
but we've got
an urgent quest to tackle

48
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,458
and are looking to add
somebody with the right skills

49
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,166
and training
as soon as possible.

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,500
Will you come along with us?

51
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,541
I don't know.
What kind of quest is it?

52
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,833
Goblin slaying!

53
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,041
You're gonna go after goblins?

54
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,250
Sure are.
They attacked a village,

55
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,041
and as if stealing supplies and
livestock weren't bad enough,

56
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,291
they kidnapped
a few of the local girls too.

57
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,666
We need to rescue them
as soon as we can.

58
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,250
[GUILD GIRL] Um, you're all
porcelain-ranked, aren't you?

59
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,250
This'll be quite the challenge.
I'm sure if you wait,

60
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,583
there will be other adventurers
willing to take on the quest.

61
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,291
Oh, please.
The four of us can handle

62
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,333
a bunch of filthy goblins,
no problem.

63
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,166
-Can't we?
-Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,750
You in, Priestess?

65
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,166
Come on and make up
your mind already.

66
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,208
Okay, I'll go with you,

67
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,000
if you really think
I'll be able to help.

68
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,041
All right! We can finally go
on an adventure!

69
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,208
-Welcome aboard!
-Yeah! Great to have you!

70
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,708
[laughter]

71
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,166
[WARRIOR] Those goblins don't
stand a chance now!

72
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,791
[WIZARD]
Don't get too excited.

73
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,833
[FIGHTER] If things start to get
ugly, just leave it to me.

74
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,208
[crows cawing]

75
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,458
Oh. Uh...
[chuckles nervously]

76
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,791
Oh... Mm.

77
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,750
[crows cawing]

78
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:54,666
Um, is this a good idea?
I mean, just barging in?

79
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,791
Maybe we should head back
outside and plan some more.

80
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,208
Really? Now's when you decide
to back out of this?

81
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,416
[laughs] You don't need to worry
about anything.

82
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Goblins are nothing.

83
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,041
They're the size of little
children and just as stupid.

84
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,375
They're basically the weakest
monster you can fight.

85
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,250
I even kicked a couple out of
my village once, all by myself.

86
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,833
I wouldn't be bragging
about that if I were you.

87
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,250
[WARRIOR] Ha! I'm sure we'll
be able to handle anything,

88
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,166
and after this quest
we're going to go kill a dragon!

89
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
[WIZARD] You're getting
ahead of yourself.

90
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,583
But, yeah, we'll
eventually get there.

91
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,250
One day, I'm gonna be
a famous dragon slayer!

92
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,833
-[grunting]
-[laughing]

93
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,166
Even if that idiot
can't cut them all down,

94
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,833
I'll kill them
with my bare hands.

95
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,000
I've got you covered.

96
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,208
Besides, she's a wizard
who graduated

97
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,791
from the Sages's Academy
in the capital.

98
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,416
-[PRIESTESS gasps]
-Hmm?

99
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,541
[harrumphs]

100
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:53,708
[WARRIOR] Okay. Less talking,
more exploring. Let's go.

101
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,833
Did any of you bring
potions along just in case?

102
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,500
-[WARRIOR] Nope.
-Huh?

103
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,458
We didn't have the time
or the money

104
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,791
to do much shopping
before we left.

105
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,208
Rescuing those
kidnapped girls takes priority.

106
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,666
Plus, we've got you to help.

107
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,000
You can heal us if we happen
to get hurt, right?

108
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,166
Well, I can pray
to the goddess

109
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,833
and ask for the miracles
of healing and light if need be,

110
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,333
but there are limits.

111
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,708
I can only use them
three times, so...

112
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,083
-Hold up!
-Huh?

113
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,625
[WARRIOR]
What the heck is this?

114
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,500
[FIGHTER] There was one
at the entrance, too.

115
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,708
[WARRIOR]
I know.

116
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,083
Hear me,
oh merciful Earth Mother.

117
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,458
Please offer us
your loving protection.

118
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,375
-Light the darkness.
-Come on, we're falling behind.

119
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,291
The other two ran up ahead and
I don't want to miss anything.

120
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,083
Right, I'm sorry.

121
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,583
[panting]

122
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,791
[distant clatter]

123
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,208
Jeez, what's the matter now?

124
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,791
It's just, I thought
I heard something.

125
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,958
[WIZARD]
Like what?

126
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,166
I'm not sure,
but it was behind us.

127
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,666
That's impossible,
we just came from the entrance

128
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,375
and didn't see anyone
along the way.

129
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,916
It's probably only
your imagination.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,041

Take that!

00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,875
Hurry and perform
a healing miracle.

155
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,625
Of course! Hear me,
oh merciful Earth Mother.

156
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,916
Please lay your blessed hands
