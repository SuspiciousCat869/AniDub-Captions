the promotion exams going?

So far so good. We've got

This applicant.

She's the one who's been working
with Goblin Slayer lately.

Remind me
who this Goblin Slayer is?

-Oh. That guy.
-Yes, that guy.

-Good morning! Finally awake?
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Yes.

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,458
-Everything okay?
-No sign of goblin activity.

12

That's not what I mean,
actually. I'm talking about you.

You collapsed as soon as you
got home from that quest.

I'm worried you're pushing
yourself too hard.

15

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I rested for days.

Only three.
You need more than that.

It was just exhaustion.

Nothing to worry about.

00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,250
Although, I was told
that my refusal

00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,500
to take care of myself
is a problem.

No, another adventurer.

Just once so far.

You're right.
Giant rats and insects aside,

it would be a waste

Hey, look. I've got
plenty of spare weapons,

But you're not strong enough
to wield them.

If you use one
that's not a good match,

you could get into
all sorts of trouble, yes?

Right. I know that.
I'm sorry.

[giggles]
A marvelous item.

You see it grows hot when you
get close to what you seek.

128
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,958
I suppose, you could
sell it for cash

129

instead of using it,
if you want.

You're always
destroyin' my work.

00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,750
You need to learn to be careful.

140
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,666
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I am careful.

141
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,708
You ought to learn
about sarcasm, too.

142
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,583
[GOBLIN SLAYER] I'd like you
to procure a scroll, as well.

143
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,541
[BLACKSMITH]
Scrolls are hard to come by,

not to mention expensive.

145
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,375
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Cost isn't an issue.

146
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,750
If some adventurer comes around
here lookin' to sell one,

147
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,291
then I'll buy it,

148
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,166
but I wouldn't go
gettin' your hopes up.

149
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,708
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I understand. That's fine.

my promotion exam yesterday.

that I'd get it,

really gave me an edge.

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I see. Congratulations.

It's thanks to you.

159
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,416
Without all your help, I never
would've gotten this far.

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
I didn't do anything.

Of course you did.

Maybe.

The rest of your party
didn't make it, though.

I know. Still,
if it weren't for you,

I wouldn't have
survived, either.

But I did, and I wanted
to thank you properly.

how grateful I am.

Nope, not a chance.

so I have to use a loaner.

let somebody else borrow it.

That's right.

You're asking me for information

on how to slay giant rats?

203
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,083
Sorry, I'm afraid
it doesn't work that way.

204
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,500
We leave these sorts of things
for adventurers to handle

205
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,250
precisely because they're
so difficult to deal with.

Please, we're begging you!

Well, you may have already
thought of this,

209
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,458
but you could try
strengthening your defense

-with chain mail or other armor.
-Except we don't have any money.

You know, if it's advice
you're looking for,

00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,291

that sort of thing.

We wanted to ask you something.

If you lose your sword,

what's the best way
to fight enemies?

[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Steal one from a goblin.

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,125
Okay, but we're
not fighting goblins.

00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,625
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Oh.

230
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,208
Have you ever used any weapon
other than a sword?

00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,375
No.

And we don't have
any money, either.

233
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,833
[GOBLIN SLAYER] In that case,
how about a club?

00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,750
-[WARRIOR] A club?
-[GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah.

Throw, stab, break, shatter.

236
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,416
There are plenty of ways to kill
a goblin besides using a blade.

237
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,166
Would it work on rats
and bugs, too?

238
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,708
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
Probably.

239
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,166
I'm sure being hit with one
would at least hurt them.

240
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,791
Plus, clubs don't get
nicked like swords do,

241
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,500
so the maintenance is easier.

242
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,416
Easier. A club, huh?

243
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,750

That's what I would do.

Oh! I think I understand
what happened.

While the others thought
you were scouting,

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,250
you found a treasure chest,
which you kept for yourself

the contents.

[GUILD GIRL]
Absolutely unacceptable.

demoting you to porcelain

should be sufficient.

-[GOBLIN SLAYER] I'm back.

467
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,375
[gasping]
What are you--?

468
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,416
Um... Goblin Slayer!

469
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,875
What are you doing here?

470
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,750
[GOBLIN SLAYER]
What else?

471
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,416
I'm going to slay some goblins.

472
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,125
That quest listing,

473
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,916
it arrived on a parcel carriage

474
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,250
that had travelled
a great distance.

475
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:58,375
And it's specifically
asking for Goblin Slayer?

476
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,208
But who could it be from?

477
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,958
