1
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,083
Where the hell are we?

2
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,291
I could be wrong, but
this kinda looks like-

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,458
It is, Koshien Stadium.

4
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,375
No way. I coulda sworn

5
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,083
we still had another round
of play-offs to go.

6
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:33,166
Yeah, we gotta make it past
regionals if we wanna play here.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,625
It looks like we're about to
skip straight to the finals,

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,000
you guys, 'cuz we are
just that awesome.

9
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,208
This is no time for
joking around, guys.

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,291
There's somethin'
strange goin' on here.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,750
Yeah, this is weird.
It's too quiet.

12
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,875
You'd think we'd be able to
hear the sounds of the city,

13
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,500
cars driving by and stuff.

14
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,791
Unless the stadium was built

15
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,166
in the middle of a
desert or something.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,458
What's goin' on?!

17
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,875
This better not be the
work of another alien!

18
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,916
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,583
who come and go as they please.

20
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,458
Some are friendly,
others are hostile.

21
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,250
But they all do their best
to disguise their appearance

22
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,291
and blend in with the locals.

23
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,541
Keeping that in mind, it's not
too surprising things can go

24
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,416
a little haywire
from time to time.

25
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,416
The bus disappeared?

26
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,958
I watched it happen, man!

27
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,625
It vanished with the whole
Kisaragi High team onboard!

28
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,708
I swear!

29
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,916
That's Tsutsui's team, right?

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,083
Are you sure that's
what you saw?

31
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,375
Diskunians have
perfect eyesight!

32
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,083
I can see the
stitches on a fastball

33
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,500
goin' a hundred miles an hour!

34
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,916
Walk me through it
from the beginning.

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,250
I was riding my bike
alongside the team's bus.

36
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,458
I wanted to cheer them on

37
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,208
during the forty mile
trip to the stadium.

38
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,833
That sounds rather excessive,
if you ask me.

39
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,791
Then, all of a sudden...

40
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,958
It's like the car
that disappeared

41
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,375
on the Fujishiro
Bypass in 1963.

42
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,208
Did it cross dimensions?

43
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,333
No, it was spontaneous
spatial translocation.

44
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,125
The vehicle was torn apart
at the atomic level.

45
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,083
Wait, that's possible?

46
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,541
Yes, though it's an
extremely rare occurrence.

47
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,666
In fact, chances are
considerably greater

48
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,000
that the bus was somehow sucked
into another dimension.

49
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,875
Now how're we gonna find them?

50
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,083
Man, this is really
startin' to freak me out.

51
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,541
Time to man up, you pansies!

52
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,583
How much you wanna bet it's
just one of them pornogeists?

53
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,791
Captain, I'm pretty
sure you meant to say

54
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,916
"poltergeist" not "pornogeist"!

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,333
Bah! What's the
stinkin' difference?!

56
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,291
We made it!

57
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,125
Whadya say we run
victory laps to celebrate

58
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,583
makin' it to the Koshien?!

59
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,541
Are you guys with me
or what?! C'mon!

60
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,208
Talk about dedication.

61
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,916
We're stuck in the Twilight
Zone and he wants to run.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,208
The captain's a
no-nonsense kinda guy.

63
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,666
He's the type who doesn't
even care how food tastes

64
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,791
as long as it's edible.

65
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,291
Shut up! That is not true!

66
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,500
I mean. I make a lunch
for him every day

67
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,875
and he always tells me
it tastes delicious.

68
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,125
Yeah, yeah, he has to say that.

69
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,541
Of all the guys on the team,

70
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,458
I can't believe Fujii fell
for our meathead captain.

71
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,958
Shut up!
You're all just jealous!

72
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,833
Man, I hope we're not dealin'
with another ghost infestation.

73
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,583
Remember the last time?

74
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,541
This is on a grander scale.

75
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,041
There's no other way to explain

76
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,958
our bus just popping
up at Koshien.

77
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,958
Hey, we keep callin'
this place Koshien

78
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,208
but how do we know
this is the real deal?

79
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,375
Yeah. Good point.

80
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:33,375
Now that ya mention it, I've
only seen the stadium on TV.

81
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,000
Any of you guys ever
been there before?

82
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,958
--Yeah, I have.
--When?

83
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,916
Back when the Giants
were playing the Tigers.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,541
Does it look the same?

85
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,958
Yeah, but somethin'
feels kinda off.

86
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,041
Lemme check one thing
and I'll know for sure.

87
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,333
Uh-huh, their bus was
supposed to arrive a while ago

88
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,125
but it hasn't gotten here, yet.

89
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,166
Did something happen to them?

90
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,791
It's too soon to say.

91
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,375
I'll check back in
with you later on.

92
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,416
They're still not there.

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,083
I bet you the Ellerians
are behind this!

94
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,500
What?

95
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,500
If Yukitaka's team wins
regionals, there's a good chance

96
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,125
a high school team from
their turf'll get booted!

97
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,541
They're playin' dirty

98
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,125
'cause they don't want us
winnin' the championship.

99
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,041
I know they did this!
And we're gonna make 'em pay!

100
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,375
Now, now, let's
think rationally!

101
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,833
You don't have any proof!

102
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,583
I love Kisaragi High's
baseball team.

103
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,166
This isn't fair.

104
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,666
I've watched how hard they've
trained to get to this point.

105
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,625
They deserve to win!

106
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,291
We're not gonna let those
chumps get in our team's way!

107
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,375
That championship belongs to us!

108
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,958
Okay, I know you're mad
but let's calm down.

109
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,708
C'mon, let's take him down, too!

110
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,958
No!

111
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,541
Sado.

112
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,791
Do you think another alien race
could be responsible for this?

113
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,625
Maybe for the Norfolk Regiment
disappearance of 1915,

114
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,625
and the incidents within
the Bermuda Triangle.

115
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,708
But this is different.

116
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,750
Well, that's weird,
I'm sure it was right here.

117
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,291
What are you lookin' for?

118
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,208
It's just. I remember seein'

119
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,666
an Okayama Bizen High
sticker underneath this seat.

120
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,416
Maybe somebody scraped it off.

121
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,208
But my name is missin', too!

122
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,500
Wait, what do you mean?

123
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,375
I wrote it here.

124
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,666
You dumbass. You vandalized
Koshien Stadium?!

125
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,458
I felt bad about it. That's
why I wrote it super small.

126
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,166
I thought nobody would notice.

127
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,583
It should still be here.

128
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,541
Even if they cleaned, it
must've left some kinda mark.

129
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,083
You sure you checked
the right seat?

130
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,583
Yeah, I'm absolutely positive!
I memorized the number

131
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,166
so I'd know exactly
where to sit next time.

132
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,666
Look! Row fifteen,
seat fourty-one.

133
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,375
But none of the
seats are numbered!

134
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,250
They were!

135
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,666
Maybe your memory's off

136
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,958
and it wasn't actually Koshien,
but some other ballpark.

137
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,625
No, I was here!
I swear, you guys!

138
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,375
The problem isn't
Tanaka's memory,

139
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,000
this is definitely the place.

140
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,708
Yeah, but his name's missing.

141
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:00,875
'Cause this isn't
the real Koshien.

142
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,541
It appears to be
a failed attempt

143
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,875
at replicating the
stadium, gentlemen.

144
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,791
What the hell do you
think you're doing here?

145
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,666
Well, I haven't messed
with you in a while

146
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,083
and I thought it'd be fun.

147
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,333
Oh really?

148
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,291
I hitched a ride 'cause
I wanted to cheer you on

149
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,583
at your big play-off game.

150
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,791
I would've walked had I known
the fate that would befall me.

151
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,375
Hey, you didn't have anything
to do with all this, did you?!

152
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,125
Easy, cowboy. You don't think
I'd go to this much trouble

153
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,041
just to mess with you.

154
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,958
Damn you. Urge to kill rising!

155
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,916
Hey, who is that guy, Yukitaka?

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,083
Just a punk from
my neighborhood!

157
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,375
Hey guys, c'mere!

158
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,666
You have to see this!

159
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,791
Impossible. Is this for real?

160
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,250
This looks like
Konan Municipal Stadium.

161
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,083
Wait, hold on a second.

162
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,333
All locker rooms look the same
so this could be Koshien right?

163
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,416
No, look over there.

164
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,708
That green washer's in the
municipal stadium's locker room.

165
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,958
I'd recognize it anywhere!

166
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, if this place actually
is Konan Municipal Stadium...

167
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,333
...that door should
lead to the outside.

168
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,875
Where the hell, are we?

169
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,833
I dunno but it
sure looks familiar.

170
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,250
Yeah. 'Cause this is where
they conduct interviews

171
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,500
after the high school
championship.

172
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,083
What's goin' on?!

173
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,083
Is this Konan
Municipal or Koshien?!

174
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,958
Maybe, it's both
places at once.

175
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,916
Home run!

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,333
But that doesn't make any sense!

177
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,916
The only parts of Koshien
that have been reproduced

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,791
are what can be
seen on television.

179
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,166
It seems he's used a familiar
stadium to fill in the gaps.

180
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,375
Until this point I was
merely speculating,

181
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,250
but now I can say with
absolute certainty.

182
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,375
We are trapped inside
someone's mind.

183
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,875
You treat me so horribly

184
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,958
I don't know why I bother
putting up with you!

185
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,666
Poor you, spending all
my hard earned money!

186
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,708
Work, work! Is that all
you ever talk about?

187
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,625
Well, all you ever
do is complain!

188
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,333
You have no idea
how hard I work!

189
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,083
Stop it!

190
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,875
This is reminiscent of
the Robert Incident

191
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,375
of England in 1920.

192
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,875
It was a bizarre case
where a six year old girl

193
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,416
trapped her father
within her subconscious.

194
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,416
When the father suddenly
reappeared, he told authorities

195
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,250
that he had been inside
his daughter's mind.

196
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,166
So, you don't think
the Ellerians had

197
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,750
anything to do with this?

198
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,833
No, someone under extreme
stress inadvertently

199
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,916
unleashed this
paranormal power.

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,458
Then it's likely a member
of the team, right?

201
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,125
Imagine how stressed
they must be

202
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,166
going into this play-off game.

203
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,000
How'd we get stuck
inside someone's mind?!

204
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,166
This is just like
the case in England.

205
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,916
Someone under extreme stress has
created a paranormal dimension,

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,333
and now, we are trapped
within their subconscious.

207
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,666
Make it stop!

208
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,250
Please forgive me.

209
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,000
When the little girl's
father apologized,

210
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,500
her stress was lifted.

211
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,625
That's why he was able to
leave her subconscious, right?

212
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,583
I'm sorry!

213
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,875
He shoots, he scores.

214
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,791
All we have to do to get
back to the real world

215
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,208
is eliminate the
source of the stress.

216
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,708
Well, that's easier
said than done.

217
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,083
Yeah, we don't even
know who sent us here.

218
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,666
If I knew, I'd deck 'em.

219
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,208
I know it's the
play-offs and all,

220
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,875
but baseball is
supposed to be fun,

221
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,291
not somethin' you stress
out about, am I right?

222
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,208
Yeah, plus skippin'
the regionals and goin'

223
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,250
straight to Koshien would
be way more stressful.

224
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,166
C'mon, this ain't
funny, you guys!

225
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,708
Would somebody just grow
a pair and 'fess up already?!

226
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,125
Well, I'm so nervous
I could die.

227
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,041
This bein' my last
chance and all.

228
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,208
I feel ya. I'm nervous, too.

229
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,208
It's gotta be someone
who's not here.

230
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,708
It can't be. The whole
team is with us, right?

231
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,791
Anything goes when you're

232
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,875
trapped within
somebody's subconscious!

233
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,791
One of us could be a fake
created by the perp

234
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,166
to throw the others off!

235
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,625
That's right!
You're all suspects!

236
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,708
It could be fatty here.

237
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,083
The weird, pasty guy.

238
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,666
Or this loser.

239
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,083
The only person who
isn't a suspect is you!

240
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,208
Just know that the you
who's busy suspecting

241
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,416
everybody but yourself
could be a phony!

242
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,125
Shut up!

243
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,541
What is wrong with you?!

244
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,416
Why're you tryin' to pit
everybody against each other?!

245
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
'Cause it's fun.

246
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,083
I hate you so much!

247
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,875
Why the hell are you
lazy, good-for-nothin's

248
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,708
just sittin' around
when you should be out

249
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,750
workin' up a sweat
like my boy Yukitaka!

250
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,458
There's no sense worryin'
about who got us here.

251
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,666
Oh really? Why is that?

252
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,166
Obviously it's the stress
of the regional play-off

253
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,500
that's gettin' to him.

254
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,541
We'll probably be freed
once the game is over,

255
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,125
but we won't be able to play
as long as we're all stuck here.

256
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,583
That's what I like to call
a never-ending paradox!

257
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,041
What is that?

258
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,833
No way! There's nobody
in the stands!

259
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,708
Cheering from invisible
fans. Well, that's surreal.

260
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,666
Uh. Hey guys? Check it out.

261
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,125
It's Matsukawa Commercial
High representin' Ehime!

262
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,291
There's Imai,
the "Big Slugger"!

263
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,875
They're a tough team to beat.

264
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,875
They're definitely
a fan favorite.

265
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,625
Aw, man, we played against
those guys last year

266
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,875
and they totally
kicked our asses!

267
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,958
That's it! This is the future!

268
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,750
My ESPN is tellin' me
we'll get to the Koshien!

269
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,708
Hey Captain.
It's just called ESP--

270
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,666
Let's massacre Matsukawa
as a warm-up for our game

271
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,625
against Greater Yamagata later!

272
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,791
He seriously wants
to play those guys?!

273
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,125
I don't think we can talk him
out of it, he seems pumped.

274
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,833
I'm all for it! Our team's a
lot stronger than last year.

275
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:04,833
We can take 'em!

276
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,708
Let's play ball!

277
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,166
Yeah!

278
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,625
It looks like we're gettin'
that final game after all,

279
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,750
even if it isn't
for the regionals.

280
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,166
And hey, maybe this'll be
enough to relieve some stress

281
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,083
so we can get outta here.

282
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,750
I sure hope so.

283
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,208
This isn't your best
game. I'm just sayin.

284
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,750
With runners on first and
second base and no outs.

285
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,166
Kisaragi's screwed!

286
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,750
Geez, did they
forget how to play?!

287
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,541
I won't let 'em blow
this for the team.

288
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,791
Guess it's all up to me now.

289
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,833
You dumbass! They've
got runners, bro!

290
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,750
So the problem child's
waiting at the station.

291
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,458
Yes, sir. It's gotta be him,

292
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,041
Miho told me he's the only
player who showed up.

293
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,041
Well, then there's
no doubt about it.

294
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,166
If the kid's stressing out
about the play-off game,

295
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,833
there's nothing we can do
to remedy the situation.

296
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,791
Maybe not but we can at least
move him somewhere isolated

297
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,750
so the general public
isn't freaked out

298
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,583
when the team
magically reappears.

299
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,125
C'mon, we gotta
rescue 'em somehow!

300
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,000
There's only two
hours 'til the game!

301
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,458
There's no way!

302
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,875
You know, the prince could
probably come up with a way

303
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,000
--to get them out of this.
--Oh yeah!

304
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,416
What's the matter now?

305
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,625
The prince said he was gonna
make it out to the game

306
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,583
by hitching a ride
onboard the team's bus.

307
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,750
Is he okay? What's he doin'?

308
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,458
Thinking up a strategy
to save the prince.

309
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,666
You've gotta think, Craft!

310
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,875
This is a one in
a million chance!

311
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,375
There has to be a way to bring
Tsutsui and his team mates

312
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:57,041
back safely, while leaving
that imbecile there.

313
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,250
Oh, yes!

314
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,750
Oh, Captain, villains
aren't supposed to sparkle.

315
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,958
Damn it!

316
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,500
I can't believe that fat bastard
got a home run off of me!

317
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,333
They've got five
points now. Big deal.

318
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,291
Yeah, yeah, I know...

319
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,208
I'm betting that Terakado
is the one behind this.

320
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,125
He's made some major
mistakes this game,

321
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,416
and he's obviously
the most stressed out.

322
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Nah, I think it's Fujii.

323
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,750
Everybody knows young women

324
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,583
are more susceptible
to poltergeists.

325
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,875
This may sound weird, but do you
think it could be the captain?

326
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,375
I know he's confident, but
he almost seems too calm,

327
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,416
know what I mean?

328
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,916
You've got a good point there.

329
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,166
Since this phenomenon
happens subconsciously,

330
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,166
the culprit may not necessarily
show signs of stress.

331
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,458
If so, anyone who's calm
is a prime suspect!

332
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,333
And you guys look as
cool as a block of ice!

333
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,750
Leave 'em alone, man.

334
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,291
Boo-yah! Right between
the shortstop and third!

335
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,250
Whether it's real or not we're
playin' a game at Koshien.

336
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,125
Might as well enjoy it, right?

337
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,791
Is that him?

338
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,041
Uh-huh. Are you sure it's
the stress of the regionals

339
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,583
that caused this to happen?

340
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,791
What do you mean?

341
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,541
Well, before all of
my swimming tournaments

342
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,916
I do something called
imagery training.

343
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,416
It's kinda like meditation

344
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,250
but I try to focus on the meets
where I swam really well.

345
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,625
It's pretty amazing how much
I can shave off my time

346
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,458
when I really concentrate.

347
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,958
That's it!

348
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,833
The phenomenon was caused by
the player's concentration,

349
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,083
not stress!

350
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,625
But how is that possible?

351
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,958
While both are
capable of putting

352
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,541
an enormous amount of
strain on the human mind.

353
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,875
It would actually be easier

354
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,958
to trigger this paranormal
power via concentration.

355
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,166
It must've happened on the bus.

356
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,125
He was using imagery training
to prepare for the game.

357
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,625
Unfortunately, his teammates
got caught up in it.

358
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,875
If that's the case,

359
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,875
then there has to be a
way for us to free them.

360
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,375
What if we asked him to try and
concentrate as hard as he did

361
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,708
when the bus vanished-
wouldn't that do the trick?

362
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,791
It's certainly worth a try.

363
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,083
The poor guy's in no position
to be thinking about baseball.

364
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,000
Actually, it's
quite the contrary.

365
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,416
He shouldn't be able to
think about anything but.

366
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,958
Why is that?

367
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,958
As long as the Kisaragi Nine are
trapped in his subconscious,

368
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,125
all his thoughts will
be influenced by them

369
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,333
rather than any
outside stimulation.

370
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,250
--Hell yeah!
--All right!

371
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,291
We've got runners
on first and second!

372
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,375
Number two.
Third Base. Kanemitsu.

373
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,583
Play ball!

374
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,000
Yukitaka's got the right
idea, might as well

375
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,625
make the best out of a bad
situation. Have a little fun.

376
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,416
Yeah, way to go, Kanemitsu!

377
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,458
Show those Matsukawa
bastards how it's done!

378
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,625
Bases are loaded!
It's up to you, Kuramoto!

379
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:45,875
Ice chips, here! Come get your
famous Koshien ice chips, here!

380
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,000
Number four.
Right Field. Iwata.

381
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,166
Watch out 'cause a grand
slam is comin' your way!

382
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,333
Yeah, Captain! Tell 'em!

383
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,541
Hit a homer and there's
a kiss in it for ya!

384
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,500
That's a deal, baby.

385
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,166
Woo!

386
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,416
Yes! Woohoo!

387
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,166
Grand slam in your face!

388
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,875
Thanks for playin' guys.

389
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:19,916
Yeah!

390
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,916
Heck yeah. We've got
it easy now, huh?

391
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,750
Yeah!

392
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,250
They don't look too
stressed out to me.

393
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,291
In fact, it looks like
everybody's pretty stoked

394
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,458
about our chances of
makin' it to Koshien.

395
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,916
Not good. If stress
isn't the problem,

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,333
then my escape
strategies are useless.

397
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,833
Then please tell me
you have a backup plan.

398
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,416
Strategy number one.

399
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,291
Identify the culprit through the
use of psychological testing.

400
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,541
Then cut them from the team,

401
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,958
thereby alleviating
their stress,

402
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,875
which, in turn, sets us free.

403
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,500
Strategy number two.

404
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,208
Destroy Koshien Stadium,
a place he considers sacred,

405
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,916
and in defense,
he will instinctively

406
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,250
eliminate us from
his subconscious.

407
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,583
Strategy number three.

408
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,916
Commit unspeakable acts

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,625
until the culprit's mind
simply can't take anymore.

410
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,375
If we do that,
I have no doubt--

411
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,333
You scumbag!

412
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,916
You wanna play at
Koshien, dontcha?!

413
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,208
Yeah!

414
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,750
I guess we'll have
to settle the score

415
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,625
with Matsukawa on this side!

416
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,000
Uh, what?

417
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,791
He's just talking
about a dream he had.

418
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,041
Yeah, that's all.

419
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,416
Okay. Let's do this!

420
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,250
Yeah!

421
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,333
Hey! Are you not
staying for the game?

422
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,958
The last thing I wanna do
is jinx Yukitaka's team

423
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,500
with my bad luck.

424
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,125
Believe it or not, the Captain
can be quite superstitious.

425
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,750
I was surprised the team
was in such good spirits

426
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,875
when they got back.

427
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,416
They must've played a good game

428
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,125
while they were stuck
in that boy's mind.

429
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,791
Odd. It seems like we're
forgetting something,

430
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,791
but I almost feel like we'd
be better off without it.

431
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,875
I'm celebrating tonight!

432
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:25,833
Okay. How do I get out of here?

433
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,916
I've gotta go into hiding!
They're after me!

434
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,916
Who's after you?

435
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,208
My younger brother
and my fiancée.

436
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,458
Why would the assembly approve

437
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,375
such a ridiculous bill
in the first place?!

438
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,958
It's truly an honor to meet you.

439
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,708
--So beautiful!
--I know that.

440
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,875
I guess I'll wait here while you
go get me something to eat.

441
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,916
Here's an idea, why don't
you go back to your planet,

442
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,333
marry that princess
and become the king!

443
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,833
Your turn, Brother! Will you
please put on your ring?

444
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,083
Up next: Half moon!

445
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,833
Things have started
goin' batty 'round here.
