1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,500
High school boys like
gettin' into trouble.

2
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:19,500
They'd rather hide-out with
pals than learn anything.

3
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:23,416
But if they pick a dangerous
spot they could end up

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
seein' somethin'
they shouldn't.

5
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,583
Hey, isn't it time to
meet up with the class?

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,791
Teacher'll be pissed
if we show up late.

7
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,125
We're still playin'!

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,541
Check it!
Read 'em and weep!

9
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,250
Three of a kind?!

10
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,333
Hold up, are you
cheatin', Itakura?

11
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,750
Just lucky.
Guess I won this round, huh?

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,708
Not so fast.

13
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,541
Damn it, Higashio!

14
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,708
Crap!

15
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,291
Is that a classmate?

16
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,583
Yeah, a chick!

17
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:11,000
Sweet! C'mon, baby,
give us a little show!

18
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,500
--She's dead!
--Shhh!

19
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,916
What do we do now?

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,250
I swear on all that's holy,

21
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,083
if you ask that one more
time, Nozaki, you're dead!

22
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,166
I can't help it;
I'm freakin' out!

23
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,208
I think we oughta
call the cops, man!

24
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,041
Oh yeah? And tell 'em what?

25
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,291
What we saw!

26
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,833
There's no way in hell
they're gonna believe we

27
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,166
watched somebody drag Yasuda's
body in, suck her veins dry,

28
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,125
and then eat her corpse;
skin, bones, and everything.

29
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,166
I mean, would you?!

30
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,500
And what do you think, Yamada?

31
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,666
I'm thinkin' who cares
if the cops believe us?

32
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,083
I'm freaked out about
some killer walkin' around.

33
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,583
That sick bastard is in
the same grade as us.

34
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,083
We should figure out who it is!

35
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,916
Think of it as self-defense!

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,333
If we knew who it was,
we'd know to steer clear.

37
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,916
Know what I mean?

38
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,708
I didn't notice anything,

39
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,541
but he wasn't a part
of my group either.

40
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,250
I saw Kanamori take
off partway through,

41
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,208
but he was probably with Motoi.

42
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,375
We wouldn't really know
whether anybody left.

43
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,458
Yeah, I'm sorry but we were
with a totally different group.

44
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,791
From what I hear,
Komiyama definitely ditched

45
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,416
his group at one point.

46
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,375
Then we have five
possible suspects;

47
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,375
four guys and one girl.

48
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,083
Can we take Nakai off the list?

49
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,041
She's a lot shorter
than the killer.

50
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,458
Might as well mark
off Maehara, too.

51
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,916
I mean, the guy's over
two hundred pounds.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,541
That leaves us with...

53
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,458
Komiyama from Group B.

54
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,166
And from group A,
Horikoshi, and Yamamoto.

55
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,125
If we ask around we might
be able to find somebody

56
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,041
who'll know what they
were up to that day.

57
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,000
We should stop.

58
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,125
I just don't see why we
should dig any deeper when

59
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,208
we already know the killer's
one of those three.

60
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,458
Itakura's right.

61
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,958
It's not like we have
any classes with 'em.

62
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,458
Wait.

63
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,375
So you're saying all we gotta
do is stay outta their way

64
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,541
and we should be safe, right?

65
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,166
It'd suck if we got attacked
'cause we were snoopin' around.

66
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,916
Know what I mean?

67
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,708
Yeah, I guess you
make a good point.

68
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,125
I asked his girl,

69
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,333
but she doesn't know
what happened to him.

70
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,208
I bet he kept diggin' for
info after we split up.

71
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,166
He pissed off the killer
and now he's dead!

72
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,208
Shut up!

73
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,041
What if the killer's
on to us, too?!

74
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:41,875
We're goners!

75
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,416
I said shut up, man!

76
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,166
We should go and
ask Ungo for advice.

77
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,083
Why?! You know he's just gonna
laugh at us, don't you?

78
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,625
Who cares? Getting
laughed at still beats

79
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,083
tryin' to figure all
this out on our own.

80
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to part ways

81
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,125
'cause I can't hang
with crazy folk.

82
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,833
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true! For real!

83
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,333
C'mon, man, help us out.

84
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,583
What do you want me to do?
Kill the guy for ya?

85
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,208
You know I've never
been one for violence.

86
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,833
No, of course not.

87
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,333
But with all your connections,

88
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,833
we figured you might know
someone who could help us out.

89
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,333
Sure, I can hook you up,

90
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,250
but it'll cost ya
twenty thousand yen.

91
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,500
We got enough?

92
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,041
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we do.

93
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,041
Here ya go.

94
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,500
Who's this?

95
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,708
He runs a hospital that's
about to be shut down.

96
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,541
What?! How is that
supposed to help us?

97
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,916
Hear me out!
When they ask you

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,750
which consultation
course you wanna take,

99
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,916
be sure to tell 'em that
you want the E Course.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,208
Then what?

101
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,625
The rest is up to you.

102
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,125
This it?

103
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,708
Good afternoon, boys,
is this your first visit?

104
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,125
Uh... Yes.

105
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,125
Which consultation course
would you like to take?

106
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,750
Uh...

107
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,750
The E Course, please.

108
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,083
We'll be with you shortly.

109
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,000
What's with the wait?

110
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,333
I said E Course, right?

111
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,750
Yeah.

112
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,333
You can go in now.

113
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,875
Uh, okay!

114
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,250
Welcome. Make
yourselves comfortable.

115
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,875
Please, go ahead
and have a seat.

116
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,416
So who referred you?

117
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,708
It was a guy named
Ungo Sakamoto.

118
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,625
You really shouldn't
associate with him.

119
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,250
Hold onto your brain
cells as long as you can.

120
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,333
Uh...

121
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,708
Say what?

122
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,916
Never mind.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,375
Now then.

124
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,875
I'm going to ask you a few
basic questions to determine

125
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,666
whether or not your case
is worth taking on.

126
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,541
You can save all the
gritty details for later.

127
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,791
Don't worry,
I'm sure she'll turn up.

128
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,833
Yeah, and didn't she say
that she was having

129
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,333
issues with her parents?

130
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,583
She probably just had a big
fight with them or something

131
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,208
and decided to run away.

132
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,208
C'mon, cheer up, Moe!

133
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,125
What do you say we go
and grab a bite to eat?

134
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,500
Yeah, it'll be our treat!

135
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,000
You witnessed this?

136
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,583
Yeah.

137
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,166
Well, unfortunately, there's
no way for me to prove

138
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,500
that you're telling the truth.

139
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,583
And even if you could prove it,
no one would ever believe you.

140
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,833
So.

141
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,708
You want to know where
you should go from here.

142
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,500
--Is that right?
--Yeah.

143
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,416
Well, the answer
is quite simple.

144
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,416
The best way and really the only
way to deal with this problem

145
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
is to avoid the suspects.

146
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,083
As long as you stay
out of their way,

147
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,416
they won't have any reason
to retaliate against you.

148
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,750
That should just about do it.

149
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,166
Any questions?

150
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
You're not telling us anything
that we didn't already

151
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,291
figure out for ourselves.

152
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,333
Dontcha have any
other advice for us?

153
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,708
Like a way to protect
ourselves against the monster?

154
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,666
Not without a
thorough investigation,

155
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,583
which I'd be glad to perform,

156
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,625
but I'm afraid that's
going to cost you.

157
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,458
How much are we talkin'?

158
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,000
The investigation is one
point five million yen,

159
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,125
plus fifty-thousand a day
and an additional two million

160
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,416
if a solution is found.

161
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,583
Sorry but that's as low
as I can possibly go

162
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:48,125
and no, insurance
won't cover it.

163
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,875
If you can't pay,
I can't help you.

164
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,708
--We're outta here.
--C'mon, man!

165
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,625
That would be a wise
decision considering

166
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,416
the perpetrator isn't too
dangerous at this stage.

167
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,750
And how can you be
so sure of that?

168
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,083
Most only eat one or two
people a day for sustenance.

169
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,041
Considering the number
of missing persons,

170
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,875
I'd say he's well-behaved.

171
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,666
Well, compared to
most visitors to Earth.

172
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,500
Visitors... to Earth?

173
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,458
Oh, dear.

174
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,166
What do you mean?

175
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,416
Let me explain.

176
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,416
You saw an Adherent Type II,

177
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,583
a life form that's
not from Earth.

178
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,875
They're known to integrate
into our society

179
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,000
but they don't usually
cause us any harm.

180
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:36,500
That said, this type
can pose a higher risk.

181
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,458
They live amongst us
disguised as humans.

182
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,375
Therein lies the problem.

183
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,250
Because they can
communicate with us,

184
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,250
we often fall victim
to their trickery.

185
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,375
I once had an
assistant go missing

186
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,708
while working on
a similar case.

187
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:57,500
His corpse was
found without a head.

188
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,708
Strains of unidentified
bacteria were found on his body.

189
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,166
The authorities declared
his death an accident

190
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,958
and refused to release
their findings to us.

191
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,250
Before he went missing,
his last words to me were,

192
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,125
"Don't worry,
this case is safe".

193
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,958
Well, do my investigation fees
still sound unreasonable now

194
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,583
considering the alternative?

195
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,125
How are we supposed to know
you're telling us the truth?

196
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,875
Excellent question.

197
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,125
Guess you'll just have
to trust me. Okay?

198
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,041
What'll we do now?

199
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,375
Really?

200
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,083
Well, then I'll
start right away.

201
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,583
I heard a couple of
people say that Higashio

202
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,291
and his pals from Group C
haven't come to school in days.

203
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,125
Seriously?

204
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,416
Your parents' rings.

205
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,583
But won't they be mad?

206
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,541
Probably so, but I'd rather
be killed by my own folks

207
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,291
than end up a rotting corpse
in that monster's gut.

208
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,416
Well okay then.

209
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,916
If you'll go ahead and
fill these out for me,

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,333
I'll put you boys
into isolation.

211
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,875
Why? How's that gonna--

212
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,333
My utmost concern
is my client's safety.

213
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,708
The investigation should
only take about a week

214
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,791
and don't worry; I'll bring
you all the food you need.

215
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,083
Guess this is it.

216
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,916
Higashio?! Itakura!
What's going on?!

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,458
Where in the hell have
you losers been hiding?!

218
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,000
Why're you here? Watch it!

219
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,208
Hold on, don't shut the door!

220
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,000
It's no use, man; you can't
open it from this side.

221
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,500
Why're we locked in here?!

222
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,833
You're not too bright, big guy.

223
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,916
Here's how it went down.

224
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,833
After we split up a week ago,

225
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,333
Higashio just couldn't
let the matter go.

226
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,083
He asked Ungo for advice,
and was sent here,

227
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:31,166
and when he requested an
investigation he was locked up.

228
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,833
Then after the three of us
came here together.

229
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:38,625
I came back to ask Yumeno
for advice, and I got locked up.

230
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,500
Which brings us to the
two of you showing up.

231
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,333
Are you saying each of us hired
him to do the exact same job?!

232
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,416
Yeah, but he didn't tell us
you guys were here already.

233
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,541
How come?

234
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,083
It's called
"client confidentiality."

235
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,500
Basically, he knew he would
make three times as much cash

236
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,958
if he kept his mouth shut.

237
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,458
That greedy bastard!

238
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,291
I start workin' for Ungo next
month to pay off my bill.

239
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,333
But that's nothin'
compared to Higashio!

240
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,166
He agreed to start working
as an assistant here!

241
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,000
This is stupid! Can't we
break our contracts?!

242
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,625
Geez, you didn't
read it, did ya?

243
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,916
You can't break your contract
or even get a refund.

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,458
Not once he's
started investigating.

245
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,958
Bonehead! Sounds like he
already has you brainwashed!

246
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,666
He totally pulled one
over on us! He's a fraud!

247
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,875
He's telling the truth.

248
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,958
Sure is.

249
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,291
How can you be so
sure about that?!

250
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,333
Well, you comin' or not?

251
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,958
What's this?

252
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,791
It's a bunch of stuff that
old fart's been researchin'.

253
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,500
But they're fake, aren't they?

254
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,791
Look at this and
tell me it's fake.

255
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,916
This thing doesn't even
have a scientific name yet,

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,250
but somehow it's able to
analyze the purity of the water.

257
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,875
I don't know how, but it planted
everything you see in the tank.

258
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:01,750
Seriously?

259
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,541
Who'd fake that?

260
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,166
It's the harsh reality.

261
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,666
Lately, our planet has
become overwrought

262
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,208
with these foreign life forms.

263
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:15,166
They roam the city's alleys,
they reside in apartments.

264
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,291
They could even
be in your class.

265
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,291
They're so close that
no one notices them.

266
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,083
I know who the killer is.

267
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,625
She ran away?

268
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,583
I bumped into her earlier.

269
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,416
She asked me to take you to her.

270
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,166
Why didn't she talk to
me before she ran away?

271
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,375
'Cause it was a
last second decision.

272
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,291
She wasn't expecting to
fight with her parents.

273
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,000
If you would,
please come with me.

274
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,833
Yamamoto?!

275
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,458
There are two different
ways that aliens

276
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,958
can disguise
themselves as human.

277
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,000
They either wear a
sophisticated costume

278
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,500
or transform themselves
to look like us.

279
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,333
In any case, there's an easy way
to see through their disguise.

280
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,500
By their fingerprints.

281
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,416
Whenever a human hand
touches something,

282
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,666
a fingerprint is left behind.

283
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,375
Those in costumes don't leave
prints at all, while those

284
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,875
who've transformed leave a
different print than humans.

285
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,833
I approached the three
suspects on the street

286
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,166
and asked them to
fill out a survey.

287
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,625
His pen was the only one
that came back clean.

288
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,791
What's that?

289
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,958
My curiosity was piqued so
I lured his younger brother

290
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,833
out of their den and then
questioned him under hypnosis.

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,500
It was a very
revealing interview.

292
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,166
Just try to stay relaxed, okay?

293
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,833
Uh-huh.

294
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,666
Now, is it all right if I
ask you a few questions?

295
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,333
Are you from this planet?

296
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,500
I come from the planet Conwell.

297
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,041
How many of you came to Earth?

298
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:02,958
Three of us: my Dad,
my big brother, and me.

299
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,583
Why did you come here?

300
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:09,375
We came here because our
home planet exploded.

301
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,583
I see.

302
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,041
There was a civil war.

303
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,375
Everybody kept fighting
until it was destroyed.

304
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,375
What happened to everyone else?

305
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:30,250
They either escaped to other
worlds or they were killed.

306
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,333
Where's your mother?

307
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,916
She's dead.

308
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,250
On my planet,

309
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,458
males must eat females to
give birth to children.

310
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,458
As we get older,
we start to get

311
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,208
a craving for the
female species.

312
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,166
Do you ever get these cravings?

313
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,041
Yeah, but not for just anyone.

314
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,500
It has to be a certain girl.

315
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,333
What do you do when one
of these "cravings" hits?

316
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,041
I take medicine
and it goes away.

317
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,000
But we're running low-
we're almost out.

318
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,375
Can you still give birth
if you eat human females?

319
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,333
No, my Dad said
it wouldn't work.

320
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,541
But you still crave them anyway.

321
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,750
Yeah.

322
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,125
On Conwell, we call
it the Hollow Stomach.

323
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,000
The Hollow Stomach?

324
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,458
And this medicine you
take makes it feel full.

325
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,666
Yeah, but some said
it wasn't natural.

326
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,166
That's what started the war.

327
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,000
My Dad told us he wished
our kind had never existed.

328
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,916
How did it make you
feel when he said that?

329
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,666
Sad, but I agree.

330
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,333
Why is that?

331
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:58,833
Because, there's a girl I like.

332
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,583
Sometimes, I crave her.

333
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,458
I'm dying to eat her.

334
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,041
It's hard to fight the urge!

335
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,708
Once it starts to take over...

336
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,291
Hey, are you all right?

337
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:17,250
...the craving is so strong that
I feel like I'm going crazy!

338
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,708
I'm sick of it!
I can't take it anymore!

339
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,041
Don't cry.

340
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,666
Apparently in their species,

341
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,250
the males prey on
ovulating females

342
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,875
and inseminate
the egg internally.

343
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,791
They must have run
low on females.

344
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,375
But, what I find most
tragic about their kind

345
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,333
is they develop romantic
feelings for their prey.

346
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,583
Their race has been
reduced to three survivors

347
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,750
who are tormented by guilt.

348
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,500
They don't pose a threat to you,
especially since you're men.

349
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,625
The four of you covered
my investigation fee

350
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,041
so I'll refund the rest.

351
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,041
What, you worried
about your girl?

352
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,750
Nah, she could put up one
hell of a fight if she had to.

353
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,416
Maybe I should
check on her anyway.

354
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,750
Man, I wish I had a girlfriend!

355
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,041
Moe Hibino disappeared.

356
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:43,166
Not long after, Yamamoto and
his family suddenly vanished.

357
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,875
Who wants chicken?

358
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,875
I got dibs on the thigh!

359
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,708
I want the breast!

360
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:16,916
Yeah, I bet you do.

361
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,541
I told ya, bro,
I'm a breast man!

362
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,333
I guess when it
comes down to it.

363
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,291
We're not really all that
different from them, are we?

364
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,166
The End.

365
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,833
Well?!

366
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,708
I'll pass.

367
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,166
Darker shows aren't
doing well in the ratings.

368
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,416
What?!

369
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,958
Humans deserve to know
the truth about aliens

370
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,083
and that's the whole
point of this show!

371
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,083
They exist and
they're not goin' away!

372
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,416
Not another one
of those freaks.

373
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,041
Yes, sir!

374
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,833
Unfortunately...

375
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,208
...my plan to convince
the humans of our existence

376
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,166
through a fictional
program on television

377
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,708
was a complete
and utter failure.

378
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,250
Baka out.

379
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,291
Chairman, can we try a more
direct approach now? Please?

380
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,375
--For my next plan...
--I have an idea!

381
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,750
Why don't we just tell
the humans directly?!

382
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,125
Sir.

383
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,958
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

384
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,791
who come and go as they please.

385
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,458
They've gotten so good at
disguising their appearance

386
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,625
and blending in
with the locals.

387
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,833
This is my apartment, you jerks!

388
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,791
It's time for you
to get the hell out!

389
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,750
That they've picked up
on some human behaviors.

390
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,625
Like bein' downright rude.

391
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,416
I think that should just
about do it for today, class.

392
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,333
Ms. Tachibana's an alien?!

393
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:10,791
That wasn't Ms. Tachibana,
that was an alien monster!

394
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,916
She's a cold-blooded assassin.

395
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,125
I heard she'll even kill
infants if the price is right.

396
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,750
Then why'd you have
to drag us here?!

397
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,166
Not cool, not cool.

398
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,041
She'll kill me. I'm gonna die!

399
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,583
Up next: Here Come
the Color Rangers!

400
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,458
Is it true that
you're an assassin?

401
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,958
It's true all right.
