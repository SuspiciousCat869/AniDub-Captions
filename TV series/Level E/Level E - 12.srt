1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,208
So are they Ellerians, Gramps?

2
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,916
No, that's a Dogran ship.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,166
Ever since this planet
was put under their watch,

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,875
things have started
goin' batty 'round here.

5
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,875
Where's my brother?

6
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,458
Unfortunately, he wandered
off a few days ago,

7
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,125
and we've been unable
to track him down.

8
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,458
You, of all people, know how
difficult the prince can be.

9
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,791
You must find him at once.

10
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,458
Yes, sir!

11
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,375
This is the place.
The planet that he calls home.

12
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,458
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

13
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,875
who come and go as they please.

14
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,333
Some are friendly,
others are hostile.

15
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,083
But they all do their best
to disguise their appearance

16
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,083
and blend in with the locals.

17
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:26,000
The only ones that haven't
caught on are the Earthlings.

18
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,083
Coming!

19
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,125
Hey!

20
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,375
Not you again! Crap!

21
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,166
I've gotta go into hiding;
they're after me!

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,750
Who's after you?

23
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,458
My younger brother
and my fiancée.

24
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,291
After you.

25
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,625
The second prince of Dogra,
Mohan Ki Et Dogra,

26
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,958
is a simple and honest man.

27
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,375
He's very popular
amongst the citizenry.

28
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,458
He's the prince they trust.

29
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,208
They bemoan the fact that
he's the second born

30
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,041
because they'd prefer
him as their ruler.

31
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:35,458
Then there's the first princess
of Magra, Luna Mi Mad Magra.

32
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,416
Her parents contracted
us to be married

33
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,125
before the poor dear
was even born.

34
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,500
While most women
would be horrified,

35
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:49,125
Princess Luna is content to
marry a complete stranger.

36
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,750
I am truly baffled
by that creature.

37
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,416
It's incredibly hard for me
to relate to either of them

38
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,541
because of their
conservative nature.

39
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,916
Yeah, I can imagine.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,291
Hey. That's a sweet
new bench press.

41
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, after playin'
at the Koushien,

42
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,916
I just gotta stay
fit for the scouts.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,333
Betcha don't make
the scouts drink this.

44
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,875
If you don't like it, leave!

45
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,541
Will I be using the
same futon as last time?

46
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,916
Yeah, is that a problem?

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,166
Well...

48
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,166
Excuse me?!

49
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,333
I don't know how
to tell you this,

50
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,791
but I'm kind of a big deal.

51
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,666
Here's an idea, why don't
you go back to your planet,

52
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,166
marry that princess
and become the king!

53
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,041
They got fluffy beds
waitin' for ya!

54
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,125
--I'll never become the king.
--Why?!

55
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,708
Because I went to
a lot of trouble

56
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,458
to convince Dogra's Succession
Assembly to pass a bill

57
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,375
that would keep me
from taking the throne.

58
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,166
What bill?

59
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,541
This legislation requires
the heir to the throne

60
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,583
to be married before
reaching adulthood.

61
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,250
If this condition is not met,
the right of inheritance

62
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,750
will be transferred to the
next in line of succession.

63
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,250
I'm surprised the assembly
passed the prince's bill

64
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,708
without an amendment.

65
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,791
I've approached them about
revising it but they refuse.

66
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,208
Why?!

67
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,708
Why would the assembly approve
such a ridiculous bill

68
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,166
in the first place?!

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,375
The first born prince has
always inherited the throne;

70
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,250
it's an age-old
Dogran tradition!

71
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,875
Well, not anymore.

72
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,125
You know. I think traditions
are kind of like rules;

73
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,125
they're made to be broken--

74
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:11,208
This bill will permanently alter
Dogra's line of succession!

75
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,125
Nobody wants that
idiot brother of his

76
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,625
to become ruler of Dogra.

77
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,166
Why doesn't he realize the
assembly's trying to prevent it?

78
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,416
Based on this planet's
measurement of time,

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,458
my brother only has one month
before he becomes an adult.

80
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,166
And if he fails to marry
Princess Luna within that month,

81
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,166
then the right of succession
will be transferred to me!

82
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,958
That's true. I know it
would break with tradition

83
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,875
but there are many Dograns who
would prefer you as their king.

84
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,458
But I'm not meant to
be the ruler of Dogra!

85
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,541
It's my duty to act
as his assistant,

86
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,958
and the exact same can be
said for Princess Luna.

87
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,291
I won't let my brother lose
his right to the throne!

88
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,958
I'll find him and ambush him
with a wedding if I have to!

89
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,250
Ah, crap.

90
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,208
And well, there it is.

91
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,916
So, basically you're playing
a game of cat and mouse.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
If you avoid them you win,

93
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,458
but if they catch you and force
you to marry Luna, they win.

94
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,916
When did you get here?!

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,333
That's it, exactly.

96
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,458
Thankfully I have Captain Craft
and his men on my side.

97
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,583
They'll keep Mohan and
Luna from tracking me down.

98
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,291
But they've got a
month to find you!

99
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,958
I'll just stay in hiding.

100
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,666
I can't believe those
two actually think

101
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,916
they're smart
enough to catch me!

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,291
I mean, this is me
we're talking about.

103
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,208
Hey. Is it weird
that I'm rooting

104
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,500
for his brother even though
I've never met the guy?

105
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,833
Do I want ramen? Or ramen?

106
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,916
--Don't just help yourself!
--Okay, okay.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,708
I guess I'll wait here while you
go get me something to eat.

108
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,291
But you better
get a move on.

109
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,625
You don't wanna miss the big
sale they're having at Q-Mart.

110
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,666
You can starve to
death for all I care!

111
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,666
Now, now, let's calm down.

112
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,666
Why are you so dead set against
becoming the king anyway?

113
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,250
You'd have the freedom to
do whatever you want, right?

114
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,666
No, not so much.

115
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,250
I'd get stuck with all
kinds of dumb kingly duties.

116
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,166
I'm a free spirit
who shouldn't be

117
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,166
bogged down with
responsibility!

118
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,166
All I have to do is
get through the month--

119
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,791
I found you!

120
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,791
Whoa. Who is that?!

121
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,000
It's my brother.

122
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,291
--What?!
--Huh?!

123
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,833
Now I hereby unite
the monarchies

124
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,791
of planets Dogra and
neighboring Magra.

125
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,708
May the marriage
of Baka Ki El Dogra

126
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:22,291
and Luna Mi Mad Magra
bring peace to us all.

127
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,291
Wow, your little brother is
just as brazen as you are.

128
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,875
I can't believe it myself.

129
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,458
Mohan has never confronted
me like this before.

130
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,791
I'm completely stumped
as to how to handle this.

131
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,416
Well, you better
start thinking fast!

132
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,500
Damn, that's cool!

133
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,041
And now, you'll put on
your respective rings

134
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,666
to conclude the ceremony.

135
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,375
Princess Luna will
put her ring on first.

136
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,750
May I say a few words?

137
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:00,916
My beloved prince, it's
truly an honor to meet you.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,750
I've dreamt of this
moment my entire life.

139
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,666
And now here we are,
face to face.

140
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,875
Seeing you in person

141
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,000
has only strengthened
my feelings for you.

142
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,791
So, what is she
rattling on about?

143
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:16,125
Just the usual female stuff,
blah blah feelings.

144
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:20,125
I vow to be your devoted
wife for all eternity.

145
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,041
Is that a ring?!

146
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,541
Yes, it's a special
bio-ring created for royals.

147
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,833
Once you put it on...

148
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,416
...it becomes part of your flesh

149
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,958
and you're stuck
with it for life.

150
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,458
No way!

151
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,500
If she was infatuated with me
before we'd ever even met,

152
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,333
that would make her a psycho,
which is totally my type.

153
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,666
So you're into the
crazies too, huh?

154
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,416
Your turn, Brother! Will you
please put on your ring?

155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,958
Just do it, and put
an end to this nonsense!

156
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,166
The citizens of Dogra
are depending on you

157
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,833
and I refuse to sit idly by

158
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,500
while you choose
to neglect them!

159
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,291
You've had your fun.
Now it's time to grow up--

160
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,166
You're not my boss! The real
fun hasn't even started yet!

161
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,958
I'm starting my Massive Fun
Earth Alteration Project soon--

162
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,583
I have no idea what
your brother said

163
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,958
but I'm pretty sure
you're in the wrong here!

164
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,541
Uh, Yukitaka!

165
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,416
He's gone?!

166
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,916
Brother!

167
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,916
They arrived sooner
than I anticipated.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,833
Yeah, they headed
straight for the apartment

169
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,666
when they left our house.

170
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,625
I suspect someone's
leaking information.

171
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,791
Why aren't Mohan's
bodyguards with him?

172
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,500
Perhaps he decided he would
rather make the trip alone.

173
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,125
Uh, I don't think so.

174
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,791
He probably thought you two
could talk this out peacefully

175
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,958
so there'd be no need for them.

176
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,000
Mohan would never travel
without his bodyguards.

177
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,791
Something fishy's going on here.

178
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,916
So what do you think has
him so deep in thought?

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,583
Like I'd know! But I've got a
bad feeling about this, Sado.

180
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,625
Oh. Hey, I'm sorry.
Let me pick up that mug for ya--

181
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,916
No, you can leave it.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,583
This is the mug that he was
drinking from, wasn't it?

183
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,000
I can sense it.
It's still warm.

184
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,875
Holding it makes me
feel closer to him.

185
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,500
Hold on. You speak
our language?

186
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:25,000
I fervently studied to master
it because someone once told me

187
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,125
that he is fond of
your local tongue.

188
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,708
Wait, who's fond of it?

189
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:33,000
That stupid--I mean, she must
be talking about Prince Baka.

190
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,625
There's nothing like
a good workout, huh?

191
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,125
You'd never hear that from
his lazy brother, would you?

192
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,500
Yeah, no joke.

193
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,708
Yukitaka?

194
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,750
How do you know
my name, Princess?

195
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,375
Well, I had you investigated.

196
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,125
I heard he stayed with you
when he first came to Earth,

197
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,541
so I wanted to learn
more about you.

198
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,666
O-kay.

199
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,666
I have a favor to ask.

200
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,000
If you don't mind,

201
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,791
would it be all right if
I stayed here with you?

202
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,416
But Princess, we still
have to find my brother.

203
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,458
I am well aware of
that Prince Mohan,

204
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,416
but he will not be
an easy man to catch.

205
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,416
We may be going about
all this the wrong way.

206
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,291
I think it would be best to
wait here until he returns.

207
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,791
Are you sure about that?

208
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,583
I mean, you barely
know me, right?

209
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,583
And my place is a bachelor pad.

210
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,625
In that case,
I shall stay as well.

211
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,833
Huh?!

212
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,625
There must be someone
here to protect her.

213
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,500
Don't worry, I promise
we won't impose on you.

214
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,166
You have got to be kiddin' me.

215
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,916
Sorry, Yukitaka, but it looks
like you're stuck with 'em.

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,625
He almost had us fooled.

217
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,125
But he's a schemer,
just like his brother.

218
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,833
A real-life princess.

219
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,375
So, how did he choose
to spend his time?

220
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,708
Well, let me see.

221
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,333
When he wasn't
busy tormenting me,

222
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,625
I would usually find
him reading in here.

223
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,041
Oh yeah! He also
liked watching TV.

224
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,666
What is TV?

225
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,208
It has been over
a year and a half

226
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,625
since our first close
encounter with a UFO.

227
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,291
However, it appears that the--

228
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,333
What is that?

229
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:15,458
What the hell do they see?

230
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,583
As you can see, we analyzed
the data you sent us

231
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,500
and as a result, we were
able to reveal the ship.

232
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,083
This is a bad idea. It violates
multiple space ordinances.

233
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,000
Good point, I suppose
we'll need a fall guy.

234
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,375
I choose you!

235
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,041
Try to keep your cool, sir.

236
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,500
If we're not careful, he
could become our next king.

237
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,833
I know that.

238
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,875
Could you show us the
other ship as well please?

239
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,708
They haven't found the
escape pod, your highness!

240
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,833
If you hurry, you could
use it to flee the planet!

241
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,833
That's odd.

242
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,416
Sorry?

243
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,333
They know it'd be impossible to
catch me if I made it into space

244
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,666
yet they didn't bother
looking for any spacecraft.

245
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,500
Doesn't that seem
rather strange?

246
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,083
Yes, it does.

247
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,041
That's true, but we all know how
impulsive Prince Mohan can be;

248
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,750
he probably just didn't take
the time to come up with a plan.

249
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,083
No, he always has a strategy.

250
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,458
He's without his bodyguards

251
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,458
and he hasn't blocked
my escape route.

252
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,541
Oh no.

253
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,250
I-Is something wrong,
your highness?

254
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,541
He wouldn't dare.

255
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,125
So early.

256
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,000
Princess?

257
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,708
I guess she went out.

258
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,375
You don't mind if I
borrow them, do you?

259
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,541
Thank you, Miho.
I appreciate it.

260
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,625
Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't
mean to wake you up.

261
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,375
No, I'm sorry! I swear I'm not
a peeping tom or anything!

262
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,458
It was totally an accident,
so don't call the cops!

263
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,041
Huh?

264
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,666
Go back in and close the door
while I've got my eyes covered!

265
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,666
Uh...

266
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,500
Hurry 'cause the
hand's comin' off!

267
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,625
Good morning, Yukitaka.

268
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,208
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,000
I went by Miho's apartment to
borrow some clothes from her.

270
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,250
But...

271
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,666
I hope it's okay;
I needed to take a shower.

272
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,333
It's cool.

273
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,791
Why is he staring
out into space?

274
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,791
How should I know?!

275
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,625
Where are we? And why'd he
drag us all the way out here?

276
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,833
Just as I suspected.

277
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,291
Is there something
flying overhead?

278
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,541
No, sir.

279
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,666
The clouds are in same
formation as yesterday.

280
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,166
Impossible!

281
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,625
My guess is they're using a
wormhole to create a barrier

282
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,500
and they're projecting this
artificial sky to hide it.

283
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,750
But why?!

284
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,791
Ridiculous! Attempting
such a thing would cause

285
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,833
a fluctuation in
time and space.

286
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,458
We would've caught
on right away.

287
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,583
What if the barrier surrounds
the entire planet, huh?

288
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,791
Then we wouldn't
notice the change.

289
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,916
Do you honestly believe they'd
go to such an extreme measure?

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,375
It is possible,

291
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,958
but the only way to know
for sure is to see if

292
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,208
there's anything lurking
beyond the Earth's atmosphere.

293
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,833
What the hell is going on?!

294
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,250
This is just one small area.

295
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,375
I would venture to guess
there are thousands--

296
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,708
more likely tens of
thousands of ships,

297
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,500
currently surrounding
this planet.

298
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,625
But why?

299
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,000
Hard to say, but,
it's safe to assume

300
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,708
someone went to great
lengths to summon them here.

301
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,708
But why haven't the people
of this planet noticed yet?

302
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,333
I realize the spacecraft
are hidden behind a barrier

303
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,291
but the Earthlings depend
on countless satellites--

304
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,500
It would be incredibly
easy to gain control

305
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,375
of their satellites'
communication.

306
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,625
Earth has very few
vessels that are capable

307
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,708
of reaching outer space,
and their primitive aeronautics

308
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,708
leaves them open
to manipulation.

309
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,583
Precisely.

310
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,250
The real mystery here is:

311
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,375
Who would stage such a
large-scale event and why?

312
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,375
Is it Prince Mohan?

313
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,500
He certainly has the motive
to be our prime suspect.

314
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,875
The barrier has successfully
trapped me on this planet.

315
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,416
But if that's all he was after,

316
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,541
then this should have
been handled differently.

317
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,666
All right, I confess!

318
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,958
I invited them all
here for your wedding.

319
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,375
How did you find us?

320
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,750
I knew you three were in
cahoots with my brother

321
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,208
from the moment I landed here.

322
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,791
I assure you, it's
not what you think,

323
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,000
and please believe
me when I say

324
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,125
we only have Dogra's
best interests at heart!

325
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,750
No need to worry.

326
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,125
I don't intend to
make an issue of this.

327
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,208
You're simply doing your job
as my brother's bodyguards.

328
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,833
So you mean,
we're not in trouble?!

329
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,083
That's Prince Mohan for you!

330
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,833
Princess Luna is at Yukitaka's
apartment awaiting your return.

331
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,833
And you expect me to
just waltz over to her?

332
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,833
Hey, a guy can hope.

333
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,083
Brother, I know you
have reservations,

334
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,375
but this is what's
best for our planet.

335
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,750
Please, don't disappoint
our invited guests.

336
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,333
The princess said she wants
to wait until you're ready.

337
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,333
But I'm prepared to resort to
force if we run low on time.

338
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,125
I hope it doesn't
have to come to that.

339
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,333
Question for you.

340
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,750
About Princess Luna,
do you love her?

341
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,458
Catch it!

342
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,458
Our planets have a
gravitational bond

343
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,541
similar to the Earth
and its moon.

344
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,708
Magra is a natural
satellite that orbits Dogra.

345
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,250
--You're out, buddy!
--Seriously?

346
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,500
That's awesome.

347
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,583
I just wish there was
life on our moon, too.

348
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,250
How do you know there's not?

349
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,958
Well, I think we
would've seen 'em by now.

350
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,458
Initially, Magra sought to win
its independence from Dogra,

351
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,416
which resulted in a
seemingly unending war.

352
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,666
In an effort to bring peace
to the war-torn planets,

353
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,000
it was decided that
Magra's first princess

354
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,625
would be contracted to marry
the crown prince of Dogra.

355
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,166
Safe!

356
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,916
Okay, so it's basically just
a marriage of convenience, huh?

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,291
And I guess you're
okay with that?

358
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,041
Yes, I am.

359
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,125
Since birth, we've been
required to exchange

360
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,541
videos of ourselves
once a month.

361
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,541
There wasn't a lot talking
to be done as babies,

362
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:15,000
but even as the years
passed and we grew older,

363
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,541
the prince remained a mystery.

364
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,208
Because he never spoke to me.

365
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,291
When I was told he
possessed a genius mind,

366
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,666
I dedicated my
life to academics

367
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,000
to prove myself
worthy of his love.

368
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:35,375
I finally broke through to him
by solving a difficult problem.

369
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,375
He came up with a
different solution

370
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,666
and proceeded to
walk me through it.

371
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,041
This went on for years,
until one day...

372
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,583
Well done, Princess Luna.

373
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,041
He spoke to me, and it
was the first time

374
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,041
I had ever heard his voice.

375
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,875
Sounds like somethin' he'd do.

376
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,041
From that moment on,
I knew that I wanted

377
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,041
to spend the rest of
my life with that man.

378
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,541
Naturally, I've heard
the vicious rumors

379
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,333
floating around about him.

380
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,750
They say he's the
nastiest man in space.

381
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,250
That he enjoys
watching others suffer.

382
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,625
And he's secretly plotting
to destroy the universe.

383
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,500
Then why do you
want to marry him?

384
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,083
Because there is no way being
with someone like that

385
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,250
could ever get boring!

386
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,208
She's so beautiful.

387
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,750
Yukitaka! You're up, man!

388
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,166
Coming!

389
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,041
Bye.

390
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,916
This sport looks like
it would be fun to play.

391
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,333
Hey, I think I've got an idea!

392
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,833
Ejiri, try to go easy on her!

393
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,083
Don't wanna be the guy
who hurt the hot chick.

394
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,875
"Go easy"? Yeah, right!
That ain't in my vocabulary!

395
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,666
Holy crap!

396
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,250
Whoa.

397
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,333
You wanna be on our team?

398
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,333
She saw right through me, huh?

399
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,125
Well, I have her under
surveillance, don't I?

400
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,875
Yes, I do.

401
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,666
Yeah, I think she knows you do.

402
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,708
She asked me to
deliver this to you.

403
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,291
I see.

404
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,333
Well, it appears that she's not
your run-of-the-mill princess.

405
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,875
What's that supposed to mean?

406
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,375
Okay, lemme see if I can get
this through your thick skull,

407
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,541
she came all this way
because she loves you!

408
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,875
Oh, and you know that because--

409
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,125
Because she told me!

410
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,708
And I don't have any
reason to doubt her.

411
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,333
I'll admit,
she's kinda weird

412
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,625
but she's also really cute,
and she's in love with you!

413
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,875
I'm sure of it!

414
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,958
Look, I don't know what
kinda crap's gone on

415
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,708
between your planets,
but I do know

416
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,666
Princess Luna's way
too good for you.

417
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,416
Aha! So now you've got the 
hots for her too, Yukitaka.

418
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,666
I didn't say that!

419
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,958
You didn't have to!

420
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,333
You're such a playboy,
first it was Miho--

421
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,750
One more word outta you and I'm
throwin' you over the ledge!

422
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,791
I've already made
this jump, remember?

423
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,416
Get serious, guys!
We've gotta figure out how

424
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,458
Princess Luna knows
your every move.

425
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,166
There has to be an
information leak somewhere.

426
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,625
Hmm...

427
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,041
--Hey, what're--
--Shhh!

428
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,000
Might I borrow a screwdriver?

429
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,083
We were bugged?!

430
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,375
You got it.
We've found our leak.

431
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,750
She's been spying
on us the whole time.

432
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,500
Do you think the princess
is responsible for this?

433
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,125
No, it would appear that
these predate her arrival.

434
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,833
I'd guess they've been here
since I first came to Earth.

435
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,458
If that's true,
then who planted them?

436
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,875
Let's find out!

437
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,583
Not this thing again.

438
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,125
Well, you know I hid several
cameras around your home.

439
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,791
This is the footage.

440
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,500
I've found evidence
that suggests

441
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,666
he's living with an Earthling.

442
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,375
Hey, don't you have an
outlet on that wall?!

443
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,916
That means...

444
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,500
Colin?

445
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,416
He's out checking
the garden for me.

446
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
He should be back
any minute now.

447
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,208
Found one!

448
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,375
Okay, we found a bug. But who
would've planted it out here?

449
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,625
Hey, would you get
off my back already?!

450
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,125
It's amazing! So beautiful!

451
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,500
What did they say?

452
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,041
It turns out Colin
was a spy after all;

453
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,750
he's probably returned to
the princess's side by now.

454
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,333
So, what is that?

455
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,791
Captain!

456
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,166
I've been unable to make
contact with our mother ship

457
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,416
or anyone else on Dogra.

458
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,791
This is something that
I think you need to see.

459
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,166
Sorry about this.

460
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,375
I hope this don't make
ya think badly of us.

461
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,875
So what do we do now?

462
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,375
You're in cahoots with our idiot
prince again, aren't ya?!

463
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,125
"Short walk", my ass!

464
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,375
Why did you bring us
all the way out here?!

465
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,000
Up next: Full moon!

466
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,000
You're cool! Totally cool!
