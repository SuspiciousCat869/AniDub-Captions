1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,750
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

2
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,916
who come and go as they please.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,666
One such alien is the idiot
prince of Dogra, who has flung

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,250
five unfortunate children to
the faraway planet Calvary,

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:30,541
which has been transformed into
a monster-filled RPG world.

6
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,958
Meanwhile, back on Earth.

7
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:38,875
Hi!

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,458
Everyone take your
seats now, okay?

9
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,791
This is bad,
they're absent again.

10
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,125
If they aren't
back by tomorrow,

11
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,625
I should probably
go look for them.

12
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:56,041
I swear, if that Prince
did anything to them,

13
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,250
I'll make him pay.

14
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,791
We're here!

15
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey King, where are ya?

16
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,166
I am the great King Iidachi.

17
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,666
The truth is something terrible
has befallen our land.

18
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,958
A bunch of grade school
kids march into his castle

19
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,625
and he starts
spilling his guts?

20
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,416
Gotta advance
the story somehow!

21
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,291
Perhaps you have heard
of the Demon King's

22
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,750
Dark Dragon Knight Air force.

23
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,208
Their leader, General Luch,

24
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:05,583
is determined to wed
my only daughter.

25
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,791
Luch's strength is truly
beyond imagination.

26
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,583
With one thrust of his lance,

27
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,958
even mighty mountains
are rent in twain.

28
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,500
I am willing to offer my
daughter's hand in marriage

29
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,250
to any man in the
kingdom brave enough

30
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,458
to vanquish General Luch.

31
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,000
Well then?

32
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,291
Have you the courage to protect
her from his evil clutches?

33
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,125
You heard him. So what now?

34
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,458
I don't like being tied
down to just one girl.

35
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,750
And I don't need a
princess when I have Rina!

36
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,208
All five are absent again?

37
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,833
Yes, unfortunately.

38
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,083
Yeah, Rina Itoi from
my class is absent,

39
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,291
and I haven't heard anything
from her parents yet.

40
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,625
Well, that probably
doesn't have

41
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,250
anything to do with
your boys, though.

42
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,041
I wonder.

43
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,416
Seems kinda harsh making us
fight the big boss monster

44
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,458
before we've done a
single fetch quest.

45
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,958
Yeah, no kiddin'!

46
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,958
You don't have
much of a choice!

47
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,416
There's a reason I went to
the trouble of finding out

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,333
which girls you like.

49
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,708
I like Rina Itoi.

50
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,708
Suck on that, Prince!
I'm finally free!

51
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,916
Allow me to introduce you
to my lovely daughter.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,291
Dear, come in and say hello.

53
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,875
It can't be.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,291
Is it the girl from Nakano?

55
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,666
Meet my lovely daughter,
Princess Apparel.

56
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,333
Hello, there. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

57
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,958
Although I am the
king's only daughter,

58
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,625
I would rather die
than be forced

59
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,625
to wed a monster like Luch.

60
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,666
Oh travelers from
afar, I beg you,

61
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,583
please protect me from the--

62
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,291
Then go ahead and die!

63
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,000
Did I say something
to anger you?

64
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,291
Yeah, everything that comes
out of your stupid mouth!

65
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,250
What's wrong- don't you
like pretty girls?

66
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,333
You've got a lot of
explaining to do!

67
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,041
I thought it'd be a funny
surprise if you were

68
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,041
expecting to see the girl
you had a crush on,

69
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,333
and then it ends up
being me- funny, huh?

70
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,833
Oh yeah, funny like
a needle in your eye!

71
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,208
And you thought we'd be
perfectly okay with this?

72
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,666
That we wouldn't
punch you in the face

73
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,500
and then tie you up with rope?

74
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,833
It did occur to me, but I--

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,166
Oh, I can't wait to see
the looks on their faces!

76
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,875
It'll be splendid!

77
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,708
I was so excited.
I wasn't thinking straight.

78
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,166
This guy's an addict, isn't he?

79
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,250
Or a straight-up psychopath.

80
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,875
Now, would you darling boys
mind untying me, please?

81
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,083
Yeah, right!

82
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,416
Send us back to earth
already, "princess"!

83
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,791
And stop the game, too!

84
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,291
It's too late for that.

85
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,750
So you wanna play rough, huh?

86
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,291
We're the ones making
the demands, here!

87
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,333
You must understand,
if I were the Demon King,

88
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,875
that would be one thing,

89
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,875
but since I'm the princess,
I can't control the scenario!

90
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,083
What?

91
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,958
The Demon King has an AI that
thinks and learns for itself.

92
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,916
I may be its creator,
but even I can't predict

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,083
what it will do anymore.

94
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, the space ship
and game system

95
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,166
are both in the
Demon King's castle.

96
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,333
In other words, until you
rescue me and beat the bad guy,

97
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,000
you're stuck right
here on Calvary!

98
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,666
That means you're
stuck here too, dummy!

99
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,250
You didn't know?!

100
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,416
Whatever shall we do?

101
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,916
You suck!

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,250
Like it or not,

103
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,083
we'll have to come up
with a solution together.

104
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,375
General Luch is gonna
show up any second now.

105
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,708
The question is, do we protect
the prince--er, princess or not?

106
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,041
Why would I want
to protect him?!

107
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,041
Yeah, let him be
that demon's bitch!

108
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,625
Although that would
be pretty funny,

109
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,250
we have to remember that he's
the one who created this game.

110
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,458
Having him on our side would
give us a huge advantage.

111
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,875
Good point.

112
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,333
Hey "princess", whaddya
think we should we do next?

113
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,208
What level are you boys?

114
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,541
Between 35 and 70.

115
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,958
General Luch is level
one thousand three hundred.

116
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,208
We're gonna die!

117
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,250
Worry not, he'll come by to meet
you but he's not programmed

118
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,041
to fight you right off the bat.

119
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,500
For now, try to impress
him with your manliness,

120
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,666
and he'll start to
respect you as a rival.

121
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,875
Get ready. He's here.

122
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,333
So that must the guy we're
supposed to beat, huh?

123
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:40,416
I expect a favorable
answer this time, old man.

124
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,625
I won't give you my
daughter, no matter what!

125
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,625
He's still here?!

126
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,750
Hate to break it
to you, freakshow,

127
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,625
but the lady's just
not that into you.

128
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,833
Why don't you screw off

129
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,416
and get your mack on
somewhere else, okay?

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,708
And you are?

131
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,333
We are Princess
Apparel's guards!

132
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,416
You think you're funny?

133
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,291
Get out of my sight
before I destroy you, brat.

134
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,625
Go ahead and try it you-

135
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,375
Next time I won't miss.

136
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,333
I thought you said he
wasn't gonna fight us yet?!

137
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,833
--I didn't think he was.
--Say what?!

138
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:21,000
It would appear that the
enemy's AI has been reset.

139
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,083
And there's only one person
capable of doing that.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,291
The Demon King?

141
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,291
He's more cunning
than I expected.

142
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:35,041
It's too dangerous to
continue the game like this.

143
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,041
Head East to the Saint's Shrine.

144
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,833
Its power repels monsters.
You'll be safe there.

145
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,833
Huh? But what about you?

146
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,708
Don't worry, I'll cook up a
plan to get us back to Earth.

147
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,750
Wha-- Wait!

148
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,041
Please don't harm them.

149
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,625
I will agree to
become your wife.

150
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,166
--You can't leave me!
--He's still here?

151
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,250
Is this for real?

152
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,166
Let's hope it's just
part of the game.

153
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,000
No, I think the Prince was
telling the truth this time.

154
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,416
Think you can beat me, huh?

155
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,041
That's what he said
as he walked away.

156
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,916
Okay, all together, guys!

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,375
Color Rangers!

158
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,875
Bus gas blast! Bus gas
blast! Bus gas blast!

159
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,250
How much wood would
a woodchuck chuck

160
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,666
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?

161
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,791
Yokota!

162
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,083
Nine nice night nurses
nursing nicely.

163
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,500
Nine nice night
nurses nursing nicely!

164
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,750
A totally tough tongue twister

165
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,041
is totally on the
tip of my tongue!

166
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,791
Is everyone okay?

167
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,083
Yeah, somehow.

168
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,125
What's wrong?

169
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,416
I hate to say it,
but I feel like

170
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,291
the Color Ranger theme
song should be playing.

171
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,791
There's no time to be
fooling around, gosh!

172
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,500
You have to hurry to the shrine!

173
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,625
We get it, ass wipe,
we're on our way.

174
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,333
Battle Light, go!

175
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,791
In the meantime,
let me tell you

176
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,333
a few things about
the Demon King.

177
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:24,083
He can take many forms and
remodel his entire body at will.

178
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,708
He can be anywhere from
1 to 15 meters tall and

179
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:30,375
alter his features with a nearly
infinite set of variations.

180
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,583
As a result, no one has
ever seen his true form.

181
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,541
Great. That's really useful.

182
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,166
Didn't you create him?

183
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,708
Yeah, but I believe that a good
game should hold surprises,

184
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,208
even for the one
who creates it.

185
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,166
Yeah, but normally
games can't kill people!

186
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,208
By the way, should you
really be contacting us

187
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,041
when you're with Luch?

188
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,083
Don't worry.

189
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,791
He doesn't know how to treat
a lady on her wedding night,

190
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,750
so he's studying up on that.

191
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,666
Although he is equipped with
a highly advanced battle AI,

192
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,458
I suspect that it'll
take him a while longer

193
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,041
to learn how to-- You know...

194
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,375
Pardon me, Princess.

195
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,791
But are you normal,
uh, down there?

196
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,625
Let's just say you have quite
the surprise waiting for you.

197
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,125
One moment please.

198
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,250
Let's examine this; there are
three ways the game could end.

199
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,208
One: you could all die.

200
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,083
Two: you could beat
the Demon King.

201
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,000
Or three: the game
could stop working.

202
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,125
Obviously, 2 or 3
would be better.

203
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,833
The problem is,
the Demon King's army

204
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,250
is guarding his castle
very carefully.

205
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,458
Whether we clear the
game or shut it down.

206
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,166
We have to find a way
to get through them first.

207
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,416
Just tell us what level we
need to get to to beat them

208
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,416
and we'll see what we can do.

209
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,625
Hey, did you hear me?!

210
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,750
Oh, guards shmards,
what's important is that

211
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,625
the Demon King fears "game
over" even more than we do.

212
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,583
Because it wouldn't just
be the end of his life,

213
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,875
it'd be the end of this world.

214
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,583
In other words, you don't need
to worry about him killing you.

215
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,875
Instead, he'll probably
put you under confinement

216
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,541
and keep you alive
as long as he--

217
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,708
Princess, what kind of toys
would you like to use?

218
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,166
Let's save the randy stuff

219
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,041
for when the
relationship gets stale.

220
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,833
One moment please.

221
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,583
Let me gather a bit more
information before we meet up.

222
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,416
Wait at the shrine until then.

223
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,875
That must be it.

224
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,083
Sure you'll be able to sneak
out on your wedding night?

225
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,375
I'm going to fight
to keep my chastity,

226
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,666
but if I happen to
be running late,

227
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,333
I'd rather you not
ask what happened.

228
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,625
I almost feel sorry
for the poor bastard.

229
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm just happy we're not
the ones getting cornholed.

230
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,750
Come Princess, let us begin.

231
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,750
I have become well-versed
in the ways of lovemaking

232
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,666
and vow to satisfy
you completely.

233
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,666
Well, in that case.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,583
I managed to
overcome my crisis.

235
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,375
Yeah? How'd you pull that off?

236
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,791
Why don't you ask me again
when you're a little older?

237
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,250
Bedroom Role play: A school
boy's sexy teacher asks him

238
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,500
to stay after class, then
promptly forgets about him.

239
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,458
I got a map to the
Demon King's castle.

240
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,208
I'm on my way to
meet you right now.

241
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,583
We'll be back on Earth in
no time, Color Rangers.

242
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,291
Count on it!

243
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,833
Wait a minute.

244
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,958
That's the Demon King's army!

245
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,041
You've got a ton of monsters
right on your tail,

246
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,916
so you'd better hurry to
the shrine right away!

247
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,833
Run for it!

248
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,291
Guys, wait for me!

249
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,791
Did he prepare the army
because he knew I would escape?

250
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,041
If that's the case,

251
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,958
then General Luch was
conveniently left behind

252
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,666
to guard the castle while
all of his troops are busy.

253
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,875
Not bad. I'm starting
to enjoy this.

254
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,333
Akagawa!

255
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,083
Quit being such a pain
in the ass, leader!

256
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,250
I guess we survived.

257
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,625
Hey Prince, where are
you at right now?

258
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,833
Sorry to keep you
gents waiting so long.

259
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,666
Anyway, I guess
we need a plan, huh?

260
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,666
Clearly, getting out of
here is going to be tough.

261
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,500
Maybe we should use Red
as a decoy and hightail it.

262
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,125
Or maybe we can offer him
as a human sacrifice.

263
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,291
Hey.

264
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,208
Hey, one of 'ems
coming over. Look.

265
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,333
The heck is that?

266
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,000
Another Prince Baka?!

267
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,458
I have come here to
negotiate, not to fight.

268
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,916
So, even if things go wrong,
I want all of you to stay back.

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
He's giving them orders?

270
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,916
There's only one creature who
can command monsters like that.

271
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,083
In other words,
that's the Demon King.

272
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,875
What's the deal?
He's coming up the stairs!

273
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,583
You said this place
repels monsters!

274
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,500
Yes. Well, more precisely,

275
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,083
it repels a monster's
unique framework.

276
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,708
Then how is he
able to do that?!

277
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,333
Don't sacrifice me!

278
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,208
Think. There has to
be a reason for this.

279
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,666
Of course!

280
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,708
So what should we do?!

281
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,708
It's too late to
come up with a plan;

282
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,125
all we can do now is fight!

283
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,750
No, no, no,
I think we'll be fine.

284
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,958
If the Demon King is able
to enter the shrine,

285
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,208
he must've given up his monster
form for a commoner's body.

286
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,625
Which means he's even weaker
than the weakest enemy

287
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,166
in the game right now.

288
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,583
Why'd he do that?

289
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,500
I have a pretty good idea,
but it's hard to explain.

290
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,708
Pleased to meet you,
I am the Demon King.

291
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,000
Uh, hello.

292
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,333
This, is the game console.

293
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,250
I have no intention of stopping
you from leaving this planet.

294
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,458
If you are not pleased
with our negotiations,

295
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,458
then I will permit you to turn
off this console at any time.

296
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,750
However, I hope you will
trust me and allow this game

297
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,375
to continue on indefinitely.

298
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,041
Wait, isn't your whole purpose
in life to like, kill all of us?

299
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,291
No, it isn't.

300
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,083
I knew nothing
when I was born.

301
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,750
Only one thought
echoed in my mind.

302
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,875
"You are the Demon King."

303
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:05,708
I had no memories, no goal,
no reason for living.

304
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,041
Hey Prince, you didn't
happen to forget to program

305
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,458
the Demon King with
a purpose, did you?

306
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,708
It's complicated.

307
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,333
The first thing I did
was acquire information

308
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,250
so that I could find
a purpose for my life.

309
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,041
In my search, I learned
of both good and evil,

310
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,500
and much to my surprise
that the Demon King

311
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,541
was to be the
greatest evil of all.

312
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,250
But that wasn't
the worst part.

313
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,166
I also learned that
my creator, my father,

314
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,000
derived pleasure from making
other people miserable.

315
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,041
I probably shouldn't
have put that

316
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,083
in my social network profile.

317
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,750
While I am still grateful
that he gave life to me,

318
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:45,791
I swore that I would never
become anything like him.

319
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,375
My dream is to
turn this planet

320
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,500
into a haven for
monsters of every kind.

321
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,625
To make it a world without war,

322
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,125
where we can act of
our own free will.

323
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,708
The face I wear acknowledges
where I came from,

324
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,625
but it also reminds me
to go someplace different.

325
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,375
I want the title of "Demon
King" to become a legacy that

326
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,708
I can be proud of, not
something that I run away from.

327
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,625
Please, say that
you believe in me!

328
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,666
So what should we do?

329
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,666
We could be playing
into his trap, you know.

330
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,333
The prince made him, and
he looks like the prince,

331
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,500
so he's bad!

332
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,375
The only...

333
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,625
The only lullaby
I've ever known

334
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,333
is the Color Ranger theme song!

335
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,166
Does this mean you...

336
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,083
We all believe in you.

337
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,875
Yeah, I'm cool with
letting the game go on.

338
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,875
Thank you, everyone!

339
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,125
Thank you so much!

340
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,666
Well, I'm against it.

341
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,916
Please. Tell us why.

342
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,666
Because if we let
him have his way,

343
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,166
then the game will never
achieve its true purpose.

344
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,333
And what is its "true purpose"?

345
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,833
To put it simply, this
world is my little toy box

346
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,125
where everyone gets to suffer

347
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,833
and I get to laugh at
them while they do.

348
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,291
What?

349
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,250
Of course, the story would
start out innocently enough,

350
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,458
the important thing is
that it draws you in...

351
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,833
Then before you know it
you're completely addicted

352
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,583
and bit by bit it
starts to corrupt you.

353
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,916
For example, there's a
city to the west of here

354
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,041
absolutely drowning
in corruption,

355
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,125
desire and treachery, and
even if you keep your sanity,

356
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,208
it's guaranteed to make you
lose faith in humankind!

357
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,708
Then there are the items!

358
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,208
A strength potion that won't
let you sleep for three days

359
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,250
and a perfume so strong
it gets you high!

360
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,041
And don't forget all
the attacks I designed

361
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,541
to feed the destructive
instincts deep inside you!

362
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,041
My favorite combines your
powers into a golden force

363
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,791
that can crush any enemy
no matter how strong!

364
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,291
Wow, and how are you
supposed to use that one?

365
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,541
If you point a finger at
your target and all say

366
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,375
"Golden Hammer" at the
same time, then suddenly,

367
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,666
the fist of justice
will unleash its fury!

368
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,916
Golden Hammer!

369
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,791
We'll come back to play
again sometime real soon.

370
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,166
And don't worry, we'll be
sure to live long lives!

371
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,208
Yeah! We do have to keep
the game running, after all.

372
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,333
It was an RPG, but now I think
it's more like a life-simulator.

373
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,875
Yeah, and you're the
new hero, Demon King!

374
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,125
Thank you.

375
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,250
We must never cower,
our courage will empower

376
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:43,708
and our strength
will save our lives.

377
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:49,958
When you are afraid, alone,
there's one rule you must obey.

378
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,875
Call upon the colors...

379
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,291
Good luck to you all!

380
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,083
I hope you have a safe
journey back to Earth!

381
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:03,125
Black and red, lift up your
head, yellow, white and blue.

382
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,583
Color your heart with justice--

383
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,750
That little guy's the nicest
evil king I've ever met.

384
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,500
Nothing like his dad at all.

385
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,708
How far is it to Earth?

386
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,958
We all wanna get back
home soon, okay?

387
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,250
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,041
It's about 3 hours through
the local wormhole.

389
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:23,416
Course, the regular route will
take about 11.6 billion years.

390
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,708
Then you should take
the wormhole, obviously!

391
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,625
The toll is pretty expensive.

392
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,458
Good thing you're paying!

393
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,416
Whoa, I can, like, see infinity!

394
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,250
Heeyah!

395
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,416
Good mornin', Ms. Tachibana!

396
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,083
Right back at ya!

397
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:52,583
Luckily, the five boys made it
back to Earth safe and sound.

398
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,041
Hey!

399
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,583
Unfortunately, they
failed to realize that

400
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,333
as long as they allowed
the game to continue,

401
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,875
they would be transported
to the planet Calvary

402
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,333
any time they met in
their classroom.

403
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,208
Maybe I should've offed
that Prince after all.

404
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,833
Although the boys had made
peace with the Demon King,

405
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,791
they soon found
themselves face to face

406
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,250
with the newly crowned
Great Demon King.

407
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,708
But that's a story
for another time.

408
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,708
Princess Saki of the
Macbacs is coming.

409
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,541
She's set to arrive
on Earth tomorrow.

410
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,041
I didn't realize their
princess was in heat already.

411
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,333
Within a few generations,

412
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,791
the species they mate with
always goes extinct!

413
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,000
All that really matters
is that we're together!

414
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,416
The rest of the world can
go and die, for all I care!

415
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,416
Why is this happening to me?!

416
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,916
Up Next: You're my darling!

417
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,875
It's almost as if fate
brought us together, isn't it?
