1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,500
Can you guys believe
I made it to level 10?!

2
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:14,541
You're still level 3 or 4,
so you wouldn't know.

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,708
But around level 5 you start
getting some abilities

4
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,041
that might actually be
pretty useful in a fight.

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,416
Here, I'll show you.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,125
My level 10 move is gonna
blow your feeble minds.

7
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,166
Little Bomb!

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,708
So are you jealous now, or what?

9
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,750
Hearing that level up jingle
really gets my blood pumping!

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,791
You've done well, dear leader.

11
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,708
Now take the day off so
you'll be well-rested

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,166
for your big showdown
with the Demon, Craft.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,250
What big showdown?

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,125
The whole team's
counting on you, Leader.

15
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,333
Wait. Noooo!

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,833
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

17
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,166
who come and go as they please.

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,875
Some of 'em are friendly while
others can be downright hostile.

19
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,875
And so, five boys, were chosen

20
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,458
to serve as the primary
colored warriors of justice

21
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,916
known as the Color Rangers.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,125
With their strength combined,

23
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,250
they head to Yamagata
to face off with

24
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,166
the Demon King's
nefarious minion, Craft.

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,291
Get outta my head,
you stupid prince!

26
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,416
Jeez, I wish those
cicadas would shut up.

27
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,000
I figured since we were going
north, it wouldn't be so hot.

28
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,458
What do you expect?!
Snow in summer?

29
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,875
What?

30
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,833
You need to stop complaining
and take this seriously!

31
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,083
We're in the heart of
enemy territory right now!

32
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,458
The Demon Lord's
minions could strike at-

33
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,333
Is that supposed to
be Craft's hideout?

34
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,041
Sure doesn't look like much.

35
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,708
Well, it says
"Dogra" right there.

36
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,708
Not very subtle, huh?

37
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,625
Looks like the nameplate used
to say "Earth Defense Force"

38
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,125
before they tried
to wipe it off.

39
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,000
Man, they're not even
trying, are they?

40
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,333
You can tell that guy works out.

41
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,500
Uh, sir? You're not
Mr. Craft, are you?

42
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,166
Yes. Yes, I am.

43
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,125
Uh, hold on a sec.

44
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,541
He looks kinda tough.

45
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,166
I'm scared! Let's go home!

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,500
Hell no! Those train
tickets were expensive!

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,958
I wanna see a fight!

48
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,958
Oh, come on! It wasn't even
your money, you big baby!

49
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,375
You can do it, Leader.

50
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,500
Don't give up. All of our
fates rest in your hands.

51
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,916
Hold on a sec!

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,750
The Color Rangers are supposed
to be a team, you know!

53
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,166
Less talking and more fighting!

54
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,291
I wanna see blood!

55
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,375
Hello, nice to meet you.

56
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,958
To be perfectly honest?

57
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,625
We came here to steal a key
from you, Mr. Demon, sir.

58
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,708
A key?

59
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,791
Whoooa, actually,
on second thought,

60
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,500
it might be better if
you just kept it here.

61
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,583
I mean, we don't
need that key anyway.

62
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,166
What was I even thinking?

63
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,416
Akagawa's useless
again, big surprise.

64
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,375
I don't know what it does
or why you need it,

65
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,000
but I think I know the key
you're talking about.

66
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,958
Anyway, come inside.

67
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,541
I see.

68
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,083
I had a feeling he
was up to no good.

69
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,500
But still.

70
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,166
He expects me to fight
a bunch of grade school kids?

71
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,791
He seems as torn up
about this mess as we are.

72
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,458
Can't say I blame him- if he
works for that stupid prince,

73
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,250
he must have it pretty bad.

74
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,333
I do indeed have the
key you're looking for.

75
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,750
So you'll give it to us, then?

76
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,500
Never. You weaklings
might as well give up.

77
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,625
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

78
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,458
Huh?

79
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,916
But why the hell not?!

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,708
It's a treasure that
the prince ordered me

81
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,583
to protect with my life.

82
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,000
In other words,
if you want it,

83
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,750
I'm afraid you must
defeat me first.

84
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,833
I'm willing to bet that
moron's eavesdropping

85
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,708
through your bracelets
as we speak.

86
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,041
I'm in a delicate
situation here,

87
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,708
so I can't just
hand over the key.

88
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,708
In other words, I need for
you to play along for now.

89
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,416
Fine! If you wanna fight,
then you got yourself one,

90
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,833
you evil demon monster!

91
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,375
I'd be careful if I were you!

92
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,041
I may be a kid,
but I know karate!

93
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,458
Then have at it,
foolish mortal!

94
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,875
Dragon kick!

95
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,333
No fair! Don't hit
me from behind!

96
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,958
Owowow. Hey,
that really hurt!

97
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,000
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

98
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,333
Please don't take the key.

99
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,666
I'm begging you,
anything but that!

100
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,875
Lucky for us, Craft the Demon
was a pretty nice guy after all.

101
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:31,291
Let's hurry up and get
these stupid bracelets off.

102
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,375
Right!

103
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,750
I don't know how to use it.

104
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,250
First you beat me, and
then you ask for my pity?

105
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,083
What do you take me for?

106
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,916
Sorry, but I'm too old
to play with toys.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,708
I have no idea how it works.

108
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,958
Yes, who is it?

109
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,541
Hey Ms. Tachibana.
It's me, Shimizu.

110
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,625
Yeah, uh...

111
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,625
We got the key but
we have a problem.

112
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,791
See, we can't use it
'cause we don't know how.

113
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,166
I see.

114
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,666
Unfortunately, I'm not
sure how to use it either.

115
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,791
I could try to look it up,

116
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,375
but since the Prince
altered the suits,

117
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,916
he probably changed the way
the key works as well.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,541
Guess you're right.

119
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,875
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,083
Turns out Ms. Tachibana
doesn't know either.

121
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,791
So we came all the
way to Yamagata

122
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,041
to get a key that
we can't even use?

123
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,500
I bet he wasn't
gonna let us take

124
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,625
these things off
in the first place!

125
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,625
The Prince sure does love
to see us suffer, doesn't he?

126
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,750
So, what should we do now?

127
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,208
I can't take it!

128
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,541
Hey Prince! Are you listening?

129
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,166
Forget it, I know you are!

130
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,708
You probably think this
is real funny, don't you?!

131
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,708
Well the joke's on you,
because from now on,

132
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,958
I'm teaming up with the kids!

133
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,458
You're gonna apologize to them

134
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,291
even if it's with
your dying breath!

135
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,833
Sado! Colin!
Get back here now!

136
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,125
But we're in the
middle of collecting

137
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,625
beetles for our research, sir.

138
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,166
Irrelevant! We're going
to take down the Prince!

139
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,250
You can count me out.

140
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,250
Is that it? You wanna
be my enemy now?

141
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,416
'Cause you are if you don't
come back this instant!

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,250
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,083
I wonder what I should wear?

144
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,583
Sure, it comes off. It's easy.

145
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,583
Yeah?

146
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,500
My friend's son
has one of these.

147
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,583
It probably works the same way.

148
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,750
How'd his work? Tell me.

149
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,666
First, you twist the round piece
on the back end of the key.

150
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,458
That should make the keyhole
on the bracelet appear.

151
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,666
Oh!

152
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,166
After that,

153
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,250
the liquid metal on the tip
of the key will take shape.

154
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,458
It should fit in
the keyhole now.

155
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,708
Oh, sweet!

156
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,000
And then...

157
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,500
State your password.

158
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,666
Password?!

159
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,083
There's a password?!

160
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,083
I bet the Prince made one
before he gave 'em to us!

161
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,833
It should have some
sort of hint function

162
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,000
for people who've
forgotten their passwords.

163
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,833
Hint function?

164
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,333
To retrieve your password,

165
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,791
state the name of the girl or
girls you have a crush on.

166
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,083
"I like Rina Itoi."

167
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,833
Oh, the girl from Class 2?

168
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,958
I think she already has
a crush on someone else.

169
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,708
Well, I like her anyway!

170
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,583
Yeah, suck on that,
Prince! I'm finally free!

171
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,000
Who wants to go next?

172
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,416
Mayuzumi, are you ready?

173
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Sure, why not?

174
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,625
It doesn't seem like the Prince
booby-trapped it or anything.

175
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,250
"No one in particular."

176
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,041
All right. Who
wants to go next?

177
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,583
Man, that was pretty smooth.

178
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,833
I never knew he was so classy.

179
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,458
Here, Akagawa. Have at it.

180
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,958
Think I'll pass.

181
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,833
I'm perfectly happy keeping
the bracelet on, thank you.

182
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,083
What are you staring at?

183
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,625
Don't get the wrong idea,

184
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,125
it's not like I'm shy about
saying who I have a crush on.

185
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,458
I just happen to think
the bracelet's cool, okay?

186
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,791
'Kay. I'll go.

187
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,541
But I've gotta warn ya,
my list is a real doozie.

188
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,000
Uh, let's see.

189
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,458
Sayaka Natsumoto, Ayaka
Sakurada, Yuuko Kojima,

190
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,916
Kei Nakahori, Manami Maeda,
Elena Ogawa, Tomomi Kawakita,

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,750
Kyoka Kuramochi,
and Kana Komori.

192
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,250
I'm just getting started.

193
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,875
Rina Toono, Kayo Nobi, Yuuka
Masubata, Natsuki Matsubara,

194
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,875
Kazumi Omoteno, Renka Tada,
and Youka Nishiyama...

195
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,250
I think that should cover it.

196
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,208
Password, incomplete.

197
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,041
For real?
Oh! Sae Kanzawa!

198
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,291
Sorry. You're still
missing one.

199
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,083
Geez, I don't know who's left.

200
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,833
Maybe that girl
I met in Nakano?

201
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,458
Ah, come on, her name's
on the tip of my tongue.

202
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,708
Dude, you're a scumbag.

203
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,916
Go ahead. We'll
skip him for now.

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,375
Uh, I think I'll
do mine over there.

205
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,500
What's wrong?

206
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,250
Oh, don't tell me
you're too shy!

207
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,291
I'm not shy!

208
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,833
Then why don't
you tell us, huh?

209
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,666
We wanna hear all about
your secret crush, big guy!

210
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,750
C'mon!

211
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,791
So that's how it is?
Well, that's fine with me!

212
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,458
You're about to get
stomped by the toughest

213
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,500
elementary school kid
in all of Japan, buddy.

214
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:16,083
What does it matter if
you say her name or not?

215
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,875
What, is she ugly?

216
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,708
As leader, I command you guys
to stop fighting each other now!

217
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,000
That's what the Prince
wants us to do!

218
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,916
Little Bomb! Little Bomb!
Little Bomb! Little Bomb!

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,791
I warned you,
but you wouldn't listen!

220
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,791
I swear, all you guys
ever do is fight!

221
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,583
You're driving me crazy!

222
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,916
The Red Ranger is
totally flippin' out, man.

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,250
Yeah, I guess we'd
better call it a truce.

224
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,208
Here, go take it off
somewhere else.

225
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,416
All right.

226
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,708
Would you think about
what you're doing?!

227
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,958
There, there, everything's
gonna be alright.

228
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,208
Sorry 'bout your watermelons.

229
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,750
It's not your fault.

230
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,791
The prince makes me want
to destroy things, too.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,166
Nice to have that weirdo
out of your head, huh?

232
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,791
It's a whole lot
easier to take a dump

233
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,875
when someone isn't
listening in on you.

234
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,833
Akagawa, just take
it off already!

235
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,083
I don't even know what
you're so mad about!

236
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,916
After I remember that
last girl's name,

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,333
I'll give you the key
and you can use it

238
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,083
in the privacy of
your own home.

239
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,166
I said I don't need it
'cause I'm not taking it off.

240
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,875
Well, I'm not gonna force you.

241
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,791
But as for me, I think
I'm done with super powers

242
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,583
and alien princes for good.

243
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,458
Yeah, you said it.
That was a pain in the ass.

244
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,083
At least we all got
a happy ending, right?

245
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,125
And so the five
elementary schoolers

246
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:38,291
gave up the mantle of justice
and lived happily ever after.

247
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,083
Yeah, you wish.

248
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,958
Rina Itoi from Class 2, huh?

249
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,375
She's a real cutie.

250
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,541
Click.

251
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,375
You too, huh?

252
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,500
I dunno what's wrong with me.

253
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,541
For some reason,
I couldn't throw it out.

254
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,291
--Ditto.
--Huh?

255
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,916
Seems like we all brought
them to school with us, too.

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,291
I don't get it.

257
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,541
Hey, what's up?

258
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,875
Good morning!

259
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,625
Did you ever remember
the rest of that password?

260
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,000
You can't blame me.
I only met the girl once.

261
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,375
That's like trying to
get me to remember

262
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,083
everything I ate last week.

263
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,375
Dude, you're a total
scumbag, for real.

264
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,541
Hey guys!

265
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,875
Can you guess
who's level 15 now?

266
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,333
I can't tell if he's on
his medication, or off it.

267
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,000
Sure am glad
I kept my bracelet!

268
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,208
You guys are missing out!

269
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,291
Did you know...
at level 15 you--

270
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,708
You're seein' this too, right?

271
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:08,041
I don't know what it is,
but yeah, I'm seeing it.

272
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,666
Hey, what's that thing?

273
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,166
The Color Rangers retrieved the
key, but little did they know

274
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,083
that was all part of
the Prince's scheme!

275
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,750
When all five rangers gathered
in the classroom that morning,

276
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,750
a mysterious power
entered the key.

277
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,708
They were transported from
Earth to the planet Calvary,

278
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,625
5 hundred million
light-years away.

279
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,250
You seriously don't have
anything better to do?

280
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,875
Unfortunately for them,

281
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,583
Calvary is a deadly
den of monsters!

282
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,416
How will they survive?

283
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,708
We'll be rooting for
you, Color Rangers!

284
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,416
What's Demon King Quest?

285
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
And why is it seven?

286
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,166
I get it.

287
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,083
It's like he used some
kind of RPG maker.

288
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,416
A wha-?

289
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,250
Well, I guess you
could say it's like

290
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,416
a do-it-yourself
video game maker.

291
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,833
So basically, he made a game
and dragged us into it.

292
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,750
That's why we couldn't
throw away our bracelets.

293
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,583
They're plot items in the game.

294
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,708
So what you're saying is,

295
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,875
we been playin' this
game for a while.

296
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,833
Wait, the manual said there's
no way to come back to life,

297
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,416
so it's more like murder
than a video game, isn't it?

298
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,708
This is balls!

299
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,333
We're gonna get killed
by monsters, aren't we?

300
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,625
Akagawa, hurry up and
transform before everyone dies!

301
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,541
Okay! Red Charge, go!

302
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,375
Eat Little Bomb!

303
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,000
Yokota, what level
are you right now?

304
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,833
Still at one-what're you?

305
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,541
Two.

306
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,500
Damn it, we gotta find a town
so we can come up with a plan.

307
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,125
No complaints here.

308
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,125
They just disappeared,
like it was magic!

309
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,291
Okay, let's calm
down, everyone!

310
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,041
Please listen to me!

311
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,166
No! They vanished
into thin air! Right?

312
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,041
Right!

313
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,916
I'm sure the Prince
is behind this.

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,291
Those poor boys.

315
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,625
Maybe I should've
tried to help them out

316
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,750
a little more after all.

317
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,958
Whoa!

318
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,625
My desk just totally
split in half!

319
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,333
Okay. I'm taking
attendance now, everyone.

320
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:20,666
In a galaxy far, far away, there
is a role playing game creation

321
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,000
program that allows the user
to modify actual planets.

322
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,750
One such place is
the planet Cavalry,

323
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,791
which has been transformed into
a land of monsters and mayhem,

324
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,791
courtesy of the Prince's
wild imagination.

325
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,458
Welcome to Hamajiri-
enjoy your stay.

326
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,833
Hi, we're kind of
stuck in this game.

327
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,666
Do you think you can help us?

328
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,000
Welcome to Hamajiri-
enjoy your stay.

329
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,375
Uh, okay.

330
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,791
Welcome to Hamajiri-
enjoy your stay.

331
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,250
Could you direct us to an
inn or something, maybe?

332
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,291
Welcome to Hamajiri-
enjoy your--

333
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,083
Welcome to Hamajiri-
enjoy your--

334
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,833
Welcome to Hamajiri-
enjoy your stay.

335
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,375
I'm scared!
Why's she so weird?!

336
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,208
Not her fault she was only
programmed to say one thing.

337
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:05,500
I've never noticed how creepy
lookin' characters are in games.

338
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,041
Yeah, they're a
scary lookin' bunch.

339
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,625
No kiddin'.

340
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,791
Ya think everyone in town just
walks around in circles all day

341
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,291
until we talk to them?

342
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,333
Hey, I dunno if you noticed,

343
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,250
but some old dude's been
following us around.

344
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,083
Uh, can I help you?

345
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:30,708
There is a castle on a hill
about a mile south of this town.

346
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,833
Rumor has it the
king of that castle

347
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,625
has been out of
sorts as of late.

348
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,250
I wonder what's wrong.

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,375
I guess we had to talk to
him to advance the game.

350
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,166
Usually, once you meet
all the prerequisites,

351
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,166
you get a little event scene.

352
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,250
Like that?

353
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,000
The Dragon Knights who
serve the Demon King

354
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,000
are seen flying to
the castle every day.

355
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,458
This strange happening might
have something to do with

356
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,375
the unexplained behavior of
the king, don't you think?

357
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,666
So... In other words
"go to the castle."

358
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,708
Does that mean we're gonna
have to fight those things?

359
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,166
At our low level,

360
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,208
we wouldn't stand a chance
against monsters like those.

361
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,333
If you wanna go now,
raise your hand...

362
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,166
Okay, if you wanna go after
we've all hit level 10 or so,

363
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,291
raise your hand.

364
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,791
Level 20, raise your hand.

365
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,208
All right, if you wanna
go after we hit level 30,

366
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,583
raise your hand.

367
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,375
Blue Charge!

368
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,083
Yellow Charge!

369
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,875
And red Charge!

370
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,000
White Charge, go!

371
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,250
And Black Charge.

372
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,291
Change Color Rangers!

373
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,125
Let's hear it, fellas!

374
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,458
Color Rangers!

375
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,625
Lame!

376
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,916
Right back at ya!

377
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,875
I actually transformed
a few times at home,

378
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,708
so the stupid-looking costumes
don't really bother me anymore.

379
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,750
Yeah, same with me.

380
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,833
Check this out, Yellow.

381
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,541
Battle Pocari!

382
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,916
What is that,
a sports drink?!

383
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,083
When you need a refreshing
electrolyte beverage,

384
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,250
reach for Battle Pocari!

385
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,500
It's delicious and hydrating!

386
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,083
Here goes nothin'.

387
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,875
Battle Light, go!

388
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,916
With Battle Light, you'll
never fear the dark again!

389
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,625
You're killing me.

390
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,125
I gotta admit,

391
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,750
as long as you don't mind
looking like a total dumbass,

392
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,625
this game is
actually kinda fun.

393
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,666
Isn't it, isn't it?!

394
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,333
You finally understand
how I feel!

395
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,541
I hate to admit it, but yeah.

396
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,416
And even if our powers
suck balls now,

397
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,750
we'll be able to kick
ass after we level up.

398
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,083

Look at me worrying
about my students;

407
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,875
it's almost as if I'm turning
into a bona fide teacher.

408
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,416
I wonder if I'd be better off
quitting my job as an assassin

running out of magic points.

418
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,291
I know. We need way
more when we level up.

419
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,791
Sounds like they're
gettin' hooked.

420
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,375
If it weren't for that,

421
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,916
we wouldn't have to leave all
the dungeons so freakin' soon!

Boo-yah!

423
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,666
Shimizu is now Level 3.
Strength increased by 1.

He's learned the
Battle Shower move.

00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,708
Battle Shower, huh?

426
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,833
Yeah, that sounds
pretty awesome.

427
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,208
Ah, but I still don't have
enough MP to try it out yet!

I don't wanna wait 'til
we charge up again!

Amen, brother.

430
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,250
I am beat!

431
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,958
We got addicted and
ended up over-leveling.

432
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,000
So? It's not like we can
kick too much ass, right?

433
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,333
Good point! The stronger I am,

434
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,166
the harder I can stick it
to that stupid prince!

Let's hope it's just
part of the game.

Not bad. I'm starting
