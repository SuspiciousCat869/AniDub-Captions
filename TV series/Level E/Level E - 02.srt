1
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:13,625
You mean that thing
is the real you?

2
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,666
It's an arthropod from
the planet Jacqueline S

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,500
known as a Clive.

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:22,333
It is extremely
adept at mimicry.

5
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,666
Tell me, Yukitaka.
Do you find it disgusting?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,625
I've got to admit, it's not the
prettiest thing I've ever seen.

7
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,458
Fair enough.

8
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,000
But, thanks for showing me.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,500
I know it must've
been hard for you.

10
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,583
You're not so bad, after all.

11
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:58,916
I'm the one who should be
thanking you, Yukitaka.

12
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,041
So, what're you gonna do now?

13
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:11,083
I'm going to leave; I've
caused you enough trouble.

14
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,166
But what if they see
you on the street--

15
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,458
Wait. You could just change
forms, couldn't you?

16
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:21,166
Are you saying that I'm
capable of shape-shifting?

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,000
You said it, not me. Weren't
you just talking about how

18
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,166
you're a "Clive" and
you're good at mimicry.

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,208
Who are you calling a "Clive"?!

20
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,125
Well, that's what
you are, right?!

21
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,750
No, he's just my pet.

22
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,291
Your what?!

23
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,250
Then why'd you try to tell me
that's who you really are?!

24
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,166
I simply meant that
owning a pet like Clive

25
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,125
reflects on who I really am.

26
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,583
You're a quick one, aren't ya?

27
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,291
Got your memories back yet?

28
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,750
Not a single one.

29
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,958
Goodnight, I'll be in
my room if you need me.

30
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,333
What do you mean "your room"?!

31
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,333
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

32
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,625
who come and go as they please.

33
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,791
Some are friendly,
others are hostile.

34
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,750
But they all do their best to
disguise their appearance

35
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,458
and blend in with the locals.

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,291
The only ones that haven't
caught on, are the Earthlings!

37
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,166
Yukitaka! Yukitaka!

38
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,583
What do you want?

39
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,166
Are there any girls you like?

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,500
Go to bed!

41
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,416
Warning! Warning!

42
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,208
The Yamagata Prefecture of
Japan is Diskunian territory.

43
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,333
Withdraw immediately.

44
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,833
I repeat.

45
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,916
The Yamagata Prefecture of
Japan is Diskunian territory.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,666
Captain!

47
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,958
What's the problem?

48
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,250
Did you not just hear
the warning, sir?

49
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,583
I think we're in trouble!

50
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,083
We're not authorized
to land here.

51
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,083
The Diskunians are gonna be
pissed when they find out!

52
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm aware.

53
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,541
Leave it to that fool to crash
in the worst possible place.

54
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,208
He's gonna pay for this!

55
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,791
Be careful, Captain.

56
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,666
A statement like that is likely
to get you court-martialed, sir.

57
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,041
Like I care?!

58
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,208
After what he's put me through,

59
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,208
he'll be lucky if he
makes it home alive!

60
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,125
I repeat--

61
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,916
Shut up!

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,500
Sado! Contact the
Diskunian leader.

63
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,916
As you wish.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,666
We'll meet with him while
you pursue the man, Colin.

65
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,208
And which man is that, sir?

66
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,500
Who do you think?!

67
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,000
Right! Sorry.

68
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,666
Talk about creepy.

69
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,666
Hey Miho, what's up?

70
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,541
Oh, nothing much,
I just thought I heard

71
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,125
some weird laughter
through the wall.

72
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,625
Sorry, I was on the phone.

73
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,791
Didn't realize
you could hear--

74
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,583
You know that blonde guy you
were hanging out with yesterday?

75
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:54,041
The cops came by my place
looking for him earlier.

76
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:58,916
--Uh, are you sure about that?
--Yeah, I have 20/10 vision.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,666
Your friend is an
alien, isn't he?

78
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,041
Those guys aren't really cops.

79
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,708
They're special investigators
called "Missing Hunters"

80
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,541
who work at the Konan
Institute with my dad.

81
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,541
I bet he's getting
messages from NASA.

82
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,791
Like they'd trust him.

83
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,833
You boys should prob'ly
lay low for a while.

84
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,166
Is that your way of saying
you're gonna help us out?

85
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,791
Yeah, all in all,

86
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,500
the Institute's been pretty
good to me and my dad,

87
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,916
but, I don't like how quick
they are to resort to violence.

88
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,166
Neither do I.

89
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,250
You haven't been bugged,
as far as I can tell.

90
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,750
Man, she must've had
a rough childhood.

91
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,291
I'd hate to waste such
a lovely day indoors.

92
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,083
Why don't we go
get some fresh air?

93
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,041
Have you lost
your freakin' mind?!

94
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,791
Do you want those institute
pricks to cart you off?!

95
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,041
I'm dying of boredom.

96
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,458
Tough luck, pal!

97
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,500
Geez, could you at least
teach me how to use this thing

98
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,083
so  I can entertain
myself for a while?

99
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,833
Who do you think
you are, a king?!

100
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,250
No, but maybe a
dignitary of sorts?

101
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,000
Who, you?! Fat chance.

102
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,791
Stay outta trouble and
I'll let you stay here

103
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,791
'til one of your alien
buddies comes to pick you up.

104
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,083
But what if, they don't?

105
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,125
I can't even remember
where I'm from;

106
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,750
much less who to
contact for help.

107
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,875
For all I know, I could
be the sole survivor

108
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,416
of a dying and lonely planet.

109
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,333
Poor guy; I feel bad
for him, don't you?

110
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,791
Nope, I've pitied him before and
he's made me feel like an idiot.

111
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,625
He's being so quiet.

112
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,166
Yeah.

113
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,708
Too quiet!

114
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,625
What'd I tell you?!

115
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,041
"Dear Yukitaka, how's
life been treating you?

116
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,625
Are you enjoying
your new place?

117
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,875
Do you like small town living
or does it bore you to tears?"

118
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,166
Why did he write this?

119
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,583
He's messin' with me!

120
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,000
Whenever he gets quiet it means
he's plotting something.

121
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,041
So you're not even
gonna go look for him?

122
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,666
Why should I bother when all
he ever does is give me grief?!

123
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,125
Good point.

124
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,416
One thing.

125
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,041
Yeah, what?

126
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,750
The institute has close
ties to the government,

127
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,416
and for all we know,
the military could be

128
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,833
hot on his trail right now,

129
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,416
just waiting to
kill him on sight.

130
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,291
Could you live
with that guilt?

131
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:46,291
Where can I find your leader,
Mr. Jinpachi Sakamoto?

132
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,583
I guess ya found me.

133
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,208
Come on in here;
take a load off,

134
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,500
and tell me what's
on your mind.

135
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,000
I see.

136
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,708
So yer mother ship
was in a collision.

137
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes sir, luckily it
wasn't a serious accident.

138
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,375
However, it was enough
to panic one of our men

139
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,083
who then took off
in an escape pod.

140
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,000
Our calculations suggest
he crashed in this area.

141
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,041
There's one thing
I don't understand.

142
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,291
Why did ya have to go
and make such a ruckus

143
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,625
when ya landed here?

144
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,125
I know you guys got fancy
ships and everything.

145
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,166
Dontcha have one of
them cloakin' devices

146
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,250
to help ya avoid radar?
You shoulda used it.

147
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,500
I apologize for any
inconvenience my men and I

148
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,208
may have caused you, sir.
Once we've retrieved our--

149
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,708
Shut it, you!

150
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,833
Ya shouldn't be actin' up like
that when we got company.

151
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:39,750
This is Mr. Craft and Mr.
Sado from the planet Dogra.

152
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,208
It's nice to meet you.

153
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,375
This mean we're gonna fight
the Dograns next, Gramps?

154
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,750
Keep breathing, Captain.

155
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,333
Nah, they're okay.

156
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,000
They're just lookin'
fer one of their men

157
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,125
who mighta landed near here;

158
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:55,041
I don't want you boys
botherin' 'em. Ya hear me?

159
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,500
Man, I was lookin' forward
to fightin' those losers.

160
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,458
No way, the Dograns
ain't gonna fight

161
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,250
'cause they're a buncha
pacifist sissies.

162
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,708
They're so lame!

163
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,916
Well, what happened
don't bother me none.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,583
Thank you for understanding.

165
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,125
That being said,
as I'm sure you know,

166
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,000
my planet is full
of hotheaded folk.

167
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,833
The kind that ain't afraid
of takin' someone down

168
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,333
if they need ta.

169
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,500
If your boy gets outta line,

170
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,500
let's just say he ain't
gonna make it back to Dogra.

171
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,458
Duly noted.

172
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,416
Thanks for comin' out all
this way to see me, gents.

173
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,416
Of course. It's our pleasure.

174
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,916
I gotta say, I'm surprised ya
went to the trouble of learnin'

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the language
that's spoken here.

176
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,250
Makes me think this guy
you're lookin' for must be

177
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,666
some kinda big shot
back on Dogra.

178
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,000
Uh, well.

179
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,416
No, just a commoner in distress.

180
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Whatever you say.

181
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,083
What's so damn funny, old man?

182
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,625
We should probably
be moving along now.

183
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,958
Were you trying to pick a
fight with the Diskunians?!

184
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,166
You do realize they're an
aggressive race who has

185
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,916
eradicated hundreds of
species across the universe.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,208
Yes, I'm aware of that!

187
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,250
But those bastards
really piss me off!

188
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,541
I believe that's the
general consensus, sir.

189
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,916
I will say this particular
group of Diskunians

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,166
seem much more docile
than their brethren.

191
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,333
Which is odd considering
the Ellerian presence

192
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,625
on this planet.

193
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,958
Good point, I was under
the impression that

194
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,875
their people are
mortal enemies.

195
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,125
That's correct.

196
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,958
Earth is the only planet
in the universe where

197
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,333
the Diskunians and the
Ellerians peacefully coexist.

198
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,666
Okay, but why this planet?

199
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,166
That remains a mystery
even to astrobiologists.

200
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,416
For whatever reason,

201
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,666
the Diskunians are
protective of Earthlings.

202
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,083
They've declared it illegal
to harm them in any way.

203
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,916
I had no idea.

204
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,916
Yes, Colin?

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,208
Please tell me
you've captured him.

206
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,458
Not yet, but I traced
his distress signal

207
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,208
to an apartment nearby.

208
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,958
Unfortunately, he
isn't in right now.

209
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,500
It appears to be an
ordinary human dwelling.

210
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,916
I've found evidence
that suggests

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,458
he's living with an Earth--

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,083
Wait 'til I get
my hands on him!

213
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,416
Use mine, sir.

214
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,208
Colin, stay there and
let us know if he returns,

215
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,666
Sado and I are going
to hunt him down!

216
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,125
Wouldn't it be best if we all
waited for him at the apartment?

217
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,333
I may not be a smarty-pants
biologist like you

218
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,083
but when it comes to
dealing with that moron

219
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,250
I'm the expert,
is that understood?!

220
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,333
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,958
Your logic is completely
wasted on him

222
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,500
because while most of us move
in straight lines like rooks;

223
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,000
he moves diagonally
like a bishop!

224
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,416
Got it, sir.

225
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,958
Excuse me, do you have
this in extra-large?

226
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,583
Of course!

227
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,291
Haven't you watched
enough for one day?

228
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,791
How's it look?

229
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,375
That's cute!

230
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,708
That was so awesome!

231
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,916
Can you believe
all that security?

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,125
I didn't notice.

233
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,125
Was there a lot there?

234
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,750
You cannot be serious.

235
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,291
You didn't notice all
of the hidden cameras?

236
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,125
And I have a sneaking suspicion
that the couple taking pictures

237
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,333
and the guy on the tractor were
actually undercover police.

238
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,625
You kiddin' me?

239
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,291
Your friend really is
an alien, isn't he?

240
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,708
I bet Dad's tickled pink to
have proof that they exist.

241
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,916
I hate to admit it,

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,541
but I'm startin' to
get a little worried.

243
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,041
I thought for sure
we'd find him there.

244
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,708
How 'bout a strategy
meeting in the café?

245
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,708
Sure! Sounds good.

246
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,416
Are you all right, sir?

247
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,583
Oh my goodness!

248
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,375
We've been lookin' all over
town for you, you jerk!

249
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,916
I'm sorry, but I was
too nervous to stay put.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,708
So you decided to go shopping
and eat spaghetti in public?!

251
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,541
It wasn't spaghetti;
I had Penne all'Aribbia-

252
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,958
It's the same thing!

253
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,916
Something tells me
Yukitaka didn't learn

254
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,125
to kick like that in baseball.

255
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,291
Something's bugging me and
I just can't seem to shake it.

256
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,541
I know precisely how that feels.

257
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,208
I could use some
advice on the matter.

258
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,500
Oh yeah, like you're
gonna listen to us.

259
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,458
You don't have to be a jerk!

260
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,833
I'm going to tell you
a story about a man

261
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,083
and then I would like
you to tell me,

262
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,583
whether you think he
did the right thing.

263
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,833
One day, a man was headed home
after doing a little shopping.

264
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,791
Wait, is this story about you?

265
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,916
The man was being pursued
by an evil organization.

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,625
The "man" is you.
It's totally obvious!

267
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,250
So he did his best to
avoid getting into trouble,

268
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,916
lest he be captured by them.

269
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,041
C'mon dude, just admit
it's you already!

270
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,208
He can stay anonymous
if he wants to!

271
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,250
That's when...

272
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,750
C'mere.

273
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,000
Leave me alone.

274
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,916
What, ain't you into bad boys?

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,125
Yeah right, you wish!

276
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,333
You don't wanna make
us angry, do you, lady?

277
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,916
Let go of me, you creep!

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,916
No can do. You're
comin' with us!

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,750
--Whoa.
--And, then what?!

280
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,375
The man wanted to
stay out of trouble

281
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,250
so he decided it would be
best to just keep walking.

282
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,208
Good thinkin', a normal like
you'd get your teeth bashed in.

283
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,500
I wonder.

284
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,333
But, the man
couldn't walk away.

285
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,125
He had to stop them.

286
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,958
You cannot force a
lady to do something

287
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,625
she doesn't want to do.

288
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,916
Well, ex-thug?

289
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,041
Was that a brave move
or a stupid one?

290
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,833
Definitely stupid.

291
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,708
It's never a good idea
to call out a thug

292
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,041
because if you piss 'em off...

293
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,333
I knew it, he's a reformed thug.

294
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,833
That's when one of them said...

295
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,083
Beat it, asshole.

296
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,833
Cliché but it works.

297
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,916
This guy obviously knows
how to talk the talk

298
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,583
but I don't think he's legit.

299
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,250
A real thug isn't
gonna warn you,

300
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,708
he's just gonna kick your ass.

301
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,750
The man wasn't scared of
them so he stood his ground

302
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,083
and demanded they
let the girl go.

303
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,083
You didn't! What
were you thinkin'?!

304
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,500
And then...

305
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,791
In the midst of
the brutal attack,

306
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,375
the man could see the
girl running to safety,

307
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,166
and a feeling of relief
washed over him.

308
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,458
He assumed that his attackers
would eventually grow tired

309
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,750
of hitting him,
but he was wrong.

310
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,458
Finally, he couldn't
take it anymore.

311
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,125
The man hit the thug
with all his might

312
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,625
and immediately felt guilty.

313
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,958
He didn't have any choice!

314
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,541
Those guys would've
beat him to death!

315
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,500
But the man had let his rage
consume him, so much so,

316
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,500
he didn't even think
to hide the blue blood

317
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,041
running down his face.

318
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,916
I doubt they noticed,
and even if they did,

319
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,625
most thugs're so dumb
they'll forget the next day.

320
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,375
He can only hope you're right.

321
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,750
Oh, cheer up man,
you're a hero!

322
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,458
I've got a newfound
respect for ya.

323
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,041
Yeah, me too!

324
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,166
Does that mean you've
come to a conclusion?

325
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,250
We both agree that you
did the right thing!

326
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,375
Oh, he's so relieved,
there's just one thing.

327
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,458
How should he dispose of that?

328
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,666
Thankfully, the other two
ran off without realizing

329
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,125
what happened to him.

330
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,083
They may freak out when they
aren't able to contact him

331
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,125
but I highly doubt
they'd go to the police.

332
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,333
To be safe, maybe we
should bury him someplace

333
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,500
that's hard to get to,
like the side of a mountain.

334
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
What would you two
do in this situation?

335
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:09,041
I'd call the cops on you!

336
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,541
But I don't understand,

337
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,416
didn't you just say that
I did the right thing?

338
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,666
You withheld info!

339
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,791
You never said anything
about killing the guy!

340
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,625
'Cause I was worried
you'd be angry with me.

341
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,791
Yeah, you bet I am!

342
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,666
We're so screwed.

343
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,125
The police have no
reason to suspect us.

344
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,541
I made sure not to leave
any physical evidence.

345
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,875
Why do I get the feeling that
you've done this before?!

346
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,291
Okay, Captain, he just
walked through the door.

347
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,250
He's standing in front
of me as we speak.

348
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,500
Hey, who in the hell
is that bozo?!

349
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,875
Where the hell is he?!

350
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,708
Your highness!

351
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,375
Your what?!

352
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:50,041
Hey, Yukitaka; just who
are these strange men?

353
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,333
So he's been
struck with amnesia?

354
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,166
And he's guilty of
murdering an Earthling?

355
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,750
Pretty crazy, huh?

356
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,250
We had no idea the
nut job was a prince.

357
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,166
Suddenly feel the urge
to bow before me?

358
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,250
Like I said, he's a bishop
on the chess board of life,

359
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,041
always mucking everything up
for the rooks around him.

360
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,583
Indeed. So what's
the plan, sir?

361
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,208
We're gonna tie him up,
throw him on our ship,

362
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,708
and get off this
wretched planet.

363
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,208
Excuse me, sir, but I'm not
going anywhere with you.

364
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,333
At least not until you
tell me who you are

365
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,166
and where you're from.

366
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,666
It's like I'm dealing with
a petulant little child.

367
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,000
Now, let's be a good boy
and get on the ship.

368
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,166
And what if I refuse?

369
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,833
I'll throw you
over my shoulder!

370
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,541
Hey, let him go!

371
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,333
We told you he has amnesia!

372
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,166
Why won't you just
tell him who you are?

373
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,750
He's your prince, right?
Show him some respect!

374
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,291
I don't need a commoner from
an underdeveloped planet

375
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,708
telling me what to do.

376
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,291
Give the guy a break. I mean,
he's been through hell,

377
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,208
Not only did he lose
his freakin' memory,

378
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,833
but ever since he
landed on this planet

379
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,000
there've been people
tryin' to capture him!

380
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,833
The poor guy's gotta
be scared to death!

381
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,208
Try to put yourself in
his shoes, would ya?

382
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,375
In his shoes?

383
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,500
Now why would I ever want
to do something like that?

384
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,291
I couldn't care less about
what he's been through,

385
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,833
because he's a truly
despicable being.

386
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,500
You better watch
what you say, pal.

387
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,500
Trust me, I'd be more than
happy to leave him here,

388
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,208
but it is imperative
that he come with us,

389
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,750
otherwise the universe
faces destruction.

390
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,083
C'mon!

391
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,625
We were on our way to a
conference when the prince

392
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,583
escaped and crash-landed here.

393
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,333
All the major players
in the universe

394
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,083
are expected to be there,
including representatives

395
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:32,750
from militant planets that have
previously refused to attend.

396
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,416
If the Prince of Dogra were
to arrive late and disrupt

397
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,083
the conference, it would
infuriate the other attendees.

398
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,958
It is feared the disgruntled
would retaliate by obliterating

399
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:46,083
thousands of planets,
including our own.

400
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,750
Did you catch all that, dimwit?

401
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,250
Why didn't ya tell us
sooner instead of

402
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,500
stormin' in like
you own the place?

403
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,125
I don't feel the need
to explain myself

404
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,000
to someone of an
inferior species.

405
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,583
How can you call us the inferior
species when you're the ones

406
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,958
walkin' around lookin'
like cockroaches?

407
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,583
Better shut your mouth.
Show me some damn respect.

408
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,333
Oh yeah? Whatcha gonna
do about it, numb nuts?

409
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,708
You're lucky that
we're pacifists.

410
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,083
Just admit you're
too scared to fight

411
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,333
'cause I know that ain't true.

412
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,875
What a lame attempt at
insulting our species.

413
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,708
I'm just tellin' it like
it is. I don't buy that

414
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,958
pacifist BS when your
prince just killed a man.

415
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,125
You're so gullible you actually
fell for one of his stories?

416
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,750
No, I saw the body
with my own eyes!

417
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,833
Yeah right, show me a body
and I'll get on my knees and

418
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,625
--apologize to the poor schmuck!
--I'm not bringing it in here!

419
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,000
So, you're lying?

420
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,666
I'm back!

421
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,000
Your mama's so ugly
she makes onions cry!

422
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,291
You've never seen my mother!

423
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,416
Guys?

424
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,250
This thing is a lot heavier
than I thought it'd be.

425
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,916
Why did you bring
the body in here?!

426
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,333
I was worried the
cops might find it.

427
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,541
So you're gonna
hide it in my place?!

428
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,375
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

429
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,750
There you go.
Are you happy now?!

430
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,958
...but we've got laws here
and you broke 'em!

431
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,375
Like it or not, you're gonna
have pay the consequences!

432
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,041
Who cares?! It was
just an Earthling!

433
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,333
Captain. I'm afraid
I have bad news.

434
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,708
What is it?

435
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,625
Well I've come to the
conclusion that the victim

436
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,625
was not an Earthling, sir.

437
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,125
It seems he was
actually a Diskunian.

438
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,791
As I'm sure you know, my planet
is full of hotheaded folk.

439
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,000
The kind that ain't afraid of

440
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,291
takin' someone down
if they need to.

441
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,041
If your boy gets outta line,

442
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,625
he ain't gonna make
it back to Dogra.

443
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,458
There's nowhere for you
to run and hide here.

444
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,625
Are you gonna kill him?

445
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,875
If you hand over the
offender by sundown,

446
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,000
we'll forget this whole
thing ever happened.

447
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,583
You said he was just
a commoner, right?

448
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,125
If we look, we die!

449
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,791
When they find out you're
responsible for this,

450
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,125
they'll come for your hide!

451
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,000
There's only one thing to do.

452
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,125
They'll drop the matter
if I'll turn myself in.

453
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,208
We are so dead.

454
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,958
Up next: Risky Game!

455
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,958
So he was playing possum?
