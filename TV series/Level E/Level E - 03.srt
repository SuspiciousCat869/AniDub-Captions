1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,833
What is it?

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,041
The victim was not
an Earthling, sir.

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,625
It seems he was
actually a Diskunian.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,375
Sado!

5
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,458
Leave him to me.

6
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,166
I'm proud to be a Diskunian,

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,708
but my species would be
disappointed by my actions.

8
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:44,333
Maybe I should thank you for
showing me the error of my ways.

9
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,625
I don't know if my death
will be enough to atone

10
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,041
for my shameful behavior,

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,875
but I do know that it
will enrage my brethren.

12
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,791
When they find out you're
responsible for this,

13
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,208
they'll come for your hide!

14
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,375
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

15
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,125
who come and go as they please.

16
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,166
Some are friendly,
others are hostile.

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,000
But they all do their best
to disguise their appearance

18
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,541
and blend in with the locals.

19
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,333
While most peacefully coexist,
there are a few bad apples

20
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:26,208
who're just itchin' to
start an intergalactic war.

21
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,083
And thus the war begins.

22
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,291
Huh?!

23
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,583
We are so dead.

24
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,291
Whenever Diskunians feel
mortally threatened,

25
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,041
they go into a state
of tonic immobility.

26
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,083
It's called "apparent death",

27
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,666
an ancient and instinctual
form of self-defense.

28
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,583
So he was playing possum?

29
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,541
Hey you! No smoking.

30
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,291
The problem is, the
Diskunians find it shameful

31
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,083
despite the fact that it's
an involuntary action.

32
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,333
And why is that?

33
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,916
Well, probably because
it makes 'em look weak

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,375
in front of their enemies.

35
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,541
I know they can't help it,

36
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,250
but still that's a
pretty cowardly move.

37
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,750
Yes, that would be true.

38
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,500
From a biological standpoint,

39
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,875
it proves that at some
point in their evolution,

40
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,291
their existence was threatened
by much stronger species.

41
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,041
After a harrowing
battle of survival,

42
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,416
they became the dominant
species on their planet.

43
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,416
So now, they see this reflex,

44
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,708
as a painful reminder of their
race's cowardice in the past.

45
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,333
And to make matters worse,

46
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,500
when one of them is disgraced
it affects the entire species.

47
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,083
They will never rest until
the offender is executed.

48
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,250
Seriously?

49
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,041
So they're basically
alien thugs?

50
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,500
Wait a minute.

51
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,125
It just hit me;
I'm the prince of Dogra!

52
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,583
That's old news!

53
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,041
Yukitaka, fetch me some coffee.

54
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,458
Do you let him just
order you around like that?

55
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,958
Colin.

56
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,583
I want you to send an emergency
signal to the mother ship.

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,916
Sorry, but we can't
contact them from here.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,250
That would violate the
Developing Planet Ordinance--

59
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,875
You think I care?! Just do it!

60
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,125
It looks the same.

61
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,083
Huh, weird.

62
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,125
It's not working.

63
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,625
What?

64
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,083
I think I know
who's responsible.

65
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,041
Looks like we're
not going anywhere.

66
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,458
Hello again, gentlemen.

67
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,291
If you hand over the
offender by sundown,

68
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,875
we'll forget this whole
thing ever happened.

69
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,583
But if ya don't, you'll be
in a whole heap a trouble.

70
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,208
Ya said he was just
a commoner, right?

71
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:20,083
Sounds like you're
gettin' off easy to me.

72
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:20,791
Captain?

73
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,166
He's toying with us;

74
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,166
he knows we're not
protecting a mere commoner.

75
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,250
Sorry, man.

76
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,791
That can't be good.

77
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,625
Then there's only
one thing to do.

78
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,000
They'll drop the matter
if I'll turn myself in.

79
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,958
Personally, I'm all for it!

80
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,125
But if you don't make it to
the intergalactic conference,

81
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,500
the universe could be at risk!

82
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,208
We're all out of options;

83
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,458
our only hope is to
take full advantage

84
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,666
of their aversion to
harming Earthlings.

85
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,541
Would you two mind
lending us a hand

86
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,083
and posing as our hostages?

87
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,333
He's right.

88
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,083
Collaborating with the
humans would certainly

89
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,125
--increase our odds of escaping.
--Collaborate my butt!

90
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,000
True, but it wouldn't be very
prudent to use them as shields.

91
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,416
As what?!

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,916
Captain, I have an idea.
If we use them as collateral,

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,333
the Diskunians would
be forced to negotiate.

94
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,208
While it's true they're
incredibly protective

95
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,458
of the Earthlings,

96
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,625
I highly doubt they'd
be willing to negotiate.

97
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,291
They'd just kill us
and take the humans.

98
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,625
Good point.

99
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,916
Don't the Earthlings have
any say in the matter?!

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,541
I've had enough of this!

101
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,750
We're not doin'
anything for you jerks!

102
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,083
So forget it!

103
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,333
Watch your mouth or there
might be an "accident"!

104
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,125
So what's it gonna
be, gentlemen?

105
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,791
I dunno know why
yer still tryin'

106
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,041
to protect this
commoner fella,

107
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,541
but I want you to ask
yourselves somethin'.

108
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,166
'zit really worth
startin' a war with us?

109
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,333
Wait!

110
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,291
You can't attack;
we're with Earthlings.

111
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,250
We've become close
with these humans,

112
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,083
and they told us
they'd be mortified

113
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,791
if they witnessed their
best friends being killed,

114
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,125
so they're refusing--

115
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,041
Don't listen to
him! He's lying!

116
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,541
--Please help us!
--Shut up, idiot!

117
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,791
No problem, we'll be sure to
drag you off before we kill ya

118
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,958
so they don't have
to see nothin'.

119
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,000
One more outburst
and you're a dead man!

120
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,666
But I thought we were buddies?

121
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,833
You wouldn't go and kill
your best friend, would ya?

122
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,583
Geez, will you two
knock it off already!

123
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,791
It's a long shot, but
there is one other option.

124
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,750
Attempting to find
out their weakness?

125
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,083
Not quite.

126
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,291
In preparation for the
intergalactic conference,

127
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,625
the prince collected
copious amounts of data

128
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,791
on various intelligent
life forms.

129
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,875
I'm confident that
the Diskunians were

130
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,250
one of the species
that he researched.

131
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:33,000
You're saying if we can
somehow restore his memory,

132
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,083
we might survive?

133
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,916
Yes, sir.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,041
What's up?

135
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,083
You're gossiping
about me, aren't you?

136
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,833
If you don't wipe that
smile off your face,

137
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,041
I'm gonna do it for--

138
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,541
I recall my grandfather telling
me once that you can jolt

139
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,333
someone's memory
by hitting them with

140
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:53,291
the same force as the impact
that caused them to lose it.

141
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,500
Hold it!

142
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,833
That's an old wives tale!

143
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,166
It's a cruel method and
a violation of my rights!

144
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,833
I realize that but
we're at our wit's end.

145
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,166
We're running out of time
so we have to act quickly!

146
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,208
Just know that it pains me
to do this, your highness.

147
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,625
You sure about that?

148
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,833
Because it looks
like you're excited.

149
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,166
It has to be done
to save your life!

150
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,250
So!

151
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,416
Well, Sado, did that do it?

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,250
Afraid not, sir.

153
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,750
Well, then, we'll try again!

154
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry, my prince!
Please say you'll forgive me!

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,833
--Any luck that time, Sado?
--No, sir.

156
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,625
Then I'll just have
to use more force!

157
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,333
Don't worry, my prince!
It'll come back to you soon!

158
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,791
Your captain's not
too fond of him, huh?

159
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,875
Uh-uh.

160
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,666
The prince is
incredibly intelligent;

161
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,083
he has a genius mind,

162
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,416
but he also has a serious
attitude problem.

163
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,708
Instead of using his intellect
to help his kingdom,

164
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:02,125
he uses it to intimidate
and mock his subjects,

165
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,875
making their lives
utterly miserable.

166
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,000
Captain Craft courageously

167
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,708
confronted him about
his behavior, but

168
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,500
ever since then...

169
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,750
...every mission he's been
assigned seems designed

170
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,041
to make him suffer.

171
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,458
So cold.

172
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,833
Wow, that's horrible.

173
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,458
He deserves a beat down.

174
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,458
I guess so.

175
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,750
Uncle? Uncle?

176
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,083
Look.

177
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,583
I know it may seem harsh
but we really need to get

178
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,791
that knowledge from him.

179
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,833
Knowledge, huh?

180
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,458
Any progress, Sado?!

181
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,291
His Crystal Data System!

182
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,166
That's brilliant!
Maybe we can search it!

183
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,208
Aw, damn it!

184
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,708
Guess that means
I have to stop.

185
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,500
Oh no, it's sundown!

186
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,666
Time is up. Move out!

187
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,666
We're about to
break in now, sir.

188
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,458
I'm in!

189
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,458
So much information.

190
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,416
Do you see anything
on the Diskunians?

191
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,833
I'll take a look.

192
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,708
The Diskunians
are so secretive.

193
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,541
How'd he find all
this data on them?

194
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,166
You can ask him about it later!

195
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,333
Just keep searching!

196
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,833
Look for anything we
might be able to use

197
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,833
to get out of this mess!

198
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,666
They're in Yukitaka's room.

199
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,166
Hurry, there's not much time!

200
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,208
Yes, sir.

201
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,416
I found... more data.

202
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,375
Let's see it!
Pull it up for me!

203
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,208
--But, Sir.
--Where is he?

204
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,541
Must be in the other room.

205
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,416
Hurry, Colin!

206
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,166
But sir, I don't think
it's a good idea.

207
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,375
Why is that?

208
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,166
Because the warning
says if we look, we die!

209
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,166
Move! I'll do it!

210
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,375
What's happening?

211
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,958
It's static.

212
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,625
What... is this?

213
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,375
No way!

214
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,375
Excuse me?!

215
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,000
Does somebody
wanna fill us in?

216
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,416
We can't help you if we
don't know what's going on!

217
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,000
We're in for it now.

218
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,291
Yukitaka.

219
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,375
Gotcha.

220
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,000
There's nowhere for you
to run and hide here.

221
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,666
Now hand over the offender.

222
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,500
Are you gonna kill him?

223
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,041
What do you think?

224
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,416
Wait a sec, if he dies, who's
gonna take care of the cat?

225
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,333
If you guys want the Prince,

226
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,750
you're gonna have to
get through me first!

227
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,250
What?!

228
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,583
Sure, fine. Whatever.

229
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,875
"I'll let this slide, if
you three offer your lives

230
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,625
in exchange for the Prince's."

231
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,666
Sorry, can't help it.

232
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,875
Well, then, let's see.

233
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,166
You're Lafferty, right?

234
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,041
Hey.

235
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,958
Did you guys tell him my name?

236
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,291
Nuh-uh.

237
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,791
You know, I wonder how
I would've responded.

238
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,791
As a loyal servant
of planet Dogra.

239
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,666
I probably would've done it.

240
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,791
Wait, what the hell are
you even talking about?

241
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,791
Careful, sir.
You're upsetting him.

242
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,208
So, uh, I guess this
means the jig's up, huh?

243
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,125
Yeah...

244
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,208
It is!

245
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,291
He's the one who
put you up to this!

246
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,500
I thought we fooled 'em!

247
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,750
Yeah, I did too!

248
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,333
We even broke a hole
through the wall!

249
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,875
I'm so confused.

250
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,375
Me too.

251
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,208
Colin, is there a way to replay
it so they can understand?

252
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,041
Sure, give me a second.

253
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,875
The cat?

254
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,041
The prince has been recording
everything with a camera

255
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,500
he hid on that cat.

256
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,000
Which leads us to-

257
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,750
You wanna test yer
subordinates' loyalty?

258
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,958
Correct.

259
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,125
Would your people be
willing to help me out?

260
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,416
Sounds like fun.
We'd love to help!

261
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,666
But, we're gonna need
somethin' from you in return.

262
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,541
We got strict laws against
meddlin' with the humans

263
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,208
in any way, but
everyone's been goin' on

264
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,541
about wantin' a good
look at the kid.

265
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,125
I think I can manage that.
You've got a deal.

266
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,041
Whoa! What's that?!

267
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,083
Testing, testing,
one, two, three, four.

268
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,166
Hello, who are you?

269
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,208
No, that's my line, buddy.

270
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,250
Hi, I'm Miho Edogawa.

271
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,166
Here ya go, I brought
a little something for you.

272
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,416
What does that writing say?

273
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,583
It doesn't really translate.

274
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,875
It's just that

275
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,333
I don't think that parrots
are native to Japan.

276
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,833
Fascinating.

277
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,458
I believe you're
what's called a "cat."

278
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,250
I suppose you'll do.

279
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,500
He's still watching.

280
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,125
He'll be suspicious
if I come right back

281
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,333
but I don't have
anywhere else to go.

282
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,541
My daughter's always saying
these things are bad for me.

283
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,583
I'll have these two stop by
the house and question Miho.

284
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,916
That should be enough
to get her involved.

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,375
Have you seen her lately?

286
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,791
She's really "blossomed"
if you know what I mean.

287
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,166
I knocked my front teeth
out just for the role!

288
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,458
You're sure you
want to do this?

289
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,791
Of course man, I've always
wanted to play dead!

290
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,375
So then I say, "I'll let
this slide if you three

291
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,000
offer your lives in
exchange for the Prince's."

292
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,250
Coming soon!

293
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,125
Well, that should explain it.
Do you have any questions?

294
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,291
He was filming us?

295
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,041
Wait. Why would he
put so much effort

296
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,916
into planning
something like this?!

297
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,125
The prince will go to
any lengths necessary

298
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,833
to watch others suffer.

299
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,166
In fact, it gives him great joy.

300
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,250
Wake him up.

301
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,041
I wanna give him
a piece of my mind.

302
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,458
Then I'm gonna
bash his skull in!

303
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,541
You can't do that.

304
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,791
You're standing up
for him even after

305
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,125
the way he disrespected you?!

306
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,041
Oh, believe me, I'm
angry, but his parents,

307
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,541
the king and queen of Dogra,

308
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,000
are two of the kindest souls
you could ever hope to meet.

309
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,375
It's heartbreaking.

310
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,333
I just don't understand why
they've been cursed with

311
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,208
a son who's so despicable.

312
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,750
The very thought makes me cry.

313
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,000
It's so sad!

314
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,458
If it's that bad,
why dontcha just resign?!

315
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,166
Look who's decided to wake up.

316
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,958
The Prince of Shams!

317
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,708
"Going by my face"
what kind of female am I?!

318
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,291
I'm sorry, man, but
the cat's outta the bag.

319
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,958
Evidently they'd already
figured everything out

320
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,541
by the time we got here.

321
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,958
Didn't think you'd
get caught, did ya?

322
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,666
Don't you have
somethin' to say to us?

323
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,041
Like "I'm really sorry
about all this"

324
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,416
or "I kinda got carried away"?

325
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,791
Well?

326
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,291
How dare you go digging
through my personal data?!

327
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,583
That's the first thing
outta your mouth?!

328
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,583
If he dies, who's
gonna take care of the cat?

329
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,083
If you guys want the Prince,

330
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,333
you're gonna have to
get through me first!

331
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,625
Heh.

332
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,416
I'm sorry, but he's
gonna have to die.

333
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,708
Why're you laughin'?

334
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,750
--Put that thing away!
--Are you insane?!

335
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,250
Get a hold of yourself!

336
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,625
I'm sorry, Sado, but that
bastard has pushed me

337
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,875
too far this time and
he's gonna have to pay!

338
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,583
Yes! He's dead!

339
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,708
Captain, no!

340
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,375
Don't shoot!

341
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,666
Colin, get the ship ready!

342
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,333
Sir, yes sir!

343
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,333
I'm exhausted.

344
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, me, too.

345
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,250
Geez.

346
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,958
'Scuse me?

347
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,791
Yeah? What's up?

348
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,541
Well, uh.

349
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,708
Would ya mind signing
a few autographs for us?

350
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,291
Huh?

351
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,791
Pretty please?

352
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,458
If there's one thing that us
Diskunians are crazy about,

353
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,583
it's baseball!

354
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,208
High school, college,
minor league,

355
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,583
major league, or little league.

356
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,000
We're not picky;
we'll watch 'em all!

357
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,916
Yeah, baseball is the
only thing that keeps us

358
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,916
from causin' trouble
while we're here on Earth!

359
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,416
The only reason you
helped the prince

360
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,000
is because you're
baseball fans?

361
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,458
Yep!

362
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,708
Unfortunately for us, the
big hot spots for baseball,

363
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,375
like Osaka and Kanagawa,

364
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,708
all happen to be in
Ellerian territory.

365
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,125
Yeah! They love the
game as much as we do!

366
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,250
Seriously!

367
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,708
But since we don't
get along with 'em,

368
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,000
we don't get to see many of
the up and coming players.

369
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,958
We were stoked when we
heard a promising player

370
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,958
from the top middle school team
was gonna play for Kisaragi.

371
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,666
So cool!

372
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,416
I'm not "promising."
I'm a benchwarmer.

373
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,333
Well, our leader
thinks you are!

374
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,375
He told us!

375
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,208
That kid's the
real deal, alright.

376
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,083
And he knows his baseball!

377
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,458
Uh, thank you?

378
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,625
Thank you.

379
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,416
Kisaragi High has
finally gotten serious

380
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,333
about beefin' up its
roster this season.

381
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,666
So we know you boys'll go far!

382
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,041
Yeah, we're thinkin'
this team'll make it

383
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,958
--all the way to Koshien!
--Uh-huh.

384
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,291
And when ya do,

385
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,500
we know you guys are gonna
destroy the competition!

386
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,125
And the crimson
championship flag

387
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,958
will finally fly over Yamagata!

388
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,833
We'll do what we can.

389
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,250
Here ya go.

390
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,458
Thanks a lot, man!

391
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,958
No problem.

392
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,625
Oh yeah!

393
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,375
Sorry about all the
damage we caused,

394
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,958
but don't worry, the landlord'll
fix it right up for ya.

395
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,416
After all, he's
a Diskunian, too.

396
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,708
No problem.

397
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,041
If you ever run into any
trouble with other aliens,

398
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,375
just let us know, okay.

399
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,041
'Cause we'll crush 'em!

400
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,208
It's been three
months since then.

401
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,333
Yeah?!

402
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,708
Come on in, I'm decent.

403
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,250
Big news, Miho!

404
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,458
I'll give you one guess who's
gonna be playin' left field

405
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,208
as lucky number seven
at the play-offs!

406
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,208
Congrats! That's so exciting!

407
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,833
I have some other news
too, but it's not as good.

408
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,500
This came in the mail today.

409
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,541
There's no postmark.

410
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,000
You don't think it's
from Baka do you-?

411
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,500
"Dear Yukitaka,

412
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,208
I'm writing now because
I felt absolutely horrible

413
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,500
about leaving the Earth without
ever saying goodbye to you."

414
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,500
That's fine with me!
I'm glad to be rid of the jerk!

415
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,541
"I would've written
sooner, but I was held

416
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,250
in solitary confinement
throughout the conference.

417
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,208
I'm sorry."

418
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,500
"Thanks to my
impassioned speeches,

419
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,916
the conference was
a huge success.

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,583
Earth has been placed
under Dogran surveillance

421
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,083
and I was appointed

422
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,833
chairman of the Council Fighting
to Maintain Public Order."

423
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:02,291
"In other words, your planet
is now part of Dogra's domain,

424
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:06,875
and I've been made responsible
for ensuring its well-being."

425
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,583
"In order to keep an eye
on things, I've decided

426
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,500
it would be best to take
up residence on Earth.

427
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,625
I'll be sure and drop
by to say hello."

428
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,833
No way.

429
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,666
Hey, you heard what
Craft said about him.

430
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,291
That he always mucks things up.

431
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,958
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true! For real!

432
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,125
There's no way they're gonna
believe we watched somebody

433
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,875
drag Yasuda's body in,
suck her veins dry

434
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,375
and then eat her corpse;
skin, bones, and everything.

435
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,291
I'm sick of it!
I can't take it anymore!

436
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,750
What'll we do now?

437
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,833
That sick bastard is in
the same grade as us.

438
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:21,791
The E Course.

439
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,208
Up next: From the Darkness.

440
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,791
Welcome. Please, go
ahead and have a seat.
