1
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:19,666
"The twin-tail mermaid is
an endangered species."

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,041
"Attention. Do not tell a lie."

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:28,541
"This species is able to see
through any falsehoods."

4
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,125
What's it matter if
you know I'm lying?

5
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,583
I paid a small
fortune to have you,

6
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:42,541
so I'm going to have my fun,
whether you like it or not.

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,916
Now then, come on out.

8
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,000
Good girl! I'm not
going to hurt you.

9
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,833
Trust me.

10
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,208
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

11
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,458
who come and go as they please.

12
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,083
Some are friendly,
some are hostile,

13
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,458
and others are
nearing extinction.

14
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,541
Whether they're here to conduct
experiments, plot conspiracies,

15
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,583
or make some cash,
they go about their lives

16
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,041
pursuing their objective.

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,375
You liar.

18
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,041
So what now, Shylock?

19
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,875
She's just about earned all
the money she promised us.

20
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,250
What do you think we
should do with her?

21
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,958
The last mermaid, she sure
brought in a lot of dough.

22
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,791
Once the deal's been met and
the cash is in our hands,

23
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:23,458
I guess we could sell her scales
or we could always stuff her.

24
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,625
Get it?

25
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,875
Well, speak of the devil.

26
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,416
That didn't take long.
You end up killing him, too?

27
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,541
Yes, this planet is
filled with liars.

28
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,208
That's what makes
it so profitable.

29
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,125
C'mon, our next
client is waiting.

30
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,166
See ya later!

31
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,583
I'd better be going, too.

32
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,958
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

33
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,375
Just a few more boxes and
we should be all packed.

34
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,791
Unfortunately, his father's job
is forcing Yosh'ki Shimizu

35
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,041
and his family to
move to America.

36
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,708
When are you leaving?

37
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,041
--In two days.
--Wha?!

38
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,333
But that's way too soon!

39
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,708
I don't think you
should have to move

40
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,500
just 'cause your dad's
job got transferred.

41
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,083
I'd rather stay,
but my mom doesn't

42
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,041
wanna live far away from him.

43
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,666
Then let her go and you stay.

44
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,583
You could always
come live with me.

45
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:46,083
I couldn't mooch off
of you for five years.

46
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,583
What about our karate
tournament this summer, huh?

47
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,541
You're just gonna
ditch it, aren't you?

48
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,416
I'd love to say I'll see you
at the world tournament, but...

49
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,916
To be honest,

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
I was planning on dropping
karate in middle school anyway.

51
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,708
You're fulla crap.

52
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,916
No more than you!

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,541
Quit joking around!
We know you're upset!

54
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,958
I'm not upset about nothin'.

55
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,833
I can tell you're lying!
It's written all over your face!

56
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,541
Yeah, no joke! Why didn't
you tell us you were moving

57
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,375
as soon as you found out?!
Aren't we your friends?

58
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,708
Since when do I have to report

59
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,916
everything that happens
in my life to you guys?!

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,375
--That's what friends do!
--Back off, would ya?!

61
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,458
Cut it out.

62
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,541
You okay with moving?

63
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,166
I don't have a choice, do I?

64
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,583
I guess I'll just have to
make new friends in America.

65
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,458
Well, hello there.

66
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,333
You're injured, I'll go get--

67
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,875
No, I don't want
to see a doctor!

68
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,250
Thank you, but I'm
afraid I'm an alien.

69
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,500
Oh yeah, they'd find out if they
examined you, wouldn't they.

70
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,750
So what else can I do?

71
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,041
You're not scared?

72
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,875
Most kids would be
terrified of me.

73
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,458
Nah, I've met my fair
share of aliens, lady.

74
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,041
Wouldja believe my teacher's
an alien assassin?

75
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,541
You're being honest with me.

76
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,916
How can you tell?

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,708
If you had lied, I have this
reflex and it would make

78
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:57,000
my tongue shoot out
and attack you.

79
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,833
Wow. Glad I didn't, then.

80
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,083
Hey, wait a sec!

81
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,375
One of my buddies has
the power of healing.

82
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,750
I'll just go get him!

83
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,166
Is something the matter?

84
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,666
We kinda got into a fight.

85
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't be silly.
Go find him and apologize.

86
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,666
I can't; he's really mad.

87
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,583
Just do it!

88
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:28,041
You never know when you might
lose those closest to you.

89
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,083
Don't waste precious
time fighting.

90
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,541
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

91
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,083
You've got a point. Hang tight!

92
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,833
Shimizu?

93
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,833
Sorry I didn't tell you
'bout the move sooner!

94
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,500
It's cool. Sorry we
were so hard on ya.

95
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,166
Yeah. We were just
really shocked is all.

96
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,500
Yokota. Forgive me!

97
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,166
Would ya quit pouting?

98
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,083
It's not his fault
his dad got transferred

99
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,250
and he has to move away.

100
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,916
Yokota.

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,958
Ignore him. Is that it?

102
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,416
Did you just come back
here to apologize to us?

103
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,458
I forgot! I need you guys to
come help me with something!

104
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,750
I told her to wait
right here for me.

105
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,375
She's lost a lot of blood.

106
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,625
We gotta find her
or she could die!

107
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,583
Let's split up and
search. Yokota--

108
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,333
Forget it.

109
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,833
What's your deal?

110
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,083
I still haven't
forgiven you, bro.

111
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,750
Would you just drop it already?!

112
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,916
Dontcha think you've given
the guy enough grief?

113
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,708
Well, he deserves it.

114
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,375
Don't be a jerk about it.

115
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,208
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

116
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,916
Yokota, is there anything I
can do to make it up to you?

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,416
Don't ask me!

118
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,541
You don't owe that
big crybaby anything.

119
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,541
Tell him to quit whining.

120
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,500
Watch it, Mayuzumi!

121
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,666
'Scuse me?

122
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,750
Why, you!

123
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,333
Got somethin' to say to me?!

124
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,708
Well?! Let's hear it, runt!

125
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,750
Knock it off!

126
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,708
Quit fightin' would ya?!

127
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,583
We've only got a couple
of days to spend together

128
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,375
'til Shimizu has to move away!

129
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,666
Is this how you guys wanna
remember our friendship?!

130
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,666
What's wrong with you?!

131
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,958
You guys better cut it out!

132
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,875
You don't wanna
piss me off, do you?

133
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,208
Nobody wants that, buddy!

134
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,083
We should stop fighting before
Akagawa here blows a gasket.

135
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,250
C'mon. We made
the poor guy cry.

136
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,458
I think we should call
a truce. Who's in?

137
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,875
I am.

138
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,666
We've gotta hurry and find
that lady before it's too late.

139
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,625
I bet she's lost a ton
of blood by now.

140
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,916
Yeah.

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,041
You sure she's worth
goin' to all this trouble?

142
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,666
Mm-Hm. She was
really nice to me.

143
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,916
She's the one who convinced
me to apologize to you guys.

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,166
Oh yeah?

145
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,833
I think she might
be feelin' lonely.

146
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,166
Nice! Sounds like
she's just my type.

147
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,750
C'mere guys!

148
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,958
Check it out.

149
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,958
Looks like she left
a trail of blood. Ew.

150
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,125
Blue Charge, let's go!

151
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,000
Yellow Charge!

152
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:34,916
Red Charge, go!

153
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,833
White Charge, go!

154
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,500
And Black Charge!

155
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,416
Together we are
the Color Rangers!

156
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,583
So did you kill her?

157
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,000
No, I missed her vital organs.

158
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,208
There's no sense in
killin' her like this;

159
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:02,083
it's her mermaid form
that'll bring in the big bucks.

160
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,916
Hey, grab some tape.

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,458
We should cover her
mouth just to be safe.

162
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,166
Earthling children?

163
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,541
Go play superhero
somewhere else.

164
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,875
Now beat it.
Don't make me shoot you.

165
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:21,958
You healed me?

166
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,208
Oh yeah, you're as good as new.

167
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,250
I thought we had a
deal. Were you lying?

168
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,250
C'mon, you know
better than that.

169
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,958
If I had lied your tongue
would've shot out

170
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,625
and pierced my brain,
killing me instantly.

171
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,875
Ain't that right?

172
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,041
Are they your friends?

173
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,541
Not at all!

174
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,208
While we are from the same
planet, we're different species.

175
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,625
They're poachers.

176
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,208
They make their living
selling exotic creatures,

177
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,958
and I am their...

178
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,666
...merchandise.

179
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,083
That's true.

180
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,625
Twin tail mermaids have
always been big money makers.

181
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,958
When we started poaching
there was such a high demand

182
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,833
they were almost
driven to extinction,

183
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,208
but by the time we
found Lorelei here,

184
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,041
there were only five
left in existence.

185
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,333
We all just wanted to
live our lives in peace.

186
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,458
I remember that day well.

187
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,791
I felt like I had
hit the jackpot.

188
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,958
I knew any one of those
mermaids could pull in

189
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,958
at least fifty customers.

190
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,166
Man, this guy's a jerk!

191
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,958
Yeah. He's even worse than you.

192
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,750
All of a sudden, one of 'em
swam up to me and said...

193
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,958
If you'll leave the other
four alone, I promise

194
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,916
I'll bring in double the amount
they would make you, on my own!

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,625
I merely repeated what
my mother once told me.

196
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,750
Her offer gave me goose bumps.

197
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,458
It was just too good
a deal to pass up.

198
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,000
I agreed.

199
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:46,291
I told her I'd take her back
once she'd made enough money.

200
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,541
And I meant every word.

201
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,666
What can I say?

202
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,666
I guess I was consumed
by my own greed.

203
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,791
The trip to Horn is expensive

204
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,458
and we never planned to
go back once we left.

205
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:04,208
So the idea of making a pricey
trip just for you pissed me off.

206
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,791
My rage got the best of me.

207
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,000
I wasn't thinkin'
when I shot you.

208
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,833
Can you ever forgive me?

209
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't buy it.

210
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,458
You shot her because
you didn't wanna

211
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,000
fulfill your end
of the bargain?

212
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,791
Like I said, I wasn't thinkin'.

213
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,958
--How could you?!
--It was stupid of me.

214
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,708
I promise, I'll take you
back to be with your kind.

215
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,416
Don't listen to him. He's lyin'!

216
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,750
No, he's being honest.

217
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,375
Doesn't this seem fishy to you?!

218
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,458
If he lied, I could hear it.

219
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,875
That's right.

220
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,083
Twin tail mermaids have a
unique defense mechanism,

221
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,958
they can hear the brainwaves
of other species.

222
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,791
Their subconscious then
separates fact from fiction.

223
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,750
They instinctively
kill liars because

224
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,916
they pose an immediate
threat to their safety.

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,416
Yet here we are, standing
right in front of you.

226
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,083
That should be enough to prove
we've never lied. Right?

227
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,833
Come on.

228
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,416
I'm sure your friends
are awaiting your return.

229
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,916
Let's wrap this up so
you can go back to them.

230
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,458
Don't go.

231
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,625
You believe him?

232
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,541
I do. He hasn't lied.

233
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:25,041
He will take me back to them.

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,125
--Akagawa?!
--What the hell was that for?!

235
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,708
He's obviously lying!

236
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,125
I'd know!

237
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,583
You can read their brainwaves,
but who really cares?

238
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,166
I don't need some stupid
power to know they're lying!

239
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,041
I can tell just by
looking at their faces!

240
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,500
Akagawa's right.

241
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,208
Let's go get 'em, fellas!

242
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,666
No, wait!

243
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,000
Damn brats!

244
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't know who
you're messin' with!

245
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,958
Ah man, you are one ugly mofo!

246
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah, you wouldn't
sell for squat!

247
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,000
Shimizu!

248
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,208
Yokota!

249
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,791
Giga Bomb!

250
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,375
Why, you!

251
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,333
You're good!

252
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,208
Battle Light go!

253
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,375
Ready to take him out?

254
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,708
You know I am!

255
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,291
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!

256
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,416
Hiya!

257
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,208
Hiya! Hiya!

258
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,541
Hiya!

259
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,583
It's just as I thought.

260
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,875
They were using these to
manipulate their brainwaves.

261
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,791
That's why you couldn't tell
they were lying to you.

262
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:24,416
The other four mermaids,
are they still alive?

263
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,041
Answer me!

264
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,125
Tell her or I'm gonna
kneecap all three of you.

265
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:34,166
No, don't shoot! I swear
I'll tell her everything!

266
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,833
They...

267
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,791
We sold them too.

268
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:46,708
So, they're probably--
no, they are... dead.

269
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,791
I don't know what
I'll do without them.

270
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,125
All my friends are
gone. I'm alone.

271
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,541
You haven't lost
all of your friends.

272
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,208
My name is Yoshiki Shimizu.

273
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,333
Osamu Momochi.

274
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,416
Just call me Yokota.

275
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,166
I'm Mayo Mayuzumi.

276
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,083
And I'm Taiyou Akagawa!

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,250
Nice to meet ya!

278
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,208
I can't thank you boys enough.

279
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,500
I put my cell phone number
in here, so call me anytime.

280
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,833
I promise I'll pick up for you.

281
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,625
Easy, man, you don't
wanna get tongue-stabbed!

282
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,833
Thanks again.

283
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,125
I'll give you a call!

284
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,500
--Yokota.
--Hm?

285
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,125
I don't wanna move to America!

286
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,916
It's about time you
finally 'fessed up.

287
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,458
You hate me, don't you?!

288
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,333
Maybe.

289
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,791
We're cool.

290
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,416
Thanks, man.

291
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,708
Who's the crybaby now?

292
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,583
Wha-?! I am not crying!

293
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,125
Hello?

294
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,500
Yeah, did you see it on
the news? Crazy, huh?

295
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,375
Well it turns out the
guy who was murdered

296
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,041
was one of the top
businessmen with our company.

297
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,083
Remember the creepy guy
I was telling you about?

298
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,583
Yeah, it was him.

299
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,833
He was the reason we were
moving but now that he's gone,

300
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,750
all foreign transfers
have been cancelled.

301
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,833
I guess this means I
should start unpacking?

302
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,375
Yeah, sorry. I'll help
when I get home.

303
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,041
Tell Yoshiki as
soon as you can.

304
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,333
He'll be happy to hear the news.

305
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,375
Wow, your tail's split in two!

306
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,000
I've never seen
anything like it!

307
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,166
Where the hell are we?

308
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,458
The bus disappeared?

309
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,083
Their bus was supposed
to arrive a while ago.

310
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,750
I bet you the Ellerians
are behind this!

311
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,416
How much you wanna bet it's
just one of them pornogeists!

312
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,708
You've got a good point there.

313
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,208
The vehicle was torn
apart at the atomic level.

314
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,541
The only person who
isn't a suspect is you!

315
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,041
Just know that the you who's
busy suspecting everybody

316
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,041
but yourself could be a phoney!

317
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,833
Up next: Field of dreams!

318
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,041
Who is that guy, Ukutaka?

319
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,875
Just a punk from
my neighborhood!
