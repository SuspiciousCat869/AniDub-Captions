1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We were bugged?!

2
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,416
We've found our leak.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,208
She's been spying
on us the whole time.

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,666
If that's true,
then who planted them?

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,250
Colin?

6
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,958
He's checking the garden for me,
he should be back any minute.

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,500
Found one!

8
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,041
It turns out Colin
was a spy, after all.

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,875
He's probably returned to
the princess's side by now.

10
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,833
So, what is that?

11
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,291
She's a psycho!

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,833
Yeah! A total psycho!

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,916
And look at all these mistakes.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Did she happen to
mention anything to you

15
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,916
about learning the language?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,083
I think so.

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,125
Didn't she say she
studied it fervently?

18
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,791
So the mistakes must
have been intentional.

19
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,958
Yukitaka!

20
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,208
I need ten copies
of each page, stat!

21
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,625
Right!

22
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,958
Go do it yourself!

23
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,125
You think it's a coded message?

24
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,875
Watch, I'll show you.

25
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,250
You can run but you
cannot hide from me.

26
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,250
I have bugs hidden everywhere,

27
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,166
some of which
you will never find.

28
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,541
I finished decoding mine.

29
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,208
Hmm...

30
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,000
What do you get when
you put them together?

31
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,750
Rupachi-gata-kahamirato.

32
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,250
Excuse me?

33
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:17,125
Her mistakes have to
be related to the code.

34
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,041
What's the matter?

35
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,166
Hey, wha-!

36
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,041
No way!

37
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,375
So that's the trick!
Let's do this!

38
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,666
Yeah!

39
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,041
"On the night of
the round moon,

40
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,875
come to the peak of Mount Honeo

41
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,333
and I will present
you with a quiz."

42
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,958
"I will meet you there,
at eight o'clock sharp."

43
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,875
"The night of the round moon"
She must mean the full moon.

44
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:52,333
It seems all lines of
communication have been blocked.

45
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,833
I've been unable to make
contact with our mother ship

46
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,750
or anyone else on Dogra.

47
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,375
Have you checked the
teleportation device?

48
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,625
I'm sure they've
found it by now.

49
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,041
When did they do this?!

50
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,375
Well, I had no problem accessing
the system two days ago,

51
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,416
so it must've been
when they visited us.

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,416
But they weren't
acting suspiciously!

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,375
Maybe they were and
we just didn't notice

54
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
because we had our guard down.

55
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,000
They pulled a fast one on me!

56
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,416
This creature is
even more striking!

57
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,666
Damn you!

58
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,458
Can't you see we're on
the brink of calamity?!

59
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,916
You're overreacting.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,375
We simply need to go over
the facts and devise a plan.

61
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,166
How can I take you seriously
when you're jumping for a bug?!

62
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,000
He speaks the truth, Captain.

63
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,750
Here's an idea; why
don't you try asking

64
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,833
the Diskunians for assistance?

65
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,833
Why them?

66
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,000
Think about it, Captain!

67
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,375
They should still have
the means to make

68
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,875
some kind of contact
with outer space.

69
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,833
So I have to go bow down
to that old fart again?

70
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,250
If you want to keep the prince
from getting married, yes.

71
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,333
Uh-huh.

72
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,208
Hopefully, this will shed
some light on our situation.

73
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,708
What do you mean?

74
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,333
I'm sure they assumed we'd
contact the Diskunians for help

75
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,750
after realizing our
communications had been cut.

76
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,166
They've probably already
made their next move.

77
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,208
You're willing to risk your
men's lives to test that theory?

78
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,208
Life is never boring
when you work for me.

79
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,000
If I worked for you,
you'd be dead by now.

80
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,875
I still can't get over
how crazy she is.

81
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,708
She seemed so normal
when I spoke to her.

82
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,083
She could be pretending
to be a psycho.

83
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,583
You never can tell.

84
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,916
After all, she was coherent
enough to encrypt her letter

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,083
and cut off my escape
routes- ooh, that's nice.

86
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,541
But why would she go
to such great lengths?

87
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,208
Well, it's pretty obvious she's
completely obsessed with you.

88
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,500
Lucky me.

89
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,291
Has she always been this crazy?

90
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,291
I wouldn't know.

91
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,000
Luna and I stopped
exchanging videos ages ago

92
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,625
and I haven't seen
my brother since

93
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,750
he was about thirteen
in Earth years.

94
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,166
Wow, then it's been
a long time, huh?

95
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,625
Man, I'm surprised you were
still able to recognize him

96
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,000
after all these years.

97
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,750
Right? What if he's
actually a look-alike?

98
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,208
There's no way!
Sure, it's been a while,

99
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,458
but he'd be able to tell--

100
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,291
Hold on.

101
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,375
That's it!

102
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,708
Yay! That one deserves
a hand shake!

103
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,083
Dude, what in the hell
has gotten into you?

104
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,541
You're wrong about me.

105
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,416
I wouldn't be able to
tell if he was my brother.

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,166
He and the princess could
very well be imposters!

107
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,041
Huh?!

108
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,291
So, who do you think they are?

109
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,958
The Magra Freedom Alliance.

110
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,416
Say what?

111
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,791
Wait a minute, isn't that
where Princess Luna is from?

112
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,541
Bingo!

113
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,250
There are some
Magrans who resent

114
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,333
their subordinate position
as Dogra's satellite

115
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,625
and they hope to gain
their independence.

116
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:44,083
This Alliance aims to free Magra
through a bloodless revolution.

117
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,500
Let me get this straight.

118
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,291
You're saying they're
a resistance movement

119
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,958
fighting for their
freedom from Dogra?

120
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,750
Yes, and they've
been very vocal

121
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,333
in their criticism
of the wedding.

122
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,041
They would do
everything in their power

123
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,958
to keep it from happening.

124
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,333
But how'd they get their
hands on the princess's ring?

125
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,625
Easy, they kidnapped them.

126
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,750
They intercepted Mohan
and Princess Luna's ship

127
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,458
on its way to Earth, and then

128
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:12,958
swapped them out for two
Alliance members in disguise.

129
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,541
Why would they do that?

130
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,666
Because they want me
to marry the imposter.

131
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,291
If the queen of Dogra
demanded that Magra

132
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,875
be granted its independence,

133
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,958
the king would be
forced to comply.

134
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,833
And Dogra would
lose a considerable

135
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,458
amount of power as a result.

136
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,416
Oh, no. That's why--

137
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,708
What's up?

138
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,958
What do you say we
take a little walk?

139
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,125
Now?!

140
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,500
How's it going?

141
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,791
It's hard to say.

142
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,458
I didn't expect him
to catch on so quickly.

143
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,541
You don't think he's figured
out your plans, do you?

144
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,625
I wouldn't be surprised.

145
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,500
"Short walk", my ass!

146
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,625
Why did you bring us
all the way out here?!

147
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,916
Show you, I will.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,458
What?!

149
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,000
This is something I
think you need to see.

150
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,750
Whoa!

151
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,125
What the heck?!

152
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,208
I have a feeling these
ships are from planets

153
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:21,666
that resent Dogra's vast
intergalactic power.

154
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,500
Among them are the
Diskunians, the Macbacs,

155
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,083
and even the Ellerians.

156
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,666
For real?

157
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,208
Are you sure about that?

158
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,875
Yep. It's all beginning
to make sense now.

159
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,833
This explains why it
was so easy for me

160
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:38,125
to sneak off the mother
ship to come to Earth.

161
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,583
And why it was placed
under Dogran surveillance

162
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,208
at the intergalactic
conference.

163
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,500
The Diskunians.

164
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,083
The Macbacs.

165
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,083
And even the planet Calvary.

166
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,791
They all had a common goal;

167
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,333
they were tying me
down to this planet.

168
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,375
I would be out of their
reach if I returned to Dogra.

169
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,250
No way!

170
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,250
So, the Magra Freedom Alliance

171
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,833
is behind everything
that's happened

172
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,208
since you landed on Earth?!

173
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,875
It appears that way.

174
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,041
I'm impressed; they certainly
did their homework on me.

175
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,958
Do you think Captain Craft
and Sado are okay?

176
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,791
But, we don't pose
any threat to you, sir!

177
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,625
We're merely asking
for your assistance!

178
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,916
Sorry 'bout this.

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,458
I hope it don't make
ya think badly of us.

180
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,291
I'm gettin' pumped!

181
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,250
Uh, Captain?!

182
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,583
Aw, c'mon! You bastards
can't fool me!

183
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:41,166
You're in cahoots with our
idiot prince again, aren't ya?!

184
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,041
Haven't we been
through this already?!

185
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,833
Sado, can you
believe this crap?!

186
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,041
Could the prince
be that stupid?!

187
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,333
Yes.

188
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,666
Finally. I finally
outsmarted that prick!

189
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,500
Even a diagonally moving bishop

190
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,541
can be taken down by
a quick-witted rook!

191
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,208
Do it.

192
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,541
Poor Craft.

193
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,333
Now then.

194
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,791
You are a heartless man!

195
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,583
We need to come up with a plan.

196
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,916
If we're not careful,
we could lose the Earth.

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,791
Huh?!

198
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,041
--Wait, seriously?!
--Mm-Hm.

199
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,166
These forces will serve
as their insurance

200
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,375
in case they're caught.

201
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,958
What do you mean?

202
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,708
I mean that they'll manipulate
them into destroying the Earth

203
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,083
if I refuse to get married.

204
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,500
That makes no sense!

205
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,625
I thought they were fighting
a bloodless revolution?!

206
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,333
Yes, that's true.

207
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,666
But if one of the planets were
to go against their wishes

208
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,250
and attack the Earth,
they would be...

209
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,791
...guilt-free.

210
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,208
Those bastards!

211
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,541
So what do we do now?

212
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,458
First off, I'll expose the
princess as an imposter

213
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,500
from the Alliance thereby
forcing her into negotiations.

214
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,750
How will you do that?

215
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,125
Oh, it shouldn't be too hard.

216
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:04,208
The real princess has two
moles on her right shoulder.

217
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,833
I like to think they
represent Dogra and Magra.

218
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,375
They were only visible once

219
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,541
so she probably doesn't even
know I'm aware of them.

220
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,125
Here you go.

221
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,375
We've got this one
in the bag, you guys!

222
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,541
Let's party! Who's
drinking with me?!

223
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,416
Prince Mohan and Princess Luna!

224
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,833
What are they doing here?!

225
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,958
Check it out. Captain.

226
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,625
The Magra Freedom Alliance?!

227
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,833
Yep, you got it.

228
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,958
Damn it, Sado! You done yet?!

229
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,958
Almost there, sir.

230
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,666
Apparently, our captors aren't
aware that the secretions

231
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,500
of some Earth insects are
capable of dissolving metal.

232
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,125
Give me one week.

233
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,708
That's all the time I need,
then I'll set you free.

234
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,791
I can't wait for you to see all
the changes I have planned.

235
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,833
Ruthless hussy!

236
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,500
I'll show her!

237
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,958
I know Prince Mohan's ship
like the back of my hand!

238
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,875
Sir, please don't
forget about me.

239
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,708
Prince Mohan!

240
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,750
Captain!

241
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,875
You'll be safe now,
Princess Luna.

242
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,958
Hope those two are
okay on their own.

243
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,458
You traitor!

244
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,750
Uh. I'm sorry!

245
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,833
I wanna pull the trigger!

246
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,041
Not until he
tells us everything!

247
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,500
I must say, I'm
surprised you decided

248
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,125
to show up tonight, brother.

249
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,500
Only because I have a suspicion
I would like to confirm.

250
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,791
And what might that be?

251
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,041
I have reason to believe
you may be imposters.

252
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,375
What?! How dare you insinuate
that Princess Luna--

253
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,083
I'll handle this.

254
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,458
Is there some way that
I can prove myself to you?

255
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,833
If you're the real princess,

256
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,625
you should have moles
on your shoulder.

257
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,166
Perhaps you'll show them to me?

258
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,333
And how do you know about that?

259
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:07,125
Just like you, I was required
to watch your videos weekly.

260
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,708
And I recall seeing
them on your shoulder

261
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:13,541
in one of the videos
you sent me.

262
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,208
Well, if that's what it takes.

263
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,000
There they are.

264
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,125
Does this prove it to you?

265
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,833
Yes. Now, I have no doubt.

266
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,708
You are definitely not
the real Princess Luna.

267
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,750
You're with the Magra Freedom
Alliance, aren't you?

268
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,208
She has three moles on
her right shoulder, not two.

269
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:47,250
I lied about it because I knew
you were eavesdropping on me.

270
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,708
Remember when I said
I would expose you?

271
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,875
You didn't even bother
to check her moles

272
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,916
even though she was
on the ship with you

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,250
because you didn't
want to jeopardize

274
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,833
your precious
bloodless revolution.

275
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,666
Luna would never expose her
flesh to anyone but her fiancé,

276
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,666
and there's a chance
she'd commit suicide

277
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,666
if she were forced to.

278
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,250
And how did you figure that out?

279
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,750
Oh, I'm surprised I
didn't catch on sooner,

280
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,041
but during the ceremony
I heard you say.

281
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:19,291
"I hereby unite the monarchies
of planets Dogra and Magra."

282
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,000
Only someone from the Alliance
would refer to Magra

283
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,916
as a planet and
not a satellite.

284
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,750
Both your performances
were award-worthy,

285
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,083
but Mohan's actor especially.

286
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,833
I love how you turned away when
the princess exposed her flesh.

287
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,583
Nice touch, really.

288
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,666
No! You put that sword
down immediately!

289
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,083
Never, we can't afford
to miss this opportunity!

290
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,166
The Alliance seeks to
gain independence

291
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,833
through a bloodless revolution!

292
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,250
How many years have
we wasted on this plan?!

293
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,541
This was our only
shot and we blew it!

294
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:55,541
If we want to liberate Magra,
we'll have to kill him!

295
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,541
No, don't!

296
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,916
You can't win, Mohan.

297
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,708
If you strike me down, I
will become more powerful,

298
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,041
but you're not even close.

299
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,833
No way.

300
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,791
Don't move!

301
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,416
The jig is up.
We've got you now.

302
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,458
I am so proud of you, brother.

303
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,708
But, this was all my fault!

304
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,916
I never should've forced the
princess to make the journey.

305
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,041
Please forgive me!

306
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,416
No, I'm the one to blame!

307
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,791
I knew that you didn't want
anything to do with me,

308
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,458
but I couldn't overcome
my desire to marry you!

309
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,750
No, you didn't do
anything wrong.

310
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,208
And this is why I
can't stand these two.

311
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,333
Hey, aren't you forgetting
about something, Princey?

312
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh yeah, the quiz!

313
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,958
Let's test your smarts.

314
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,958
There was only one ring
created for Princess Luna,

315
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,750
and it's currently on
the hand of a rebel.

316
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,708
Once the wearer puts it on,
it can never be taken off.

317
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,166
You're going to need this ring

318
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,583
if you want to marry
this princess.

319
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:56,250
But it's on my finger.
What'll you do?

320
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,625
--Princess Luna!
--Damn you!

321
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,000
That ring is only to
be worn by royalty!

322
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,458
Yeah, like they'd wanna
wear something this ugly!

323
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,958
Just look at this crap!

324
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,708
This cheap little trinket
isn't worthy of our princess!

325
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,541
Is this what you
think of Magra?!

326
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,916
So what'll you do?!

327
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,083
You've had plenty of
time to think about it.

328
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,541
Well?!

329
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,083
You've made your point.

330
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,125
I will do what I must.

331
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,750
I will marry the rebel!

332
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,541
Captain!

333
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,666
I just didn't think
he'd be that stupid!

334
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,250
The king and the rebel.

335
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,125
Got a nice ring to it,
dontcha think?

336
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,416
You're much better than
some sheltered princess!

337
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,208
We'll live a life of danger!

338
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,458
Yeah, I have high
hopes for you, lady!

339
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,125
You're cool! Totally cool!

340
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,791
Our first course of action
will be toppling the dynasty!

341
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,833
After that, we'll
produce an heir:

342
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,375
a nightmarish brat who'll
become our sworn enemy!

343
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,958
All this is going to keep
us really, really busy.

344
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,583
I'll leave my official
duties to you, Bro!

345
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,125
Oops. That would be you, huh?

346
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:29,458
Not me. I'm a princely
imposter; he's the real one.

347
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,791
I thought you'd be able to
see right through our plans

348
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,416
and I never dreamed you would
actually put your ring on.

349
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,333
I can't believe that
we outsmarted you.

350
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,041
What?! But I don't understand.

351
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,791
The imposters were the
ones being held captive!

352
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,375
This means Prince
Baka is married

353
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,500
to the real Princess Luna!

354
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,875
I'm not a traitor!

355
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,291
I was simply
following the orders

356
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,416
of the real prince
and princess, sir!

357
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,833
Yeah, you were so close
to figuring everything out.

358
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,166
We hijacked their ship

359
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,000
and planned to switch
places with them, but....

360
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,666
They quickly
overpowered our forces

361
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,000
and learned of our plans.

362
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,458
I've got an idea!

363
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,708
How would you like to help
me play a prank on someone?

364
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,666
If she had been your
typical princess,

365
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,958
I wouldn't even have considered

366
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,416
going along with
her crazy idea.

367
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,750
But she's the one who decided
it'd be fun to act like a psycho

368
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,125
and get all the other
planets involved.

369
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,958
You're a real lucky guy.

370
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,541
You just married the most
amazing woman I've ever met.

371
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,916
I used some powder to
cover up one of my moles.

372
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,875
When you said you remembered
seeing them in one of my videos,

373
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:42,375
it made me so happy to know
that you actually noticed me.

374
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,333
And now that we're married,

375
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:50,750
I can't wait to spend the
rest of my life with you!

376
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,458
What the hell?!

377
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,875
No! The Earthlings
are gonna see that!

378
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah. Princess Luna spoke to
the intergalactic conference

379
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,875
on behalf of the Earthlings,
and their probation was lifted!

380
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,416
You're fascinating!

381
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,125
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

382
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,416
who come and go as they please.

383
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,083
Some are friendly,
some are hostile,

384
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,208
and others are
nearing extinction.

385
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,791
Whether they come here to escape
the law, do a little research,

386
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,958
or just for vacation,

387
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,875
they do their best to disguise

388
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,208
their appearance and
blend in with the locals.

389
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:50,666
And now it seems, the people of
Earth have finally caught on!

390
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,458
Best of luck, kitty.

391
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,125
Wait!

392
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,750
I believe you're
what's called a "cat."

393
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,000
I suppose you'll do.
