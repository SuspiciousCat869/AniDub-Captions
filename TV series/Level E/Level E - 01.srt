1
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:18,125
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,916
who come and go as they please.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,958
Some are friendly,
some are hostile,

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,083
and others are
nearing extinction.

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,375
Whether they come here
to escape the law,

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,875
do a little research,
or just for vacation,

7
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,916
they do their best to
disguise their appearance

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,875
and blend in with the locals.

9
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,583
A UFO?

10
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,250
The only ones that
haven't caught on yet,

11
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,666
are the people of Earth!

12
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:39,541
Yamagata! Yamagata!

13
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,541
Ya gotta love the fresh air
outside the big city.

14
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,375
I wasn't planning on making
a career out of baseball.

15
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,541
But I was on the top middle
school team in Japan,

16
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,375
so I don't have
much of a choice.

17
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,791
My position on the team
was basically benchwarmer

18
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,708
but I was still scouted.

19
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,375
And here I am,
thanks to my "talent."

20
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, here comes
the third pitch!

21
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,250
I saw it as the perfect
opportunity to leave home.

22
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:18,416
Sure, I have to play baseball,
but I get to live on my own.

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,208
The center fielder makes a run
for it and catches the ball!

24
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,958
You from Tokyo?

25
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,041
Yeah, originally, but I'm gonna
be starting my freshman year

26
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,291
of high school out here soon.

27
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,125
Good ol' Kisaragi, huh?

28
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,458
Yeah, that's right;
how did you guess?

29
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,041
Easy.

30
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,750
They've been recruiting a whole
lot of new ball players lately.

31
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,333
Watch out, kid,

32
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,291
'cause if you're any good, the
girls are gonna be all over ya.

33
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,291
Yeah, I can't say
I would mind that,

34
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,833
I didn't have much luck
with the ladies in Tokyo.

35
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,416
You just watch, a handsome
city boy with a nice smile?

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,125
They're gonna love you!

37
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,083
These calluses are
somethin' else!

38
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:20,583
Holy- You're a hardcore
player, ain't ya?

39
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,708
This place is full
of baseball fanatics.

40
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,458
So, uh, can I get my key?

41
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,541
Oh, that's right!
Here ya go, son.

42
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,375
Well, this is it.

43
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,791
Woah!

44
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,541
Man, that is one hell of a view!

45
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,583
Life on my own begins today.

46
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,458
Who started unpacking?

47
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:05,000
It must've been Mom, I knew
she'd pull something like this.

48
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,708
Caught ya, Mom--

49
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,833
Hello. Who are you?

50
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,958
No. That's my line, buddy.

51
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,625
Just who in the hell are you?

52
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,291
Hold on, are you
wearing my clothes?!

53
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,708
You must be the joker who
started unpacking my stuff!

54
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,333
I'm sorry; I was just trying
to help out a new friend.

55
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,791
I am not your friend!

56
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,250
Wanna explain to me how
the hell you got in here?

57
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,000
It's the fifth floor!

58
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you some kind of gymnast
cat burglar or something?!

59
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,250
A Burglar?

60
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,291
Don't be silly,
I'm just an alien.

61
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:05,000
I come in peace.
Take me to your leader.

62
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,833
Huh?

63
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,750
My spaceship crash-landed
on your planet.

64
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,583
There must be a
full moon tonight;

65
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,666
that always brings
out the freaks.

66
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,958
Get outta here, ya Psycho.

67
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,916
I'm sorry, but would you mind
repeating that last part for me?

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,500
I haven't completely
mastered your language yet.

69
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,625
I said beat it!

70
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,666
You can't kick me out in the
middle of a conversation.

71
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,916
Leave or I'm calling the cops!

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,958
Damn it!

73
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,208
What'd I say?!

74
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,125
Talk about a nut job!

75
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,500
I'll get the landlord
to change my--

76
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,583
What's with you?!

77
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,833
Would you at least
just hear me out

78
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:52,125
before you decide
to call the police?

79
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,125
Did you hear about the
object that crashed

80
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,291
nearby night before last?

81
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,875
Uh-huh, yeah.
It was just a meteorite.

82
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,041
No, it was an escape pod,

83
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,083
The one I flew in on.
It's all over the news.

84
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:04,916
Need a spoon?

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,291
Oh, Yeah, thanks a lot.

86
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,416
Hey, keep your hands
off my stuff!

87
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,250
I was just trying to help.
There's no need to yell at me.

88
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,083
--This is bad.
--Just drink it!

89
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,250
Unfortunately, 
officials won't let us get

90
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,875
any closer to the
site of the crash.

91
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,833
Luckily, one of our
viewers submitted footage

92
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,458
of the mysterious object.

93
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,375
Let's take a look.

94
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,541
I realize the video
quality is lacking

95
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,458
but if we take a closer
look inside the object,

96
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,875
we can see what appears to be

97
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,500
a control system
and a pilot's seat.

98
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,166
--Is this for real?
--It's obvious to this reporter

99
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,041
that this is some sort of space
craft, and not a meteorite.

100
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,250
Told you so.

101
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,125
A space ship crashed,
no big deal.

102
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,541
There's still no proof
that you were piloting it.

103
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,791
Everyone knows aliens
don't wear clothes.

104
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,916
They don't look human either.

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,666
So you had better
show me a little proof

106
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,958
if you want me to believe you.

107
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,000
Come, on!

108
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,625
That was enough
proof for Elliott.

109
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,666
I'm not a kid and you're
not a little brown dude!

110
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,416
I have amnesia, okay?!

111
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,875
Which means that I don't really
have any way to prove it to you!

112
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,958
Except...

113
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,416
What is this thing?

114
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,583
Not sure, but I was holding
onto it when I came to.

115
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,250
Looks like a controller, huh.

116
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,750
What the-?

117
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,708
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is terrible!

118
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:30,041
It appears the UFO has
spontaneously combusted!

119
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,625
I can't see the
scene from here,

120
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,250
but I would imagine countless
lives were lost in the blast!

121
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,750
No way.

122
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,916
You must have activated the
ship's self-destruct device.

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,250
I feel sick.

124
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,208
I wonder just how many
humans were killed today.

125
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,291
Who knows how many SDF members,
local officials, scientists,

126
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,916
and engineers were lost!

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,625
The crème de la crème of
mankind wiped out in an instant!

128
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,375
So many families
must be suffering.

129
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,208
Newlywed spouses
who've lost their mate.

130
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,291
Newborn children
who've lost a parent.

131
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,041
The loved ones who've been
left behind will be consumed

132
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,541
with feelings of rage and sorrow

133
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,041
that will haunt them for
the rest of their days.

134
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,875
They'll forever wonder
what could have been.

135
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,291
"If only that blast
had never happened."

136
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,791
And, it's all because of you!

137
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,333
You shut up!

138
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,375
It was an accident--I mean,
how was I supposed to know

139
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,666
the stupid thing
was gonna explode

140
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,166
when I pressed the buttons?!

141
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,750
Murder is an "accident" to you?!

142
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,875
This is your fault!

143
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,083
None of this ever
would've happened

144
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,833
if you hadn't broken
into my apartment!

145
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,875
Oh, trying to shift the
blame to me now, are you?

146
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,833
The cops?

147
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,000
Hi, I'm Miho Edogawa,
I just moved in next door.

148
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,500
Here ya go, I brought
a little something for you.

149
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,791
She's cute!

150
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,375
Hi, my name's Yukitaka Tsutsui.

151
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,833
Thank you for the gift.

152
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,625
You know, I just
moved in here myself.

153
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,458
Yeah, the landlord
already told me;

154
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,791
in fact, he wouldn't
shut up about you.

155
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,208
He said you're a baseball star.

156
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,250
I'm workin' on it,
so you live alone?

157
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,500
Mm-Hm.

158
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,250
Or at least it's sure
seemed that way lately.

159
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,875
My dad's work brought us here,

160
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,541
but he's practically been
living at the lab these days.

161
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,625
So more often than not, I end up
with the place all to myself.

162
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,750
Busy man, huh?

163
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,500
Yeah, Daddy's an engineer.

164
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,708
He's investigating
the UFO crash site.

165
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,083
Is something wrong?

166
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,333
Well, uh, there was just
an explosion, so I thought--

167
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,791
Oh, no need to worry.

168
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,833
He called a minute ago
and said he's okay.

169
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,333
Oh, good, Wow, what a relief.

170
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,083
Well, I should probably
start unpacking. See ya later.

171
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, see ya later.

172
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,958
If you ever need help
with something heavy,

173
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,500
just let me know.

174
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,000
Thanks a lot.

175
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,958
By the way, I hope we're in
the same class at Kisaragi.

176
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,833
Huh?

177
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm starting as a freshman, too.

178
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,250
Miss Miho Edogawa.

179
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,125
My high school life
is gonna be so sweet.

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,041
Once I get rid of him.

181
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,916
Hit, Hit, Hit, and miss.

182
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,041
I pushed the
self-destruct button

183
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,375
and killed innocent humans!

184
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,208
Ding-dong!

185
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,583
Yeah?

186
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,000
Nice to meet you, neighbor.
My name Miho Edogawa!

187
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,458
You're quite a looker!
You live alone?

188
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,250
My Father busy
investigating UFO.

189
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,750
Wha?! But there was
just a big explosion-

190
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,500
He call, he okay.

191
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,208
What a relief!

192
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,291
Wow, It appears you've got the
makings of a homicidal maniac.

193
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,083
You leave or you die!

194
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,333
I have nowhere to go.
Can't I stay a little longer?

195
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,708
No way in hell!

196
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,666
I'm begging you!

197
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,750
I want you out of my apartment!

198
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:49,208
In that case, you leave
me with no choice.

199
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,458
That's one, down.

200
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,208
People of Earth,
may I have your attention?

201
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,291
Are you crazy?!

202
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,750
Where did you get this?

203
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,500
I had a feeling this might
happen, so I packed a spare.

204
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,000
No way!

205
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,500
Fine, you can stay.

206
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,208
For how long? Don't forget that
I've got blackmail on you.

207
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,333
Put that thing away!

208
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,166
Must've escaped from somewhere.

209
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,666
Why is that?

210
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,583
It's just that I don't think
parrots are native to Japan.

211
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,791
Fascinating.

212
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,125
I cannot comment on the subject

213
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,333
until we've completed
our investigation.

214
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,416
Can you at least tell our
viewers whether or not the

215
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,458
--object was alien in origin?
--So that's Miho's dad.

216
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,000
As I said, I'm not at liberty
to comment on the subject.

217
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,083
I wish you would've told me you
were picking up instant noodles,

218
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,416
because I prefer the
salt-flavored variety.

219
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,666
Just shut up and eat!

220
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,666
We have breaking
news to report,

221
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,291
according to officials
at the scene,

222
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,166
many of whom were
eye witnesses,

223
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,916
there were no casualties
caused by today's blast.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,583
I repeat, there were no
casualties in today's explosion.

225
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,666
You hear that?

226
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,291
In the future,
I prefer fried noodles.

227
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,625
Listen up, you!

228
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,125
The lady said, that
nobody died in the blast,

229
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,208
which means you've
got nothin' on me now.

230
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,583
"That doesn't change the fact
that you blew up the UFO",

231
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,416
thinks the alien to himself.

232
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,000
Then call the cops
and tell 'em that.

233
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,708
You don't seriously think
they're gonna believe

234
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,375
a freak like you, do ya?

235
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,916
Tell 'em and let's
see what happens.

236
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,000
C'mon, I dare you to.

237
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,000
No, you're right.

238
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,208
They'll never believe
a "freak" like me.

239
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,750
Why should they?

240
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,583
Hey man, are you mad?

241
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,833
No.

242
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,750
Wait, are you goin' somewhere?

243
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm leaving.

244
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,291
One last thing, would
it be okay with you

245
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,875
if I kept these clothes?

246
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,208
I don't have anything
else to wear, you see.

247
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,000
Sure, you can have 'em.

248
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,833
Thanks.

249
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,791
Ciao.

250
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,541
Hold it.

251
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:10,291
You can stay, but
only for the night!

252
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,458
Arigato.

253
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,875
What gives?

254
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,416
He's awfully quiet
all of a sudden.

255
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,166
That device.

256
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,625
Whoa, how'd you do that?

257
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,083
I have to get it back.

258
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,916
We have a sketch based
on eye witness reports.

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,583
What do you think it could be?

260
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,750
I couldn't say, but
judging from its design,

261
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,083
I think it's safe to say it
wasn't made on this planet.

262
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,958
They're similar.

263
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,916
Hey, what're you doing now?

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,208
I'm getting it back.

265
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,458
Wait!

266
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,541
I can't believe he jumped
from five stories up.

267
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,750
Maybe, he really is an alien.

268
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,083
Idiot!

269
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,666
That bonehead
jumps five flights

270
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,125
and he can't dodge
a freakin' car?!

271
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,875
Crap!

272
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,791
I can't let them take
him to the hospital.

273
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,791
If he's really an alien,
he'll be found out!

274
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,750
What, the?!

275
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,875
Blue blood?!

276
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,583
I don't understand
why you won't let me

277
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,208
take you back to my place.

278
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:58,000
Because, I don't want to
make a mess of your home.

279
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,083
I need to sit.

280
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,750
Right here?

281
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,958
No, by that tree.

282
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,708
Did you... save it?

283
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:21,041
Can you give me just
a moment to rest?

284
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,750
This is all the proof I need.

285
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:10,541
No doubt about it,
he's definitely an alien.

286
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,083
No. It can't be.

287
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:31,000
Hate to kick you out but I've
got morning practice, so--

288
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,541
Where'd he go?

289
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,375
Come, on! Hit it, rookie!

290
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,166
Don't let your team down!

291
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,291
I won't! Throw it!

292
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,166
I had no idea high school
baseball practice

293
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,791
could be this brutal,

294
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,541
I'm spent and classes
haven't even started yet.

295
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,125
Chin up, Mister Baseball Star!

296
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,041
Morning! Out jogging?

297
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,708
Yeah, I try to do it every day.

298
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,125
I've finally got
the free time for it

299
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,166
now that dad doesn't
come home for lunch.

300
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,291
Speaking of, I saw
him on TV yesterday.

301
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,208
Things have been kinda weird
between Daddy and me lately.

302
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,375
It's almost like he's
hiding something from me.

303
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,791
You really think so?

304
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,375
Well, I called him at the
Konan Institute yesterday,

305
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,708
but he said he was
busy and hung up.

306
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:35,083
I dunno. He never had a problem
talking to me about work before.

307
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,583
I should really go.
You're busy right now.

308
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,666
See ya!

309
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,958
Miho...

310
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,625
Well maybe, your dad's just
trying not to worry you.

311
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,125
I'm sure he's gonna
tell you everything

312
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,166
when the time is right.

313
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,083
Thanks.

314
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,750
Still not back.

315
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,666
Hello sir, we're
from Konan Station.

316
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,791
Sorry to bother you,
but we've had reports

317
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,458
of a wanted criminal
on the loose in the area,

318
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,041
We were wondering
if you've seen him.

319
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,791
Does this man look familiar?

320
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,083
No, I've never seen the guy.

321
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,958
Well, thank you for your help.

322
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,208
Good day.

323
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:34,125
'Scuse me, but what is
this guy... wanted for?

324
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,375
He committed murder.

325
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,375
No way.

326
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,083
He's a killer?

327
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,916
Bravo! An award
worthy performance!

328
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,875
You know, I bet you would
make an excellent con artist.

329
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,458
You're the con artist here!

330
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,666
Care for a dumpling?

331
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,083
I'm not really a fan
of red bean sauce.

332
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,833
Tell me, is what
those cops said true?

333
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,250
What'd they say?

334
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:07,166
They said, that you're wanted
for committing murder.

335
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,750
I'm the one who was
nearly a victim of murder.

336
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,916
Bang.

337
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,833
Whoa, you were shot?

338
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,583
Yes, but I can't
say I blame them.

339
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,500
The situation quickly
escalated to violence.

340
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,625
That's the thing we saw on TV.

341
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,208
Uh-huh, I bet those
"cops" were sent

342
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,208
by the Institute to find it.

343
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,958
So, what is it supposed to do?

344
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,875
It'll prove that I've
been honest with you.

345
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,625
When I was shot, my memories
came flooding back,

346
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,333
and I remembered this
can reveal my true self.

347
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:46,750
I'll warn you, you may find
the sight of it repulsive.

348
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,166
Would you like me to show you?

349
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,583
Only if you want to.

350
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,958
I'm nervous, but
I feel like I can...

351
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,958
...trust you.

352
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,916
Then let's see it.

353
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:19,958
Na'shaya.

354
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,416
Mene sakkhet ur-seveh.

355
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,375
You had me freaked
out for nothin'.

356
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,625
You look exactly the
same as you do now.

357
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,708
Just wait.

358
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,708
The real me hasn't
been revealed yet.

359
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,541
What is that?

360
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,125
It's an arthropod from
the planet Jacqueline S

361
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,041
known as a Clive.

362
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,750
It is extremely
adept at mimicry.

363
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:18,083
You mean that thing,
is the real you?

364
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:21,000
Do you... find it disgusting?

365
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,791
Are you ready?

366
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,583
I'm going to leave; I've
caused you enough trouble.

367
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,666
Were you trying to pick a
fight with the Diskunians?!

368
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,500
As I'm sure you know, my planet
is full of hotheaded folk.

369
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,250
The kind that ain't afraid
of takin' someone down--

370
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,750
For all we know, the military
could be hot on his trail

371
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,791
right now just waiting
to kill him on sight.

372
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,041
He's messin' with me!

373
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,291
Your friend's an
alien, isn't he?

374
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,208
No, just a commoner in distress.

375
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:25,500
Up next: Run after the man.

376
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,041
Are there any girls you like?
