1
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,833
I think that should just
about do it for today, class.

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,541
If you don't do your homework,
you'll be in big trouble...

3
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:38,916
Got it?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,958
--Yes ma'am.
--Yeah.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,958
And remember to be careful
on your way home, okay?

6
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,583
Seriously, it's not
even summer yet!

7
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,958
Why is it so hot?!

8
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,291
A prince?

9
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,708
"Hi! I am the alien
prince of Dogra.

10
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,375
I am on my way to kidnap you.

11
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,166
See you soon"...

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,375
That's weird.

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,166
What's up, Mayuzumi?

14
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,708
What the-?

15
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,333
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

16
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,458
who come and go as they please.

17
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:03,833
Some are friendly, while
others can be downright hostile.

18
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,833
Now, as you all know,

19
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:11,208
this world needs justice
and that justice is you!

20
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,875
Great, he's a kidnapper
and a whacko.

21
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:16,916
Justice my ass!

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,083
Just untie us
already, you prick!

23
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,125
I am the prince of Dogra!

24
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:26,666
And I've come to planet Earth
to protect it from Evildoers.

25
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,666
You with me, or not?

26
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,458
Are we supposed to
believe you're an alien?

27
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,125
He looks like your
run-of-the-mill pervert to me.

28
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,791
No! Check this out!

29
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,875
We're really in outer
space-he isn't lying!

30
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,583
He's actually a real alien!
Like for really, really, real!

31
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,583
Nobody gives a crap!

32
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,916
Ow. Ow! Ow!

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,791
The road ahead of you
is a difficult one,

34
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,583
and I'm sure you'll encounter
many hardships on the way-

35
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,875
But don't lose heart!

36
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,541
"Heavy work in youth is
quiet rest in old age."

37
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
If he doesn't shut up,
I'm gonna miss my date.

38
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,208
Akagawa, c'mon.

39
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,375
Yeah, you're the
class president, right?

40
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,500
Tell him that we wanna go home.

41
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,833
What?! No!

42
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,041
I'm so sick of you guys
pinning everything on me!

43
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,708
Shut up and do it,
you little wuss!

44
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,083
Okay, okay.

45
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,625
These trials will temper
the iron of your spirit

46
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,166
into a shining
blade of justice!

47
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,625
Uhm, excuse me.

48
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,958
And that blade will be
plunged into the heart of evil!

49
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,541
Your blood sweat and tears,

50
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,041
shall cleanse your
world of all villainy!

51
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,791
Uh, excuse me.

52
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,125
Hey, geek.

53
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,458
Maybe you didn't notice,
but I'm monologuing here.

54
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,166
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.

55
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,291
I'm sure what you have
to say is important,

56
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,458
but uh-we're kinda
busy right now,

57
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,333
with like homework and
dates and karate practice

58
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,625
and I'm sure our parents
are worried sick about us.

59
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,375
So if you don't mind, could we
call it a day for now? Maybe?

60
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,958
You're busy?

61
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,375
So you're telling me that karate
practice and things like that

62
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,416
are more important
than peace on Earth?

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,583
Uh, no. Well, not exactly.

64
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,875
"Not exactly."
Then what exactly?

65
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,125
Never mind! I was
wrong. I'm so sorry, sir!

66
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,250
Yeah, you are.

67
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,583
He's mad! We are
so in for it now!

68
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,250
And whose fault do you
think that is?! Not mine!

69
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,625
Man, you are such a waste.

70
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,291
Anyone got the time?

71
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,500
It's 5:05.

72
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,166
Perfect. Now I'm late.

73
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,625
Dude, this sucks.

74
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't even care anymore.

75
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,875
Let's just play along
for now so he'll let us go.

76
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,125
I mean, it's not like we can

77
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,500
do anything while we're
stuck in space, ya know?

78
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,708
I guess so.

79
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,833
I hate to let that
guy win, though.

80
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,208
Hey, Alien guy!

81
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,666
We'll be your warriors
of justice, okay?

82
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,541
Just untie us and
let us go home.

83
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,875
Oh? You finally came
to your senses?

84
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,208
Good.

85
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,041
Then I shall bequeath
wondrous powers unto you!

86
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,916
I'm warning you,
this may sting a bit.

87
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,041
What was the stupid
activation code again?

88
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,916
Blue Charge, or-?

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,583
Change, Color Ranger!

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,583
I guess, I'm blue, huh?

91
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,333
Good mornin', Yellow.

92
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,208
Mornin', Blue.

93
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,250
You try out the bracelet?

94
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,625
Yeah, I guess so.

95
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,416
When I looked in the mirror,
I laughed my ass off.

96
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,708
After a while, I kinda
felt like crying, though.

97
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,041
Hope this doesn't make
my allergies act up.

98
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,375
Cheap plastic always
irritates my skin.

99
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,166
Man, you rich kids worry
about some weird stuff, huh?

100
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,250
Can't you get your family to sue
that alien dude or somethin'?

101
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, I doubt Daddy
would believe me

102
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,375
even if I told him the truth.

103
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,583
Hey Mayuzumi!

104
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,041
Anything crazy happen
after our 'lil trip?

105
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,541
I had a weird dream.

106
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,666
I went to this dance party where
I met this princess chick

107
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,041
who had an eggplant for a head.

108
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,541
He didn't try the bracelet?

109
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,833
He was probably too
busy sleeping, as usual.

110
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,125
Yeah, but now the question is

111
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,000
should we tell him
about it or not?

112
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,875
Good mornin' guys!

113
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,166
Did you try it? Sweet, huh?

114
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,500
Now we get to fight for justice
just like real superheroes!

115
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,041
It's so cool!

116
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,458
Can it!

117
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,625
What the hell?!

118
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,875
No fair guys; the red
ranger's always the leader,

119
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,250
so you can't be mean to me!

120
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,375
All right leader, but first
how about you calm down

121
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,166
and shut your freakin'
piehole huh?!

122
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,250
Don't talk about this crap

123
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,833
in front of the
whole class, leader!

124
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,416
Right. Sorry.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,916
But just think about it.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,125
That alien must manipulate
particles on a subatomic level

127
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,958
to make us transform!
That's awesome!

128
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,333
Wait! Or maybe he can
control that dark matter stuff

129
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,666
I heard about on TV!

130
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,708
Using our minds, we bend
the rules of the universe

131
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,416
and unlock an amazing
cosmic power!

132
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,458
Ugh, shut up.

133
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,041
Speaking of amazing,

134
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,166
as soon as I said "red charge",
I started to glow! Like this!

135
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,750
How dumb can you get?!

136
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,666
You can't ever say
that in public!

137
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,416
Right. My bad.

138
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,208
Gosh, that scared me!

139
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,875
Now boys, you really shouldn't
be running in the hall!

140
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,291
We're sorry.

141
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,000
Akagawa has got crazy diarrhea!

142
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,750
We're taking him to
the potty right now!

143
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,833
Wait, what is Akagawa wearing?

144
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,625
Hey!

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,333
Say what?!

146
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,625
That wasn't Ms. Tachibana;
that was an alien monster!

147
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,125
It looked like
some kinda lizard!

148
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,458
Whatever, man.

149
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,666
I think you got so excited
it melted your brain.

150
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,583
You're a spaz.

151
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,166
I am not!

152
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,041
I bet this visor has the
power to see through

153
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,833
the human disguises that
alien invaders wear!

154
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,208
See for yourself.

155
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,500
Transform and go take a look
if you don't believe me.

156
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,833
Whoa, wait a sec.

157
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,333
Is that her?

158
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:11,125
Miss Tachibana, this is
the boy's bathroom!

159
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,833
How is Akagawa holding up?

160
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,208
Well, you know how it goes.

161
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:22,250
Ah, he still sounds pretty sick.

162
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,750
If he's that ill, then I
should take him to the nurse.

163
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,541
Why don't you leave this to me
and head back to class?

164
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,041
I think he'd rather be
with his friends right now.

165
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,875
I said go back.

166
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,916
Well, he's screwed.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,083
Hold on; do you think
what he said was true?

168
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,583
If she's really
an alien, then she-

169
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,666
Unlock the door, Akagawa.
Let's go to the nurse's office.

170
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,250
No! I'm not going
anywhere with you!

171
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,000
Stay away from me, you monster!

172
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,666
What a naughty boy you are!

173
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,833
Is that any way for a student
to speak to their teacher?

174
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,791
"Teacher", huh?

175
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,958
What's so funny?

176
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,958
Well? I'm waiting.

177
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,500
I want to see you and
your two little friends

178
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,041
in my classroom after
school, you got that?

179
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,375
If you don't come,

180
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,416
then I'll have to pay your
house a visit instead.

181
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,333
♪ G7. ♪

182
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,500
♪ F. ♪

183
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,833
♪ G. ♪

184
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,708
Ms. Tachibana's an alien?!

185
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,958
Then why'd you have
to drag us here?!

186
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,000
Simple. The more people
we have around,

187
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,000
the less likely she is
to do something bad.

188
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,958
That's right. I'm sure
she's trying to keep

189
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,250
this whole alien thing
on the down low.

190
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,958
She'll kill me. I'm gonna die!

191
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,375
Don't freak out, man!

192
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,291
Just cause she's some
kinda alien lizard

193
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,500
doesn't mean she's
a murderer, right?

194
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,583
Since we know her big secret,
we even have the edge, in a way.

195
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,541
I bet she'll let us go
if we all keep quiet.

196
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,958
I didn't think of that!

197
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:29,041
Even if she is an alien,
we can still talk things over!

198
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,083
I don't think
it'll be that simple.

199
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,083
Who's there?!

200
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,333
I'm the kidnapper
from yesterday.

201
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,916
Well, at least he
admits it, I guess.

202
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,916
By the way, your
bracelets are transmitting

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,500
my voice directly
to your brains.

204
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,625
Your teacher Ms. Tachibana,
is indeed an alien.

205
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,625
You figured that
one out pretty fast.

206
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,625
Also, she's a
cold-blooded assassin.

207
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,916
I heard she'll even kill
infants if the price is right.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,291
Are you kidding?!

209
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,916
Oh no, she's quite evil,
I assure you.

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,375
A true villain!

211
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,500
Defeating her is your first
mission as Color Rangers!

212
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,708
What's wrong with you?!

213
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,458
You can't expect a bunch
of grade school kids

214
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,375
to fight a scary
monster like her!

215
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,416
Take a pill, you'll be fine.

216
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
You have all sorts of powers.

217
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,083
You did read the instructions
guide didn't you?

218
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,250
There's a guide?

219
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,333
Of course! All you have
to do is study it.

220
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,916
If you practice real hard
and get your powers right.

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
Assassins like her'll
be an easy fight!

222
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,875
I know you can do it.

223
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,250
Uh-huh.

224
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,291
Oh, I threw that away
without even looking at it.

225
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,166
Me too. Except I don't
think I ever got one.

226
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,833
That happens to you a lot,
now that you mention it.

227
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,416
Is this what you're
talking about?

228
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,916
--Let me see!
--Dude, move over!

229
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,208
Yeah!

230
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,875
I'm the mini Prince
and I'm gonna tell you

231
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,750
all you need to know about
being a Color Ranger!

232
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,083
It's 3D?

233
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,375
Color Rangers can use
all sorts of neat weapons!

234
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,666
--Knives and hammers are great!
--Wait, is that a joke?

235
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,333
You can buy them at
your neighborhood store,

236
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,041
but kill someone
and it might get messy!

237
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,375
You can use: Pistols! Rifles!

238
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,500
Need to kill from a
distance? Check this!

239
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,791
Stop saying "kill"!

240
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,166
Not cool. Not cool.

241
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,791
Of course, you can use
more advanced weapons, too!

242
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,416
Tanks and jets
wreak serious havoc.

243
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,875
But on the downside,
they cost awful lot.

244
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,041
Terrorists might cut you
a bargain, though!

245
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, no thanks.

246
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,666
Last but not least.

247
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,333
There's the nuclear missile!

248
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,875
But thanks to Japan's Three
Non-Nuclear Principles,

249
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,000
it might be kinda
hard to score one.

250
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,500
The good news is,

251
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,500
even if you can't get your
hands on any heavy artillery,

252
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,458
there are still tons of
special moves you can do.

253
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,166
A level one Red Ranger

254
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,166
can use the fire technique
"Battle Match!"

255
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,041
That sounds awesome.

256
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:51,250
Red, Charge go!

257
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,541
Battle Match!

258
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,333
Don't do it now!

259
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,750
Don't kick me!

260
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,708
I may be wearing a power
suit but it still hurts!

261
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,125
Naturally, as you level up

262
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,500
you'll learn powerful
new techniques.

263
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,750
Okay, but how are we
supposed to level up?

264
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,000
For every half-hour in Color
Ranger mode, you go up a level.

265
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,250
So stay transformed a whole lot.

266
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,125
We can't wear those
costumes all day!

267
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,000
One more thing, if you
get hurt in battle,

268
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,666
go to the hospital right away!

269
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,250
You can do lots of cool things,

270
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,875
but coming back from the
dead isn't one of them.

271
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,708
Okay! Time to
fight! Go get 'em!

272
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,791
Screw you!
That didn't help at all!

273
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,791
I ain't fighting an
assassin or anybody else!

274
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,125
What was that
about an assassin?

275
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,416
Are you really Miss Tachibana?

276
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,625
In the flesh.

277
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,958
What you see now
is my true form.

278
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,791
But, but how?!

279
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,458
I'm not wearing
the visor this time!

280
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:58,500
All I have to do is manipulate
my refractive index a bit.

281
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,791
You boys called me an
assassin just now, didn't you?

282
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,833
Where did you get
that idea from?

283
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,791
Uh, wait, is there any way you
could turn back to the old you

284
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,708
before we start talking
about this stuff?

285
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:09,958
Nothing personal,

286
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,750
but you're a bit easier
on the eyes that way.

287
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,208
Deal with it!

288
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,375
Okay, let's just calm down.
Even if you are an alien,

289
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,416
teachers shouldn't
destroy school property.

290
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,291
Cut the crap and answer
my question already.

291
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,208
I've seen that bracelet
somewhere before.

292
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,541
You have?

293
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,875
That's right!

294
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,416
They used to sell
transformation toys like that

295
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,625
on the intergalactic
market a while back.

296
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,000
Huh? It's a toy?

297
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,375
But if this thing's
just for fun,

298
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,666
how come it can see
through your disguise?

299
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,250
That's strange.

300
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,083
They only make those so children
can pretend to be superheroes.

301
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,625
It shouldn't be able to
see through my photo-shield.

302
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,791
Not only that, it looks like the
armor's shape-memory particles

303
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,541
were designed for
actual combat.

304
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,958
Okay, 'fess up.
Where did you get those?

305
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:01,000
C'mon, you're the leader!
You gotta do something!

306
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,916
Battle Match!

307
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,458
What good is that gonna do?!

308
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,083
I'm sorry-it's all I've got!

309
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,208
I'll ask you one last time.

310
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,083
Where did you get the bracelets?

311
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,708
Uh. This weird alien guy made
us take them. I swear it!

312
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,541
A "weird alien guy"?
What's his name?

313
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:21,500
I don't know, he just said
he was the Prince of Dogra.

314
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,500
Of Dogra?

315
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,125
Well, that's not
what I expected!

316
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,916
Not that I'm complaining,

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,708
for a second there I was
afraid someone was after me.

318
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,416
Hey, hold on a sec, are you
saying you know the guy?

319
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,583
For better or worse,

320
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,708
the whole universe knows
about Prince Baka.

321
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,458
He may have a
reputation as a fool,

322
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,791
but he's actually quite clever,
at least when it comes to

323
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,791
causing trouble
and wasting time.

324
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,833
He's just screwin' with us?

325
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't know how he
figured out my identity,

326
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,791
but I'm sure he's having
a blast watching

327
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,958
an alien teacher and her
superhero students face off.

328
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:02,083
Speaking of your identity,
can I ask you a question?

329
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,458
Is it true that
you're an assassin?

330
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,666
It's true all right.

331
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,083
I can't believe you
really kill people.

332
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,875
There must be a reason why.

333
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,958
I do it for my dream.

334
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,875
Your dream?

335
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,916
My dream is to make enough
money to experience

336
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,375
life on every planet
in the known universe!

337
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,750
That includes being a teacher,

338
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,791
so I'm glad I was able
to come to Earth!

339
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,416
I am one lucky girl!

340
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,291
So is everyone from space
messed up, or what?

341
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,666
Excuse me. I have
a question, too.

342
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,125
Since you're an assassin,

343
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,208
how much would it cost to
get you to kill that prince?

344
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,333
Oh?

345
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,916
Ah, I didn't think of that!

346
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,625
I've got 50 million yen in
my bank account if that helps.

347
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,500
Guys, this is wrong!

348
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,083
We're heroes of justice-we don't
hire assassins to murder people!

349
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,250
Leader, nobody cares!

350
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,583
Right.

351
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,958
Anyway, point is we don't
mind if you're an alien

352
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,208
or an assassin or whatever.

353
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,166
All we care about is
losing these bracelets

354
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,333
and getting on with our lives.
Your secret is safe with us.

355
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,791
That's what I like to hear.

356
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,166
You know, I always
did like you boys.

357
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,958
But still, you shouldn't
run to your teacher

358
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,500
every time you need help.

359
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,833
Try to solve this one yourself.
You're big boys now, right?

360
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,416
And if you start to get in
over your head, don't worry.

361
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,541
I'll be happy to
help out in a pinch.

362
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,208
Thanks!

363
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,791
Uh, one last thing.

364
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,958
I heard you'd even
kill a baby, is that true?

365
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,125
Maybe, if the price
was right, at least.

366
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,083
But babies don't come cheap.

367
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:34,291
In fact, they're so expensive,
I doubt anyone could afford it.

368
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,833
I betcha she only
kills the bad guys.

369
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,083
I know, right?

370
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,333
And by the way, don't
forget your homework!

371
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,083
Yes ma'am!

372
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,458

this story is you, you jackass!

Yes, I suppose you're right.

Darling, Yoshiki's been
acting strange today.

418
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,291
He just asked me to put
a lock on his bedroom door!

419
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,250
Well, he's at that age.
What can I say?

420
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,458
He keeps talking, even
though no one's there,

421
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,916
then he'll just start
screaming, out of the blue!

422
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,083
I'm really starting to think
something's wrong with him.

423
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,083
Blue Charge!

424
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,333
Hiya! Hiya!

425
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,916
Baka! I'll make you pay!

426
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,958
Shimizu is now Level 2.

See? What did I tell you?!

430
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,916
Almost as good as new!

431
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,666
Can you guys believe
I made it to level 10?!

432
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,541
A key?

433
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,083
I'd be careful if I were you!

434
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,208
I may be a kid,
but I know karate!

435
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,000
At our low level, we
wouldn't stand a chance

436
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,375

437
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,500
You can't blame me-
I only met the girl once.

438
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,333
I wonder what I should wear.

439
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,125
At least we all got
a happy ending, right?

440
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,083
Yeah, you said it.
That was a pain in the ass.
