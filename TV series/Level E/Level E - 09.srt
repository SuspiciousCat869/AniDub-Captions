1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,041
This game of tag is over.

2
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,041
But Princess Saki, there's
something you should know

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,791
about that boyfriend of yours.

4
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,208
You can tell her
whatever you want.

5
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,791
But nothing you say is
ever gonna tear us apart!

6
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,333
Save the lines for
the movies, Romeo.

7
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,333
It's over!

8
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,958
We know you're
not really a boy!

9
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,500
But, I don't understand.

10
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:35,375
The name of the person you ran
off with is Kyoko Mikihisa.

11
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,583
She's a woman.

12
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,750
A woman?

13
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,791
It doesn't matter if
I'm a guy or a girl!

14
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,958
All that matters is how
we feel about each other!

15
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,541
Sure about that?

16
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:51,666
Tell them you love me; tell them
this doesn't change anything!

17
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,916
We were brought 
together by fate.

18
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,500
Wait a second!

19
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,458
No matter how much
you love her,

20
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,125
there are some things
in this universe

21
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,375
that require a male and female.

22
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,208
It's not fair.

23
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,125
It's nothing personal.

24
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,500
It's just that I'm not into
other girls like that.

25
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,041
That'd be way too
weird. No, thank you.

26
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,083
I'm sure fate will
find someone for you!

27
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,166
Just not me, okay?

28
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,041
I was so sure.

29
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,708
When you came into my life,

30
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,166
I thought fate was finally
smiling down upon me.

31
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,208
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid

32
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,000
I must return to the mother
ship ahead of schedule.

33
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,125
I see. That's unfortunate.

34
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,875
I'll consult with
the previous queen.

35
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,583
Then perhaps I can find
a solution to all of this.

36
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,666
I wouldn't take it so hard,
Earth just wasn't meant for you.

37
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,791
You're young, so I'm sure
you can find a better match

38
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,666
somewhere else in the universe.

39
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,916
I-I wish it were that easy.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,958
You're gonna make me cry.

41
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,250
I'm sorry for all the
trouble we caused you.

42
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,041
It must've come
as quite a shock.

43
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,416
Of course it was.

44
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Can't have babies if you
hook up with another female.

45
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,291
That was inappropriate, sir.

46
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,916
This affects the survival
of an entire species.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,125
All the same, it's not
our problem anymore.

48
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,875
What's she gonna do now?

49
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,666
You think she'll
look for another mate?

50
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,041
Hard to say.

51
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,333
I've never heard of a Macbac
choosing a second mate,

52
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,708
but this is a unique situation.

53
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,791
Either way, I feel
kinda bad for her.

54
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,541
I find it hard to care since
she threw Mikihisa away

55
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,666
the second she found
out she was a woman.

56
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,875
It's not like that!

57
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,791
Even though she felt
confused and betrayed,

58
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,833
she never blamed Mikihisa for
what happened between them!

59
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,250
You can believe
whatever you like.

60
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,125
I'm just happy
that they're gone.

61
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,458
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

62
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,750
who come and go as they please.

63
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,291
Some are friendly,
some are hostile,

64
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,916
and others are
nearing extinction.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,250
Yet somehow, they all
exist in a curious balance.

66
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,166
Now, it would appear that
balance has been restored

67
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,625
and the Earth is saved!

68
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,458
Prince, what're you doing here?

69
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,958
I thought that you were
still in Southeast Asia?

70
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,291
This poor thing finally
deposited its eggs

71
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,083
only to end up like this.

72
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,791
Apparently, it lived a
full life despite being

73
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,833
infected by a parasitic fungus.

74
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:36,958
Don't ignore me!

75
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,250
I'm sorry, were you
saying something?

76
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,583
So, Craft, did anything
happen while I was gone

77
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,083
that you might want to
report to your leader?

78
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,958
Uh, no. Well,
nothing I can think of.

79
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,458
Oh?

80
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,583
I know you're trying to hide
the Macbac's visit from me,

81
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,791
so stop pretending!

82
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,125
How'd you find out?!

83
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,875
It was a lucky guess.

84
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,458
And by 'lucky' I mean that
I knew they'd be mating soon

85
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,583
and I figured you must've been
dealing with a dignitary

86
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,000
since you're wearing
your spiffy suit.

87
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,666
Even I didn't know
I was so smart!

88
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,541
It isn't your fault he's
an evil genius, Captain.

89
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,125
But how did you find us here?!

90
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,291
No way that
was a lucky guess!

91
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,375
Easy peezy, 'cause you used
your home phone number

92
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,875
to make the reservation.

93
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,458
You bugged it, didn't you?!

94
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,708
Bugging is such a nasty--
Yes, I did.

95
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,791
I'll kill you!

96
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,083
Does that mean she was
here looking for a mate?

97
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,666
Yes, that's right.

98
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,541
Interesting.

99
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,625
My princess.

100
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,541
It's a delicate situation.

101
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,375
We resolved the
problem on our own,

102
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,458
so there's no reason
for you to get involved.

103
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,166
You're being entirely
too optimistic.

104
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,458
I can't imagine the
princess of the Macbacs

105
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,166
giving up that easily.

106
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,666
But, we saw her leave
the planet ourselves.

107
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,208
There's no doubt.

108
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,500
I'll never forget the tears
in her eyes as she flew away.

109
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,666
You should know better than
to trust a female's tears.

110
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,166
That's a fundamental law known
throughout the entire universe.

111
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,583
What is that?

112
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,750
A listening device?

113
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,166
Wait a sec, when did she--

114
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,000
Damn! She played us
for a bunch of fools!

115
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,291
Other than the part
about her being a girl,

116
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,000
it seems their "translations"
were full of crap.

117
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,625
They certainly
underestimated us.

118
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,333
Considering Dogra's position,
I suppose it's only natural

119
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,208
they'd go out of their way
to protect the Earthlings.

120
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,125
My suspicions were correct.

121
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,541
The Dograns were bound and
determined to prevent me

122
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,166
from mating with a human being.

123
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,916
Just because my beloved
was revealed to be a woman,

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,125
it does not mean
that this is over.

125
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,083
Damn it! Where'd
she run off to?!

126
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:08,750
Maybe to a rendezvous
with Princess Saki?

127
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,375
It seems they've made
contact with her.

128
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,250
Yeah, but why would
they even bother?

129
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,583
They know Kyoko
Mikihisa's a woman!

130
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,083
All they have to do
is turn her into a man.

131
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,333
I had no idea they
were capable of that!

132
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,916
Oh, it's quite common.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,250
I used to be a female
myself, you know.

134
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,166
Wha?!

135
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,541
Whoa!

136
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,458
That was a joke.

137
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,708
Damn, it's gonna take months to
get that image outta my head!

138
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,791
How could Princess Saki make
such an obvious mistake?

139
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,083
Mikihisa's brain must
be similar to a male's.

140
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,125
That's true! Good point.

141
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,666
There are differences between
the male and female brain.

142
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,375
For example, the part
known as INAH 3

143
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,708
is significantly
larger in males.

144
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,041
This helps dictate
sexual behavior,

145
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,166
so if Mikihisa's was enlarged,

146
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,750
it may explain her behavior
and the Princess' confusion.

147
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,250
What difference does that make?

148
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,583
She still has a female body

149
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,625
so it's not like
they can procreate!

150
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,208
I meant it when I said
they could change her.

151
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,083
That's not
scientifically possible.

152
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,125
Before poo-pooing my idea,
ask yourself this.

153
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,791
After generations of
successful mating, how could

154
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,458
Princess Saki mistakenly
fall in love with a female?

155
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,833
Wait, you aren't suggesting...

156
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,916
I suspect a study of Kyoko
Mikihisa's genetic makeup

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,583
would reveal she's
virtually a dude.

158
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,041
Let's go! We gotta find her!

159
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,125
I bet those clowns from Dogra
are in a panic right now.

160
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,625
But it's too late.

161
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,458
There's nothing they can do
to keep me from my beloved.

162
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,250
I've never seen you so happy!

163
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,416
The greater the challenge,

164
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
the greater the sense
of accomplishment.

165
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,000
Since I'll never
experience it myself,

166
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,291
would you tell me what
it's like to fall in love?

167
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,291
It's an almost overwhelming
feeling of elation,

168
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,250
like the end of the hunt,
when your prey falls,

169
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,833
but it's even better.

170
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,416
Is that an accurate
description, mother?

171
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,291
Indeed, it is exactly
as you said.

172
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,333
However, it is nothing compared
to the feeling that awaits you

173
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,208
after you have mated, my dear.

174
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,125
Watching my mate's
species slowly go extinct

175
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,250
was the most exhilarating
thing I've ever experienced.

176
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,750
It was then that I
understood what it meant

177
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,666
to be Queen of the Macbac.

178
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,750
Soon you shall know that
joy too, my princess.

179
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,333
Captain, look! One of the
snowmobiles is missing!

180
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,458
It must've been her!

181
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,125
Unfortunately, the snow
has covered her tracks.

182
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,125
I guess we'll just have
to find her on our own.

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She'll be at the Shimo
Forest Park at 11 PM.

184
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,500
How do you know?

185
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,500
Y'know that note in the
ashtray? I restored it.

186
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,875
To hide evidence, you have to
burn it until it's crumbled ash.

187
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,833
Kyoko Mikihisa has a
unique genetic makeup,

188
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,416
in some ways male
and in other ways female.

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,666
All it would take is a
tiny tip of the scales

190
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,666
to change everything.

191
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,708
Of course, with the Macbac's
scientific prowess,

192
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,541
that would be easy.

193
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,583
What is going on here?

194
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,875
Hey, why do you have my scarf?

195
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,750
Princess Saki is anxiously
awaiting your arrival.

196
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,041
Damn it! Where did she go?!

197
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,541
Aw, crap!

198
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,000
I knew they wouldn't make it.

199
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,750
You may look like a woman,
but deep down you're a man.

200
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,666
Don't worry; I'll help you
show your true form.

201
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,666
I promise it won't
hurt, my love.

202
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,000
Just leave it to me.

203
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,791
All right class, let's give a
warm welcome to our new student.

204
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,875
Meet Kyoko Mikihisa.

205
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:52,041
I wanna be treated like one of
the guys, so call me Mikihisa!

206
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,083
You're so funny!

207
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,083
She wants to be
treated like a guy?

208
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,708
This is some kinda joke, right?

209
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,958
Why would you try to
kiss another girl?!

210
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,916
You're a freak!
Get away from me!

211
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Sorry Mikihisa,
but you're a girl.

212
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,666
I'll only ever see
you as a friend.

213
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,000
No, wait! Don't go!

214
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,708
I'm a man, Satomi!

215
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,166
I'm not a girl!

216
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,958
That's right, my darling.
You weren't meant to be a woman.

217
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,083
Who're you?

218
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll be waiting for you,
my destined one.

219
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,833
Whoa. What the-?!

220
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,625
I don't know why, but
my head feels really fuzzy.

221
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,333
My scarf.

222
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,833
Am I forgetting something here?

223
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,125
Crap! It's time for work!

224
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,583
Those are some biiiig boobs.

225
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,833
No kidding.

226
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,083
Hey! Would you please
take this seriously?!

227
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,625
It's part of our
observation, right?!

228
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,708
Since the Macbac supposedly
operated on her,

229
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,041
we're supposed to be
checking out her body!

230
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,500
If you keep making a fuss,
she'll notice you.

231
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,458
Let's not start out the year
with accusations of voyeurism.

232
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,000
It's not like we're
peeping toms! Jeez!

233
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,958
They've definitely
altered her somehow.

234
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:35,291
But it may be a while before
we see any physical effects.

235
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,166
So she's slowly going to
start turning into a dude?

236
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,458
Then maybe we can
reverse the process.

237
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,791
You think it's possible,
Mr. Scientist?

238
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,333
I would have to
do some research--

239
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,791
Hey, is the soup ready yet?

240
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,041
We've got a major emergency

241
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,458
and all you can think
about is eating?!

242
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,708
Who am I to butt in on
their little romance?

243
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,291
Why's it always about you?!

244
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,708
The fate of the Earth
is at stake here!

245
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,291
Here you go.
Sorry for the wait.

246
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,708
That looks yummy!

247
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,041
Don't ignore me!

248
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,750
We would be liable if
the humans went extinct.

249
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,875
Hey, wouldn't it be funny
if we were put on death row?

250
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,041
Look! It's so stretchy!

251
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,083
I'm already there.

252
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,375
New Year's Special.

253
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,958
One soybean and
one herring roe pizza!

254
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,166
I hope you guys enjoy it.

255
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,916
She didn't even bat an
eye. What happened?

256
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,625
It would appear they've
erased her short-term memory,

257
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,083
which means she's completely
forgotten the ski trip--

258
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,500
including her encounter
with Princess Saki.

259
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,250
Buy why would they do that?

260
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,958
They're probably making a second
attempt at a first meeting,

261
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,291
I would guess. The Macbac
are very particular about

262
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,041
love at first sight, you know.

263
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,958
Oh, give me a break.

264
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,583
It's believed that creatures
with complimentary genes

265
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,041
are drawn to each other because
it evolves their species,

266
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,458
that's how some
explain the concept

267
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,666
of "love at first sight."

268
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,416
In other words, the
pairing is more about

269
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,833
the success of the
lineage than the couple.

270
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,625
But is that a legit theory?

271
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,500
Not according to the
academic community at least.

272
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, the Macbac
didn't get the memo.

273
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:08,541
Love at first sight's how they
confirm genetic compatibility.

274
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,375
Who ordered this garbage?
It's totally nasty!

275
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,875
You did, stupid!

276
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,333
So the princess is
after her genes?

277
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,416
Is there something
about Earthling genetics

278
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,958
that makes them more valuable?

279
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,291
It's hard to say, since
humans only understand

280
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,083
a small portion of
their genetic code.

281
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,250
I wouldn't be surprised if
they had a hidden treasure

282
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,583
buried in there somewhere.

283
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,833
In fact, some races
have abducted humans

284
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,750
to collect samples for testing.

285
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,250
Now that you mention it, maybe
that isn't such a bad idea.

286
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,208
Looks like I'll make the
delivery right on time.

287
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,458
What's the verdict?

288
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,625
I had to throw this vaccine
together on short notice,

289
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,166
but I'm pretty sure
it'll do the job.

290
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,791
Hold on.

291
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,083
If you haven't
done this before,

292
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,291
shouldn't you try running
a simulation first?

293
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,416
I suppose it wouldn't hurt.

294
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,208
What is that?

295
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,000
A reverse-anti-virus!

296
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,333
Basically, if I attempt
to inject my vaccine,

297
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,541
a program will cause
the virus to activate.

298
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,041
Are you kidding me?!

299
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,375
When it comes to genetics,
the Macbac are one of the most

300
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,916
advanced species
in the universe.

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,291
They knew we'd be
powerless to stop them.

302
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,208
Otherwise, they would have
kept her in captivity

303
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,625
instead of returning
her to Earth.

304
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,750
That true?

305
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,541
I'm afraid so, sir.

306
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,166
Great!

307
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,708
Man, they almost hit me.

308
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,625
Huh?! What the-?!

309
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,833
It was ten after just
a second ago! Crap!

310
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,625
All of humanity wiped out
because of one stupid girl!

311
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,041
And you're sure we're
completely out of options?

312
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,125
Even the vaccine idea
was stretching it.

313
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,791
Damn!

314
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,500
I wonder what's going
through her head right now.

315
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,041
We've got no choice.

316
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:32,208
The only way to save humanity
is to finish her off!

317
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,666
--Don't do it, Captain!
--Calm down!

318
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,166
Let me go!

319
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,750
You'll get the death penalty
if you murder an Earthling!

320
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,916
If I'm screwed either way,
I might as well play dirty

321
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
and save the human
race, right?!

322
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,208
Well, if we break a few rules,

323
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,166
I can come up with
all sorts of solutions.

324
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,541
Yeah, like what?!

325
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,791
It might be problematic.

326
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,208
What could possibly be more
problematic than this?!

327
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,916
I don't care what it takes-
I'll do anything to stop them!

328
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,583
You realize I'm going
to hold you to that.

329
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:03,375
Uh, just for the record, what
exactly did you have in mind?

330
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,791
Everything is going
according to plan.

331
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,208
Those idiots from Dogra
tried to step in,

332
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,625
but it looks like
they're out of ideas.

333
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,083
What's Saki up to?

334
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,541
Learning about Earth
in her sleep.

335
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,833
She hardly knew anything about
their language and customs,

336
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,208
so it's taking
longer than expected.

337
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,500
Well, I'm sure the fact that
she'll get to see her mate

338
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,416
when she's done is
keeping her motivated.

339
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,500
Hi, there.

340
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,291
I haven't seen you around here
before; my name's Mikihisa.

341
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,916
My name is Saki.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

342
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,750
Wow, it worked like a charm!

343
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,333
Of course it did.

344
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,166
Now all we have to do
is wait for them to mate

345
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,833
and we'll be set.

346
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,416
No matter what, the Macbac Queen
only mates once in her lifetime.

347
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,041
Even if she does catch on,
it'll be too late.

348
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,541
Do you hear that?
The operation was a success.

349
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,666
Shut up!

350
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,083
No, you shut up.
What's your problem?

351
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,250
We made an exact clone of Kyoko
Mikihisa and even planted

352
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,750
all of the original's
memories inside of it.

353
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,083
Of course, that in itself,

354
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,708
wouldn't have
accomplished anything

355
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,916
so to prevent humanity
from going extinct,

356
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,375
we equipped the clone
with a special anti-virus

357
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,000
that will activate when it
mates with Princess Saki.

358
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,708
Then, as if we hadn't screwed
with Mikihisa enough already,

359
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,791
we tweaked his genes so that
he wouldn't fall in love

360
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,625
with Saki again, made him move
away to some distant city,

361
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,250
then replaced him with
the clone we created.

362
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,000
And we altered
his memory, too.

363
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,375
By that point,

364
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,083
we'd broken well over a
hundred intergalactic laws.

365
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,500
I never thought I'd end up
living a life of crime.

366
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,000
Are you saying there's a better
way we could've done it?

367
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,791
I've been thinking, but I
can't come up with anything.

368
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,625
The princess gets to
preserve her species

369
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,291
and humanity won't go extinct.

370
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,416
I'm sure Mikihisa is happy
to be a real man now, too.

371
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Maybe this plan left you
with a guilty conscience,

372
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,208
but I think that's a small
price to pay, Captain.

373
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,791
What do you mean "this plan"?!

374
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,250
Did you come up with another
idea and not tell us?!

375
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,083
Hey now, don't be judgin' me!

376
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,041
I made a point to choose the
plan that would give you

377
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,250
the least amount
of mental anguish.

378
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,500
So you did have
another idea after all!

379
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,750
Just spit it out-
I deserve to know!

380
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,708
All right, but you're
gonna regret it.

381
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,666
I was a fool to ask.

382
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,125
No good can ever come
from his twisted mind.

383
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,083
Come on, how bad
could it really be?

384
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,000
Too bad for me to repeat.

385
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,916
Oh, I have no problem
telling you too!

386
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,875
You see, first off--

387
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,250
Spare him!

388
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:07,291
Even as alien races seek
out the genes of humans,

389
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,791
mankind continues
to destroy itself.

390
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,666
Transformed by radiation,

391
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,291
industrial waste and
unknown viruses.

392
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,083
It may not be long before
their much-coveted genes

393
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,125
become undesirable and
the intergalactic community

394
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,125
looks away from
the Earth in disgust.

395
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,083
Even as it comes to pass,

396
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:31,833
we may never know whether
that's a blessing or a curse.

397
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,083
"The twin-tailed mermaid
is an endangered species."

398
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,916
She sure brought
in a lot of dough.

399
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,291
...but I'm afraid
I'm an alien.

400
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,583
"Do not tell a lie."

401
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,791
I need you guys to--

402
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,625
Quit joking around!
We know you're upset!

403
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,000
--You're fulla crap.
--So, did you kill her?

404
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,791
No, I missed her vital organs.

405
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,250
She's lost a lot of blood.

406
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,041
--Don't be a jerk about it.
--You're okay with moving?

407
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,291
I guess I'll just have to
make new friends in America.

408
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,333
Up next: Boy meets girl.

409
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,958
You liar.
