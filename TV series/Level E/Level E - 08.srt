1
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,125
Here ya go, Mikihisa.

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,833
"Ahh!"

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,291
Mm. That's good.

4
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,375
This is the first time we've
gone on a trip with just us.

5
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,875
And your family wasn't
worried about you?

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,333
Nah.

7
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,333
I told my mom I was
going with another girl

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,500
she was like "yeah, sure."

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,500
Although. I bet when she sees
the pictures of us together,

10
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,833
she'll freak out.

11
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,250
You really think so?

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:41,166
Probably, make that definitely.

13
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,666
Satomi.

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,958
We can worry about that
later, but for now,

15
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,916
let's make this a
Christmas Eve to remember.

16
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,291
This time, for sure.

17
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,291
Here they are.

18
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,541
There are hundreds of alien
species living on Earth

19
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,625
who come and go as they please.

20
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,541
Some are friendly,
some are hostile,

21
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,083
and others are
nearing extinction.

22
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:22,208
Yet somehow, they all
exist in a curious balance.

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,833
That is until one of them

24
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,875
threatens all life
on the planet!

25
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,708
What did you say?!

26
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,833
Princess Saki of the
Macbacs is coming.

27
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,750
She's set to arrive
on Earth tomorrow.

28
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,875
I wonder if she realizes
it'll be Christmas Eve.

29
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,208
What's wrong with the
Macbac Kingdom coming?

30
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,333
I'm looking forward to meeting
an all-female species.

31
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,583
Let's just say
they're no Santa Claus.

32
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,000
No, of course not.

33
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,250
It's strange enough that
there's one species out there

34
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,208
delivering presents
to children.

35
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,916
She said it's a
diplomatic trip, but-

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,208
You think she's
looking for a mate?

37
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,208
Probably so.

38
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,583
I didn't realize their
princess was in heat already.

39
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,750
Since the queen of the
Macbacs is the only one

40
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,208
capable of reproducing,
I'm sure this is a big event.

41
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,791
Their society is much like an
insect colony in that respect.

42
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,583
However, since they have
no males, the queen must

43
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:56,291
begin searching for a mate
from a different species.

44
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,750
Although the queen only mates
once, she bears many children

45
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,958
and becomes deeply
attached to her partner.

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,458
They stay together
until her mate dies,

47
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,416
and even then, she
never chooses another.

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,625
I wish I could have
a romance like that!

49
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,000
I think love between different
species is a beautiful thing.

50
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,458
If only it were that simple.

51
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,250
The Macbac have another name;

52
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,666
they are called
"species eaters."

53
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,666
Romantic or not, there's
a dark side to their story.

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,041
Within a few generations,

55
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,625
the species they mate
with goes extinct!

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,083
We're pleased to have you
on Earth, Princess Saki.

57
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,791
In the name of Planet Dogra,
we will serve as your guides.

58
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,250
It's a pleasure to meet you.

59
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,333
I'm sure I'll enjoy
my stay here.

60
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:59,041
By the way, isn't this a bit
desolate for a meeting place?

61
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,375
To be honest, I had hoped
there would be Earthlings here

62
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,125
to greet me when I arrived.

63
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,916
The people of Earth are
not widely aware that

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,875
intergalactic species exist,
so we chose someplace remote.

65
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,875
I see, then we had
better hide our antenna.

66
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,791
That goes for our spaceship
as well, is that correct?

67
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm afraid so.
I hope you don't mind.

68
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,333
Then please allow
us to get changed.

69
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,833
We'll meet back here
in just a moment.

70
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,708
Do you think I should
wear a miniskirt?

71
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,166
No way! Your legs
are way too chubby!

72
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,500
And you're duck-footed too!

73
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,375
You guys made them sound
like a bunch of monsters!

74
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,541
But they seem pretty
charming if you ask me.

75
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,875
Don't let your guard down.

76
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,833
From an evolutionary
perspective,

77
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,875
it's vital for them to
make a good impression.

78
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,833
You're falling right
into their trap.

79
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,291
The ones that seem
the most harmless

80
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,208
are always the worst
to deal with.

81
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,333
C'mon guys, just chill out!
I think dealing with the Prince

82
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,958
is starting to warp
your view of the world!

83
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,875
Rookie.

84
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,750
Wait, where is Prince Baka?!

85
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,166
Please tell me you didn't let
him know about the Macbac!

86
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,625
No, of course not!

87
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,166
He should be
collecting flora samples

88
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,458
in Southeast Asia right now.

89
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,041
Don't mind me,
you just keep mating.

90
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,291
Mating?

91
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,458
I know the road is rough,
Princess, I'm sorry about that.

92
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,916
It doesn't bother me at all.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,958
Hey Captain. I don't think
this is the road we--

94
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,166
Use an Earth language
whenever you talk to us!

95
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,208
Oh no, is your head okay?

96
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,250
Oh, yeah! Never better!

97
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,875
I know this must be a pain.

98
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,375
I hope this inconvenience
doesn't ruin your trip.

99
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,625
Don't worry.

100
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,291
I've been waiting to see
Earth for a long time,

101
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,958
so I'm just happy to be here.

102
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,250
The Macbac species
has decimated life

103
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,166
on thousands of planets.

104
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,750
After mating with them,

105
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,916
their partner's species always
loses the ability to propagate.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,125
But why, when the queen only
has intercourse with one male?

107
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,291
I don't get it.

108
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,416
How does it affect
the rest of the planet?

109
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,250
They're likely
infected by a virus.

110
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,291
Well, that's the theory, anyway.

111
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,625
Since they mate with so
many other species,

112
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,416
their greatest fear
is an unknown disease.

113
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,583
Therefore, it's believed
that the queen's body

114
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,083
holds countless viruses
to combat this.

115
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,875
And among those viruses is one

116
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,375
that destroys males'
reproductive ability.

117
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,666
Although the virus is originally
passed on like an STD,

118
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,583
it evidently becomes
airborne not long after.

119
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,375
Then, spreading across
the planet in seconds,

120
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:30,250
it neuters the entire male
population on a genetic level.

121
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,375
This is serious business.

122
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,458
I can't believe they'd
do something like that.

123
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,083
I mean, what's the point?

124
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,041
I bet they're
extremely possessive.

125
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,125
Once they've chosen a species,
only they can have it.

126
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,083
Nature can play cruel jokes.

127
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,375
There must be something
we can do to stop them.

128
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,416
Do you have any ideas, Captain?

129
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,875
Anti-matchmaking!

130
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,708
Is something wrong?

131
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,916
No.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,458
I was just thinking
that maybe you shouldn't

133
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,541
have gone to the trouble
of visiting Earth.

134
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,416
When it comes to
destroying their planet,

135
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,458
Earthlings are the
worst in the universe.

136
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,291
They create tons
of toxic waste,

137
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,708
emit vast amounts
of carbon dioxide,

138
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:12,708
dump trash everywhere and expect
someone else to clean it up.

139
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,958
I see.

140
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,916
I can't deny that these
are all shortcomings,

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,958
but surely they have
good traits too.

142
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,416
Well, if nothing else,

143
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,583
I suppose they are
rather prolific.

144
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,791
It's like their mating
season is year-round.

145
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:24,875
The people of this world

146
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,625
can't think of anything
but intercourse.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,791
You don't mind, do you?

148
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,125
I guess not.

149
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,916
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,458
It was probably just
a mix up anyway.

151
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:43,583
No, I was looking forward
to sleeping with you tonight.

152
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,250
Oh, Mikihisa.

153
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,583
--That's such a pretty tree!
--Yeah!

154
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,458
Hey, Saki, look! Look at that!

155
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,208
Is it okay for them to be using
their native language here?

156
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,666
People will probably just think
they're from another country.

157
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,083
Are they having some
sort of festival tonight?

158
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,375
Yes, the Earthlings
call it "Christmas Eve."

159
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,250
It's the biggest day of the
year for sexual intercourse.

160
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,458
Captain!

161
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,375
What's the big deal?
It's true, isn't it?

162
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,833
Well. I suppose, but...

163
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,291
On Earth, it's normal for
both men and women to have

164
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,125
multiple sexual partners
throughout their lives.

165
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,208
The couples you see here
will probably have

166
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,958
different partners next year.

167
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,833
I had no idea.

168
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,875
That's going a bit far, sir.

169
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,500
I'm barely stretching the truth.

170
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,541
Besides, if they end up
hating the entire planet,

171
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,625
that's a good thing.

172
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,708
Oh, don't let it
get to you, Saki.

173
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,291
Not everyone's like that,

174
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,416
some couples stay together
their whole lives.

175
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,166
Finally, something nice!

176
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,833
That little bastard!

177
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,625
Whose side is he on anyway?!

178
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,250
Satomi.

179
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,500
You can check out at any time.

180
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,833
Please let me know
whenever you'd like to leave.

181
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,125
I know it may take time,

182
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,208
but I'm willing to work
hard while I'm here.

183
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,916
In search of your
mate, you mean?

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,375
If you want me to be honest,

185
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,583
I believe that the
Earthling's mating practices

186
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,708
make for a more efficient
form of proliferation.

187
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,208
However, the Macbac
believe that finding a mate

188
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,166
is a trial given to
us by our ancestors.

189
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,250
We put our entire
species on the line

190
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,500
with one chance at true love.

191
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,708
That's why we search
with all of our might,

192
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,791
and that's why we make love
with all of our hearts.

193
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,208
The point is, I'm
proud of my people

194
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,250
and how we search
for our mates.

195
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,166
What happens if you
don't find anyone?

196
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,375
Oh, I will.

197
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,041
Then what happens if
he doesn't notice you?

198
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,500
I'll make him notice.
No matter what.

199
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,291
There are plenty of
Earthlings who are impotent

200
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,166
or have erectile
dysfunction, you know.

201
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,791
Some men only like
other men, or 2D girls.

202
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,333
There are Oedipus complexes,
and Lolita complexes.

203
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,291
No matter what hurdles
may stand between me

204
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:50,250
and my species' survival,
I vow to overcome them.

205
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,958
Well, it's settled then.
With an attitude like that,

206
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,458
you're never going
to see the light.

207
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,458
Whoa, Captain!

208
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,916
At least you're
straightforward.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,291
I can respect that.

210
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,250
I could've used some
help back there!

211
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,125
She was so passionate.
What could I say?

212
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,333
You're useless!

213
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,041
Are you sure you're
not taking this too far?

214
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,375
If you aren't careful,

215
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,333
you could hurt Dogra's
relationship with Macbac.

216
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,708
Who cares?!

217
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,125
Then at least they won't
try to mate with one of us!

218
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,083
Satomi, wait. Talk to me!

219
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,791
I can't do this, okay?

220
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,708
What's the problem?

221
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,208
I-I just see you as
a friend and that's all.

222
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,625
I can't change your mind?

223
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,958
No.

224
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,125
Well, that's a shame.

225
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,666
I'm sorry. I'm going home now.

226
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,583
Hold on a sec!

227
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,875
Seems like that was the
girl's fault, don't you think?

228
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,666
No way, I think it
was the guy's fault.

229
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,541
It was both their faults, okay?!

230
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,416
I think a woman should
expect a certain level

231
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,958
of physical intimacy if a
man invites her to a hotel.

232
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,625
Following that line of logic,

233
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,958
shouldn't we be sleeping
with those Macbac harpies?

234
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,791
That would be nice, huh?

235
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,041
He's been compromised.

236
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,458
There's no need to worry.

237
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,500
If Dogra's safety is at
stake, I'll put him down.

238
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,291
Was it too soon?
I just don't get it.

239
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,166
I hate to ask this of you,
but would you mind translating

240
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,916
since I don't know
the language?

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,291
Oh no, it's part of
my job, after all.

242
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,166
No.

243
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,833
Is there anything in
particular you'd like to eat?

244
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,791
I can't blame this on timing.

245
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,833
I know the truth.

246
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,958
Princess Saki?

247
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,208
Would you please marry me?

248
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,250
Now, Princess Saki,
let's be reasonable.

249
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,166
But I am. This is the one!

250
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,750
I've never been so
sure in my life.

251
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,458
It's rather sudden.
Let's slow down.

252
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,458
Uh, my name is Mikihisa.

253
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,083
I'm sorry, but what
did you just say?

254
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,875
Now hold on there. Stay back!

255
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,791
Don't treat me like
some kind of criminal!

256
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,041
I just wanted to
introduce myself to her!

257
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,500
It is your job to translate
for me, isn't it?!

258
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,375
You have to tell him
what I said, please!

259
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,916
C'mon, what's she saying?

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's double love
at first sight?!

261
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,083
Why is this happening to me?!

262
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,291
Okay. Now let's all calm down,

263
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,583
and see if we can
talk through this.

264
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,291
So what did she
say earlier?!

265
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,916
I thought I told you
to calm down?!

266
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,666
This is a princess from
a foreign country.

267
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,958
She's on vacation
here incognito.

268
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,375
As you might guess, we're
the princess' bodyguards.

269
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,208
A princess? No wonder.

270
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,875
All right, Captain,
so far so good.

271
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,416
It's probably better to stretch
the truth than to lie outright.

272
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,333
Also, it puts a lot
of pressure on the boy

273
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,500
now that he knows he's
dealing with royalty.

274
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,791
Just now the princess...
she was saying...

275
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,750
Yes?! What?

276
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,875
Well, she said.,,

277
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,708
She said that you look just
like her long lost brother.

278
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,250
Oh, Captain.

279
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:45,750
That is so cliché,
but still, I love it!

280
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,916
This is some commoner taking
a vacation for the holiday.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,791
Turns out you look
a lot like his fiancée,

282
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,208
so he got a bit confused
when he first saw you.

283
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,333
It's almost as if fate
brought us together, isn't it?

284
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,416
Ignoring the part
about the fiancée?

285
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,375
In the path of love,
that's just a minor obstacle.

286
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,291
The shameless hussy!

287
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,041
Please, help translate for me!

288
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,083
I want to ask her out on a date!

289
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,833
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

290
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,916
Of course I did!
And it touched my heart!

291
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,875
Even though we just met, the
princess feels as close to me

292
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,000
as my own flesh and blood.

293
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,458
Obviously this is fate!

294
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,416
You might be
over-thinking this, kid!

295
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,333
Would you please
translate that for me?!

296
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,333
Oh, it's hardly worth repeating.

297
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,500
Look, you have to
ask her out for me!

298
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,083
I'm sure if she understood,
she would happily agree!

299
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,000
No way.

300
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,625
Pass on the message, would ya?!

301
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,458
You're way out of your
league here, boy!

302
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,833
I don't care!

303
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,125
You stupid brat!

304
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,041
You're about to destroy
the entire human race!

305
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,291
Hey, Saki, come with me.

306
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,166
Please excuse us for a moment.

307
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,583
As you can see, the princess
isn't interested in you.

308
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,625
If you don't mind,
would you please leave?

309
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,125
Colin, escort him.

310
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,791
But, they're coming right back.

311
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,625
Just do it! That's an order.

312
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,791
Hey, let go of me!

313
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,333
Sorry, but there's no other way!

314
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,166
I said let go, damn it!

315
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,125
The Earth is saved.
All in a day's work, huh?

316
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,166
What're you going to
tell Princess Saki?

317
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,541
I'll say that he
left, of course.

318
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,958
I understand how you feel,

319
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,750
but I'm afraid it's
not gonna work out.

320
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,125
Please, just give up on her.

321
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,791
Not a chance.

322
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,125
--Ho, ho, ho!
--I-It's you.

323
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,833
Please say you'll
run away with me.

324
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,416
Sorry, Captain.

325
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,875
They took me by surprise.

326
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,875
It's remarkable that she
was willing to resort

327
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,333
to brute force so soon!

328
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,083
A remarkable pain in
the ass! Found them!

329
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,041
Stop!

330
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,791
I always say a good man knows
when it's time to stand down.

331
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,125
Yeah well, a good soldier
doesn't know how to give up.

332
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,125
Colin. Go get 'em!

333
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,833
Get off me!

334
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,708
Ugh, I thought we
got rid of you!

335
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,583
Wha- Where am I?

336
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,125
Princess Saki!

337
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,541
Damn it!

338
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,708
Those two are out
of their minds!

339
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,041
For the Macbac, love at first
sight is a powerful drug.

340
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,458
It's the only way they
know to find a mate.

341
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,375
The second they find
that special someone,

342
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,541
a bolt of electricity
runs through their body

343
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,958
and they enter a trance.

344
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,125
When they wake up,

345
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,708
they immediately
propose to their beloved.

346
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,541
At least, that's how a
previous queen described it.

347
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,375
Why didn't you tell
me that sooner?!

348
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,708
Well, the academic community
ignored the theory,

349
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,375
since you can't
really prove it.

350
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,958
But we're seeing
it for ourselves!

351
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,541
It looks like the coast
is clear. Let's go.

352
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,208
Here. Take this.

353
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,625
Thank you very much.

354
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,125
I know we just met and I
can't speak your language,

355
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,625
but I promise I'll do everything
I can to protect you.

356
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,208
I've got you now!

357
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,416
Stop making my job so difficult!

358
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
What do you care if
we're together or not?!

359
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,416
It's our mission to
ensure that you stay safe.

360
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,833
We can't just hand you
over to some strange man.

361
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,083
You are a princess, after all.

362
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,500
I promise I'll make her
happy, no matter what!

363
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,458
Sadly, that would make the
rest of mankind very unhappy.

364
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:40,000
Now step away from-What now?!

365
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,416
Here ya go, Saki! Use this!

366
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,041
C'mon Colin. Where in
the hell are you?!

367
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:51,875
Come back!

368
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,416
Captain!

369
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,916
Now I'm mad!

370
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,708
Do you brats think
this is cute?

371
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,375
I'll make you sorry
you ever crossed me!

372
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,041
You should be safe now.

373
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,083
We've let them have their
way for long enough.

374
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,375
I'm sorry Captain,
this is my fault.

375
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,625
Though in my defense,

376
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,166
I never expected they
would take it this far.

377
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,208
Women are monsters.

378
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,458
There's no limit to
what they'll do.

379
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,333
All right, Princess,
let's head back now!

380
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,333
No way!

381
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,750
I won't let you
take her from me!

382
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,875
Listen, pal! I don't
think you understand

383
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,125
what kind of danger you're
getting yourself into!

384
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,291
All that really matters
is that we're together!

385
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,625
The rest of the world can
go and die, for all I care!

386
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,750
That's exactly
what's gonna happen!

387
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,625
You'd better be
careful, Captain!

388
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,583
What'll we do if you
end up hurting the princess?!

389
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,875
We're not going anywhere

390
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,458
until you decide to
accept our relationship!

391
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,166
Get your head out of your ass!

392
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,750
Even if it's written in
the stars, I won't accept--

393
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,625
Are you doin' okay, Captain?

394
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,291
I've never felt so pathetic.

395
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,916
I think I'd rather die than have
the prince see me like this.

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,166
Captain! Sorry for the wait!

397
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,500
As long as you found
something, I don't care.

398
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,833
I did, sir.

399
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,208
Here, take a look at the
boy's sign-in information.

400
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,625
Well, I'll be damned.

401
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,125
It's such a beautiful sight.

402
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,875
When I planned this trip,

403
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,208
I just wanted to share
this incredible view

404
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,375
with the one person
I loved most.

405
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,041
Now that dream has come true.

406
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,666
Hey, I just realized,
this all happened so fast

407
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,666
that I never even
asked you your name.

408
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,541
We were destined
to fall in love.

409
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,916
I knew from the
moment I saw you.

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,166
You're the reason I traveled
to this faraway world.

411
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,041
I don't care that I can't
understand your words.

412
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,166
Because I understand
your feelings,

413
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,416
and I feel the same way.

414
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,458
This game of tag is over.

415
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,500
Calm down, I'm not
going to hurt her.

416
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,958
But Princess Saki,

417
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,375
there's something I
think you should know

418
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,791
about that boyfriend of yours.

419
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,375
It's all right. Come here.

420
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,250
Thank you for
cooperating, princess.

421
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,083
You can tell her
whatever you want,

422
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,666
but nothing you say is
ever gonna tear us apart!

423
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,375
Saves the lines for
the movies, Romeo.

424
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,416
It's over!

425
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,750
We know you're
not really a boy!

426
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,750
So the princess is
after her genes?

427
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:05,916
It's a delicate situation.

428
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,583
I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid I must return--

429
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,458
I'm a man, Satomi!
I'm not a girl!

430
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,166
Would you tell me what
it's like to fall in love?

431
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,375
There's no doubt.

432
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,583
I'll never forget the
tears in her eyes--

433
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,583
I can't imagine the
princess of the Macbacs

434
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,583
giving up that easily.

435
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,166
You're a freak!
Get away from me!

436
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,875
I'm just happy
that they're gone.

437
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,875
Next up: Love me tender.

438
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll be waiting for you,
my destined one.
