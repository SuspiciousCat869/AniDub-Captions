00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:16,349
{\an8}(cheerful music
with foreign lyrics)

2
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,772
(serene flute music)

3
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,277
- [Narrator] Each day,
Ryuki Shi was becoming

4
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,698
more and more competent
as the king of Saiunkoku.

5
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,491
He would clearly
state his opinions

6
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,827
in the royal court,
form conclusions

7
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,870
from the opinions
of his ministers,

8
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,997
and actively involve
himself in every aspect

9
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,582
of government affairs.

10
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,668
- [Shuei] He really
is becoming more

11
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,294
like a king, isn't he?

12
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,214
- Well, that's just because
he has a good teacher.

13
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,258
- (laughs)

14
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,844
- Now, consider this
issue, we would like

15
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,847
to hear your opinions
by the end of the day.

16
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,848
- Hmmm...

17
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,892
(serene flute music)

18
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,361
- I see, he's doing well.

19
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,530
- He is. I hear that,
even in the royal court,

20
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,282
he comes forward
with his opinions.

21
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,701
- If that's how it is,
I guess it's about time

22
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,870
I pack my things and go home.

23
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,288
- Huh?

24
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,998
- I came here to
help the king but,

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,334
if he's dealing with the
affairs of state properly,

26
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,543
then there's no
need for me to stay

27
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,378
at the palace any longer.

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,422
Classes at the temple
school should start again

29
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,341
and, with the summer
banquet season coming up,

30
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,051
there'll be lots
of performing jobs.

31
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,887
- Hmmm. The king will be
very lonely without you.

32
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,641
- (sighs) I have
to live my own life

33
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,809
and this isn't the place.

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,066
- (sighs)

35
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,777
(somber music)

36
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,742
- (sighs)

37
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,418
(knock on door)

38
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,294
- Huh?

39
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,298
- Hmmm, what a lovely scent!

40
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,384
- Korin prepared it for you.

41
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,345
I believe she referred to
it as her secret formula.

42
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,554
- Secret formula?

43
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,890
- Yes, she was worried
about you, I think.

44
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,058
She said the consort seems

45
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,310
a little under the
weather lately.

46
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,605
- [Shurei] (giggles) I see.

47
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,024
When you see Korin again,

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,026
would you please tell
her thank you for me?

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,528
- Of course, my lady.

50
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,699
- [Servant] I will be sure
to pass on your thanks.

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,659
Well then, please excuse me.

52
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,625
(door closes)

53
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,336
(serene music)

54
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,643
- Hmmm.

55
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,608
(cup clatters)

56
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,905
(groans)

57
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:51,833
- Huh?

58
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,501
- Anything unusual to report?

59
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,919
- [Guard] No, sir.

60
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,837
- Very well.

61
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,592
(footsteps)

62
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,762
- (growls)

63
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,140
- (growls) I thought
it would be a breeze

64
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,059
if I had a map of
the palace with me!

65
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,980
That's it! This stupid
map must be wrong!

66
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,398
That's gotta be it.

67
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,859
Otherwise, there's no
way I would get lost.

68
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,194
- [Korin] It was you, wasn't it!

69
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,570
- (grunts)

70
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,613
- [Korin] Why do you
have to interfere?

71
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,656
- [Koyu] What was that?

72
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,950
(footsteps)

73
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,413
(door creaks)

74
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,833
- [Korin] This is what
that person truly desires,

75
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,834
isn't it?

76
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,835
- It's over there.

77
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,507
- [Korin] Please! I want
to be of use to him too!

78
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,966
- It's coming from here.

79
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,719
Honestly, making such a
racket at this time of night.

80
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,513
- [Korin] If it
wasn't for him...

81
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,223
(thud) - (surprised gasp)

82
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,766
(grunts)

83
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:50,684
- Huh?

84
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,103
- Korin!

85
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,064
Are you okay?

86
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:56,981
(hissing noise)

87
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,942
- Huh? Is anybody out there?

88
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,902
- [Koyu] Check Consort
Hong's room, quickly!

89
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,153
- Don't tell me.

90
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,908
- Consort Hong? (heavy
breathing) She's gone.

91
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,953
(suspenseful music)

92
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,665
- Damn it.

93
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,793
- [Koyu] Shuei!
Shuei, where is she?

94
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,129
- What a surprise, you
didn't get lost this time.

95
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,465
- This is no time to be
joking around! (gasps)

96
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,675
- [Koyu] Where's Seiran?

97
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,801
You'd think he'd be
the first one here,

98
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,136
all things considered.

99
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,890
- Hmmm?

100
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,142
- [Ryuki] What's going on?

101
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,477
- Your Majesty.

102
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,565
- Huh? (grunts)

103
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,526
(foreboding music)

104
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,994
- (groans)

105
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,971
- But we already switched
Korin's drug incense

106
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,806
with a non-lethal substitute.

107
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,977
- Which means there must
be others involved as well.

108
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,979
- Whoever they were,
they vanished like smoke

109
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,647
along with Shurei,
even in the middle

110
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,191
of such high palace security.

111
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,818
It looks like we're dealing
with real professionals here.

112
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,987
At least we figured
out a few things,

113
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,697
Korin's motives have
been clearly established

114
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,033
and she's involved
with this other person.

115
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,243
Although, I'm quite sure he
never would have expected

116
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,245
that girl to take
any action like this.

117
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,083
- I wanted to handle this
matter a little more discreetly

118
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,251
but now it's come to
this, I have no choice.

119
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,297
Shuei, your orders are to
arrest that man immediately.

120
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,674
- Yes, sir.

121
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,134
- [Ryuki] Koyu, please
remain with Korin

122
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,803
until she wakes up.

123
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,848
Inform only Shoka and,
please, do so in secret.

124
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,685
Also, there's a chance
people may be injured,

125
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,895
we must ensure that they
receive treatment quickly.

126
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,189
Wake Dr. To and the
royal physicians

127
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,358
and tell them to be prepared.

128
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,317
- Yes, right away.

129
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,781
- By the way your majesty,

130
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,701
there's one other who
remains unaccounted for.

131
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,952
- Hmmm?

132
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,787
- It seems very odd that Seiran

133
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,623
is no where to be found
in a situation like this.

134
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,749
Do you think that he was the-

135
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,959
- I don't.

136
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:21,835
- And your basis?

137
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,877
- None.

138
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,714
- That's hardly a
persuasive argument.

139
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,259
- [Shuei] Your majesty,
please forgive me.

140
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,636
I'm told you didn't
give Seiran a flower,

141
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,930
why is that, may I ask?

142
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,975
- Because it's not necessary.

143
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,226
- Not necessary?

144
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,188
- [Ryuki] There's no need to
confirm his true feelings.

145
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,690
I know for a fact that Seiran

146
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,775
would never betray Shurei or me.

147
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,777
In the same way,

148
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,404
I have no doubt in
my mind that you two,

149
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,364
who willingly
accepted my flowers,

150
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,700
will always serve
me with loyalty.

151
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,827
- My, it seems that
you estimate our worth

152
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,912
extremely highly, your Majesty.

153
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,206
- I'm not estimating,
I know it for a fact.

154
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,624
It's part of who you are.

155
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,251
You're both stubborn
and unyielding,

156
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,836
always poised to take action,

157
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,213
never pandering to
those who are in power.

158
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,840
In addition to these traits,

159
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,092
you have high self-respect
that borders on arrogance.

160
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,094
You're both unwavering
in self-confidence

161
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,763
and faith, and
neither of you bow

162
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,806
before those who
are unreasonable.

163
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,142
- Is he suppose
to be praising us

164
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,310
with this speech of his?

165
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,394
- I'm not sure.

166
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,189
- Well then, you're saying that,

167
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,024
in your eyes,
Seiran is innocent?

168
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,276
- I am.

169
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,821
- You pass the
test, your Majesty.

170
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,865
(paper crinkles)

171
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,950
- Hmm? What's that?

172
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,453
- It's a note that was
given to me by Seiran.

173
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,704
- You got a note?

174
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,709
- To be perfectly honest, he
told me not to let you see it

175
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,712
but I see no harm, since you
truly believe he is innocent.

176
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,387
- Hmmm.

177
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,393
- (gasps)

178
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,311
- What's this? I thought
you would've been surprised.

179
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,231
- What are you talking about?
Of course I am surprised.

180
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,818
- I wasn't asking you,
Koyu, I was asking the king.

181
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,319
- I already knew.

182
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,072
(wistful music)

183
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,826
- Hmmm.

184
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,246
(wistful music)

185
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,248
- Hmmm.

186
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,045
(wistful music)

187
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,217
(sword clinks)

188
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,929
- It's been a long time.
Those words seem appropriate.

189
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,224
It's quite amusing,
don't you think?

190
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,809
Now, when I look at you,

191
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,937
I'm reminded of the
distant past, Prince Seien.

192
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,526
- So Seiran is really your
brother, Prince Seien?

193
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,819
(arrow whooshes through the air)

194
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,529
(gasp in unison)

195
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,405
- Huh?

196
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,411
Well, whoever it was,
they escaped quickly.

197
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,956
(foreboding music)

198
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,792
(paper crinkles)

199
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,128
- Your Majesty?

200
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,092
- (grunts) Hurry and carry
out my orders immediately,

201
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,303
arrest Advisor Sa on sight.

202
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,306
You'll likely find Seiran
is already with him.

203
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,182
- Yes.

204
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,725
- And you, your Majesty?

205
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,393
- Shurei is in the Ministry
of the Enlightened One's cave,

206
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,020
I will go.

207
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,188
- The Enlightened One's cave?

208
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,814
- It's too dangerous
for you to go,

209
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,232
this is obviously a trap.

210
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:35,820
- It likely is but, this
time, I must jump right in.

211
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,447
I will bring Shurei back.

212
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,406
(suspenseful music)

213
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,366
- [Enjun] A long time ago,

214
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,909
when I served the former king,

215
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,287
it was a time of constant
warfare and strife.

216
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,873
In those days, Shusui
and I fought together

217
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,875
on the battlefield,
doing what we could

218
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,378
to get ahead and reach
the top of the pile.

219
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,254
The Sa Clan was
then ranked lowest

220
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,924
among the seven noble families.

221
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,801
I wanted to elevate our position

222
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,470
and I offered the former
king my loyal service.

223
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,098
- You've already
accomplished that goal,

224
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,433
your power and rank
are unshakable.

225
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,352
You've become an
advisor with hundreds

226
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,312
of ministers answering to you.

227
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,231
Why do you find it necessary

228
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,233
to do something like this now?

229
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,110
- [Enjun] It's a
gamble of sorts.

230
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,070
- What, a gamble?

231
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,614
- [Enjun] Oh, things
were still fine back then

232
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,866
but then I realized something.

233
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,245
No matter how hard I tried, no
matter how much I sacrificed,

234
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,831
I would never be
at the very top.

235
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,125
As long as both
of us still live,

236
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,044
that man will
always be above me.

237
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,088
- You mean Advisor Sho?

238
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,633
- It didn't matter how
much effort I put in,

239
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,052
I could never reach Sho's
level, he outpaced me.

240
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,973
He's the type of person
we define as genius.

241
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,101
- But you also raised to
the position of advisor.

242
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,186
- Yes, but I am an ordinary man.

243
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,189
Success, honor, status,
power, I crave these things.

244
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,567
They nourished me as
I climbed my way up

245
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,319
the long and steep path
to where I am today,

246
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,488
but it was very
different with Sho.

247
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,991
He was sincerely devoted
to serving the king

248
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,201
to the exclusion of all
else, status, power,

249
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,454
and wealth mean
nothing at all to him.

250
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,998
It's as though he has
no desire in his heart

251
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,168
for anything in this world
beyond simply existing.

252
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,884
And that is the reason I
despite my dear old friend, Sho.

253
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,181
(serene flute music)

254
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:28,725
(suspenseful music)

255
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,393
- Despite him?

256
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,020
- He showed me all too clearly

257
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,188
the difference between a genius

258
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,565
and an ordinary man like me.

259
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,193
I have no regrets
about living my life

260
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,486
in the way that I have chosen.

261
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,738
Almost all of my wishes
have been fulfilled.

262
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,449
And yet, despite
all my satisfaction,

263
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,534
there's still one
desire that remains,

264
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,661
to rise above Sho.

265
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,165
This is now my only
wish and fondest dream.

266
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,167
I wonder how he'll
respond to this.

267
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,003
Can I surpass him in
this last match of wits?

268
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,756
As I said, it's a gamble.

269
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,217
I've already grown
old, because of that,

270
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,719
this is a risk I can
well afford to take.

271
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,138
I have no attachment
to what little remains

272
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,473
of the life left to me.

273
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,142
This is my first and last wager.

274
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,186
Constructing this life
of mine has been like

275
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,147
painting a dragon, all
that is lacking now

276
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,024
is the finishing touch.

277
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,360
- And that's why you
kidnapped Lady Shurei?

278
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,698
(suspenseful music)

279
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,660
- (groans)

280
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:33,164
(suspenseful music)

281
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,126
- [Shurei Voiceover] Where am I?

282
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,294
Who did this to me, and why?

283
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,215
Surely there isn't
anyway they can benefit

284
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,134
from kidnapping me.

285
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,261
- [Enjun] I admit, I did
not anticipate the king

286
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,180
becoming so intensely
found of your mistress,

287
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,598
but he made it clear
that he would prefer

288
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,184
that girl to my
own granddaughter

289
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,686
so forging an alliance
through marriage

290
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,105
was no longer an
option and then,

291
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,274
just as I was thinking
about what to do next,

292
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,693
fortune smiled on
me and I learned

293
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,237
of your existence, Prince Seien.

294
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,156
- No, I am not Prince Seien.

295
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,532
- Your eyes are
identical to those

296
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,285
of the former king
when he was a youth!

297
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,536
- No, I-

298
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,538
- Well, if you insist on
denying it, that's fine.

299
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,624
However, quite frankly, your
word is of little value.

300
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,543
Once people learn their
beloved Prince Seien

301
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,711
has returned from exile,

302
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,713
I guarantee there will be many

303
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,506
who will want you
to take the throne.

304
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,091
- There's only one
king of Saiunkoku

305
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,718
and that's King Ryuki.

306
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,553
Would you really want
to risk a repetition

307
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,805
of the struggle for the
throne eight years ago?

308
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,140
- [Enjun] Oh, there
will be no need

309
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,224
to go through
anything like that.

310
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,684
- Huh?

311
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,228
- It would be fine if his
Majesty just disappeared.

312
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,231
Yes, perhaps through an
unfortunate accident.

313
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,483
- Hmmm?

314
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,527
(suspenseful music)

315
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,699
- If Shurei's here, the
darkness doesn't matter.

316
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,536
(door creaks) - Hmmm?

317
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,830
(footsteps)

318
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,625
- [Shurei Voiceover] Who is it?

319
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,294
- [Assassin] He
came, huh? (chuckles)

320
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,631
It looks like things are
going to get interesting.

321
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,762
(suspenseful music)

322
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,391
- [Enjun] I will be
waiting patiently

323
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,268
with the throne I've prepared
for you, Prince Seien.

324
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,478
- [Seien] (grunts)

325
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,480
What have you done
with King Ryuki?

326
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,898
- After all this time,

327
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,442
you still care so deeply
for your younger brother.

328
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,361
You were the only one
in the entire palace

329
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,406
who ever truly loved the
lonely child, Prince Ryuki.

330
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,782
Could it be because you've gone

331
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,243
through the same very
harsh experiences yourself?

332
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:33,910
- You're wrong!

333
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,412
- Hmmm.

334
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,331
- He was the only one who
always loved and respected me,

335
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,292
purely and innocently
without any ulterior motive.

336
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,794
I was the one who
found comfort in being

337
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,255
with him and trusting him.

338
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,923
It was because of
Ryuki that I was able

339
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,551
to go on when I was
in the royal palace.

340
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,428
That's why I was the
one that loved him.

341
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,804
Now tell me, right now,

342
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,681
what have you done to Ryuki?

343
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,268
- It appears that it will
take a little more convincing

344
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,270
in order to have
you take the throne.

345
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,479
- [Seien] That'll never happen!

346
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,647
- Hmmm.

347
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,274
- You've become
blinded by ambition,

348
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,526
you're a fool, Advisor Sa!

349
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,694
- How dare you?

350
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,531
(suspenseful music)

351
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,867
(footsteps)

352
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,620
- (grunts)

353
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,706
(grunts)

354
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,210
- [Assassin] (grunts)

355
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,298
- [Shurei Voiceover] Ryuki!

356
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,466
- [Seien] It'd be impossible

357
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,842
for you to have me
take the throne.

358
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,386
That chance died the
moment Ryuki became king.

359
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,264
A new era has already
begun for the royal court.

360
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,850
Your grand opportunity
has come and gone.

361
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,935
Shuei Ran and Koyu Ri
have already chosen

362
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,271
the master they are
going to follow.

363
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,315
They've pledged
their loyalty to him.

364
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:46,858
If you somehow were successful

365
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,985
and were able to put a
puppet king on the throne,

366
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,153
rest assured that those two

367
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,947
and I would take you
down without hesitation.

368
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,491
- Hmmm.

369
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,868
- You see, the thing
about my younger brother,

370
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,954
is that he's nowhere near as
stupid as you seem to think.

371
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,707
And, as for myself,
I am nowhere near

372
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,584
as obedient as you think either.

373
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,878
- That much seems
to be apparent.

374
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,548
In that case, I'll just
have to make you obedient.

375
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,470
(door closes)

376
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,764
- (groans)

377
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,812
- You see, Prince Seien,
there are many different ways

378
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,439
to turn a disobedient
person into a puppet.

379
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,315
Seize him!

380
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,024
- [Minion] Yes, sir!

381
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,902
(groans)

382
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,028
(gasp in unison)

383
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,322
(grunts)

384
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,659
- (groans)

385
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,911
- (groans)

386
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,623
- [Enjun] It's a lovely
scent, is it not?

387
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,543
- Advisor Sa!

388
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,629
- Don't worry, by the
time you come around

389
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,964
you will be on the throne.

390
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,677
- (grunts)

391
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,516
- No one told us this
guy would be so skilled.

392
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,019
- (gasps)

393
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,521
- I'll ask you once,
where is Shurei?

394
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,691
- (groans)

395
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,909
- [Assassin] Over here! I
have your lovely princess!

396
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,995
- Is that really
Shurei with you?

397
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,789
- Certainly. Of course
her mouth is covered

398
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,958
so I can't let you
hear her voice.

399
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,420
Now then, be reasonable
and throw away your weapon.

400
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,548
- [Shurei Voiceover] (gasps)
No, that isn't me down there!

401
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,550
Those two in the shadows
are both assassins

402
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,801
that are trying to kill you!

403
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,762
Oh, if only I could warn you.

404
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,724
(sword clanks)

405
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,646
- [Assassin] (laughs)
That's a good boy.

406
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,983
- [Shurei Voiceover] Don't
go over there, Ryuki!

407
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,823
- (groans)

408
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,367
- Take him away.

409
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,829
- (groans) Huh?

410
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,084
- (grunts)

411
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,630
- (grunts)

412
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,050
- (gasps)

413
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,556
(sword clangs)

414
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,896
(air swishes)

415
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,400
(all groan)

416
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,487
- What's going on?

417
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,823
- The king knows
you're behind this.

418
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,450
It won't be long now
before General Ran arrives.

419
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,495
- Huh? How? How did he know?

420
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,665
- Korin, the young girl you
brought to the royal harem,

421
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,166
she's the one who
lead us to you.

422
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:54,004
- Korin, you say? I never
told her a thing about this!

423
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,464
(owl hoots)

424
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,852
- I'm so sorry, Lord Enjun.

425
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,690
- [Black Wolf] At some
point, Korin came to realize

426
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,567
what your intentions were.

427
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,194
In order to help you,
the man she so adores,

428
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,738
she planned to kill Consort Hong

429
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,072
on her own initiative.

430
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,741
It was through her
attempts at poisoning

431
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,784
that we were
finally lead to you.

432
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,494
- Huh? Hmmm.

433
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,621
- [Black Wolf] As I recall,
you found Korin collapsed

434
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,832
and near death in
front of your gate

435
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,710
during the great struggle for
the throne eight years ago.

436
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,503
You took her in
then, didn't you?

437
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,964
(somber music)

438
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,094
- [Korin Voiceover] Lord Enjun!

439
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,638
- Yes, Korin, my
child, what is it?

440
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,100
- Uh... here. I embroidered
it for you myself.

441
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,977
I hope you can find
some use for it.

442
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,646
- Korin.

443
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,107
- [Black Wolf] It's
ironic, isn't it?

444
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,859
Your kindness and good conscious

445
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,112
were ultimately instrumental
in your final downfall.

446
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,739
- This is impossible.

447
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,158
Shusui never mentioned
anything about this to me.

448
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,953
- Shusui? If you're
referring to the assassin

449
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,081
I know by that name,
then I should inform you

450
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,625
that she is a member of
the Wolves of the Wind.

451
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,254
That woman will only take
orders from three people:

452
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:23,093
the former king, myself,
and, of course, Advisor Sho.

453
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,010
- Huh?

454
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,015
I see now, that
explains everything.

455
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,811
(chuckles)

456
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,730
(laughs loudly)

457
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,315
Isn't it always the way?

458
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,526
All this hard work and planning

459
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,653
and he had me dancing
in the palm of his hand,

460
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,197
once again, right up to
the very last moment.

461
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,574
That's Sho for you. And you!

462
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,327
To think that you were
the legendary assassin,

463
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,955
Black Wolf! I must
congratulate you.

464
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,748
You did an excellent
job managing

465
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,751
to keep it a secret
from us all this time.

466
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,170
(laughs)

467
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,673
I'll let you take the
Prince, go right ahead!

468
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,927
- [Enjun] But my
life is something

469
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,345
I will never let you take.

470
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,889
You're not the one to whom
I'll give my last breath!

471
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:12,559
(door creaks)

472
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,190
(sword clinks)

473
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,693
(footsteps)

474
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,780
- Really, you can
be so reckless.

475
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,825
(suspenseful music)

476
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,960
- [Shurei Voiceover]
Don't do it, Ryuki!

477
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,920
Don't go over there, Ryuki!

478
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:50,972
{\an8}(serene music with
foreign lyrics)

479
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,461
- [Narrator] Well, my
work here is finished.

480
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,963
Despite everything
that's happened,

481
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,173
I really enjoyed it in the end.

482
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,300
Now that Advisor
Sho, one more thing,

483
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,845
those five hundred gold
coins you promised me?

484
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:12,887
Hand them over!
