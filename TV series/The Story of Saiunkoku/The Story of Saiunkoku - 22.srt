00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,717
{\an8}(dramatic music)

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,724
{\an8}(sings in foreign language)

3
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,945
- Are you really
sure about this?

4
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,321
- [Lieutenant Governor] Yes.

5
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,615
Please go ahead and
melt down the key.

6
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,825
- I don't know.

7
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,660
- [Yoshen] I have a bad
leg, as you well know.

8
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,663
It's best if I remain in here
and do my work in safety.

9
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,874
Besides, I also have the seal
of a Lieutenant Governor.

10
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,752
- Alright.

11
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,379
I promise you that I'll
return with the new governor,

12
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,797
without fail.

13
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,716
In the meantime,
hold on until then.

14
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,927
(door shuts)

15
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,805
(locking sound)

16
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,559
(dramatic orchestral music)

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,902
- [Narrator] Sa Province, the
land where Shurei and Eigetsu

18
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,904
have been assigned
as new co-governors,

19
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,907
is currently the
most politically and
socially unstable

20
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,951
of the eight provinces
of Saiunkoku.

21
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,039
- Judging from the petitions
Korin brought with her,

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,750
it appears that Sa Province
is in even worse condition

23
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,625
than we thought.

24
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,918
- It's true,

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,545
even Lieutenant Governor
Tei is having problems.

26
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,921
He's chosen to enter a prison,

27
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,506
made to hold the
worst criminals,

28
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,800
where he is continuing
to do his work.

29
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,427
That means the Sa Clan in unable

30
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,262
to obtain the Lieutenant
Governor's seal;

31
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,431
therefore the authority of
the Sa Provincial Government

32
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,724
remains in the
hands of Yushen Tei

33
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,809
and the other provincial
government officials.

34
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,687
- A prison made to hold
the worst criminals?

35
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,522
We understand that
Lieutenant Governor Tei

36
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,358
is a very composed
and quiet man,

37
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,693
who considers
matters a great deal.

38
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,403
- Yes, that's pretty accurate,

39
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,697
but he also has a lot
of spirit to match.

40
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,283
If he's determined to do
something, then that's that.

41
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,785
- Another skilled individual

42
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,286
who passed the same year as
Secretary Ko and Lord Reishin.

43
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,916
- Yeah, and someone we'd really
want in central government.

44
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,501
- How are things
with the Sa clan?

45
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,544
We have heard that after
Advisor Sa's death,

46
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,796
there has been no
end to the fighting

47
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,422
amongst the clan members.

48
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,841
- Not to mention that the
ring symbolizing leadership

49
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,386
of the clan still
hasn't been found.

50
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,014
- Also please tell us, how is
Advisor Sa's wife Lady Eiki?

51
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,265
We understand that

52
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,434
while Advisor Sa was
here in the royal court,

53
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,727
she remained in Sa Province

54
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,437
and kept the clan
in line for him.

55
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,774
- At the moment, Lady
Eiki is under guard,

56
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,067
deep within the clan residence,

57
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,611
and is no longer
able to act freely.

58
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,614
Also Lady Shunki, Advisor
Sa's only granddaughter,

59
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,616
barely managed to escape danger,

60
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,993
and that was only thanks to
Lady Eiki's quick thinking.

61
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,496
She's currently in hiding
at a secret location.

62
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,874
- I would never had
believed it possible

63
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,377
for the dauntless Eiki
to be under house arrest.

64
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,004
If that's the case
it won't be easy

65
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,755
for the new co-governors.

66
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,757
- It'll be just like
when I took office,

67
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,801
the Sa clan will
try and stop us.

68
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,469
They'll send
assassins to attack us

69
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,430
while we're on the
road to Sa Province.

70
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,807
Seiran and I will
be the only guards,

71
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,642
so as not to attract
any attention.

72
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,810
- I know that you and Seiran

73
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,478
are both very
skilled at fighting,

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,815
but I can't help but wonder,
will you be all right?

75
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,734
- We'll protect
Princess and Eigetsu,

76
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,736
even if it means our
lives are forfeit.

77
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,032
- Mhm, please take good care
of the two new governors,

78
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,908
Lieutenant Governor Ro.

79
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,993
- Yes, your Majesty.

80
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,667
(peaceful bamboo flute music)

81
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,130
(Horse hooves clopping
down the road)

82
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,681
- [Shurei Voiceover]
Father, I'm on my way.

83
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,569
- Have you never left
Kiyo City before?

84
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,905
It must be a pretty big
moment for you then.

85
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,698
- Huh?

86
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,618
Yes, but now we have
to be focused on the
next three months.

87
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,744
We have to get to Koren,

88
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,704
the provincial
capital in that time.

89
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,122
So now that we're on the road,

90
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,875
we have to think of our work
as having already begun.

91
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,544
- That's right,
taking office safely

92
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,464
is also one of your
responsibilities as a governor.

93
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,924
- But normally it
should only take

94
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,093
a month and a half
to reach Koren City.

95
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,761
Of course, we don't
know when pursuers

96
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,097
from the Sa clan will show up.

97
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,057
What happens if as
a result of that

98
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,184
they don't reach their post
within the three months?

99
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,812
- They'll be regarded as
having abandoned their posts,

100
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,022
and will be automatically
stripped of their positions.

101
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,440
- That's awful!

102
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,983
- Look at it this way,

103
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,778
all the more reason to get to
Koren as quickly as we can.

104
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,739
- All right, that's
the spirit Princess!

105
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,615
Yah! Yah!

106
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,994
(horses whinny)

107
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,210
- Come to think of it,

108
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,879
this is probably your first
time camping outside, isn't it?

109
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,464
- Yes it is, but considering

110
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,924
how dangerous our
road is gonna be,

111
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,676
we don't really have a
choice in the matter.

112
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,094
Besides, it certainly
doesn't hurt

113
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,179
to be frugal once in a while.

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,724
- My lady, the water
has come to a boil.

115
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,600
- Thank you very much Seiran!

116
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
(utensils clinking)

117
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,688
- I can take care of this.

118
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,941
Please, why don't you relax
and get some rest Lady Shurei?

119
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,651
- Oh, uh, thank you.

120
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,822
- Lady Shurei, I didn't
get the chance earlier

121
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,492
to say thank you, for
allowing me accompany you.

122
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,668
- [Lord Koyu] The person
who poisoned you was Korin.

123
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,260
- Korin!

124
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,305
(groans)

125
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,223
(striking sound)

126
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,601
(yelling)

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,229
(groans in pain)

128
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,066
(striking sound)

129
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,983
Ugh!

130
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:22,901
Ahhh!

131
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,780
(yelling)

132
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,659
- Ugh, that's just great.

133
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,661
If this is how it is on day one,

134
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,288
I hate to think
about what's ahead.

135
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,834
Here you go Princess, a present.

136
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,002
- Thank you!

137
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,253
This will really
help with dinner.

138
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,175
- How did things go
with the men chasing us?

139
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,552
- They were a bit rowdy
but I took care of 'em.

140
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,680
I think we should be
okay for the time being.

141
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,098
- So they came as expected?

142
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,182
- Yeah, of course.

143
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,935
After all, having the
new governors arrive

144
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,353
would cause problems

145
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,855
for those guys, it's gonna
get tough from here on,

146
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,691
Mr. Special Officer.

147
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:07,654
- Oh, to keep her ladyship
safe, I'll do whatever it takes.

148
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,700
(peaceful acoustic music)

149
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,725
- It's been a month
since we left Kiyo,

150
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,394
we haven't coming into
town like this for a while.

151
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,687
- That's certainly true.

152
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,022
- Since we have the opportunity,

153
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,107
why don't we stop
and rest somewhere?

154
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,400
- Sure, let's do that.

155
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,152
After all it doesn't
seem the Sa Clan

156
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,195
sent anyone to this town.

157
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,113
- [Arlamist] A kidnapper!

158
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,074
- A kidnapper!

159
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:53,908
Stop right there!
- Hey, wait!

160
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,076
- [Alarmist] Catch him!

161
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,287
He's going that way!
- C'mon catch the guy!

162
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,204
- [Ensei] Wait!

163
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,290
(footfalls on stone)

164
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,917
(all sigh deeply)

165
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,252
You've got it all wrong,

166
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,754
this is just a big
misunderstanding!

167
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,048
- It's really all
a mistake, honest!

168
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,007
- Oh, Ensei!

169
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,175
- That idiot!

170
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,844
- Wait Korin, what
are you doing?!

171
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,096
- Father, what on
Earth is the matter?

172
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,639
- Huh?

173
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,350
- This is your father?

174
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,934
- That right, he's my father!

175
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,187
And the boy he's carrying
is my younger brother!

176
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,314
What is it that
you want with them?

177
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,732
- Oh, oh, is that so?

178
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,650
We thought it was a
kidnapping, sorry.

179
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,986
(foot steps)

180
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,283
(relieved sighs)

181
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,242
(horses hooves clopping)

182
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
- I was worried about how things

183
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,746
were gonna turn out back there.

184
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,331
- I'd like to know
just how you managed

185
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,292
to be mistaken for
a kidnapper, Ensei?

186
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,087
- I'm sorry, it was
actually all my fault!

187
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,756
I was in a used bookstore

188
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,257
when I found some books
on medicinal herbs

189
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,051
I'd never seen before.

190
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,969
Since they were all
on an upper shelf--

191
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,930
- [Ensei] I figured it would
be difficult for him to see,

192
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,474
so I gave him a lift,
and when I did...

193
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,392
- A kidnapper!!

194
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,435
- [Ensei And Eigetsu] Uh!

195
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,812
- But it worked out.

196
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,230
Of course, it was
thanks to Miss Korin

197
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,439
that we got out of it.

198
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,982
- That's very true.

199
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,401
Thank you for helping, Korin.

200
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,986
I'm really glad you
offered to come with us.

201
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,949
- No, you're too kind.

202
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,368
- But still, I was really
impressed back there,

203
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,121
coming up with an idea like
that on the spot is amazing!

204
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,789
- It's because you
took it on yourself

205
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,167
to do the unnecessary, you could
show a bit more repentance!

206
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,294
- Geez, I'm really sorry!

207
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,587
- Now then, see?

208
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,465
Eigetsu has apologized,
so go easy on him, okay?

209
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,803
- If you say so Lady Shurei.

210
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,306
(Korin sighs)

211
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,392
- Excuse me, would
it be possible

212
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,769
to stop the carriage
somewhere for a moment?

213
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,149
Here, Miss Korin,
take one of these.

214
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,275
- What's this pill?

215
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,193
It looks suspicious.

216
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,279
- It looks like you
got a bit of a fever,

217
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,405
that pill should help.

218
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,743
We've been camping
outside all the time,

219
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,078
so it's no wonder you're
getting a little weak.

220
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,749
- Oh no, this is quite a fever.

221
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,501
Korin, why didn't you say
something to us sooner?

222
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,420
- Don't worry it's
nothing serious,

223
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,380
I don't wanna be a bother.

224
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,382
- Sorry that won't
do, Miss Korin.

225
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,134
If you start feeling
weak or feverish,

226
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,802
you gotta tell us, right away.

227
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,512
If you push yourself
too hard and get worse,

228
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,222
you'd become a
huge burden on us.

229
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,892
- You're right, I'm very sorry.

230
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,769
- Still you're the
one who's feeling ill

231
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,937
and suffering the most
at the moment, right?

232
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,023
Now, please take it.

233
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,316
(Horse neighs)

234
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,902
- Seiran, where are you going?

235
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,905
- It's best if I go on ahead
a little and check things out.

236
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,948
If I remember correctly
the town of Sakyuo

237
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,992
should be at the base
of this mountain.

238
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,455
- Wow, Seiran is pretty
cool, don't you agree?

239
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,791
- Yes he is, he's very different

240
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,210
from a slightly
bone-headed fool like you.

241
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,423
- That's for sure!

242
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,841
- This is bitter!

243
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,469
- Oh, oh dear, I'm
sorry about that!

244
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,055
- We had better get a room
in town for the night.

245
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,976
(harp strumming)

246
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,943
(indistinct chattering)

247
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,952
- Eigetsu, I'll take
over for a while.

248
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,246
After all, you
need some rest too.

249
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,706
- In that case, here,

250
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,209
you should have Korin take
it as soon as she wakes up.

251
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,377
- Sure, I'll do that.

252
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,215
- Mhhm...

253
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,509
- [Shurei] I'm sorry
did I wake you?

254
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,677
- Lady Shurei!

255
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,764
- No, Korin, you
need to rest more.

256
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,184
- Please forgive
me, Lady Shurei.

257
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,563
- Don't worry about it a bit,
it's not your fault at all.

258
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,106
On the contrary,

259
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,109
it's my fault for deciding to
camp outside all this time,

260
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,444
I'm so sorry.

261
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,320
- No, not at all,
you're mistaken!

262
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,322
- In any case get some rest.

263
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,616
Right now, the only thing you
should be concentrating on

264
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,618
is getting better.

265
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,536
- I am very sorry.

266
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,166
- Just get better
quickly, Korin.

267
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,589
(Korin gasps)

268
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,007
- I'm so sorry.

269
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,801
- You don't need to
apologize so much.

270
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,386
- [Korin] It's not just that.

271
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,057
I have no right to be treated
so well by you of all people.

272
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,308
- What are you talking about?

273
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,310
- There's something
I must apologize for,

274
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:33,480
something I should have
apologized for a long time ago.

275
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,607
It's about what
happened one year ago.

276
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,070
Everything was my
doing Lady Shurei.

277
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,166
- So, my lady, is Korin
feeling any better?

278
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,127
- Huh? A little.

279
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,130
The stress from this
trip is taking its toll.

280
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,507
Where's Ensei?

281
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,301
(shouts in battle sounds)

282
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,260
- Damn it!

283
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,221
(striking sounds)

284
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,848
(yelling)

285
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,808
- [Seiran] He said
he was going out

286
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,268
to see how things were in town,

287
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,729
maybe he's been mistaken
for a kidnapper again?

288
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,566
- Seiran, that's not very
funny and you know it.

289
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,194
But it's because of that
shaggy beard of his, isn't it?

290
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,363
That's why I keep telling
him to shave it off.

291
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,407
- I personally think
it's come in useful,

292
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,741
I don't think we would
have made it this far

293
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,576
without anyone figuring
out who we really were

294
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,371
if Ensei didn't have
that strange appearance.

295
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,581
No one would ever
guess he's an official.

296
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm afraid that no
matter how hard I tried,

297
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,751
I could never grow a beard

298
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,212
that would make me look
nearly as suspicious.

299
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,506
- Seiran with a
mustache or beard?

300
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,554
Mmhmh, but still,
it's not fair for us

301
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,098
to impose on Ensei
like this all the time.

302
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,726
- That's very kind my lady,
but he's your assistant.

303
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,395
Being imposed on is part
of his job description.

304
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,898
Besides, he doesn't think of
it as an imposition at all.

305
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,774
- I see.

306
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,402
(tea pouring)

307
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,237
- [Seiran] And, of
course, neither do I.

308
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,865
- [Shurei] That's always been
the case, since long ago.

309
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,324
But now that you mention it,

310
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,285
maybe I should say
that I'm sorry.

311
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,664
- There's nothing
to worry about,

312
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,667
it all gets written off by a
single cup of tea made by you.

313
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,796
- Come to think of it,

314
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,673
the tea in this area is
very sweet, isn't it?

315
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,801
I believe it's call Ganlu tea.

316
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,554
- It's the first
time I've ever had

317
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,181
such a wonderfully sweet tea.

318
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,266
It's not heavy and
it's very delicious.

319
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,809
Hmm.
- Huh?

320
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,145
- It's actually not your
first time, my lady.

321
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,272
We've had it in the past
when we came by this way,

322
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,442
and even as a child you
liked this tea very much.

323
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,485
- You're kidding!

324
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,694
- [Seiran] It's true.

325
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,987
- Hmmm.

326
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,280
- [Seiran] When you were
two or three years old,

327
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,448
you wanted it even
more than food,

328
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,158
and would insist on having it.

329
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,409
- You know, come to think of it,

330
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,828
we actually met you in
Sa Province, didn't we?

331
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,498
I remember father telling
me about it before.

332
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,458
- Hm?

333
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,334
- Hm.

334
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,545
By the way Seiran, I didn't
get the chance to tell you

335
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,340
that I'm really happy
you came with us.

336
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,842
- Well, I'm the special guard
assigned to you and Eigetsu.

337
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,303
It's only natural that I
come along on the journey.

338
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,349
- Oh, of course that's true,
but that's not what I meant.

339
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,352
As part of becoming an official,

340
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,521
I thought I'd prepared
myself for the reality.

341
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,314
That'd I be sent
out to any region,

342
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,692
or any post,
completely by myself.

343
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,821
But your life is
your own, Seiran,

344
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,657
in truth, you could choose
any path that you wanted.

345
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,950
You were totally free,

346
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,911
but even so His Majesty
bestowed a sword on you.

347
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:39,332
And you still stayed by my
side, I'm so happy about that.

348
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,210
I don't know what happened to
you in the past in Sa Province

349
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,671
and if you don't wanna
talk about it I won't ask.

350
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,841
(footsteps)

351
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,844
But please remember, just as
you always take care of me,

352
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,595
I'm always watching out for you

353
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,264
and wanting to take care of you.

354
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,557
So for starters,

355
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,892
don't restrain your true
feelings because of me.

356
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,603
I promise, it's okay to
look gloomy sometimes

357
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,939
and show me that you're
worried about something.

358
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,611
- It's not that I don't wanna
go to Sa Province, my lady.

359
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,282
After all, it's the place
where I met Master Shoka,

360
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,783
Madam Shokun and you.

361
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,452
That's a very good memory.

362
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,454
It's just that things
are complicated,

363
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,040
and I haven't finished
sorting out all of my feelings

364
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,374
about what happened in the past.

365
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,834
So, yes, at times I might end up

366
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,253
looking a little
thoughtful and depressed,

367
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,714
times like that there is
something you can do for me.

368
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,382
Could you make more
of this Ganlu tea

369
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,967
and have some of it with me?

370
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,677
- That's all you want me to do?

371
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,555
- Yes my lady.

372
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,432
- Alright then, in that case,

373
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,392
I need to buy lots of Ganlu tea.

374
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,394
- It's quite expensive.

375
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,813
- Oh silly, if that's price
of making you feel better

376
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,316
then it's the cheapest
thing in the world.

377
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,277
- And so, how much longer
do intend on standing there

378
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,945
and eavesdropping, Ensei?

379
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,323
Hi there, I'm back!
- I'm sorry!

380
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,575
- Yeah, sorry, it was
such a touching scene

381
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,993
that I thought it would
be rude to interrupt.

382
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,536
- Same here.

383
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,040
- Welcome back Ensei, would
the two of you like some tea?

384
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,792
Yeah.
- Yes, please!

385
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,044
- You know Seiran, I
can't help but notice

386
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,587
that you're really very
kind when it's just you

387
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,381
and the Princess alone together.

388
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,299
The only time you
seem to have a nice

389
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,634
and polite personalty
is when you're

390
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,427
with Princess or Mr. Shoka.

391
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,720
Ah, I know just the thing.

392
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,055
I'll also make
you some Ganlu tea

393
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,848
and have it with you, okay?

394
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,559
- You would be unwanted
company, idiot!

395
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,852
- [Ensei] Aw, that's
so mean of you,

396
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,354
I just wanted to support--
- That's right.

397
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,939
Ensei knew Seiran before he
came to live with us, didn't he?

398
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,524
- I'd rather become
friends with--

399
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,733
- [Shurei Voiceover] Could
it be that Sa Province

400
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,610
is also the place
where these two met?

401
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,781
- [Ensei] Now then,
we've had breakfast

402
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,366
so let's get started.

403
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,951
Sairi is just beyond Sakyuo,

404
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,619
once we slip past the
border guard there,

405
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,039
we'll be in Sa Province at
last, so we're almost there.

406
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,333
- We're gonna slip past
the boarder station?

407
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,793
- That's right, it's risky,

408
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,461
and we'll encounter
criticism later

409
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,130
if we avoid going through
the border office,

410
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,965
but it's our best bet.

411
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,466
- It seems taking office

412
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,552
really is quite a
difficult burden, isn't it?

413
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,887
- [Ensei] Well, that's
because Sa Province is unique.

414
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,349
- By the way, how old were
you when you became governor,

415
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,851
Mr. Ensei?

416
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,437
- Uh, well let's see, it's been
exactly ten years since then

417
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,648
so, I'd have been seventeen
years old, same as Princess now.

418
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,524
Seventeen!
- Seventeen!

419
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,026
- Yep, sweet seventeen!

420
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,944
- That might be so,
but the fact remains

421
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,654
that you're probably the
only one who's been governor

422
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,824
of the same province for almost
ten years without promotion.

423
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,784
- [Ensei] I was
simply forgotten about

424
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,369
by the central government
during the struggle

425
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,746
for the throne.

426
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,165
- Considering that Sa Province
is plagued by problems,

427
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,834
how were you able to keep
things control long enough

428
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,669
for the court to
forget about you?

429
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,047
- Now that you mention it,
that is a very good point.

430
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,007
- You're really
something, Mr. Ensei!

431
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,094
- Well, let's get back
to the subject, shall we?

432
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,847
We still have to plan out
the journey from here on.

433
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,682
To put it simply,
at our current pace

434
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,809
it should take about one month
to get from here to Koren,

435
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,478
the capital of Sa Province.

436
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,520
But first of all we have to deal

437
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,813
with the boarder guard at Sairi,

438
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,732
which is coming up on us fast.

439
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,651
- [Seiran] What rumors
have you heard in Sakyo?

440
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,403
- [Ensei] At Sairi's
boarder guard station,

441
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,197
all young men of around
twelve or thirteen,

442
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,449
and young women of around
sixteen or seventeen

443
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,742
are being temporarily confined

444
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,410
if they come from Shi Province.

445
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,162
(princess sighs)

446
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,705
There's no doubt about it,

447
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,791
it's the actions of those
idiots in the Sa Clan.

448
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,167
Once these visitors
are confined,

449
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,669
they're supposed to remain

450
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,129
in the custody of the guard
station until the summer passes.

451
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:16,049
- In other words, until the end
of our window to reach Koren

452
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,592
and take office, right?

453
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,594
- Maybe we should
split up after all.

454
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,555
- Doesn't look like we
have a choice, does it?

455
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,600
After all, I'm pretty famous
and well known in Sa Province.

456
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,228
If I were seen with
Princess and everyone else,

457
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,646
I would practically
be announcing

458
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:30,939
that these two are
the new governors.

459
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,441
The risk of being discovered
would be too high.

460
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,444
Well, we can go over the little
details of the plan later,

461
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,114
but first we'll review the most
important point to remember.

462
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,826
It's this, the place to
aim for right now is here,

463
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,035
just below the capital.

464
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,620
The merchant center of Kinka.

465
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,247
You two have memorized
the map, right?

466
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,790
- Mhm.

467
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,584
- Nothing can begin until the
two of you reach that city.

468
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,212
Regardless of what might
happen; Princess, Eigetsu,

469
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,715
it's crucial you arrive
there, understand?

470
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,216
This is an absolute must.

471
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,469
- Ensei, I can't say I'm getting
a particularly good feeling

472
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,138
from this big speech of yours.

473
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,557
- I feel the same way.

474
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,102
(blankets and sheets rustling)

475
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,020
- Korin!

476
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,773
- Lady Shurei, oh
no, I'm so sorry.

477
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,151
It looks like I slept
in an awfully long time.

478
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,486
- Hm, your face is
still a bit flushed,

479
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,780
I think you need
to rest some more.

480
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,825
- [Korin] No, thanks to you
I'm feeling much better now.

481
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,495
- Korin!

482
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,914
- I know what I've done is
completely unforgivable,

483
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,499
but even so,

484
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,626
I'm begging you to please
let me remain by your side

485
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:34,794
and help you.

486
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,171
Even if it means my life,

487
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,673
I intend to protect
you Lady Shurei.

488
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,093
(Shurei sighs)

489
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,095
- Korin...

490
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,933
To tell the truth I'd already
heard about everything

491
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,019
from Lord Koyu
before we departed.

492
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,897
- Then why on Earth
did you permit me

493
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,607
to accompany you
on this journey?

494
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,903
- Because despite
that, no matter what,

495
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,863
I still really like you Korin!

496
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,909
- Oh, oh Lady Shurei!

497
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,621
- Thank you for
talking to me about it.

498
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,998
- Lady Shurei!

499
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,876
- Once I've reached Koren City

500
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,712
and formally taken office
as a provincial governor,

501
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,674
please stay by my side, okay?

502
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,175
- Yes, ma'am!

503
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,011
I promise right here and now
I'll keep you from harm's way,

504
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,013
even if it means my life.

505
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,306
(Shurei chuckles)

506
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,974
That's sweet, but please
don't waste your life

507
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,101
on me like that.

508
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,271
Like they always say: Where
there's life there's hope!

509
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,023
So remember that, okay?

510
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:39,734
- Lady Shurei.

511
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,238
(footsteps)

512
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,197
Huh!
- Huh!

513
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,241
- What's the matter?

514
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:50,870
(foreboding, nervous music)

515
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,414
- What's going on?

516
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:55,208
- Please remain quiet, Eigetsu
I'll leave her in your hands.

517
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,167
- [Eigetsu] Right!

518
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,045
- Just what is going on?

519
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,839
- [Ensei] Hey
Princess, hold this.

520
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,715
- What?

521
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,382
(soft kicking sound)

522
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,216
Ow!

523
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,884
Ow, Ow!

524
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,177
Owww!

525
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,345
Do I look like a
piece of luggage?

526
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,182
Ensei?!

527
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,892
- [Seiran] Remain
silent my lady,

528
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,894
from this moment on you
mustn't say another word

529
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,354
until it's safe to do so.

530
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:20,275
- Hey, don't forget Princess,
you are the governor

531
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,028
and the lady of the direct
line of the Hong Clan,

532
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,654
you gotta depend on that.

533
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,197
- Ensei...

534
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,908
- No matter what happens, you
are to make your way to Kinka,

535
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,201
have you got that?

536
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,996
(door clanks open)

537
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,290
- We're from the
boarder office of Sairi!

538
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,332
Do not move!

539
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,045
(dramatic music)

540
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:50,930
(singing in foreign language)

541
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,461
- [Shurei] Sa Province
was right before my eyes

542
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,839
when I suddenly ended
up all on my own.

543
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,257
This isn't good!

544
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,300
AS I was thinking about how
to make my way to Kinka,

545
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:13,930
I ran into a man, a mysterious
and suspicious lady killer.
