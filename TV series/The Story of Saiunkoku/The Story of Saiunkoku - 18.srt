1
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,640
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

2
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,479
- [Shi Ryuuki] This
is an emergency.

3
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,730
Half the town's functions
have come to a halt

4
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,941
because of the Hong
Clan ceasing all work.

5
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,859
- Even for the Hong Clan,
there are some things

6
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,361
that are simply not acceptable.

7
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,822
- What exactly caused
all this Your Majesty?

8
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,616
- We believe the original
cause is quite obvious.

9
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,910
As you know, Senior Secretary
Hong of the Department

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,662
of Civil Affairs was arrested.

11
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,831
- That was because
Secretary Hong is suspected

12
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,333
of interfering with Initiate
Shurei Hong's national exam.

13
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,876
- [Shi Ryuuki] The Hong
Clan is a proud family

14
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,212
and equal to the Ran
Clan in nobility.

15
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,840
If you arrest the leader of
their family, especially without

16
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,552
evidence, that would naturally
enrage any prideful clan.

17
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,470
Not to mention
Secretary Hong himself.

18
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,847
(chattering)

19
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,932
- Secretary Hong is the
leader of the Hong Family?

20
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,976
- The leader of one of
the seven elite families

21
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,686
within Central Administration?

22
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:25,937
- Hmm.

23
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,731
- It's surprising how
many Senior Officials

24
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,357
were unaware of
this information.

25
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,235
- It was about fourteen
or fifteen years ago.

26
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,863
That was when he
took over the Clan.

27
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,322
- It can't be.

28
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,532
He's the leader?

29
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,408
(rattling)

30
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,787
(ominous music)

31
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,582
- Hey, where's Shurei?

32
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,251
- Seiran is with her,
don't worry about it.

33
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,337
(ominous music)

34
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,800
(water splashes)

35
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,890
- My Lady, before we go out.

36
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,391
Here.

37
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,017
(gasps)

38
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,395
Miss Kocho asked me to
bring it from the residence

39
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,772
when I was there last night.

40
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,440
She also said she
had to go elsewhere

41
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,733
this morning and apologized

42
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,568
for not being able
to see you off.

43
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,736
(gentle music)

44
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,404
- Hmm.

45
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,281
Miss Kocho gave this
to me a while back

46
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,574
during the final exam.

47
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,035
(gentle music)

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,874
(paper rustles)

49
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,422
- [Miss Kocho] Makeup is
the warpaint of a woman.

50
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,924
Whenever you find
yourself headed

51
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,967
into battle, make
sure you wear it.

52
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,388
That way you'll be certain
that you'll never cry.

53
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,764
- Hmm.

54
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,307
- [Miss Kocho] If you
cry, your makeup will run.

55
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,975
And no matter how
little you apply

56
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,728
your face will end up
looking disgraceful.

57
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,605
That's why no matter
how difficult things get

58
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,982
you'll keep yourself
from crying.

59
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,527
- Though Miss Kocho
was thoughtful enough
to give me this.

60
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,738
I couldn't bring myself to
wear makeup in the Palace.

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,949
Because the world of
politics is so male-dominated

62
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,369
I thought is wasn't necessary.

63
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,370
- My Lady.

64
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,622
- But I see I was wrong.

65
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,624
It doesn't matter whether
or not I wear makeup.

66
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,626
It's not gonna change
who I really am.

67
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,003
And besides, it's
impossible for me

68
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,962
to become the same as a man.

69
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,630
(chuckles)

70
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,466
I never had any intention of
trying to become one anyway.

71
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,427
Thank you Miss Kocho.

72
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,430
(mysterious music)

73
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,015
I'm gonna wear makeup today.

74
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,891
Seiran, I know you told me
I could always come to you

75
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,353
if I wanted to cry,
but I'm not gonna cry.

76
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,813
- Very well My Lady.

77
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,024
In that case since you
deprived me of that pleasure,

78
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,442
I'll just have to support you

79
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,402
so that you'll never
feel the need to cry.

80
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,487
- Oh Seiran, how is it
that you always seem

81
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,365
to know exactly what kind of
words I want to hear, huh?

82
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,076
(chuckles)

83
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,578
- [Seiran] Hey, you
better get ready.

84
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,663
We should get going shortly.

85
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,915
- The accusation is that
Senior Secretary Hong

86
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,710
altered illegally the
results of the exam taken

87
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,004
by Initiate Hong
who he sponsored.

88
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,840
Secretary Sai of the
Department of Protocol.

89
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,926
We understand you were
completely against women

90
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,845
taking the national exams
right from the beginning.

91
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,472
- Is that a crime?

92
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,098
Most people were against it.

93
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,975
If you're going to make
failed accusations.

94
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,061
Official Ryo would be
far more suspicious.

95
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,521
Well he's been treating
Initiate Hong very harshly.

96
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,733
I'm sure he's also got some
grudge against Secretary Hong.

97
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,526
Official Ryo never
had any objections

98
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,487
against female Officials

99
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,530
and not only does
he not bear a grudge

100
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,698
against Secretary Hong,

101
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,784
he's a favorite of
the Senior Secretary.

102
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,077
(whimpers)

103
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,037
- [Shi Ryuuki] Moreover,
you knew beyond a doubt

104
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,705
that your subordinates
were treating some

105
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,956
of the Initiates unfairly

106
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,584
and yet you still did
nothing to stop them?

107
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,504
- But I've heard this sort
of thing always happens.

108
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,964
- Yes, it does always happen.

109
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,092
Because Official Ryo
pays special attention

110
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,760
to outstanding Initiates.

111
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,804
(gasps)

112
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,560
- You showed absolutely
no mercy towards me back

113
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,437
when I was an Initiate.

114
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,731
I'd even say you
completely humbled me.

115
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,733
- I somehow doubt
your pride is fragile

116
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,276
enough for you to be humbled.

117
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,530
Now Secretary Hong, how long
do you plan on spending here?

118
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,990
- Official Ryo, why don't
you stay and have some tea?

119
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,034
- No, please hurry and
make your way to Court.

120
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,787
I only came because you said
you'd go if I went with you.

121
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,497
Do you know how bad things are?

122
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,165
Both inside and
outside the Palace?

123
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,126
- Can't say I
particularly care much.

124
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,669
For starters, it's a good lesson

125
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,587
for that young whelp
sitting on our throne.

126
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,131
He needs to learn more
about the hardships of life

127
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,591
and about not getting his way.

128
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,468
- Well I imagine you
would be the last person

129
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,679
he'd ever want to hear
that kind of talk from.

130
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,888
- Please have a seat.

131
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,724
After all I so
rarely get the chance

132
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,727
to spend time talking
with you in this manner.

133
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,644
And have some tea.

134
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,188
I swear it hasn't been poisoned.

135
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,773
(sighs)

136
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,109
(footsteps)

137
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,737
- As a matter of
fact I did seriously

138
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,489
contemplate eliminating
you a number of times.

139
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,951
After you ordered me to work
in the royal stables of course.

140
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,161
- [Official Ryo]
I'm not surprised.

141
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,204
I remember sensing
danger to my life then.

142
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,624
- I'm glad I didn't
go through with it.

143
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,127
Your true intentions
became apparent afterwards.

144
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,629
Eigetsu Tou is very
young and has no backing.

145
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,965
Shurei is not only
young but also female.

146
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,217
It was clear from the
start that they'd both

147
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,178
be looked down on by
Officials and that certain

148
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,180
people in the Court
would try to crush them.

149
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,057
Your strict guidance
and stern treatment

150
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,934
builds confidence in one's
self, as well as resistance

151
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,103
to the corrupting
influence of the Court.

152
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,105
Then by demonstrating
just how capable

153
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,732
the Initiates really are,

154
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,942
you make certain they're
no longer looked down upon.

155
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,236
Giving Initiates menial
jobs like cleaning toilets

156
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,655
and polishing shoes
are ideal for observing

157
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,532
what Officials are truly like.

158
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,534
(chuckles)

159
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,994
The highest Senior
Court Officials

160
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,121
base their decisions on how
capable the Initiates are.

161
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,581
They decide that based on how

162
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,041
much work you've
been giving them.

163
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,834
- [Official Ryo] You're
giving me too much credit.

164
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,795
- Not at all. All you
need to do is talk to

165
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,338
Kijin or myself and
we'd promote you

166
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,964
to any position you'd like.

167
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,550
- I don't want any other
position than this.

168
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,177
Many years ago the
previous King himself

169
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,762
bowed his head to me.

170
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,889
He said then that someone
like me was necessary

171
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,265
for the Court to exist.

172
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,851
And now once more,
his son was willing to

173
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,561
extend the same favor and trust

174
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,022
and said he would
leave everything to me.

175
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,567
This year I'm filled with very
high hopes for the future.

176
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,569
The young recruits all
understand the spirit

177
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,321
of helping each other
and their country.

178
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,989
From here on with their support

179
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,241
and assistance in
the Royal Court,

180
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,326
I have no doubt the
current King's rule

181
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,245
will be truly secure
and productive.

182
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,707
He's been quite fortunate
right from the very beginning.

183
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,916
(sips)

184
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,876
- In my opinion he's
very fortunate because

185
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,878
he has someone like
you around to help out.

186
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,714
I have to admit I
practically flipped

187
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,923
when I learned that
you were the one

188
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,133
secretly bringing
them stuff like

189
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,218
sweets, meat buns,
and tea every day.

190
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,845
Very sneaky of you.

191
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,973
It appears that practice
hasn't changed, even now.

192
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,182
- [Official Ryo]
I seem to remember

193
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,308
you being in quite the
snit about it saying

194
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,853
"What's with this
pathetic sweet pea bun?"

195
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,271
- Yes, but I still ate it.

196
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,233
You know, you
never say anything.

197
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,609
From my point of view,

198
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,069
your life is one
where you always get

199
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,612
the short end of the stick.

200
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,239
- Would you kindly
mind your own business?

201
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,283
- I hear his Majesty
intends to reward you

202
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,702
for your many years of service.

203
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,619
- Huh?

204
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,871
- From now on, I hope that you

205
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,831
will always attend
Court by my side.

206
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,207
Won't you?

207
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,375
- I'm quite satisfied
with my current situation.

208
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,002
Thank you.

209
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,378
- If you don't go with me,
then I won't go either.

210
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,214
Knowing you, if that
resulted in all work

211
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,425
outside the castle
walls coming to a halt,

212
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,302
it would bother your
conscience like hell

213
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,220
and you would feel responsible.

214
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,765
- Uh, are you trying
to blackmail me?

215
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,725
- Are you that dead
set against it?

216
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,226
Certainly your skills in loyalty

217
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,812
would be wasted on his Majesty.

218
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,189
Ah, I know!

219
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,107
Why don't you be a steward
for my household then?

220
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,942
Perfect, that's great!

221
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,153
- Hmm, very well.

222
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,821
I'll attend Court with you.

223
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,864
- Oh I see.

224
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,740
Oh well.

225
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,783
That's too bad.

226
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:40,330
So in that case, let's
be off as I promised.

227
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,957
(grunting)

228
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,334
(shouting)

229
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,960
- This is just like Ryuuki said.

230
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,170
It doesn't look like they're

231
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,797
gonna make it easy
for me does it?

232
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,006
- Are you all right?

233
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,257
- You bet! They're
solely mistaken

234
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,259
if they think these
guys are gonna stop me.

235
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,011
(footsteps)

236
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,221
- [Crowd] Come back here!

237
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,181
- Now then, onto a
different subject.

238
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,850
Senior Secretary Ko.

239
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,977
- Since a few years ago,

240
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,938
the Department of
Protocol has continually

241
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,107
requested annual
increases to their budget.

242
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,109
However I could not imagine why.

243
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,277
So after conducting
a complete audit.

244
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,405
We have found that
rather then unnecessary

245
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,156
or unwise expenditures,

246
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,243
an excessive number of odd
items are being purchased.

247
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,370
In addition every
year as a service

248
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,330
to those who pass
the national exams,

249
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,708
couriers are sent to
notify their home towns

250
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,376
of the good news.

251
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,836
- [Official] Is there
a problem with that?

252
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,838
- Yes, this year for instance,

253
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,798
Eigetsu Tou sent
his entire stipend

254
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,843
of 80 silver coins
by the Department of
Protocol's courier.

255
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,886
But not a single coin
arrived at his home town.

256
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,847
- What does he mean by that?

257
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,932
- A number of similar
incidences have been reported

258
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,809
over the past several
years as well.

259
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,186
(audience chattering)

260
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,272
So this year after the
Department of Protocol

261
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,732
sent out it's couriers,

262
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,400
we had them secretly followed.

263
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,153
Now whose residence do
you think they went to

264
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,947
with that money still
in their breast pockets?

265
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,157
- Oh, That's a lie!

266
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,242
- But I haven't even
mentioned any names yet.

267
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,578
- Well then.

268
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,039
I'll have my own say on
matters as well, Secretary Ko.

269
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,874
What is the meaning
of that mask you wear?

270
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,167
And how can we accept that a man

271
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,752
who can't even show his own face

272
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,420
somehow rose to the top ranks?

273
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,422
- Huh?

274
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,965
- Hmm.

275
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,885
- You could in fact be some
unknown man wearing that mask.

276
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,054
Pretending to be the
real Secretary Ko.

277
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,889
If you truly don't
have anything to hide

278
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,766
then take that mask
off immediately

279
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,392
and show your face to us.

280
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,310
(sighs)

281
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,895
This development is something

282
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,814
you'd expect more from some
second rate fiction novel.

283
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,859
But, very well, if you
insist then I'll take it off.

284
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:33,526
- No!

285
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,402
Please don't do it!

286
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,403
I beg you.

287
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,446
I mustn't betray
my wife anymore!

288
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,031
- Please Senior Secretary don't!

289
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,408
Don't disturb my peaceful
life any further.

290
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,910
- Huh, what's this?

291
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,079
Is Secretary Ko's
face that ugly?

292
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,248
- Lord Reishin says his face
is one that would cause crows

293
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,084
to fall from the
sky unconscious.

294
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,336
- I know it may be
unconvincing coming from me

295
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,254
but looks don't
actually make the man.

296
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,091
- (wheezing laugh)

297
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,051
If he's insisting
to that extent,

298
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,803
then why not take that mask off?

299
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,305
However, everyone else
must turn their backs

300
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,141
and you're only to
show Secretary Sai.

301
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,226
- Can I look too?

302
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,102
- You mustn't!

303
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,144
- Hmm?

304
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,312
(whimpers)

305
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,730
- Those of you who don't know

306
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,943
what Secretary Ko's face
looks like, don't get curious.

307
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,945
If you look you'll be
distracted from work

308
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,196
for three years at best.

309
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,949
If you're unlucky
you'll lose your senses.

310
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,368
- Who does this old
fox think he is?

311
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,244
Now then.

312
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,830
(whimpering)

313
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,002
(crowd jeering)

314
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,963
- My Lady let's stop and take
care of these guys already.

315
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,506
- No if we fight here,
we'll cause trouble

316
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,841
for everyone else.

317
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,012
- That's Miss Shurei!

318
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,972
(panting)

319
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,890
- [Crowd] Keep running!

320
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,401
- This will only take a moment.

321
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,902
- Oh you gonna fight!

322
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,196
(screaming)

323
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,909
(crashing)

324
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,664
(tense music)

325
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,374
- Let's hurry My Lady.

326
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,417
- Right.

327
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,045
(tense music)

328
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,967
- This way!

329
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:21,634
(panting)

330
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,011
- Aah!

331
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,056
(malicious laughter)

332
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,516
(crowd jeers)

333
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,942
- Oh no!

334
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,569
- Don't worry Miss Shurei!

335
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,196
- Ayushin.

336
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,406
(rattling)

337
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,704
- Whoa, what's with them?

338
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,206
- You have a lot
of nerve treating

339
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,415
our Miss Shurei like this.

340
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,042
We're not gonna let
you get away with it.

341
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,502
(crowd jeers)

342
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,379
- I'm very sorry about how
we acted towards you lately

343
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,923
but Officials are
really important people.

344
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,925
So if you hung around
poor villagers like us

345
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,343
we thought you'd be made fun of

346
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,053
and end up shamed because of us.

347
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,429
We didn't want that for you.

348
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,932
(jolly music)

349
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,641
- Hmm.

350
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,143
- You'd better get going.

351
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,520
You're in a hurry aren't you?

352
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,230
- We'll take care
of things here.

353
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,690
Go on!

354
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,941
- Let's go.

355
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,067
- Yeah.

356
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:19,734
(footsteps)

357
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,652
- (laughs)

358
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,444
You're not going anywhere.

359
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,320
(yelling)

360
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,072
(crashing)

361
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,074
- Thank you Ayushin.

362
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,534
Thank you everyone.

363
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,161
(jolly music)

364
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,374
- Halt!

365
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,250
- Huh?

366
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,501
- This isn't a place

367
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,044
that people like you
are permitted to enter.

368
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,379
Turn around and leave.

369
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,672
- But I'm an official Initiate.

370
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,090
I have a right to enter!

371
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,425
- Don't know you.

372
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,051
- I have to be at
the Court by noon!

373
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,428
You have got to let me in.

374
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,929
Stand aside right now.

375
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,433
- My Lady, I think our best bet
is to fight our way through.

376
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,434
Huh?

377
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,560
(doors rattling)

378
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,395
(gasps)

379
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,105
- Hello, Initiate Heki.

380
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,106
(jolly music)

381
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,482
- [Miss Shurei] Hakumei!

382
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,317
- I figured something
like this would happen

383
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,986
so I came out here to meet you.

384
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,320
Your family is noble but poor.

385
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,613
Mine is of a higher status

386
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,657
so lots of Officials
are soft on me.

387
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,034
I'll escort you in.

388
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:09,784
Hurry!

389
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,661
- Uh, thanks very much.

390
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,288
Let's go, Seiran.

391
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,456
- Yes.

392
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,125
(jolly music)

393
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,054
(prestigious music)

394
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,559
- If you please, Secretary Ko.

395
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,646
(prestigious music)

396
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,530
(gasps)

397
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,534
(whimpers)

398
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,541
(gasps)

399
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,711
- Are you quite satisfied
now, Senior Secretary Sai?

400
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,130
(whimpers)

401
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,800
- It's just as expected.

402
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,385
There's no way he'd be able

403
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,388
to keep his senses after
seeing Hoju's utter beauty.

404
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,514
I can't help but pity him,

405
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,099
even though it's Secretary Sai.

406
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,142
(sighs)

407
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,645
- You're the person
who attempted

408
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,272
to entrap Initiate Hong and
Reishin Hong are you not?

409
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,482
- Uh huh.

410
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,401
- You have also
embezzled public funds,

411
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,194
spent money recklessly on bribes

412
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,737
to pave your way to promotions

413
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,656
and even tried to
blame your wrongdoings

414
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,241
on Official Ryo, haven't you?

415
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,742
- Uh, uh huh.

416
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,703
- We have our testimony now.

417
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,872
- Hoju, you tricked him into it.

418
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,457
- It's all the truth.

419
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,751
We also have testimony
from the idiots involved

420
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,628
in that mud ball incident.

421
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,754
This is no trick.

422
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,214
- Well yes, that may be so.

423
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,258
But it still feels
like you tricked him.

424
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,468
- No!

425
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,929
Personally, I think this
should have been done

426
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,305
from the very beginning.

427
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,183
(laughs)

428
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,811
Honestly, I never imagined he
would be this much of a fool.

429
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,355
(whimpers)

430
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,815
(claps)

431
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,567
- Oh, Senior Secretary Hong!

432
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,152
- Now, it seems
you've been doing

433
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,779
some exceptionally
amusing things lately.

434
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,782
- No, no, no, it wasn't
my doing I swear.

435
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,201
- Even if there's a one in a
million chance that's true,

436
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,619
I believe it was your doing.

437
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,372
So the truth of the matter
is of little importance.

438
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,540
- That's insane.

439
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,459
- From now on it's
in your best interest

440
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,961
to avoid anywhere with
connections to the Hong Clan.

441
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,880
I've already sent
out several notices.

442
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,715
If they find you
you're as good as dead.

443
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,883
You'll be weighed down

444
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,302
and tossed in the
nearest river to drown.

445
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,471
- And of course, there isn't
a single place in this country

446
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,681
that doesn't have ties
with the Hong Clan.

447
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,808
- Like me, my Clan is
extremely difficult

448
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,310
to control when angered

449
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,645
and is exceptionally vindictive
towards those who insult us.

450
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,439
Rest assured we won't
forget your name

451
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,649
or face, even after
a hundred years.

452
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,817
(gasps)

453
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,486
- What a scary option.

454
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,529
- Oh, I'll never do this
sort of thing again.

455
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,405
- Too bad.

456
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,865
I make it my practice

457
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,743
to crush those I despise until
they can no longer stand.

458
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,287
A few years ago you made
fun of my adopted son

459
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,498
by calling him an
abandoned child.

460
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,916
Since that moment
I've had no intention

461
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,334
of ever forgiving you.

462
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,545
Oh, one more thing.

463
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,676
(officials gasp)

464
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,721
- So that's where he was
hiding it all this time?

465
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,348
- There's a saying
about hiding one's head

466
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,599
but not ones bottom.

467
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,935
- But he couldn't even
manage to hide his head.

468
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,522
- The ring that symbolizes
the Sa Clan's leader

469
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,648
or rather a fake of it.

470
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,941
- Oh that's...

471
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,693
- I don't know why you
would have this sort

472
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,569
of thing nor do I really care,

473
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,530
but I can tell you it's
pointless to take this

474
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,366
to the Sa family and try
getting help from them.

475
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,243
I've already taken
care of matters.

476
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,327
- Oh, you're not serious?

477
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,495
- Did you expect me

478
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,913
to leave a single escape
route open to you?

479
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,789
How foolish.

480
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,748
(whimpers)

481
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,874
- This isn't my fault.

482
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,502
It's all because of women.

483
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,045
- Hmm?

484
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,881
- Oh, this is all because of
women coming into the picture.

485
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,341
- She's late.

486
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,426
- She'll be here.

487
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,806
(jolly music)

488
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,517
- You surpassed even me when
you passed the national exams.

489
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,394
It's time you show those
brainless Officials

490
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,562
who can only make fun of women

491
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,731
and children what
you're capable of.

492
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,648
- Hakumei!

493
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,524
- Huh!

494
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,401
(clash)

495
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,444
- Not again.

496
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,571
- Initiate Heki.

497
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,114
How are you at fighting?

498
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,742
- We of the Heki family excel
in the arts and literature.

499
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,619
We don't know the first
thing about fighting.

500
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,413
- He's useless.

501
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:26,082
(guards jeer)

502
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,335
- Can I fight while
protecting them both?

503
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,671
(guards jeer)

504
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,803
(laughs)

505
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:39,679
(scream)

506
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,931
(gasps)

507
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:42,766
- Hey there!

508
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,601
- Ensei!
- Ensei!

509
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,312
- Yeah, it's been a while,
Princess, Seiran, hmm.

510
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,775
(officials muttering)

511
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,318
- The ones who compiled

512
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,986
the papers documenting your
misdeeds are none other

513
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,863
than Initiate Hong
and Initiate To.

514
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,324
- But these detailed figures...

515
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,869
- Having been falsely accused
of inappropriate conduct,

516
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,579
Initiate Hong
stayed up all night

517
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,956
to finish this in hopes
of vindicating herself.

518
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,500
They were quite aware

519
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,544
of whose conduct
was inappropriate,
Senior Secretary Sai!

520
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,754
- Huh!

521
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,297
Don't you all think
it's very strange

522
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,467
how the national exams were
all of a sudden open to women?

523
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,887
Not to mention a 17 year
old girl passing is Tanka.

524
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,972
- The national exams
aren't that easy.

525
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,393
- The King forced the issue
of women taking the exams.

526
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,019
Don't you find that odd?

527
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,480
- Your Majesty, I
do agree with him.

528
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,816
Please, we must demand the
full truth of the matter.

529
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,360
- If she didn't pass
using her own ability

530
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,528
we cannot accept it.

531
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,113
After all, that was
the primary reason

532
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,615
why the previous King
introduced the exam system.

533
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,783
- [Officials] That's right.

534
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,618
Your Majesty?

535
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,661
- You're right.

536
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,038
Ability is the main principle.

537
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,457
The previous King knew this.

538
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,834
That's why he created

539
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,794
a system even the King
could not interfere with.

540
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,379
[Officials] Ah!

541
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,589
- All of you have gone
through the national exams.

542
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,925
You should already know
this better than anyone.

543
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,012
You all have first-hand
experience of the
system's fairness.

544
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,930
You know how impartial
the exams are

545
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,516
and how effectively they
prevent any impropriety.

546
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,935
The national exams aren't easy.

547
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,854
- But, if that's truly the case,

548
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,690
why doesn't Initiate
Hong show herself?

549
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:14,899
Huh.

550
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,401
I have doubts that
it was Initiate Hong

551
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,861
who actually wrote these papers.

552
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,654
How are we supposed
to know for sure?

553
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,114
(muttering)

554
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,615
It's almost noon.

555
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,951
The time of the
Inquiry's about to start.

556
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,037
Could it be she knew
she'd embarrass herself

557
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,497
and decided to run away instead?

558
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,874
(muttering)

559
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,417
But still, even if she's unable

560
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,918
to become an Official,

561
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,837
as a Lady of the Hong Clan,
no doubt she'll have plenty

562
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,088
of good marriage proposals.

563
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,424
(laughs)

564
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,473
(doors rattle)

565
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,516
(gasps)

566
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,728
- [Officials] I
don't believe this.

567
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,439
- Shurei Hong reporting
for duty My Lords.

568
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,775
(muttering)

569
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,074
(growling)

570
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,743
- Initiate Hong, some in
this Royal Court suspect

571
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,078
there was impropriety involved

572
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,455
in you passing the
national exams.

573
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:11,873
Your response?

574
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,041
- I will prove myself.

575
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,085
I cannot afford to
quit being an Official

576
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,796
since as of yet I have
not accomplished anything.

577
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,464
- It is now noon.

578
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,759
We will hold the Inquiry
here in this Court.

579
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,803
With a public oral examination

580
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,806
there can be no means
for impropriety.

581
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:28,932
- As you wish, Sir.

582
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:29,766
Please?

583
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,602
(gentle music)

584
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:33,520
- Hmm.

585
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:38,900
- Very well.

586
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,485
Let the inquiry begin.

587
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,570
(doors rattling)

588
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,989
(jolly music)

589
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,175
Now, one final question.

590
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,303
Why did you as a woman
want to become an Official?

591
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,055
I'm afraid that if the
crux of the question

592
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,974
is why as a woman
do you do this,

593
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,935
then I have no answer
for you or this Court.

594
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,646
I came to do what I can do
as myself and simply that.

595
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,732
I would have taken
the national exams

596
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,817
whether I were a man or a woman.

597
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,277
I want to be an Official.

598
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,196
I want to protect as much
as I can with my own hands.

599
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,531
Those were my reasons.

600
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,826
That's why I took
the national exams.

601
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,287
(gentle music)

602
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,138
(singing in foreign language)

603
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,044
- [Shurei] At last,
the special observation

604
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,838
of the new Officials
is almost over.

605
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,757
I wonder, where will we
all be assigned after this?

606
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,592
On second thought, it
doesn't really matter.

607
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,803
It's still just an
issue of doing my best.

608
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,054
No matter where I am.
