00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,509
{\an8}(electronic whooshing)

2
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:15,724
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,729
(guitar music)

4
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,440
- [Narrator] Shurei Hong, the
first ever female official

5
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,902
of Saiunkoku and Eigetsu To
the youngest ever official

6
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,862
of Saiunkoku have
both been assigned

7
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,407
to serve as co-governors
in the troubled region

8
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,574
of Sa province.

9
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,744
- [Shurei Hong] The big
pot is on the top shelf

10
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,746
and the tea leaves are
all stored in here.

11
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,748
And I've gone ahead
and made a list

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,375
of where you'll find everything.

13
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,504
You will be all right
alone, won't you, Father?

14
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,381
- Don't worry I'm
sure I'll be fine.

15
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,386
- By the way, Father
there's something

16
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,846
I've been meaning to tell you,

17
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,639
something I have to say.

18
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,516
- Yes, what is it?

19
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,976
- Well it's just that--

20
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,854
- My lady, would you mind
if I went out for a moment?

21
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,273
- Of course I don't mind,
where are you going?

22
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,816
- Pardon me, I'll be right back.

23
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,613
- What was that you
were saying earlier?

24
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,617
- Huh ahh, we can
talk about that later.

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,456
- [Narrator] Ensei Ro
and Seiran Shi will both

26
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,792
be accompanying Shurei
and Eigetsu to Sa province

27
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,462
Ensei as assistant to
the two young governors,

28
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,007
and Seiran to protect them
as a military officer.

29
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,800
Summer is approaching quickly.

30
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,761
The time to leave
is drawing near.

31
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,431
(light music)

32
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,766
- Sa province huh?

33
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,280
(ethereal music)

34
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,535
- [Ryuki Shi] Big
brother, big brother Seien

35
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,999
Big brother Seien. (sobbing)

36
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,585
- Were the others
teasing you again?

37
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,004
- They told me I'm
an unwanted child.

38
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,422
That it would have been better

39
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,467
if I were never born,
even mother said so.

40
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,844
- That isn't true at all Ryuki.

41
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,638
I'm grateful to
have you in my life

42
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,723
so you can't be unwanted right?

43
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,600
- You really mean it?

44
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,519
- Yes, I really mean it.

45
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,436
- Ha!

46
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,857
(Lady Suzuran coughing)

47
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,735
- Mother, I brought
you your medicine.

48
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,075
Please drink it later.

49
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,913
- [Lady Suzuran] If you
only you didn't exist.

50
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,499
Things would've
been much better.

51
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,544
If only I hadn't
given birth to you.

52
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,047
- [Seien] She was always
very prone to illness.

53
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,842
Her heart and mind
were also weak.

54
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,677
In hindsight, she
would've been much happier

55
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,138
living a peaceful
life in a quiet place,

56
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,807
rather than being the
bloom of the Royal Harem.

57
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,518
Receiving the affection of
the King and giving birth

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,770
to me as the second prince.

59
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,441
(ethereal music)

60
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,527
I had five brothers, all
born to different mothers.

61
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,529
But the only one
who truly loved me

62
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,949
like a brother was
the youngest, Ryuki.

63
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,118
He looked up to me
and to be honest,

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,370
I also found comfort
in being with him.

65
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,957
We were similar children

66
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,669
in that nobody found us
necessary, or even wanted us.

67
00:04:55,754 --> 00:05:00,717
(swords clanging)
(men grunting)

68
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,512
I'm beaten, you win.

69
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,727
- You've improved your
sword skills Prince Seien

70
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,937
I'm impressed, at this rate
you could very well be champion

71
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,523
at the next martial
arts tournament.

72
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,192
- No, I still have a ways to go.

73
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,653
- Of course you do, in fact you
still have a long way to go.

74
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,405
The way of the sword
is not something you

75
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,575
can learn that easily,
Prince. (laughs)

76
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,078
(Seien laughs)

77
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,872
Oh hello Prince
Ryuki, would you mind

78
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,541
if I requested a bout with you?

79
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,002
(Ryuki gasps)

80
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,549
- Now come at me.

81
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,467
- Ah!

82
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,639
- If only I had realized
then, the extent

83
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,475
of my cleverness
and my foolishness.

84
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,768
There might have
been a path for me

85
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,978
that was different from
the one that I'm on now.

86
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,025
(swordsman grunting)

87
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,948
- The winner is Seien Shi.

88
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,742
(crowd cheering)

89
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,786
- [Man] Prince
Seien is champion.

90
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,961
- [Woman] How wonderful!

91
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,257
- I need to talk to you.

92
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,967
- What is it, Father?

93
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,761
(mysterious music)

94
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,930
- You have done
incredibly well, Seien.

95
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,601
These are the twin swords
Kanshou and Bakuya passed down

96
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,603
from generations of
the royal family.

97
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,981
Your excellence in
scholarly and military arts

98
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,941
makes you most
worthy to have these.

99
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,609
- I humbly and gratefully accept

100
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,821
these gifts, Father,
no, King Senka.

101
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,493
(crowd cheering)

102
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,541
If only I'd realized how
foolish I was really being.

103
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,753
- What, Seien as King?

104
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,715
- Shh, Seien is far more skilled

105
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,967
and intelligent than
any of his brothers.

106
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,844
However as things are the throne

107
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:11,181
will pass to the first prince,
that means you will live

108
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,725
the remainder of your
life as a mere concubine.

109
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,934
Do you want that?

110
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,728
- But Father, you
can't be serious.

111
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,064
- Should Seien take the throne

112
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,775
many people will support
him, it will all work out.

113
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,193
The First Prince
will be assassinated,

114
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,736
the other princes
will be kicked out

115
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,738
of the palace and King
Senka will step down

116
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,824
from his position to
make room for your son.

117
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,659
You have nothing to worry about.

118
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,203
Leave everything to me I'll help

119
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,580
make you mother of the
future king (laughs).

120
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,671
- [Seien] This is Bakuya,
one of twin swords.

121
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,839
- You're giving this to me?

122
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,216
- I want you to have it.

123
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,635
You've got a lot of potential.

124
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,552
- I don't know.

125
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,888
- Just think of Bakuya as me.

126
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,849
That way, you won't be
lonely even if you are alone.

127
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,268
I know in my heart it'll
always protect you.

128
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,021
- Thank you, big brother Seinen.

129
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,691
(happy music)

130
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,329
(maniacal chuckling)

131
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,128
(footsteps tapping)

132
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,879
You are under arrest
due to suspicion

133
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,298
of rebellious actions
against the court.

134
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,259
Rebellious actions?
(tense music)

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,052
- Yes, your mother
and grandfather have

136
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,638
also been taken into custody
in regards to this matter.

137
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,099
Please surrender quietly
and do not resist us.

138
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,103
- It was a trap, everything
had been planned.

139
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,900
It was a scheme laid
out by my bothers

140
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,403
and the other consorts
who were jealous of me

141
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,739
and didn't approve
of my existence.

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,828
They fooled my grandfather
and tricked him

143
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,663
into that conspiracy

144
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,666
(swordsman grunts)

145
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,129
(horse cart wheels moving)

146
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,923
- [Sou Shungai] Prince
Seien knew nothing

147
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,633
about this plot did he?

148
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,303
- It couldn't be helped, only
the kindness of King Senka

149
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,015
spared him from execution,
he's lucky to be only exiled.

150
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,686
- [Lady Suzuran] If only you
had never existed. (coughs)

151
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,942
- [Seien] I had no
lingering attachment

152
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,696
to the palace itself, I was
only worried about Ryuki.

153
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,700
(Ryuki crying)

154
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:41,373
Big brother Seien, why is it
you won't come see me anymore?

155
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,918
(Ryuki crying)

156
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,757
- It seems my
brothers didn't feel

157
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,467
it was enough to have me exiled.

158
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,761
They sent assassins to kill me.

159
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,054
They caught up with
us just before we

160
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,098
reached the lands we
had been exiled to.

161
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,935
(wagon crashing)

162
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,729
(dramatic music)

163
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,984
(assassin moans)
(sword slicing)

164
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,320
- I wished you
had never existed.

165
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,739
If only you had never been born!

166
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,282
- No mother, no!

167
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,828
(dull thudding)

168
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,329
(assassin moans)

169
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,164
- If you asked me
whether not I loved her,

170
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,083
I have to say I don't know,

171
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,127
she was that kind of mother,

172
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,295
but she was still the
woman who gave birth to me.

173
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,717
(ominous music)

174
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,266
There was no way I
could have hated her.

175
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,436
Oh mother.

176
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,069
(assassins yell)

177
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,196
(assassins moan)

178
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,198
You're taking me awful lightly.

179
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,284
Just who do you think I am?

180
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,536
I am Prince Seien
and my swordsmanship

181
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,205
won't let me fall
to the likes of you.

182
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,207
At the age of twelve I received

183
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,793
Kanshou and Bakuya
from King Senka.

184
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,462
If you intend on taking my life

185
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,381
you must come at me
prepared to die for it.

186
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,426
(assassins yelling)

187
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,138
(ethereal music)

188
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,147
(Prince Seien moans)

189
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,943
I defeated every last
one of the assassins.

190
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,990
But, the hell hadn't
ended for me just yet.

191
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,454
(peaceful music)

192
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,892
(upbeat music)

193
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,268
- And what has you
looking so gloomy?

194
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,854
It's definitely not like
you to look so troubled.

195
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,982
- To tell the truth, I'm
concerned about Seiran.

196
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,276
- Seiran why's that?

197
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,945
- Haven't I ever told you?

198
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,155
Nine years ago I was
orders by my brothers to go

199
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,158
and find the whereabouts
of a certain someone.

200
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,285
They wanted me to find
Seiren or Prince Seien

201
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,995
as he was known at the time.

202
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,580
- Wow, this is the first
time I've heard of it.

203
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,917
I'm surprised the Ran clan
would plan something so stupid.

204
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,544
- Don't get me wrong, it
was never the family's

205
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,546
intent to try and
make Prince Seien king

206
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,507
and make an already
delicate situation worse.

207
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,300
- Huh I wonder about that.

208
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,552
- My family wanted to find him

209
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,387
and place him under
protection before people

210
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,431
who were planning
exactly that found him.

211
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,308
Better to avoid unnecessary
conflict, right?

212
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,435
- Hmm.

213
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,894
- Besides, he was
pretty good with a sword

214
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,354
if you remember correctly.

215
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,356
My elder brothers probably
thought that given

216
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,483
that, Prince Seien would
be more than capable

217
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,361
of taking on any assassins
that were sent after him.

218
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,531
- Speaking of assassins
that reminds me of a rumor

219
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,241
I heard a while ago.

220
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,201
According to a rumor
the previous king

221
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,328
sent the Black Wolf out
to protect Prince Seien

222
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,123
from anyone who made
an attempt on his life.

223
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,250
- Your orders are to
protect Prince Seien.

224
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,919
You must not let those fools
have things as they desire.

225
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,547
- Go forth Black Wolf.

226
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,423
- Yes!

227
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,469
- [Friend] The legendary
assassin, the Black Wolf

228
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,346
I guess despite that
little conspiracy

229
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,140
the previous king still wanted
to keep and eye on his son.

230
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,017
- Given his position,
he had no choice

231
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,560
but to force Seien
into exile due

232
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,104
to his alleged involvement
in the plot of rebellion,

233
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,607
but the king wasn't about to
see him get killed over it.

234
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,734
- Mind you, they
are just rumors.

235
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,236
- Well regardless of
whether the Black Wolf

236
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,447
was dispatched or
not, the fact remains

237
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,074
that despite careful
searching I was unable

238
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,326
to find Prince Seien back then.

239
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,121
Here, let me
refresh your memory.

240
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,332
Don't you remember
where he was exiled to?

241
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,584
- Huh!

242
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,961
- That's right, Sa province.

243
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,588
It was fourteen years
ago when we lost

244
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,757
track of him entirely
that was not very long

245
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,385
after the New Year had
passed, but I understand

246
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,011
that it was near the
end of that same year

247
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,013
that Lord Shouka took
Seiran into his home.

248
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,605
That raises the question

249
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,650
of what he was doing in
Sa province that year.

250
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,652
- [Shokun Hyo] I've
made up my mind.

251
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,279
Your name is now
going to be Seiran.

252
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,240
- [Shurei Hong] Seiran!

253
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,202
(birds chirping)

254
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,664
- [Eigetsu] I guess you'll
be lonely without her.

255
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,708
- It's what she wished for

256
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,376
and I would never
stand in her way.

257
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,294
Besides, in the meantime
the flowers will bloom

258
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,130
on the withered
trees this summer.

259
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,673
Blossoms that
haven't come out once

260
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,384
over the past nine years
will return this year.

261
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,514
- You said nine years,
not since the civil war?

262
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,475
- Yes, after the
rebellious actions

263
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,310
of Second Prince
Seien's grandfather

264
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,021
fourteen years ago the country

265
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,565
somehow maintained
peace and calmness.

266
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,734
At least, on the
surface, that is.

267
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,656
(Shurei Hong laughing)

268
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,825
But nine years ago,
the former King

269
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:12,704
His Majesty Senka Shi was
bedridden due to illness.

270
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,206
It was that that
triggered the Civil War.

271
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,503
- From now on, I will remain
bedridden as if I am ill.

272
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,505
I will not take center
stage ever again.

273
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,425
I am leaving you in
charge Advisor Sho.

274
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,843
- Yes.

275
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,679
- The country of
Saiunkoku has fallen ill.

276
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,098
If this land is to have
any chance of surviving

277
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,310
in the difficult days a
ahead it must be reborn now.

278
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,270
No matter what it
may cost to do so.

279
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,689
- You may count on
me your majesty.

280
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,191
I promise I will see to it

281
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,151
that your desires
are met without fail.

282
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:49,366
- Hm.
(footsteps tapping)

283
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,080
The debate on who would
succeed the throne

284
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,707
had been going on below the
surface up to that point.

285
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,418
But upon hearing of the
King's illness, it erupted

286
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,338
out into the open with
the exception of Ryuki,

287
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,425
the Four Princes
fought aggressively
to inherit the throne.

288
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,303
(arrows thwicking)
(flames roaring)

289
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:11,763
The struggle soon
developed into a civil war.

290
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,890
The government could no
longer operate properly

291
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,434
and the royal court became
stagnant and corrupt.

292
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,688
(woman screaming)

293
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,731
The ones who were hurt
most were the citizens.

294
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,401
If the royal court ceases
to function naturally

295
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,403
the conditions worsen
across the country.

296
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,904
- [Townsman] What do you
mean you can't pay the money?

297
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,198
- [Townsman] If you can't pay
than we're not interested.

298
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,907
- [Townsman] What's
with these prices?

299
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,367
You're ripping us off.

300
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,576
- [Townsman] I can't
help it if they're high

301
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,620
the goods aren't coming in.

302
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,668
- As if that weren't
enough, severe droughts

303
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,256
affected the capital,
followed by flooding.

304
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,259
It wasn't long before disease
and famine became rampant.

305
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,722
(people chattering)

306
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,474
- [Townsman] Thank
you very much.

307
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,686
- Why will you not take
any action, my Lord?

308
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,771
Surely, you have
the ability to end

309
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,606
this civil war right now.

310
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:07,444
Advisor Sho, unless
you do something

311
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,780
about it fast, this
country and its people.

312
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,701
- If you must know,
I'm currently waiting.

313
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:15,618
- Huh?

314
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,330
- Waiting, what
was he waiting for?

315
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,541
- When I asked that, he replied.

316
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,543
- I am waiting for
a king who is truly

317
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,795
worthy of serving
this country of ours.

318
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,672
And what do you intend
to do if no such

319
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,466
person comes forward, my lord?

320
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,259
- Without a truly good king,

321
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,763
the land of Saiunkoku would
be better off perishing.

322
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,640
(gasps)

323
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,518
(ethereal music)

324
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,239
- [Lord Shouku] This
country is finished.

325
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,661
That was what
everyone was thinking.

326
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,246
We all lost hope.

327
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,434
- Tell me, do you want
it too Prince Ryuki?

328
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,852
- Huh?

329
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,355
- The throne, of course,
like your elder brothers do.

330
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,733
(Ryuki grunts)

331
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,779
- There appears to
be something more

332
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,489
important than that to you.

333
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,995
- [Lord Shouku] But, at the
very end before all was lost

334
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,373
Advisor Sho found
in Prince Ryuki

335
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:46,334
the potential to be
a true and just king.

336
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,422
(crowd chattering)

337
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,597
Advisor Sho
introduced one policy

338
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,891
after another and
put them into affect.

339
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,310
He saved the citizens
and devoted his efforts

340
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,354
to rebuilding the royal court.

341
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,065
The princes and officials
who valued personal power

342
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,693
over the wellbeing of
the people were arrested.

343
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,529
Some of them were exiled
while others were executed.

344
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,742
All the remnants of the
civil war that had hampered

345
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,286
the court were
completely cleaned out.

346
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,413
As a result of this
purge, the royal court

347
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:26,416
was purified and
reborn for a new era.

348
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,084
- So everything went
as the former king

349
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,462
and Advisor Sho
wanted, did they?

350
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,463
That's how it was.

351
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,968
- [Lord Shouku] The
country recovered quickly.

352
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,473
(birds chirping)

353
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:48,980
It was as if things were
guided by an invisible force.

354
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,817
- It's beautiful.

355
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,697
It has become a country
truly worthy of Prince Ryuki.

356
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,991
- [Lord Shoku] As sure
enough, two years ago.

357
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:07,499
- Become King as my
heir, Ryuki become king.

358
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,380
(chuckling)

359
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,382
- [Lord Shoku] Following
the coronation ceremony,

360
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,592
King Ryuki acted
like a fool, waiting

361
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,052
for the return of Prince Seien.

362
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,887
- But meeting with
Princess awakened

363
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,639
his inner
consciousness as a king

364
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,016
and made him live up to
his responsibilities.

365
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,853
- I have no doubt that King
Ryuki will become a great ruler.

366
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,398
And as for this country.

367
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:33,983
- I have no doubt
it's going to blossom.

368
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,610
- Hmm?

369
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,071
- The flowers, I'm sure
they'll bloom everywhere.

370
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,698
Enough to fill this
yard and enough

371
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,741
to fill this entire country.

372
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,493
- Uh-huh.

373
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,413
And that's how I know that
in the end I won't be lonely.

374
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,666
- Father, do you know if
Seiran's returned yet?

375
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,418
- Hmm no, not yet.

376
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,919
- Hmm, I wonder where he went.

377
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,046
- Knowing Seiran he's probably.

378
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,841
(gentle music)

379
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,175
- [Ensei Ro] If you were
gonna visit her grave

380
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,593
to pay respects you should have

381
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,595
just told us that's
what you were doing.

382
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,806
But still, I guess
there are times

383
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,433
when you'd rather be alone, hm.

384
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,479
You sure about this?

385
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,943
Returning to Sa province, it
might prove difficult for you.

386
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,904
The murderous blades,
no you probably

387
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,407
don't wanna be reminded.

388
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,409
- I will protect Lady Shurei.

389
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:28,496
I'll go to Sa province,
no matter what might
await me there.

390
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,999
(sword clangs)

391
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,754
I pledge on this sword.

392
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,007
- Hmm.

393
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,556
- [Shurei] You
should have told us

394
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,433
you were coming here Seiran.

395
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,560
- [Seiran] Ensei said
the very same thing.

396
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,859
- Pardon me but
there's something

397
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,444
I have to day to you Father.

398
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,491
Well um, I just wanted to say

399
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,119
thank you Father.

400
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,748
Thank you for bringing
me up properly,

401
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,002
for listening to my selfish
wishes, and most of all

402
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:19,756
for letting me chase my
dream and go to Sa province.

403
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,549
Thank you so much.

404
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,178
- I can't take the credit,
I haven't done anything.

405
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,763
It was your own strong will

406
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,890
that allowed you to
grasp your dream, Shurei.

407
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,143
- Oh, Father.

408
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,021
- Now go out there and make
a magnificent flower bloom.

409
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,236
- Right, and Seiran,
thank you for everything.

410
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,617
- [Shokun Hyo] I've
made up my mind.

411
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,953
Your name is now
going to be Seiran.

412
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,622
- Now and always

413
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:54,833
Seiran!

414
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:01,006
Seiran, I'm very happy
to have you by my side.

415
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,841
I'm the luckiest
girl in the world!

416
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,677
- Thank you, my lady.

417
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:10,056
(peaceful piano music)

418
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,563
- [Lady Suzuran] If
only you hadn't existed,

419
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,690
things would've
been so much better.

420
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:23,153
- No you're absolutely
wrong about that.

421
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:26,072
I'm very grateful that you
gave birth to me, mother.

422
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,909
I will do everything
within my power

423
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,244
to protect you, my lady.

424
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:50,221
(singing in foreign language)

425
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,211
- [Shurei] That's strange,
what is Lord Koyu looking

426
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,046
so serious for?

427
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:08,258
I sense a weirdo drawing
near, Ryuren is coming.

428
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,884
What, there are ghosts in the

429
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,012
ministry of the
Enlightened Ones' cave?

430
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,346
Is that true Eigetsu?
