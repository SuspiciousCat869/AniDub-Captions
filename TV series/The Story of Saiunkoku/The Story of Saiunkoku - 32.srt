1
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,509
(electronic music)

2
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:15,473
{\an8}("Hajimari No Kaze")

3
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:48,608
(dramatic, quiet
percussion music)

4
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,361
(crowd chatter)

5
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,282
- [Narrator] Shourin, the
leader of the bald eagles

6
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,827
of Sa province, seemed to
be flying as he made his way

7
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,413
to the Sa Clan's main residence,

8
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,249
carrying a message from
Ensei Ro to Shuurei.

9
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,423
(erhu music)

10
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,304
Meanwhile, in accordance
with Sakujun's request,

11
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,724
Shuurei was playing the
erhu for him after lunch.

12
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,400
- Huh?

13
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,989
- [Narrator] Shuurei is here
to search for two things,

14
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,908
one is the hairpin
decorated with a flower bud,

15
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,662
the other is the location
where Kokujun Sa and Lady Eiki

16
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,580
are being held.

17
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,250
(erhu music)

18
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,431
- Well, then, I'm going
to take a nap now.

19
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,725
Please be sure to come
here again tonight.

20
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,440
I truly do not get tired of you.

21
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,906
(door closes)

22
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,283
- I have to find where Mr.
Kokujun and Lady Eiki are

23
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:20,992
right away!

24
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,038
Jeez, what's up with this place?

25
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,956
It's like a maze or something.

26
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,543
I wonder which way I should go.

27
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,379
Hm, okay.

28
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,382
Hm.

29
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,386
Hm.

30
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,768
- [Shourin] Miss Shuurei!

31
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,395
- Huh?

32
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:48,937
- [Shourin] You must be
Miss Shuurei Hyou, right?

33
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,355
- Who are you?

34
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,066
- [Shourin] Your erhu playing
earlier was wonderful,

35
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,944
just like Ensei said, I
knew right away it was you.

36
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,612
- Huh!

37
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,406
- So this is the first time
that we meet, Miss Shuurei.

38
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,032
- But who are you?

39
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,409
- Oh, me?

40
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,535
My name is Shourin,
I'm the leader

41
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,661
of the chivalrous thieves,

42
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,955
the famous bald
eagles of Sa Province.

43
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,082
- The bald eagles
of Sa Province?

44
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,667
Never heard of them.

45
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,210
- You and I are
sort of connected.

46
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,088
You see, my father received
lots of favors from Mr. Shouka

47
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,047
a long time ago.

48
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,674
- From father?

49
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,551
- I always hoped someday I
could repay that kindness.

50
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,012
That's why I came
here to help you.

51
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,556
I brought along a letter
for you from Ensei Ro.

52
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,349
- Huh.

53
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,479
It's true, this is definitely
Ensei's handwriting.

54
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,648
- [Shourin] It's
in your hands now.

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,816
- Huh, what?

56
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,609
- Now that I think of it,

57
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,737
earlier I could hear
the sound of an erhu

58
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,405
from one of the outer buildings.

59
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,865
Was it Master Sakujun playing?

60
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,366
It was so wonderful.

61
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,000
- This is... hm.

62
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,882
(ancient music)

63
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,512
- Oh, do you now like me
enough to take a nap together

64
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,889
with me?

65
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,890
- I have a request,

66
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,059
I need a housemaid's outfit.

67
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,519
- Hm, if you wish.

68
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,026
- Thank you for this,

69
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,445
I'll be borrowing it
for a little while.

70
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,947
- While I have you here, I'd
like you to tie my hair up,

71
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,866
my lovely housemaid.

72
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:25,784
- Hm.

73
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,747
Fine, I'm done!

74
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
- I truly hope you find
what you're looking for.

75
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:34,918
- Hm.

76
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,757
(laughs)

77
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,429
- This is the perfect
outfit to gather information

78
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,223
about what's going
on in the household.

79
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,517
Besides, I'm used
to maid's work.

80
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:54,938
I'm definitely going to
find those two, I promise.

81
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,901
- Lord Chuushou's a really
scary man, don't you think?

82
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,361
- Now that you mention it,

83
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,530
have you heard the rumor
about Lady Eiki being banished

84
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,239
by Lord Chuushou?

85
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,740
- [Maid] What, really?

86
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,534
Well, that figures, no wonder
I haven't seen her lately.

87
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,577
- So Lady Eiki
must be an obstacle

88
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,621
that Chuushou saw in his plans.

89
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,916
At least I'm used
to cleaning toilets.

90
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,168
- Is it true?

91
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,004
Is Master Soujun really dead?

92
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,964
Which means the next
in line for clan head

93
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,550
is the prodigal
son, Master Sakujun.

94
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,510
- At least he's a better choice
than that undependable boy,

95
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,845
Kokujun.

96
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,013
- [Passerby] Which reminds
me, there are rumors

97
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,222
he's been placed
under house arrest.

98
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,224
- House arrest?

99
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,059
If that's the case, then
he must be somewhere

100
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,728
on the clan premises after all.

101
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,563
(slow music)

102
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,480
- Hm.

103
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,032
A hidden room?

104
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,243
He's not here.

105
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,498
Huh?

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,669
(trapdoor creaks)

107
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,967
A secret passage?

108
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,927
Hm, this isn't it either.

109
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,978
Just how many of these
things are there?

110
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,980
This residence is
way too suspicious,

111
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,857
with all its hidden rooms.

112
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,192
And nobody's saying
a thing about

113
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,693
what I really want to know,

114
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,528
like where Mr. Kokujun is.

115
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,283
I wonder where you
might be, Mr. Kokujun.

116
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,708
- End everything,
bring it all to an end.

117
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,004
Just like Great Uncle
Enjun did, everything.

118
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,969
(bird chirps)

119
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,055
(grunts)

120
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,770
- It's no use.

121
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,730
- [Man] What are you
doing over there?

122
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,775
- Sorry, I've just come
to collect the garbage,

123
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,901
excuse me, sir (laughs).

124
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,864
That was way too close.

125
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,784
- So, tell me, have you found
what you were looking for,

126
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,786
my lovely housemaid?

127
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,162
How about a break?

128
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,664
Shall we have tea together?

129
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,332
- I've got work to do!

130
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,626
(laughs)

131
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,589
Perhaps there might
even be a hidden room

132
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,675
in a place like this.

133
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,218
- Oh my, you're
working hard, I see!

134
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,762
- Oh, um, uh, thanks, you too.

135
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,347
- We're all working hard.

136
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,808
We've been so busy, yet we're
totally understaffed as well.

137
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,935
- Yeah, I suppose
you're right about that.

138
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,812
- I mean, we've got both
the selection ceremony

139
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,939
for the clan head, and a
wedding ceremony coming up.

140
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,399
Guess it can't be helped, huh?

141
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,734
(laughs)

142
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,943
But to think, after
all this time,

143
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,945
Master Sakujun is
getting married!

144
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,281
They say his new wife is
a member of the Hyou clan.

145
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,867
She took the national exams
even though she's a girl.

146
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,327
I bet you anything she's
got a big frown on her face

147
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,246
all the time,
don't you think so?

148
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,416
- Yeah, she probably does,
a girl taking the exams.

149
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,418
By the way, I wonder if
Lady Eiki will be attending

150
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,087
the wedding ceremony,
what do you think?

151
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:06,963
- Lady Eiki?

152
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,715
I don't know.

153
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,091
- I would love to
meet her and find out

154
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,177
what she's really like.

155
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,887
- You're new here, aren't you?

156
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,723
Trust me, you'd be very wise
not to talk about Lady Eiki

157
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,390
too much.

158
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,975
- Huh, why's that?

159
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,436
- Everyone close to Lady
Eiki's been expelled.

160
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,230
In any case, if you attract
the attention of Lord Chuushou,

161
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,190
you're finished!

162
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,943
Rumor has it that both Lady
Eiki and Master Kokujun

163
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,363
are locked up somewhere
because they angered him.

164
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,744
- If Chuushou Sa imprisons
anyone who gets in his way,

165
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,288
that would mean, with
all these hidden rooms,

166
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,998
the most likely place
for it would have to be

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,417
in Chuushou's room, but
it's not going to be easy

168
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,753
to get inside his chambers.

169
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,838
- Yeah, that's suspicious.

170
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,340
- How the heck did
you get in here?

171
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,300
- Nevermind that, I
searched around the grounds

172
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,135
quite extensively,
but in that room,

173
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,305
the sound echoes back to my
feet in a really weird way.

174
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,390
- Wait, you went in there?

175
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,307
When?

176
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,892
- A couple of times at night.

177
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,811
The floor has the same
kind of hollow sound

178
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,771
as when I make a trap
hole to catch animals

179
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,023
and I check to make sure it's
all ready by tapping the top

180
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:07,982
with my foot.

181
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,901
- So, there's a basement?

182
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,028
- [Shourin] Yup, from the
way my footsteps echo,

183
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,822
I can tell it's
deep and spacious,

184
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,240
but I also can sense
something alive

185
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,491
down there.

186
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,742
- You're saying there's
a person down there?

187
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,412
- Hm, I can't say for
sure that it's human,

188
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,997
but there's a good possibility.

189
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,417
- A basement beneath
a private room.

190
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,211
It would be the perfect place
to keep someone locked up.

191
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,006
Shourin, could you tell Ensei
and the others about this?

192
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,215
- All right, you got it.

193
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,346
- I understand now why
Ensei sent him here.

194
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,016
I'll be counting
on you, Shourin.

195
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,187
- So, there's a cellar
beneath Chuushou's room, huh?

196
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,314
No, that's not
suspicious at all.

197
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,734
- And that's likely where
Lady Eiki is, right?

198
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,779
- No, if anyone's in
there, it'll be Kokujun.

199
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,532
Old Lady Eiki is one tough
woman, so she'll be all right.

200
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,743
I can't imagine she'd allow
herself to be locked up

201
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,454
below old man, Chuushou's room
without a damn good fight.

202
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,956
- But what about him?

203
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,374
Is Mr. Kokujun all right?

204
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,376
- If Shourin said that he
sensed a living presence

205
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,086
down there, then
he's probably alive.

206
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,047
Besides, now that's
Soujun's ended up dead,

207
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,965
Chuushou would have to keep
him around as a back-up

208
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,301
in case something were to
happen to that Saku jerk.

209
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,219
- He's a back-up?

210
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,930
- Shourin, go back and
tell Princess we're certain

211
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,391
that Kokujun must be the one
in prison in the basement.

212
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,893
- Mm-hmm, got it.

213
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,897
(ancient music)

214
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,037
(bird chirps)

215
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,166
- [Shourin] Shuurei?

216
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,584
- Shourin!

217
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,586
- I got a message
for you from Ensei.

218
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,922
He figured out the person
trapped in the basement

219
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,590
is probably Mr. Kokujun.

220
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,385
- I see, but how
do I get in there?

221
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,970
- There didn't seem to be
any mechanisms on the floor.

222
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,181
- So the entrance to the
basement isn't in his room,

223
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,392
it must be somewhere
else in the complex.

224
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,601
- It'll be the middle
of the night soon,

225
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,936
I'll go and search
the grounds again

226
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,562
and see if I can find it.

227
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,398
- Thank you, Shourin, be careful

228
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,982
not to let them discover you.

229
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,277
(erhu music)

230
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,243
Say, isn't this residence
just a little too suspicious?

231
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,203
- What makes you say that now?

232
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,454
- This is not funny.

233
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,498
Why does a house need
so many hidden rooms?

234
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,709
It's like some parade of shame.

235
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,586
- Oh, it sounds like you've
been making some progress.

236
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,463
Don't you enjoy the
challenge in finding

237
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,090
all the hidden rooms?

238
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,592
- So, you admit to
the shame openly then?

239
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,761
- Like I said, why
are you asking now?

240
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,097
But of course,
there's only one thing

241
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,223
that I'm not ashamed about.

242
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,517
- Huh, only one thing?

243
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,103
How can you say something
like that so bluntly?

244
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:50,979
- Hm.

245
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,655
What, what are you doing?

246
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,158
- Between the two of us,
there's nothing going on

247
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,534
that we should be ashamed of.

248
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,496
Or could it be you want
to change all that?

249
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,040
- Enough already,

250
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,418
let that at least be one thing
you don't feel guilty about!

251
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,628
- It's such a pity, you
keep putting this off.

252
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,504
- Hm.

253
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,263
- Oh yes, by the way,
about my grandfather,

254
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,432
he says he'll be meeting
with you tomorrow.

255
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,142
- You mean Chuushou Sa?

256
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,602
Why does he want to see me?

257
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,687
- Well, for one thing,
our wedding ceremony

258
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,356
will be held very shortly.

259
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,316
- What, our wedding?

260
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,276
- Your wedding dress has
already been prepared,

261
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,319
so you'll have nothing to worry

262
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,737
your pretty little head about.

263
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,656
- Nevermind that, why are
you going ahead with this?

264
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,700
I thought you told me
you weren't interested in

265
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,328
the structure of weddings and
marriage and all that stuff.

266
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,414
- You're right, I'm not, it's
my grandfather who insists

267
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,665
on these sorts of things.

268
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,334
If you don't want to
go through with this,

269
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,086
tell him yourself.

270
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,672
- Yes, I'll do that, I'll
tell him right upfront.

271
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,674
I believe in telling someone
what they need to be told,

272
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,051
and now's no exception.

273
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,220
Ugh, all this yelling
is making me thirsty.

274
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,475
- Say, I don't suppose
you feel like brewing

275
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,769
some Gangnam tea for
me today, do you?

276
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,187
- No, I don't.

277
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,189
- Today's tea is going
to be Silver Needle.

278
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,650
Honestly, you have such
expensive tea leaves now,

279
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,151
as if there's nothing
special about it.

280
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,195
It makes me want to
go and sell them.

281
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,363
For crying out loud,

282
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,407
everything in this
house is so wasteful.

283
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:31,079
- Then marrying you
might be just the thing.

284
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,125
I'm sure it's something that
will be greatly enjoyable.

285
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,552
- Good job on your patrolling.

286
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,220
So, how are things
in the big city?

287
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,348
- Hm, nothing out
of the ordinary.

288
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,766
- Is that right?

289
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,768
Let's just hope for our
sakes that it isn't the calm

290
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,228
before the storm.

291
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,937
Here.

292
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,650
How is it?

293
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,526
Is it tasty?

294
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,111
- Terrible.

295
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,864
- You're so mean, I put all
my heart into making it.

296
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,158
So you're saying it could
never compare to the tea

297
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,909
that Princess
brews for you then?

298
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,619
- A grasshopper shouldn't
try to be anything

299
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,204
other than a grasshopper.

300
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,334
- Don't worry about
Princess, she's all right.

301
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,585
- Hm?

302
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,254
- Once those two are
sworn in as governors,

303
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,757
we'll have her make
Amut tea for us.

304
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:24,674
- Only for me.

305
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,217
- That's not fair.

306
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,890
(peaceful music)

307
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,527
- Oh!

308
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:48,656
It's you.

309
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,492
- Hm.

310
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,454
- And here I
thought she was just

311
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,331
another newly hired housemaid.

312
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,755
- Grandfather, I've
brought our guest.

313
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,634
Here you are, go on in.

314
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,469
- Hm.

315
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,682
(intense music)

316
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:31,574
This man is Advisor Sa's
younger brother, Chuushou Sa.

317
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,286
- Is it, young lady?

318
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,206
Is a member of the Hyou clan
that you look down on me?

319
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,668
I admit that among the
seven colored clans,

320
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,338
your bloodline is second only
to the Ran clan in eminence,

321
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,799
does that make you
too good to bow to me?

322
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,344
- Ah, you're mistaken, it's
nothing to do with my clan.

323
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,513
The reason I refuse to
bow before you has to do

324
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,349
with your use of the Murderous
Blades as your private army.

325
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,643
You allowed them to
ravage across Sa Province,

326
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,021
and used any and all means
to attack assigned Governors

327
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,647
whom you considered a nuisance.

328
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,733
You also show no concern
towards to casualties suffered

329
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,484
by the citizens.

330
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,610
You've convinced yourself that

331
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,237
the Sa Province belongs to you,

332
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,489
and that you are therefore
justified in your actions.

333
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,533
Given that, as the
King's official,

334
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,702
I will not bow to
anyone so conceited.

335
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,456
- After the selection
ceremony for the new head

336
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,543
of the Sa clan, we will wed
you and my grandson, Sakujun.

337
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,379
You shall remain quiet
and wait until then.

338
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,255
- Ah!

339
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,301
My only value to this
man is as the daughter

340
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,053
of the direct line
of the Hyou clan.

341
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,846
He doesn't see me as a Governor,

342
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,016
or even as a person worthy of
discussing issues as an equal.

343
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,439
I decline the engagement between
Lord Sakujun Sa and myself.

344
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,777
- If you know what's best for
you, you'd be wise not to say

345
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,362
such foolish things.

346
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,406
My only grandson is to become
the next head of the Sa clan.

347
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,825
That should be worthy enough,
even for the Hyou family.

348
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,285
- Your only grandson?

349
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,745
What about Mr. Kokujun?

350
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,372
- [Chuushou] I don't
know such a person.

351
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,664
- You don't know him?

352
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,583
He's your grandson, and
he's not the only one,

353
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,669
you also had a grandson
named Soujun, didn't you?

354
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,004
- You say very amusing things.

355
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,759
- This man, he just
erased Soujun's existence

356
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,761
like it's the
natural thing to do.

357
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,431
- It's about my elder
brother, Soujun's remains,

358
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,599
would it be all right if

359
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,393
I could see to his
burial by myself?

360
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,606
- Now I'm positive, Mr.
Kokujun's got to be locked up

361
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,482
beneath us.

362
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,945
Hm, this man has no feelings
of affection towards

363
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,614
his own blood relatives,
his own grandsons.

364
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,409
He's definitely capable of it.

365
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,619
- There's no way that
I can be prevailed upon

366
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,705
to marry your grandson.

367
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,581
You will leave your post
as the Governor here

368
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,333
and become Sakujun's wife.

369
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,460
You will find you will
have a much easier life,

370
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:48,878
surrounded by luxury.

371
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,547
- I have absolutely no intention

372
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,090
of complying with your request.

373
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,093
- Are you saying
that you refuse?

374
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,970
- Yes, I am.

375
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,472
- Even if it means Koren
will burn on the day

376
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,057
of the Governor's
swearing in ceremony?

377
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:01,975
- Huh?

378
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,310
- Or who knows?

379
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,646
Perhaps violent mobs might
start fights in every district

380
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,982
and town at the same time,
forcing all the mayors

381
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,609
and officials to run back
to where they came from.

382
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,987
When that happens, what
are you going to do?

383
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,364
You're just a little girl
who recently passed the

384
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,824
national exams.

385
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,701
- I see you're incapable of
doing anything other than

386
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,454
causing destruction, and
yet you have the power

387
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,998
and the resources to protect
Sa Province and its people.

388
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,042
You're pathetic and sickening.

389
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,669
- You talk big, but if you
think you've made an ally

390
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,839
in the merchant's guild,
you're in for a big surprise.

391
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,632
They're merchants
to the very core,

392
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,052
so they'll change
their loyalties easily.

393
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,928
They'll follow anyone
if there's enough profit

394
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,846
in it for them.

395
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,682
Surely you knew that.

396
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,059
Didn't Shou Sai tell you?

397
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,976
- Huh?

398
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,021
- Unfortunately for you,

399
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,982
I've been in communication
with Shou Sai since before you

400
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,692
came into contact with him.

401
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,944
He's given me all
kinds of information.

402
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,905
I've also asked him
to make a new ring

403
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,073
for the head of the Sa clan.

404
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,452
Although it seems that he's
been delayed considerably

405
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,663
due to a large increase
in work from elsewhere.

406
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,082
- You have my solemn
word as leader

407
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,500
that the merchant's
guild of Kinka

408
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,878
will devote 80% of its
strength to the new Governors.

409
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,797
In other words, it
could very well be

410
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:17,717
that the remaining
20% is allocated to
helping the Sa clan.

411
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,678
- Now you understand.

412
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,430
Just keep quiet and wait
for the wedding ceremony.

413
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,765
- I said I refuse.

414
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,726
- In that case,
perhaps I should add

415
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,145
Yuushun Tei's life
to the balance.

416
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,856
- And what is that
supposed to mean?

417
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,068
- It would be such a simple
thing to burn that tower down.

418
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,944
- Huh.

419
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,074
- In his case, there's
no need to worry,

420
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,951
the two of us already
decided together

421
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,994
that we would transfer
all authority as Governors

422
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,996
to you with the
best possible stake,

423
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,958
so I ask you to put
your trust in Yuushun.

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,002
- Okay, Yensei, if
I doubt you now,

425
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,546
it'll put everything
I've done to shame.

426
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,674
You've supported Sa Province
and its people for 10 years,

427
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,719
who can I trust if
I can't trust you?

428
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,512
I declare my refusal.

429
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,431
- What did you say?

430
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:08,226
- I declare my refusal,
that's what I said.

431
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,854
- So you don't care if
everything goes up in flames

432
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,605
because of your selfishness.

433
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,774
- Since I do not actually
believe everything will be

434
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:18,153
going up in flames, I
will repeat, I refuse.

435
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,947
- Then you shall remain
in this residence

436
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,241
until the deadline for you
to arrive at your assignment

437
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,993
has passed.

438
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,037
When that happens, you will
be immediately be relieved

439
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,621
of your position as Governor,

440
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,957
and the precious Governor's
seal that was given to you

441
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,209
will lose its
validity and power.

442
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,128
- That's all right.

443
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,672
You may as well know the truth.

444
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,132
Before I came here,

445
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,801
I made sure to write an
official Governor, Eigetsu To,

446
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,054
it stated that all authority
would be transferred to him

447
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,847
in case of an emergency.

448
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,808
I left the Governor's
seal with him as well.

449
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,143
Even if the deadline
for arriving

450
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,645
at my assignment has
passed, nothing will change,

451
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,814
other than the fact that there
will be one less Governor.

452
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,858
- What, but didn't you
come here as Governor

453
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,652
to witness and celebrate
the selection of the new

454
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,071
head of the Sa clan?

455
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,281
- No, I did not, I came
here as a private individual

456
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,618
to search for two things
while in your residence.

457
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,036
- Hm.

458
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,663
- Rest assured, a Governor
will attend the ceremony.

459
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,083
Governor To will arrive here
on the day of the selection

460
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,002
in full formality,
accompanied by Ensei Ro,

461
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,545
the lieutenant Governor.

462
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,256
- You'll pay for
mocking me, girl.

463
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,219
When you see every region
of Sa Province burn.

464
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,888
When you see it in flames
on the day of the ceremony,

465
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,808
you will regret every
obstinate word you've said.

466
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,228
- Hm.

467
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,818
(breathes heavily)

468
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,992
They say that a man's
word is his bond.

469
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,163
But a woman's word
is her bond as well.

470
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,021
- That witch.

471
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,026
(intense music)

472
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,723
