1
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,592
(theme note)

2
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:15,473
(sings in foreign language)

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,349
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,727
(soft music)

5
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,357
- [Narrator] Recently, the
king of Saiunkoku Ryuuki Shi

6
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,526
has been completely absorbed
in writing up the draft

7
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,985
for a certain bill.

8
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,738
It seems he's worked right
through the night again.

9
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,241
- At last, it's
finally finished.

10
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,202
Now this is done I
can go and see Shurei.

11
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,704
It's been too long.

12
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,832
I've been restraining
my desire to see her

13
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,208
until this was finished.

14
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,336
Since I have court all day,

15
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,880
I'll have to visit her
during the evening.

16
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,300
Isn't this what they you
usually call an evening tryst?

17
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,719
Once Shoka reads this,

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,555
I have no doubt he'll be
more than happy to allow it.

19
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,942
- I was wondering, princess,

20
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,362
isn't the season for
visiting family graves over?

21
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,698
So then, why are you
cleaning this one now?

22
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,660
- Tomorrow's the anniversary
of the day my mother died.

23
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,996
- I see.

24
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,999
(melancolic music)

25
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,298
- Do you have any family, Ensei?

26
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,425
- I used to, a big one.

27
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,843
But back when I was a kid,

28
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,596
bandits broke into our home,
and everyone was killed.

29
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,682
- I'm so sorry.

30
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,351
- It was a long time ago.

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,770
But as for your mother,

32
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,563
I imagine that if she
had you as a daughter,

33
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,358
she must've been very
responsible and good at cooking.

34
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,402
- While she was responsible,

35
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,322
I doubt she was the sort of
cook you imagine she was.

36
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,824
In fact, she was about
as inept as father is.

37
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,452
But she was good
at other things.

38
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,578
For instance, she
was really good

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,038
at picking fruit from the trees.

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,456
- [Ensei] Really,
that's supposed to be

41
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,624
a man's job, isn't it?

42
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,334
- She really liked doing
that sort of thing.

43
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,711
She enjoyed everything
and had fun all the time.

44
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,755
She was always smiling
and full of energy,

45
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,674
and she played with me a lot.

46
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,509
Since I was always
sickly back then,

47
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,594
she was constantly
taking care of me.

48
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,845
- No way, sickly?

49
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,097
Who was sickly?

50
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,766
- I was sickly, I had
a weak constitution

51
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,934
when I was a child.

52
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,352
- You're joking right?

53
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,603
- It's the truth.

54
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,605
The strange thing
is, after mother died

55
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,065
I suddenly got stronger.

56
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,777
- Sounds like your mom must
have been over protective.

57
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,695
- Huh.

58
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,615
On that day,

59
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,534
there was a lot of thunder.

60
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,370
Mother was always in good health

61
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,748
and she was bounding with
energy, and yet suddenly.

62
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,334
I mean she'd just been
laughing the previous day.

63
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,629
At the time I wasn't well,

64
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,923
but once mother stopped moving

65
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,341
I got better.

66
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,761
- Like I said, your
mom was overprotective.

67
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,390
You don't have to hold it in.

68
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,522
- It's all my fault
my mother died,

69
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,649
I sucked the life
right out of her.

70
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,526
- Don't be ridiculous.

71
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,528
- Mother died in my place,

72
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,863
because of me!

73
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,906
(weeps)

74
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,660
I hate summer and thunder.

75
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,496
They take away everything
and everyone I care about.

76
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,834
- If you're like this
every time summer comes,

77
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,586
your mom wouldn't be happy.

78
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,047
I lost my family
in the summer too,

79
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,715
but hey, you know something?

80
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,468
I actually like the summer.

81
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,845
That's because I still
have so many happy memories

82
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:04,721
of the season.

83
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,806
How 'bout you, princess?

84
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,809
- I've forgotten all
those other things.

85
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,978
- I'm sure you
can remember them.

86
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,440
And when you do, no doubt
you'll like summer too.

87
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,649
Besides, it's probably time

88
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,860
you start thinking
about growing up.

89
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,029
If you just make
everyone worry about you,

90
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,697
you're still a child.

91
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,158
Now that you've cried
to me about this,

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,743
you can be strong, can't you?

93
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,871
- You're a very kind

94
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,040
and very strict
person, aren't you?

95
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,668
- Well you know it's all
part of being a good man.

96
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,753
- You can say that

97
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,922
after you shave off
this unruly beard.

98
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,634
- Not being able to appreciate
the wild appeal of this look

99
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,553
proves that you're
still very much a child.

100
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,554
- By tomorrow.

101
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,892
I'll be better by the
anniversary of mother's death.

102
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:51,893
I promise you.

103
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,730
- You've taken one step closer

104
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,649
to becoming a good
woman, princess.

105
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,945
- Koyu.

106
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,823
I finished reviewing
and rewriting this
letter you gave me.

107
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,825
So, what's next on the agenda?

108
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,577
- He's in a strangely
good mood, isn't he?

109
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,079
- It's kinda creepy.

110
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,497
- [Ryuuki] Koyu.

111
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,873
- Your majesty, forgive me,

112
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,917
but you haven't eaten
anything strange have you?

113
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,836
Like mushrooms growing
who knows where,

114
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,588
or suspicious plants
or bugs or garbage

115
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,756
or things like that?

116
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,466
- What on earth do
you take me for?

117
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,594
If you must know,
tonight's the night

118
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,638
I'm going to have
an evening tryst.

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,597
- Evening tryst?
- Evening tryst?

120
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,849
- Yes indeed.

121
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,810
I even sent a letter to
Shoka about the matter.

122
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,520
He replied that
it would be fine.

123
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,814
- If I may ask, what did
you write in your letter?

124
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,816
- I will come to
visit in the evening.

125
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,569
If possible, I'd like to have
Shurei prepare me a meal.

126
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,279
I'd also like to hear
her play the erhu.

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,947
I would love to spend
an evening together

128
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,449
with you and Seiran as well.

129
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,952
I'm free four nights hence, let
me know if it would be okay.

130
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,620
- That's not a tryst at all!

131
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,705
- That's no more than a visit

132
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,206
to someone's home your majesty.

133
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,793
If your majesty is
going to visit Shurei,

134
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,671
then can I assume that
the draft is complete?

135
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,131
- Yes I finally finished it.

136
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,799
- I see, good work.

137
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,968
But if you truly want to have
Shurei by your side again,

138
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,137
what's stopping you from
simply formally demanding

139
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,973
that she re-enter
the royal residence.

140
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,101
- Shurei left the royal
residence of her own free will.

141
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,853
If I forced her to
return once more,

142
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,938
there's no doubt she'd
be very angry with me.

143
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,774
- But you've already
been in trouble with her

144
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,942
many times before.

145
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,695
- I feel that this time
it would be different.

146
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,197
If I forced her,

147
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,116
I feel like it would break
things between the two of us.

148
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,743
- So you do understand.

149
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,206
Well hang in there,
your majesty.

150
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,209
I still believe you
have a lot of potential.

151
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,838
- This room is rather lonely
without those two in it.

152
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,924
Don't you agree, Odu?

153
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,842
- Don't call me by that name.

154
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,135
- Why ever not?

155
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,845
There's only the two of us here.

156
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,598
Well at any rate,

157
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,935
maybe we can ask assistant
secretary Li to keep them here?

158
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,645
Ensei may not be able to stay,

159
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,854
but hopefully Shu can.

160
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,606
- That won't be possible.

161
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,149
- Why's that?

162
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,694
- Have you really not
figured it out yet?

163
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,361
- Huh?

164
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,696
Figured what out?

165
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,780
- [Bandit] They went that way!

166
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,739
- [Bandit] Get them!

167
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,575
(glass shatters)

168
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,663
- [Shurei] Hey,
what's going on here?

169
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,795
- That scar on
your face, why you!

170
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,089
(footsteps)

171
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,720
(chair slams)

172
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,975
- Damn, last one got away.

173
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,102
- Oh wow, amazing!

174
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,900
- Right, I'll go and explain
to the guards what happened.

175
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,906
It seems they've discovered
your whereabouts.

176
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,241
Unless I missed my guess,

177
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,909
there'll be a large
number of visitors

178
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,203
forcing their way in to
see you this evening.

179
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,289
If you wish, you
can use my place.

180
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,917
I would imagine you don't
want to 'cause trouble

181
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,878
where you're staying, do you?

182
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,047
- You're right,
I'm very grateful.

183
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,758
Since that's the case,
you'll be coming too Shu.

184
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,051
- Huh?

185
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,260
- Don't worry about it,

186
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,055
I'll be sure to send a
note back to your folks.

187
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,140
- What's this supposed to mean?

188
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,100
- [Seiran] I am so
very, very sorry.

189
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,770
I was planning to tell my
daughter as soon as she got home

190
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,647
that your majesty would be
coming to visit this evening.

191
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,942
- Well, talk about bad timing.

192
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,944
- Shall we give up and
go on back to the palace?

193
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,780
- Look, shut up!

194
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,074
For starters, why are
you two even here?

195
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,953
- Because it looked like it'd
be fun to watch, obviously.

196
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,081
- That's it, I'm going
to this residence.

197
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,458
Who in the world is this
Ensei person anyway?

198
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,294
- Uh, he's an old friend
of mine from way back.

199
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,129
He's been staying with us.

200
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,173
In any case, I'm going as well.

201
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,386
If the rest of you are
planning to come too,

202
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,929
please be sure to bring a sword.

203
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,305
- A sword, why's that?

204
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,890
- The bandits that have
made their way here

205
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,100
from Sa province,

206
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,976
seem to be chasing
after a certain man.

207
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,478
He has a distinguishing
mark on him

208
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,481
that is very similar
to that of our guest.

209
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,359
It's no doubt Ensei has been
mistaken for that person.

210
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,197
- How did I end up drinking
tea in a place like this?

211
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,159
- That's senior
secretary Ko for you.

212
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,994
It is a wonderful residence,

213
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,204
and of course I have no doubt

214
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,790
your garden is equally
wonderful to match.

215
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,292
Would you mind if I go take
a little walk around it?

216
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,210
- Ensei!

217
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,005
- Very well, do as you please.

218
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,798
- Well then, I'll
go take a look.

219
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,514
(sips tea)

220
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,808
- Oh boy, this is
really awkward.

221
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,310
- The promised one month
is almost over, isn't it?

222
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,186
- Pardon?

223
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,274
Yes, although I wasn't
able to be much help.

224
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,193
- It's too bad.

225
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,904
- Sorry sir, did
you say something?

226
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,239
- No, nothing.

227
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,744
(grunts)

228
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,371
- Ah, Seiran, you came
to join me after all.

229
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,040
But I must admit,

230
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,042
I didn't expect you to bring
all these people with you.

231
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,752
- So, you're Ensei?

232
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,795
- Oh, a new face.

233
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,047
- What do you have against us?

234
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,214
I mean me.

235
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,924
You ruined all my
plans for the evening!

236
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,885
- Calm down your majesty.

237
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,844
- Your majesty?

238
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,764
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

239
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,224
- Oh, hello there
assistant secretary Li.

240
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,144
Princess and secrety Ko
are in that building.

241
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,104
Could you explain
things to them.

242
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,857
- Yeah, I got it.

243
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,487
- I'll go with you, I'm
going to see Shurei too.

244
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,448
- And, just why
did you come here?

245
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,159
- To help out.

246
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,372
- Looks like they're
here at last.

247
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,543
(grunts)

248
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,008
(staff whipping through air)

249
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,010
(yells)

250
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,138
- Ensei, didn't I warn
you not to cause trouble?

251
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,268
- I tried not to, that's why
I borrowed this residence.

252
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,312
- But you also
involved her ladyship.

253
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,981
- That wasn't my fault,
we were seen together.

254
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,110
There was a chance she'd
be taken as a hostage.

255
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,069
- What do you mean?

256
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,862
Who the heck are you, anyway?

257
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,906
- Yeah, I was wondering
about that too.

258
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,409
- Good point, we'll
talk about that.

259
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,037
But how bout 'later, okay?

260
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,292
(dramatic music)

261
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,964
- What did you just say?

262
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,258
- My lord Kijin, what I said was

263
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,260
the ones fighting the
bandits in your garden

264
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,597
include Seiran Si, Shuei Ran,
and his majesty the king.

265
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,727
- Hmm, the stupid king.

266
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,397
Lord Shoka's daughter is
in the room over there.

267
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,733
I advise you to go and see her.

268
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,359
- Wait, you said daughter?

269
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,112
- Go, you are not the one

270
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,281
with whom I need to
discuss this matter.

271
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,658
(soft music)

272
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,120
Assistant secretary Li.

273
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,288
- Yes?

274
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,206
- In the end, those
two were quite helpful.

275
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,127
- I'm pleased to hear
that secretary Ko.

276
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,298
- So, you finished up?

277
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,174
- Yeah

278
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,177
- What happened here?

279
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,471
- Shurei!

280
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,638
- Huh?

281
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,390
And what the heck
are you doing here?

282
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,600
- Well, uh.

283
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,019
- Look, could somebody
tell me what's going on?

284
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,229
Where's Ensei?

285
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,189
- Ensei?

286
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,648
Come to think of it.

287
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,317
How dare he leave!

288
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,610
He caused this mess!

289
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,652
He's run away.

290
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,779
- [Ensei] No I haven't

291
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,077
- Who?
- Who?

292
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,495
- It's me you idiots!

293
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,372
Honestly, all I did
was shave my beard

294
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,790
and cut my bangs a little.

295
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,707
- Ensei?

296
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,294
- What is it,
what's the problem?

297
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,381
- Due to certain circumstances,

298
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,466
I sent my assistant to
attend your coronation,

299
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,218
so this is first time we've met.

300
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,179
I am the governor
of Sa province,

301
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,097
Ensei Ro.

302
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,765
- Sa province's governor?

303
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,183
- You're kidding me.

304
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,643
- Despite not taking
the national exams,

305
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,104
he was made head of the
provincial administration.

306
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,106
He's the exception
of exceptions.

307
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,524
- Without taking the exams?

308
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,484
I didn't know that was possible.

309
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,653
- And what brings the
governor of Sa province

310
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,154
here to Kyo city?

311
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,155
- In case you're not aware,

312
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,407
the Sa clan has a history

313
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,325
of trying to claim
all regional power

314
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,370
in order to avoid the central
imperial government's hold.

315
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,621
- But my understanding was that

316
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,124
when Enjun Sa, the man
who became adviser Sa,

317
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,084
claimed his position
as head of the family,

318
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,752
he successfully
resolved the issue.

319
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,796
- Yes, but only
for a little while.

320
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,423
When lord Enjun was relocated

321
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,633
to Shi province, to
remain by the king's side,

322
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,885
he was no longer able to
watch over Sa province

323
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,220
and his family.

324
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,805
As a result, there
was little he could do

325
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,515
to stop the Sa
clan from plotting

326
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,267
against the top
provincial officials.

327
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,393
Some of them were brought out

328
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,270
and ended up becoming
puppet rulers,

329
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,564
while others resisted
and were assassinated.

330
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,315
- No way, that's.

331
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,109
- It's a terrible
situation, isn't it?

332
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,360
As a result, no one wanted

333
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,821
to become head of the
provincial government.

334
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,323
- And so adviser
Sa supposedly said

335
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,575
someone who was
supposed to defeat

336
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,577
any assassins should be
assigned as the governor

337
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,746
in order to assure they
would not be coerced.

338
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,123
That man would be
you, I take it.

339
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,167
- Yes, that's right.

340
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,627
It's true, I have confidence
in my physical strength,

341
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,172
but I haven't passed
the qualifying exams,

342
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,715
let along the national exam.

343
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,885
So I was assigned the post
on a temporary basis only.

344
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,261
- Temporary or not,

345
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,472
advisor Sa perceived
the matter correctly.

346
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,058
The newly appointed
provincial governor

347
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,852
was able to fight off any
assassin that tried to sneak in.

348
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,228
But that's not all.

349
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,855
I've heard his administration
of political matters

350
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,315
has also been excellent.

351
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,567
Granted, an extremely capable
assistant administrator

352
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,735
was sent to help.

353
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,278
But he made all
the final decisions

354
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,654
and showed everyone

355
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,449
who the head of the Sa
provincial government really is.

356
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,867
On top of that,

357
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,786
he completely ignored any
attempts by the Sa clan

358
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,746
to either bribe or threaten him.

359
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,498
- Please, you're
embarrassing me.

360
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,918
But, it's time I got
to the main issue.

361
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,544
The reason I came
to the capital,

362
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,756
was to put both of these
in the king's safe keeping.

363
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,383
- I don't understand,

364
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,635
these are the seal and badge
of the governor of Sa province.

365
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,762
- Ever since the
death of lord Enjun,

366
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,971
I'm afraid that the Sa family

367
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,890
has become very
active once more.

368
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,434
- In that case, why
did you come here?

369
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,811
You're needed in your province

370
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,479
to suppress the Sa clan.

371
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,439
- I would have done
just that, your majesty,

372
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,359
if I were truly able to
declare myself governor.

373
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,777
- What?

374
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,530
- My sponsor, lord Enjun,
is no longer with us.

375
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,324
And since I haven't
passed the national exams,

376
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,659
all it takes is for
someone to state

377
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,994
they won't accept me
as a formal official.

378
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,913
That is the reason I came here.

379
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,791
To see what kind of
person the new king is,

380
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,793
and what sort of
people he has with him.

381
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,378
After I got a clear
understanding of that,

382
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,380
I wanted to speak with him.

383
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,882
- [Ryuuki] Why were you
being hunted by the bandits?

384
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,509
- My best guess is
that the Sa clan

385
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,678
put a big fat price on my head.

386
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,388
I did cut down on my sleep time

387
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,390
to hunt the bandits, but still.

388
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,017
- We understand
the circumstances.

389
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,977
And we'll write a formal
letter of authority.

390
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,729
- I already told you.

391
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,605
I haven't passed
the national exams.

392
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,442
There's no point in
repeating the problem.

393
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,694
Instead of that, my advice

394
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,820
is to take this opportunity

395
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,363
and assign a
legitimate governor,

396
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,990
that no one will be
able to object to.

397
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,576
- [Ryuuki] And what will
you do in the mean time?

398
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,536
- Return to Sa province.

399
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,581
There's much I can do, even
without being a full governor.

400
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,793
- Ensei, we have
an order for you.

401
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:24,961
- Yes?

402
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,713
- At least pass the
qualifying exams.

403
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,256
That way, we can
still assign you

404
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,342
to the post of
lieutenant governor.

405
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,886
- There's already a very
capable lieutenant governor,

406
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,013
but I'll still take the exam.

407
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,848
Because it's always
been my dream

408
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,559
to become an administrator
of Sa province.

409
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,353
Since coming here,
I've began to feel

410
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,522
that it would be all right
to start all over again.

411
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,566
(mellow music)

412
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,443
- Honestly, why
is it I'm the one

413
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,861
who has to cook at
this time of night,

414
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,446
at someone else's home?

415
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,573
- I did send a
letter to warn you,

416
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,700
I was supposed to be
coming for dinner today.

417
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,869
- Well I didn't know about it!

418
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,621
- I just wanted to visit you.

419
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,498
Are you really not
happy to see me?

420
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,376
- It doesn't feel
like it's been so long

421
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,627
since we've seen each other,

422
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,878
I guess because of all
those strange letters

423
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,922
and gifts you keep sending.

424
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,800
But I am happy to see
you in person again.

425
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,427
- So did you read
all of my letters?

426
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,887
- Yes, I've been reading them.

427
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,391
But using such expensive
paper to write a single line?

428
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,850
It rains, so the
carp were happy.

429
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,644
What's that supposed to mean?

430
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,603
It's strange.

431
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,105
- It's Shurei's advice.

432
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,065
He said the more faithfully
I wrote letters, the better.

433
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,734
- Yes, but the content
is what's important.

434
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,069
- And the gifts that I sent?

435
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,779
How were the big ice blocks?

436
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,030
- We made shaved ice treats

437
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,365
and had them with all the kids.

438
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,074
They were delicious

439
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,118
and fantastically cool.

440
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,369
- [Ryuuki] And the eggs?

441
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,037
You told me once that
you like them boiled.

442
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,539
- [Shurei] I shared
them with the neighbors,

443
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,416
we all enjoyed eating them.

444
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,500
- [Ryuuki] And the red flowers,

445
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,127
I thought they were beautiful.

446
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,920
- [Shurei] Yes, they
are, very much so,

447
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,797
I'm pressing them in some books.

448
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,465
- [Ryuuki] And the voodoo doll?

449
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,009
- [Shurei] On
display in my room.

450
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,928
- Hey Seiran, is the
voodoo doll a prank gift?

451
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,389
- No I'm afraid his
majesty honestly believes

452
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,932
that it's completely
appropriate.

453
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,434
- Actually, come to thing of it,

454
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,893
I brought you a gift today too.

455
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,817
- This is.

456
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,736
- The sapling should
arrive tomorrow some time,

457
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,989
but I thought I'd give you
a branch for now as a token.

458
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,574
You mentioned a long time ago

459
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,993
that the cherry trees in
your garden no longer bloom.

460
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,040
- I'm so happy.

461
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,084
Thank you, this one's
the best gift of all!

462
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,294
We'll plant that sapling,

463
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,088
some day it'll blossom
with beautiful flowers.

464
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,054
(gasps)

465
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,399
- Is it just me,
or did something
unbelievable just happen?

466
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,026
Ryuuki.

467
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,111
- What is it?

468
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,072
- Do me a favor
and let me hit you.

469
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,741
- Why are you angry?

470
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,702
- Even if I explained,

471
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,454
you probably
wouldn't understand!

472
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,664
- But, you're not
being reasonable!

473
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,877
- Oh boy, I swear those
two will never change.

474
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,128
- Uh, hey, aren't you angry

475
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,964
that he's made a move
on your dear princess.

476
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,050
- It's really nothing
to worry about,

477
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,927
not to mention, with this,

478
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,013
her ladyship won't cry anymore
when she looks at the garden.

479
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,223
- Hey let go!

480
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,141
- Come on now, give
it up already you.

481
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,895
I'll see you later then, Ryuuki,

482
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,606
and remember behave
yourself at the palace.

483
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,159
- Shurei.

484
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,664
Would you be interested in
taking the national exams?

485
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,082
- Huh?

486
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,625
- His majesty and I
intend to have a bill

487
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,752
allowing women to take
the civil service exams

488
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,671
passed within the year.

489
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,256
But even if you pass,

490
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,675
there's no doubt the road you
take will be extremely harsh.

491
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,969
As a woman, you might not be
given any meaningful work,

492
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,595
your opinions could be ignored,

493
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,472
and you may be
scorned and ridiculed.

494
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:08,226
In the end, you'll have
to work hard on your own.

495
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,979
Despite that, will
you still do it?

496
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,733
- I will.

497
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,526
Please let me do this.

498
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,236
I want to become
a real official.

499
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:20,822
- Atta girl.

500
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,702
- Please, I hope
you'll guide me.

501
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,246
(mellow music)

502
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,670
Keep watching me mother,

503
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,005
I swear I'll do my best.

504
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,222
- I guess it's time to
say goodbye princess.

505
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,850
- If you ever collapse
by the roadside again,

506
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,560
do it in front of our place.

507
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,896
- Please, anywhere
else I'm begging you.

508
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,857
- Aw, and we were supposed
to be friends, how cold.

509
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,984
Princess is so good
and sweet tempered

510
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,194
in comparison to you!

511
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,654
You know, it would
be really interesting

512
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,740
if you ended up
becoming my superior.

513
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:09,162
Nevermind, the main thing is
to do your best on the exam.

514
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,914
- You really don't
need to tell me that,

515
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,957
they say all good things
come to those who wait,

516
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,125
and this is truly a chance

517
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,002
I've been waiting
a long time for.

518
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,545
- True.

519
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,006
Well, princess, Seiran, you
both take care of yourselves.

520
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,222
- [Narrator] At
the end of summer,

521
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,724
a certain bill was
passed in court.

522
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,267
It was for women to
be given the right

523
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,687
to take the national exams.

524
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,231
The senior secretaries of
civil affairs and finance,

525
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,732
who were rumored
to be candidates

526
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,317
to become the next
prime minister

527
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,027
both gave their approval.

528
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,030
As a result, all
opposition was overwhelmed,

529
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,240
and the bill passed.

530
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,911
- Thank you so much Ryuuki.

531
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,330
(soft music)

532
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,892
- [Enjun] Sho, you
foolish old idiot.

533
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:16,688
How dare you go and try
something so absurd.

534
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,190
- Forgive me Enjun, but
since you've left us,

535
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,651
things have been
growing more troubled.

536
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,236
Especially in Sa province.

537
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,286
Welcome back, my old friend.

538
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:50,680
(sings in foreign language)

539
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,058
(soft music)

540
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,878
- [Shurei] I'm sick
in bed with a fever,

541
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,796
Seiran?

542
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,214
Father?

543
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,049
Huh, why is Ryuuki here?

544
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,428
Am I seeing things now
because of this fever?
