{\an8}(bright electronic music)

2
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:16,766
{\an8}(gentle music)
(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,356
(solemn string music)

4
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,025
- [Narrator] A long,
long time ago, in an era

5
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,904
when demons of the mountain
forests ravaged the lands,

6
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,282
a young man came forth from
amidst the endless chaos.

7
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,203
Seeking to bring peace
and order to the people,

8
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,123
he beat back the
rampaging demons.

9
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,333
Moved by the man's
courage and spirit,

10
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,085
eight enlightened
beings gathered

11
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,796
to join him, using
their mysterious powers

12
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,173
to assist the young
man in his quest.

13
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,092
As each bore the
name of a color,

14
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,846
they came to be called the
Eight Colored Enlightened Ones.

15
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,931
The young man's name was So Gen.

16
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,142
With the wisdom of the
Eight Enlightened Ones,

17
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,728
he brought a new dawn
to the world of men.

18
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,355
He became the first
ruler of Saiunkoku,

19
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,941
the Kingdom of the
Colored Clouds.

20
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,484
(solemn music)

21
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,111
- After So Gen's death,

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,989
the Eight Colored
Enlightened Ones disappeared,

23
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,826
but it is often said that they
still live among the people.

24
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,494
So it may be that, even now,

25
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,997
{\an8}they are right here,
living alongside us.

26
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,124
{\an8}(suspenseful music)

27
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,751
{\an8}(Shurei giggles)

28
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,295
(bright music)

29
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,841
(children laughing)

30
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,260
- Um, hey, hey
there, Ms. Shurei.

31
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,553
- What is it, Toka?

32
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,763
- [Toka] I head that the shrine

33
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,972
where the Enlightened Ones used

34
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,974
to live still exists
at the palace.

35
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,142
Is that true?

36
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,769
- Yes, now it's
called the Ministry

37
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,228
of the Enlightened Ones Cave

38
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,315
and stands in a corner
of the imperial grounds,

39
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,400
or so Seiran tells me.

40
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,569
- You haven't seen
it, Ms. Shurei?

41
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,988
- I'm not allowed
to enter the palace.

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,866
That's because girls cannot
become government officials.

43
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,576
- In that case, I'll
become a court official,

44
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,453
and you can marry
me, Ms. Shurei.

45
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,289
That way, I can take you
into the palace, right?

46
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,499
- If you want to do that,

47
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,542
you'll have to study
a lot harder, Ryushin.

48
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,002
- Huh?
- If you ask me,

49
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,296
I think you'd make a much better
military officer (laughs).

50
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,172
(door rattles)

51
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
- [All] Huh?

52
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,176
- [Shurei] Seiran.

53
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,804
{\an8}- Hello, my lady.

54
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,932
It's almost time.

55
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:44,808
- Yes.

56
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,061
Right, today's work awaits.

57
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,355
Come on, let's get going.

58
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,941
(gentle music)

59
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,901
- [Sa] The daughter
of the Hong clan?

60
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,069
- [Sho] That's correct.

61
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,113
Her father, Shoka
Hong, is in charge

62
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,948
of the imperial archives.

63
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,367
- [Sa] The Hong clan is one
of the most distinguished

64
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,952
of the noble families.

65
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,121
There's no problem with her
family lineage, but, uh--

66
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,081
- [So] But an archivist's
salary is not likely

67
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,207
to be very much.

68
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,459
- [Sho] Indeed.

69
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,837
They're having difficulties
making ends meet,

70
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,632
and apparently, his daughter's
working several jobs.

71
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,093
- And you believe that
this girl will be useful

72
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,470
in solving such a
major problem, Sho?

73
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,347
- [Sho] I'm sure of it.

74
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,640
- It's been almost six months

75
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,976
since His Majesty
ascended to the throne.

76
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,477
I had hoped things
would turn out better

77
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,687
than they have, but--

78
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,189
- At this rate, it's
only a matter of time

79
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,150
before a usurper goes
after the throne.

80
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,526
- Hmm?

81
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,486
That's certainly true.

82
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,406
- In any case, leave this to me.

83
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,366
It's a matter of common sense.

84
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,620
They always say that a man's
greatest enemy is his wife.

85
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,497
(Sho chuckles)

86
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,544
(solemn music)
(people chattering)

87
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,059
(birds twittering)

88
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,189
- Hmm.

89
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,025
- Seiran!
- Hmm?

90
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,403
Oh, Ryushin, what's the matter?

91
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,238
- It's Mr. Shoka.

92
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,156
- Hmm?

93
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,450
- Hmm.

94
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,994
Why has father called me
back home, all of a sudden?

95
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,204
- I believe it's something

96
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,122
about an important guest
coming to pay a visit.

97
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,332
- Well, who is it?

98
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,042
- I don't know, but
Master said you were

99
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,127
to return immediately,
so he must need you there

100
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,170
to meet the visitor.

101
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,589
Huh?
- Why me?

102
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,548
It's not fair.

103
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,676
That was a pretty good job, too.

104
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,011
But since I only
played one song,

105
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,347
they took a giant
chunk outta my pay!

106
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,683
(sighs) And here I was
thinking we'd be able

107
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,226
to buy rice this month.

108
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,395
But it'll be barley again!

109
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,021
That line down the middle of it,

110
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,565
that line that
distinguishes it from rice,

111
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,401
no doubt this month too,
it's going to taunt me

112
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,695
and laugh at me,
saying I'm not rice.

113
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,196
Oh, I can't believe it.

114
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,572
I can't believe it!

115
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,409
- (chuckles) My lady, I
don't think barley talks.

116
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,576
It will be fine.

117
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,579
I'll take on a few
more side jobs, too.

118
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,123
- I'm sorry, Seiran.

119
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,167
You'd be able to
support yourself

120
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,752
as an imperial
officer of the court,

121
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,171
if you only had yourself
to take care of.

122
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,174
- That's not something you
need to worry about, my lady.

123
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,510
The truth is, I'm just happy
to have the opportunity

124
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,595
to repay the debt that I owe.

125
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,972
- Repay the debt?

126
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,101
(Seiran sighs)

127
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,229
- [Seiran] 13 years ago, your
family took me into your home,

128
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,440
even though you had no
idea about who I was

129
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,108
or where I came from.

130
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,610
I decided to spend the
rest of my life paying you

131
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,654
and your father back
for that kindness.

132
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,116
- Seiran.

133
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,993
(people laughing)

134
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,494
Mm.
(people chattering)

135
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,079
Oh man!

136
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,248
Why is our family
paid so little?

137
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,750
Yeah, we're of high rank,

138
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,792
but no money to go with it.
- My lady, please calm down.

139
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,252
People are watching.
- I hate this!

140
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,253
You hear me?

141
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,172
I really hate being poor!

142
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,383
Ah!

143
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,344
The wall's collapsing again,

144
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,803
and the roof tiles are broken.

145
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,805
Maintaining this
ridiculously large mansion

146
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,307
takes up so much money.

147
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,143
As soon as you repair one thing,
something else falls apart.

148
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,561
I can't stand it!

149
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,271
- [Seiran] I'll take care
of repairing the wall.

150
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,773
And I can get some
tiles from the castle

151
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,940
to replace the broken ones.

152
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,442
- [Man] Ah, what a
lovely home you have.

153
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,486
- Oh, why us?

154
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,487
Hmm?
- Huh?

155
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,654
(playful music)

156
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,656
It seems the guest
has already arrived.

157
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,532
- Oh no!

158
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,117
I have to prepare the tea.

159
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,285
(footsteps clopping)

160
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,411
- While you do that,
I'll inform them

161
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,163
that your ladyship has returned.

162
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,667
(Shurei groans)

163
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,876
- Well, Father, I guess

164
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,253
at least you made the
effort to serve tea.

165
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,048
(playful music)

166
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,678
- My lady, this is serious.

167
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,388
- What's the matter, Seiran?

168
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,556
- Apparently, the, the guest is,

169
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,599
it's Advisor Sho.

170
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,686
(Shurei gasps)

171
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:02,065
- Ah, Advisor Sho,
of the Three Elders?

172
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,155
Why would such an
important person come here?

173
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,365
- He said that there's
student he wishes

174
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,200
to discuss with you,
as soon as possible.

175
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,076
- But why me?

176
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,080
Oh, whatever the reason, we
must not show any disrespect.

177
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,166
- Ever since I was put in
charge of the archives,

178
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,543
I've been enjoying
my work very much.

179
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,711
(knocks at door)
Oh?

180
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,671
- [Seiran] Lady
Shurei has arrived.

181
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,172
- Oh, come in.

182
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,094
- Please excuse me.

183
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,099
- Ah, Shurei, I'd like
you to meet Advisor Sho.

184
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,439
- So this is Advisor Sho,
the leader of 100 advisors.

185
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,567
They say his authority ranks
second only to the king's.

186
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,693
(Shurei gulps)

187
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,446
(playful music)

188
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,410
Lord Advisor Sho, I must
ask your forgiveness

189
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,495
for keeping you waiting so long.

190
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,706
Although we are humble and
have little to offer you,

191
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,000
I pray you will make
yourself comfortable.

192
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,337
- There's no need for that.

193
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,629
Stand up, Shurei.

194
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,424
- Yes, sir.

195
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,634
- Seiran, would you mind
coming over here, as well?

196
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,262
After all, this matter
concerns both of you.

197
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,638
- [Both] Huh?

198
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,390
- But before that,

199
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,769
may I possibly ask for some tea?

200
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,396
This water alone is making
me feel rather chilly.

201
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,606
- A bucket?

202
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,107
You mean he brought
water directly

203
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,360
from the well for a guest?

204
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,486
Father!

205
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,071
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,489
- [Shurei] Why are you acting

207
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,656
so proud of what you did?
- The water from our well

208
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,783
is quite delicious, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,118
- [Shurei] I'm so
terribly sorry, my lord.

210
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,245
I'll prepare some tea
for you, right away.

211
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,290
- Hmm?

212
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,502
So you made all these sweet
red bean buns yourself, Shurei?

213
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,087
- Yes.

214
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,381
- Shurei's sweet bean
buns are quite delectable.

215
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,632
- If I may?

216
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,675
Mm, mm.

217
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,511
This really is delicious.

218
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,430
- (chuckles) I added ground
sesame to the red bean paste

219
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,640
to reduce the sweetness.

220
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,225
You won't be able
to stop eating them.

221
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,769
- This truly is
a wonderful dish.

222
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,563
Shoka, you are most fortunate
to have such a daughter.

223
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,148
- Thank you.

224
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,526
(Shurei laughs)

225
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,568
- My lord.

226
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,403
- Huh?
- You wished to talk

227
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,779
to us about something?

228
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,489
- Oh yes, I do, indeed.

229
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,659
Shurei, Seiran, there
is a favor I would like

230
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,743
to ask of you both.

231
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,497
If you agree to it, then
as a token of my gratitude,

232
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,834
I am prepared to
pay you this amount.

233
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,585
- [All] Huh?

234
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,171
- So how much exactly
are we talking about,

235
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,549
50 copper coins, 500?

236
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,384
(Sho chuckles)

237
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,802
(Shurei gasps)

238
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,723
No way, this could actually
be a really sweet deal.

239
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,434
You're not suggesting
five silver coins?

240
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,187
50 silver coins?

241
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,401
(suspenseful music)

242
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,531
Hmm?

243
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,327
- It's 500 gold coins!

244
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,122
(dramatic music)

245
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:10,587
- Gold?

246
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,756
500?

247
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,384
- Hmm.

248
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,846
- I'll do it, no
matter what it is.

249
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,431
You can count on me!

250
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,100
{\an8}(gentle music)

251
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,272
(solemn music)

252
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,202
So this is the palace?

253
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,372
Incredible, it's many times
bigger than our little home.

254
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,750
And from now on, I'm supposed
to live in such a grand place?

255
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,251
What am I gonna do, Seiran?

256
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,753
- Well, it can't be helped now.

257
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,671
(ethereal music)

258
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,256
Uh, my lady, don't be hasty.

259
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,258
We don't know what
this job involves yet.

260
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,385
- What are you saying, Seiran?

261
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,928
It's 500 gold coins!

262
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,264
With that much, we'd be able
to eat white rice, every day,

263
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,141
and repair all the
walls and roof tiles,

264
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,518
with some left over.

265
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,354
- Well, in that case,
Seiran will temporarily join

266
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,273
the imperial personal
guard, the Uringun army.

267
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,234
You'll be assigned
directly to the king.

268
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,694
(all gasp)

269
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,904
And as for Shurei,

270
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,281
you are to enter
the king's household

271
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,450
and take on the role
of the king's consort.

272
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,952
(Shoka and Seiran gasp)

273
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,706
- I have to become
the king's consort?

274
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,290
(ethereal music)

275
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,793
Ah, how could I have agreed
to a request like that?

276
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,587
- Well, you did say yes
before hearing him out.

277
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,797
(Shurei sobs)

278
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,173
- [Shurei] What should I do?

279
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,676
Seiran, do something about this.

280
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,971
(quirky music)

281
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,806
(Shurei laughs nervously)

282
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:48,685
- We've been awaiting your
arrival, Consort Hong.

283
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,853
- [Shurei] Consort?

284
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,438
That's gonna take
getting used to.

285
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,605
- [Sho] From now on,

286
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,691
this lady-in-waiting
will be assigned to you.

287
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,526
She is to serve
you and take care

288
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,861
of anything you may need.

289
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,280
- My name is Shusui.

290
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,198
- I have to act like a consort.

291
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,367
I am Shurei Hong.

292
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,746
It is an honor to
meet you, Shusui.

293
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,540
How was that, Seiran?

294
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,875
- Uh--

295
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,669
- Just like that, right?

296
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,879
- [Elders] Hmm.

297
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,591
- Okay, I'm on my way.

298
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,218
(regal music)

299
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,266
So from now on, this is my room?

300
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,020
(Shurei sighs)

301
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:32,896
Now then,

302
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,984
I guess I'll start off by
learning more about the king.

303
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,695
Ryuki Shi, the
king of Saiunkoku,

304
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,572
first, his family background.

305
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,866
Though he was the
youngest of six sons,

306
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,660
four of his five elder
brothers killed one another

307
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,372
in the struggle for the
throne, eight years ago.

308
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,708
The other remaining son had
been exiled long before that,

309
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,628
so as a result, he unexpectedly
rose to the throne.

310
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,256
Huh, in other words, the
throne just fell into his lap.

311
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,717
Now then, for his
government administration,

312
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,469
he doesn't attend court at all

313
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,013
and leaves everything
to his ministers.

314
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,516
So even though he's the
king, he has no interest

315
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,559
in government or
a desire to rule.

316
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,770
And lastly, his private life,

317
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,273
he currently has no consorts
or concubines, except for me.

318
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,110
(men boing)

319
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,530
In fact, rumor has it that the
king prefers men over women.

320
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,533
Ah, what's that
supposed to mean?

321
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,911
Oh jeez, you can't just
slack off for half a year

322
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,664
without even making the
effort to have a royal heir.

323
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,042
(groans) If this keeps up,
the country's gonna collapse.

324
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,628
Now I understand why Advisor
Sho was so desperate.

325
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,504
(ethereal music)

326
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,381
- Please, I beg you,

327
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,300
help His Majesty become the
proper king he should be

328
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,678
within the next six months.

329
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,304
(ethereal music)

330
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,099
- No wonder he was willing
to pay me 500 gold coins.

331
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,727
(groans) Guess I
learned my lesson.

332
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,437
Every good deal has a catch.

333
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,771
(door rattles)
- Pardon me!

334
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,690
- [Shurei] Yes (chuckles)?

335
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,318
- I brought some flower
tea for you, Consort Hong.

336
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,739
- Right, she's one of
the ladies-in-waiting,

337
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,407
Korin, I believe.

338
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,451
Thank you very much, Korin.

339
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,453
(solemn music)

340
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,538
She seems to be about 13.

341
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,832
Oh, she looks so
innocent and cute.

342
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,002
(Korin yells)
(Shurei gasps)

343
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,421
(Shurei sighs)

344
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,715
- (gasps) Oh no, I'm so sorry.

345
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,884
- Don't worry, what about you?

346
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,594
Are you all right?

347
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,470
- Huh?

348
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,387
Ah!

349
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,891
What have I done to
the royal consort?

350
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,685
(Korin sobbing)

351
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,979
- Please calm yourself.

352
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,356
You don't have to cry.

353
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,982
- [Shusui] What
is going on here?

354
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,484
- [Shurei] Shusui?

355
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,569
(Shusui gasps)

356
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,904
- [Shusui] Consort Hong.

357
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,364
- There's no need to worry.

358
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,656
I'm fine.

359
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,866
Please do not scold her.

360
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,494
Allow her to calm
herself, at least.

361
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,870
- Very well, I understand.

362
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,747
Come along with me now, child.

363
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,998
- Yes.

364
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,500
- [Shurei] Korin.

365
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,001
- Hmm?

366
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,753
- When your tears are all
dry, would you be kind enough

367
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,922
to bring me some
flower tea, again?

368
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,839
- Huh?

369
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,009
Oh, yes, ma'am.

370
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,679
(solemn music)

371
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,643
(door clacks)

372
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,396
(Shurei sighs)

373
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,072
(Shurei grunts)

374
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,156
(Shurei sighs)

375
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,074
- Hmm?

376
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,953
Such an impressive
piece of embroidery.

377
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,040
This cup looks expensive, too.

378
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,667
Selling one of these
would bring in enough

379
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,210
to eat for a month.

380
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,920
And we'd would be able
to buy lots of sweets

381
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,631
for the kids at the
temple school, as well.

382
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,800
This guy's living in
luxury without taking care

383
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,051
of his responsibilities,

384
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,720
simply because he's the king.

385
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,889
I won't forgive him for that.

386
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,767
(growls) Well, now that I've
accepted, I'm gonna have

387
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,520
to see it through and
restrain this stupid king.

388
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,022
Hey, it's temporary.

389
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,691
There's a reward, and my room
and board are all covered.

390
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,235
He prefers men, so I don't have
to worry about the evenings.

391
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,779
Maybe this isn't
such a bad deal.

392
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,698
You just wait, Your Majesty.

393
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,535
I'll beat that irresponsible
attitude right out of you.

394
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:15,618
(quirky music)

395
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,328
(quirky music)

396
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,580
Those were my intentions,

397
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,540
but it's been five
days since I arrived.

398
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,585
When am I supposed to get the
chance to even meet this king?

399
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,590
- (sighs) Sure is boring
around here, right, Koyu?

400
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,760
It's not so bad for me, seeing
as I was originally assigned

401
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,678
to guard the king,
but in your case,

402
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,221
you were forcibly
assigned to the king

403
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,431
at Advisor Sho's request

404
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,808
and yet you still have
not had the opportunity

405
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,560
to meet His Majesty.

406
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,729
Now regardless of your
talent as an officer,

407
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,938
if you're not even
given a chance,

408
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,023
you're just dead weight.

409
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,107
(Kyo growls)

410
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,692
Here we are, the best

411
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,986
of the young civil servants
and military officers.

412
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:53,156
We should be rising through
the ranks by now, right?

413
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,574
(Koyu growls)

414
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,283
- Why don't you just
shut the hell up

415
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,118
and get lost, Shuei Ran?

416
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,829
- My, that's no way to speak
to your best friend, is it?

417
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,247
- Who are you
calling best friend?

418
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,791
If you're a bodyguard,
act like one

419
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,584
and stick with that stupid king.

420
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,168
- I can't.

421
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,586
Didn't you know?

422
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,837
The king wanders off as
he wishes, every day,

423
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,632
so I have no idea where
he is or where he goes.

424
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,259
- Damn, does the government
think things are okay like this?

425
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,261
- Well, it seems that
Advisor Sho has come up

426
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,304
with some sort of plan.

427
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,722
- What kind of plan?

428
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,516
- [Shuei] To get a
wife for the king.

429
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,725
- A wife?

430
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,602
Some stupid woman is
gonna change the king?

431
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,812
- As always, your hatred

432
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,147
of those stupid women
remains deep-rooted.

433
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,024
- I still say that nothing
good ever comes out

434
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,192
of dealing with a woman.

435
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,944
- It's such a waste that
after all this time,

436
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,195
you still don't
know the pleasures

437
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,030
of spending the
night with a lady.

438
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,075
You're missing out on half
your life and a lot of fun.

439
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,284
- Never mind that!

440
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,869
Who is this king's wife?
(footsteps clattering)

441
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,037
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

442
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,913
(Kyo gasps)

443
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,872
Speak of the devil.

444
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,000
(gentle music)

445
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,043
(Shurei sighs)

446
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,338
- [Shurei] This is incredible.

447
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,881
- [Shuei Ran] Do
you enjoy reading?

448
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,050
- (gasps) I do.

449
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,802
And you, sir, uh--

450
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,178
- Forgive my impoliteness.

451
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,181
I am Shuei Ran, shogun
of the Left Uringun Army.

452
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,349
And this is--
- Koyu Li,

453
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,934
assistant secretary of personnel

454
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,061
in the Civil Affairs Department.

455
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,771
- I am Shurei Hong.

456
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,981
- Hong?

457
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:08,940
- I wonder, would it
be all right for me

458
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,817
to borrow books from here?

459
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,111
There is much that I have
to study from here on.

460
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,863
- Why, for what purpose?

461
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,782
- (laughs) For the
sake of this country.

462
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,076
- Hmm?
(Koyu gasps)

463
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,370
- Oh, forgive me, if you'd
like, please help yourself

464
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,831
to these sweet bean buns I made.

465
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,584
(gentle music)

466
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,212
Well, then, I shall
borrow this book.

467
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,088
Thank you.

468
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,593
- That's her?

469
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,219
- Yup, the wife of
the stupid king.

470
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,929
She also happens to
be the only daughter

471
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,098
of Lord Shoka, whom
you admire so much.

472
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,268
- The daughter of Lord Shoka.

473
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,772
Do you think the
king will change?

474
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,024
- Hard to say.

475
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,819
But it certainly does
appear that things are about

476
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,405
to become quite interesting.

477
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,617
- Wow, it's so beautiful.

478
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,078
(gentle music)

479
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,246
(Shurei grunting)

480
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,623
I can't reach.

481
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,919
(Shurei grunting)

482
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,755
- [Man] Do you want this?

483
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,631
- Huh?

484
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,717
(wind howls)

485
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,303
(Shurei grunts)

486
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,766
(Shurei sighs)

487
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,060
Huh?
(dramatic music)

488
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,146
- That was quite
the gust of wind.

489
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,439
(Shurei sighs)

490
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,150
(lively music)

491
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,735
(Shurei gasps)

492
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,195
- You broke it.

493
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,781
- That was not my intention,
but the wind startled me,

494
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,282
so I snapped it.

495
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,200
Hmm?

496
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:46,871
Would you like it?

497
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,874
(playful music)

498
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,419
(Shurei laughs)

499
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,879
- You know, all I
wanted were some petals

500
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,464
to float in my tea.

501
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,800
Won't you join me for
some sweet bean buns?

502
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,306
Here you are.

503
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,767
The cherry blossoms
are so beautiful,

504
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,894
so I thought I would
have some tea outside,

505
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,187
while I read my book.

506
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,441
(man gasps)

507
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,359
- Are you Shoka's
daughter, by any chance?

508
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,695
- (gasps) How on
earth did you guess?

509
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,947
- This tastes exactly

510
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,158
like the homemade steamed
buns Shoka often brings.

511
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,702
They're my favorite kind.

512
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,204
- Oh, why, thank you.

513
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,957
Could he be an
acquaintance of Father's?

514
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,709
My name is Shurei Hong.

515
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,169
And your name is?

516
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,296
- My name?
- What do I call you?

517
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,467
- Shuei.

518
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:44,262
We are, uh, no, my
name is Shuei Ran.

519
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,805
- Shuei Ran?

520
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,850
(dramatic music)

521
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,018
(Shurei gasps)

522
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,102
(Shurei growls)

523
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,772
(quirky music)

524
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,859
(Shurei laughs)

525
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,985
- What I want to know is,

526
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,862
why is Shoka's daughter here?

527
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:01,988
- Who, me?

528
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,282
I'm here on an errand
for the palace.

529
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,869
But I'm finding it
difficult to meet the king.

530
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:11,498
How might I be able to meet
with him, Mr. Shuei Ran?

531
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,415
- Hmm?

532
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,004
So you wish to meet the king?

533
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,381
- [Shurei] Yes.

534
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,175
- [Man] What will you
do when you meet him?

535
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,302
What will you accomplish
by meeting him?

536
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,890
- [Shurei] I should
be getting back.

537
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:29,974
(man gasps)

538
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,435
(gentle music)

539
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,066
- You haven't
answered my question.

540
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,319
To tell the truth,
I know the king.

541
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,154
If there's something
you wish to tell him,

542
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,407
I can relay the message.

543
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,410
- The reason I have come to
the palace is to help the king.

544
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,285
- Huh?

545
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,248
- There are other things I
wish to tell him, as well,

546
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,418
but they are the sorts of
matters that only have meaning

547
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,211
if I speak with him directly.

548
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:04,342
(man grunts)
(solemn music)

549
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,347
Until next time, Mr. Shuei Ran.

550
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,149
- So the two of them
have finally met.

551
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,026
- I wonder how
things will proceed.

552
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,902
- Now it is time for us to watch

553
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:26,489
and see how Shurei manages
this challenge before her.

554
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:29,200
(solemn music)

555
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:52,932
{\an8}(gentle music)
(singing in foreign language)

556
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,005
- [Shurei] 500 gold
coins, I'm telling you!

557
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,214
I don't have to think twice

558
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,258
before accepting the
job, whatever it is.

559
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,010
Mind you, I didn't
expect I'd be asked

560
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,886
to become that stupid
king's consort,

561
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,931
{\an8}but I've accepted the job,
so I'll do what it takes.
