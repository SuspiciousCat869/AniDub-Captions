1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,683
{\an8}(melodic music in
foreign language)

2
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,691
- [Narrator] Seiran and
Sakujun Sa are casting dice

3
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,401
with their lives at stake.

4
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,860
They will determine
which of the two

5
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,697
will be the first to drink
the poison in the wine cups.

6
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,410
In the meantime,
with the revelation

7
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,954
of various crimes
committed by the Sa clan,

8
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,664
everyone connected
to the family,

9
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,250
without exception,
has been arrested.

10
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,253
In the midst of the chaos,

11
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,838
Kokujun became the heir apparent

12
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,715
to the position of clan head.

13
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,217
This means that he must
now bear the heavy burden

14
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,345
of guilt and responsibility
for his clan's sins.

15
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,931
(ominous music)

16
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,397
(dice clanking in glass)

17
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,690
- [Sakujun Sa] Two, three.

18
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,569
Here.

19
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,447
- Nine years ago, the
person who arranged

20
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,865
for the murder of
Shunki's parents,

21
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,325
the late advisor, Sa's
son and daughter-in-law.

22
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,785
It was you, wasn't it?

23
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,787
- There's no way that advisor
Sa's brother, Chuushou,

24
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,581
could have managed to
pull it off on his own,

25
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,875
let alone gotten the
idea in the first place.

26
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,001
- Oh, really?

27
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,544
- I wouldn't be
the least surprised

28
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,421
if some unproductive
youngster from the Sa clan

29
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,797
got fed up with advisor Sa

30
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,425
constantly interfering
with his depraved amusement

31
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,635
and gave a few
suggestions to Chuushou

32
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,597
as a small form of
personal revenge.

33
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,932
(slurps cup)

34
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,477
(sighs)

35
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,355
- That is a rather intriguing
story you're telling.

36
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,482
- [Seiran] Oh, it gets better.

37
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
Don't you want to
hear the reason

38
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,234
why your father
was brought down?

39
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,363
- [Sakujun Sa] It seems that
hardship can make people grow.

40
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,490
The former prince has
become quite skilled

41
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,824
in little tricks and traps.

42
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,368
Perhaps we should have a toast

43
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,745
in honor of your
pathetically sincere effort.

44
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,288
- Do as you wish.

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,374
(glass clanks)

46
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,875
- Then, in honor of
the former prince,

47
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,752
who has become
cool-tongued, spiteful,

48
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,379
and pessimistic in his old age,

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,798
I raise my glass, a toast.

50
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,967
(soft ominous music)

51
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,598
- I had the merchant's
guild do some investigating,

52
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,517
and I found out that the
Sa clan's main branch

53
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,644
ordered several kinds
of incense all at once.

54
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,521
- Yes, so?

55
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,064
- [Seiran] They were
highly addictive

56
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,565
and would gradually
affect the person's

57
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,651
mind in a certain way.

58
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,362
- (chuckles) You're
very knowledgeable.

59
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,614
I assume that, in your research,

60
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,074
you discovered
exactly who it was

61
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,034
that ordered those
special drugs.

62
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,620
- Yeah, it was your
mother and grandmother.

63
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,789
- [Sakujun] Well,
those two would

64
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,791
certainly do
something like that.

65
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,002
- Oh, yes, and I'm sure
it had nothing to do

66
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,421
with a certain
unproductive slacker,

67
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,047
who knows all sorts
of strange things,

68
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,841
quietly telling them about it,

69
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,551
just to cope with this boredom.

70
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,720
- Perhaps.

71
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,388
I'm sure there are probably kind

72
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,682
and honest people out there
who would actually answer

73
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,684
if you asked them
about such things.

74
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,106
- This wine is strong.

75
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,524
My throat is burning.

76
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,573
- It's finally over, isn't it?

77
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,575
- Yeah, job well done, you two.

78
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,993
As I said to lady Shuurei,

79
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,995
you've done outstandingly
as the new governors.

80
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,164
- Thank you very much, Mr. Sai.

81
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,457
- It's not over yet.

82
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,501
We're still not finished here.

83
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,546
I have to take the flower
bud pin back from that man.

84
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,381
- Yeah.

85
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,092
- Then why don't I go and finish

86
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,762
the last part of
our mission, okay?

87
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,514
(group grunts confusedly)

88
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,058
- Do you think Shuurei
will be all right

89
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,517
going on her own like that?

90
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,728
- This is Princess's problem.

91
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,106
That means it's only proper
for her to get it back herself.

92
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,524
- Right.

93
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,692
This is one of those things

94
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,694
that we can't really
interfere with.

95
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,989
(crickets chirping)

96
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,742
(ominous music)

97
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,413
(panting frantically)

98
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,542
- [Sakujun] Would you
tell me something?

99
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,045
Why are you, or rather,

100
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,881
why are the people of this
world so open-hearted?

101
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,174
- Open-hearted?

102
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,884
What do you mean?

103
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,762
- I only need one person
in the entire world,

104
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,598
and that would be more than
enough for me, but most people,

105
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,559
for example, you, are
different, aren't you?

106
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,019
You may love your princess,

107
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,563
but there are other people
whom you hold dear as well.

108
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,527
- Yeah, that's right.

109
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,613
(soft ominous music)

110
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,873
In the past, the only
person who was truly

111
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,834
important to me was
my little brother,

112
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,797
but now, things
are very different.

113
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,138
- But I only have one person
who's important to me.

114
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,557
That means I'm trying
to give all of myself

115
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,642
to her and her alone,

116
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,938
so I would appreciate
it if people like you,

117
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,816
who have others to care
about, would stop interfering.

118
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,239
(dice clinging)

119
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,950
- When it comes
to me, Sakujun Sa,

120
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,244
I can actually be
extremely selfish,

121
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,204
if I do say so myself.

122
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,499
(slurps) I take anything
and everything I desire.

123
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,001
I don't pick and choose.

124
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,670
Why bother when I
can grasp it all?

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,256
- If you become too greedy,

126
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,051
you won't be able to get
the things you truly desire.

127
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,303
- As usual, you
don't understand.

128
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,013
Someone like you
could never comprehend

129
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,848
how much I love all of them,

130
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,601
and how fortunate I am
to have them in my life.

131
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,895
- You're right, I don't
think I do understand,

132
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,522
and frankly, I don't
think I care to, either.

133
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,942
(dice clanking)

134
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,613
Say, how would you
react if I told you

135
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,158
that your princess served me
Ganlu tea while she was here?

136
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,743
- Knowing her, I
could only guess

137
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,204
that you used some cheap
tactic to make her do it.

138
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:40,669
My lady's Ganlu tea
was exceptionally
delicious, wasn't it?

139
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,005
- Now, I'd like you to
make some Ganlu tea for me.

140
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:44,881
- No way.

141
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:51,221
- Yes, it was very delicious.

142
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,599
(crickets chirping)

143
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,727
(panting frantically)

144
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,771
If you don't brew
any Ganlu tea for me,

145
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,731
then I'm afraid
I'm going to die.

146
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,192
- I don't understand.

147
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,903
Why did he want to
drink that tea so badly?

148
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,863
(dice clanking)

149
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,907
- I'll tell you one thing.

150
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,242
I was told by my lady

151
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,285
that I'm her second favorite
person in the world.

152
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,620
(dice clanking)

153
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,205
- Why tell me
something like that?

154
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,833
I wouldn't say that's
particularly worth
bragging about.

155
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,376
(dice clanking)

156
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,294
- It is when her
favorite person is a man

157
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,088
who no one can hope to match.

158
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,757
Is it all right if I ask you

159
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,135
who your number one
favorite person is?

160
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,845
- It's father, of course.

161
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,304
He would know he's
a hopeless father.

162
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,973
He's always been my number one.

163
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,060
- That's why second place
is good enough for me,

164
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,146
and don't try to pretend
you don't understand

165
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,814
exactly what I mean by that.

166
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,234
- My goodness, you always have
had a terrible personality.

167
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,694
- I wouldn't mind
being told that

168
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,071
by anyone else, but not you.

169
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,948
(dice clanking)

170
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,408
- [Sakujun] I envy you.

171
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,617
- Huh?

172
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,245
- I said I envy you.

173
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,040
I would love to be told
by her that I'm, say,

174
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,792
even her third favorite
person in the world.

175
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,095
- His face is turning pale.

176
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,638
There's no more time left.

177
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,725
I have one more question.

178
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,770
- You certainly are
inquisitive, aren't you?

179
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,063
If I didn't know any better,

180
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,066
I'd say you wanted to
get acquainted with me.

181
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,567
If that were the case,

182
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,153
then you really should have
said something at the beginning.

183
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,989
I would've been able to
entertain you somewhat better.

184
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,993
- You've already
returned the flower bud

185
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,787
hairpin to my lady, right?

186
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,163
- Yes, I returned it.

187
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,792
(sword clanks)

188
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,294
- Now that I know for
sure, I'm satisfied.

189
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,463
If you don't mind, I
am going to have you

190
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,757
let me win this little bet.

191
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,092
- You are joking, right?

192
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,385
(loud whooshing)

193
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,179
(grunts loudly)

194
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,976
(loud thudding)

195
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,395
(glass breaking)

196
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,732
You certainly are as merciless
as always, my prince.

197
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,150
(yells angrily)

198
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,903
(swords clanking)
(both grunting)

199
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,488
- And which of us is
cold-blooded enough

200
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,699
to put poison in all the cups?

201
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,325
- Very impressive.

202
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,454
(swords clanking)
(grunts loudly)

203
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,166
I made sure to prepare a
tasteless, odorless poison,

204
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,252
but it seems you've
come prepared to ensure

205
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,462
you wouldn't lose to
that sort of thing.

206
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,215
Frankly, I find that
little cowardly of you.

207
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,343
- Do you think I'd risk my
life with you as my opponent?

208
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,095
Besides, you're only
able to stand up

209
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,347
to this fast-acting poison
because you're using

210
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,307
a neutralizing antidote as well.

211
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,184
- I did no such thing,

212
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,812
it's just that I've experimented
with so many poisons

213
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,063
over the years to kill time,

214
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,482
my body's built up a
resistance to them.

215
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,484
- You're a monster!

216
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,738
(grunts loudly)

217
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,115
(ominous music)

218
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,243
(grunting in anguish)

219
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,996
- Are you all right?

220
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,206
(sword clanks)

221
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,335
(grunts painfully)

222
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,919
I must admit, I'm impressed.

223
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,006
You must have quite a
strong stomach for alcohol.

224
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,257
To tell you the truth,

225
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,009
I couldn't resist making
a few small improvements

226
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,469
to the wine we drank.

227
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,929
It's so strong that even
the heaviest of drinkers

228
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,974
will fall over after
drinking just a single cup.

229
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,560
For you to non-nonchalantly
drink so many cups of it

230
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,936
and only become dizzy now,

231
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,855
after physically
exerting yourself?

232
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,982
Just what kind of
body do you have?

233
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,484
(grunting painfully)

234
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,861
Well, sorry to run
off, but I'm afraid

235
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,071
there's some place I have to be,

236
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,573
so I'll take this
chance to excuse myself.

237
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,949
Why don't you stay here?

238
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,077
You look like you could
use a little rest.

239
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,455
(grunts loudly)

240
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,503
(loud thudding)

241
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,381
(chuckles) If anyone were
to win a bet against me,

242
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,133
that someone would never be you.

243
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,886
(ominous music)

244
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,899
(light kokyu music)

245
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,001
- Shunki.

246
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,420
- Don't worry about a
thing, Lord Kokujun.

247
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,338
I'm still right
here by your side.

248
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,008
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you.

249
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,592
Always.

250
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,979
(crickets chirping)

251
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:51,938
- There's no moon.

252
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,192
That's right, tonight's
supposed to be the new moon.

253
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,529
(erhu music)

254
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,615
(grunts in surprise)

255
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,332
(sighs)

256
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,467
(panting frantically)

257
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,949
This will probably
be the last time.

258
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,078
As governor, it's my
duty to arrest him

259
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,497
and pass judgment on his crimes,

260
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,499
that's why this will
be the very last time

261
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,503
I can really meet him as myself,

262
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,672
as just plain Shuurei Hong.

263
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,257
(erhu music)

264
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,142
- It seems I can hardly
move my fingers anymore.

265
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:16,106
Oh, come to me quickly,
my lovely princess.

266
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,069
You never betray
my expectations, so
please, come quickly.

267
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,657
(distantly rustling)

268
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,160
(panting)

269
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,250
- What do you
think you're doing,

270
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,627
hanging around in such an
out-of-the-way place like this?

271
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,507
(gasps)

272
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,554
(far-Eastern music)

273
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,140
(gasps surprisingly)

274
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,224
What happened?

275
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,813
(gasps)

276
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,731
What's going on?

277
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,151
What's wrong?

278
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,193
Are you sick?

279
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,785
- Just as I promised, the
thing most important to you.

280
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,663
- This is no time for that.

281
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:17,459
- In the end, in
the end, it was you.

282
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,419
You only gave me hot water.

283
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,469
- You've been drinking
wine, and a lot of it.

284
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,305
If that wine mixes weirdly
with Ganlu tea in your stomach,

285
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,098
you can end up
making yourself sick.

286
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,391
Just have the hot water today

287
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,060
and get some decent rest, okay?

288
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,437
- If you don't brew
any Ganlu tea for me,

289
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,230
then I'm afraid
I'm going to die.

290
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,734
- Ugh, that is something
a child would say.

291
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,405
You know, you do have to try
to treat your body properly.

292
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,823
I'll just give you hot water.

293
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,535
- What you didn't know was
that in that hot water,

294
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,205
I had already added
a slow-acting poison

295
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:59,084
that I'm not resistant to
that would eventually kill me.

296
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,586
- I don't get it.

297
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,505
There was nothing wrong
with you yesterday.

298
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,091
- I also chopped up a
neutralizing antidote

299
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,343
and added it to the Ganlu tea.

300
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,470
- You were all energetic
and running around.

301
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,263
How could this have happened?

302
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,392
- When I said I would die if
you didn't make Ganlu tea,

303
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,768
I was telling the truth.

304
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,646
- Hey, this is probably just due

305
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,524
to a scratched throat
or something, right?

306
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,694
- I was thinking of telling
you the truth, you know?

307
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,238
That you were the
one who killed me.

308
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,282
If I did that, then you'd
never be able to forget me.

309
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,160
I felt like I could become

310
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,287
a special person
to you that way.

311
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,624
- You need medicine.

312
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,459
You don't have any
on you, do you?

313
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,255
- But it's funny, for the
first time in my life,

314
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,132
I began to think
about what I could do

315
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,135
for the sake of someone
other than myself.

316
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,594
Once I started to
think that way,

317
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,139
I realized that no matter
how I looked at it,

318
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,516
I was the greatest
obstacle in your way,

319
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,896
but I was weak enough to make
one final gamble for my life,

320
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,526
but you overcame it easily.

321
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,447
(chuckles)

322
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,364
- What, why are you
laughing like that?

323
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,657
(strained coughing)

324
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,451
Where's your medicine?

325
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,828
- I always keep
making you angry.

326
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,622
Just once, I would have
liked to see you smile.

327
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,667
(sighs)

328
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,461
- Come on, where is it?

329
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,503
- My eyes.

330
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,174
I guess that means
the last part of me

331
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,259
to go will be my hearing.

332
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,181
Please play the erhu for me.

333
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,974
- Quit joking around.

334
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,810
Nevermind, I'll go
and get Eigetsu.

335
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:41,853
(grunts feebly)

336
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,313
What is it?

337
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,857
- I must have told
you over and over

338
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,650
that it's much better like this.

339
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,529
(soft somber music)

340
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,708
You never called me by my
real name, not even once.

341
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,671
- (whimpers softly) Let me go.

342
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,382
I'll get Eigetsu
to come right away.

343
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,597
- To you, what place do
I hold in your heart?

344
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,560
- I'm begging you,
please let me go.

345
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,326
- It's not really your fault,

346
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,745
but while I still
have the chance,

347
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,289
I'm giving you the
life of Sakujun Sa.

348
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,675
- It this my fault?

349
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,806
- They say beauty and a
happy life don't go together.

350
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,851
Deadly illness always
strikes the ideal man.

351
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,689
I was planning on passing away
without saying this to you,

352
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:12,736
but now, at the very
final moment, I love you.

353
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,530
The way you play the erhu,

354
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:19,617
the way you always made tea
for me, everything about you.

355
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,207
(whimpers)

356
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:29,461
- No, I'm not gonna let you
avoid the subject like that.

357
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,754
I'm not going to
allow you to say

358
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,589
something like
that and then die,

359
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,549
and I'm not going to
call you by your name.

360
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,801
What should I call you, anyway?

361
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,387
You were always
Young Master to me.

362
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,306
Besides, you never
once called me

363
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,475
by my real name either, did you?

364
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:47,937
Wait for me.

365
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,526
- You were the one
person who could ever

366
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,778
win a bet against me.

367
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,990
In all truth, you really
were a special person to me.

368
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,618
When I decided this path,

369
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,995
I fully expected to
die with no regrets.

370
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,082
They always say that every
meeting ends in parting,

371
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:11,795
but still, I wanted
you to say my name.

372
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,422
I wanted to hear you
play the erhu again.

373
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,093
I wanted to spend more
time together with you.

374
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,639
I wanted to make you
say you loved me.

375
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,725
(somber piano music)

376
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,525
Where is the moon?

377
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,826
(crickets chirping softly)

378
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,662
- Tonight is the
night of the new moon.

379
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,122
- What's the matter,
your majesty?

380
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,042
Is there something out there?

381
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,504
- No, I just had
this strange feeling.

382
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,798
It's funny, every since
Shuurei and Seiran

383
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,592
came into my life, I've
found what's important to me.

384
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,052
It's given me
courage to the extent

385
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,888
that I'm not frightened
of the darkness anymore.

386
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,473
- Indeed.

387
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,976
- Of course, I also
love you very much,

388
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,020
Shuuei, and Kouyuu as well.

389
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,397
- Thank you for saying
so, your majesty.

390
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,692
I have to ask, though, where
do I rank compared with Shuuei?

391
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,527
- How am I supposed
to answer that?

392
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,487
You can't compare
between the two.

393
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,699
Long ago, I thought
it would be enough

394
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,826
just to have my elder
brother with me,

395
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,038
but now, I can't help but feel
that would be a total waste.

396
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,790
- Sounds like you're being
rather greedy, your majesty.

397
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,875
- Didn't you know?

398
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,002
A real king is
supposed to be greedy.

399
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,047
- But, despite your
greediness, you've done a very

400
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,717
admirable job of restraining
yourself and doing your best.

401
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,677
It's very impressive.

402
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,888
- Stop, if you keep
saying such nice things,

403
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,474
I might end up crying to
you like a spoiled child.

404
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,726
Right now, I feel
like I must have

405
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,479
a pretty pathetic
expression on my face.

406
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,605
- Well, that's true.

407
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,981
You certainly do.

408
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:55,982
But, that's fine.

409
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,068
I actually kind of like it.

410
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,694
Don't worry, it's all right.

411
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,780
We're all here by your
side supporting you.

412
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:10,663
- You know, if I could only
see Shuurei and no one else,

413
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,750
I feel like, until I met her,
the world would be boring,

414
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,126
and once we did meet,

415
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,671
I'd make up for it by
living like a blazing fire,

416
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,839
burning furiously
until it goes out,

417
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,758
and I die alone, and yet,

418
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,802
I don't think I'd
have a single regret.

419
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:32,477
But, you know, Shuuei,
even if that were the case,

420
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,937
I can't help but
think I'm luckier

421
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,064
to have many different
people dear to me.

422
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,485
(doors bang)

423
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,737
(all gasp)

424
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,784
- Seiran.

425
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,119
- Hold on, what's the matter?

426
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,955
- My lady.

427
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,206
(both gasp)

428
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,207
- I'll go find her.

429
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,253
(grunts softly)

430
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,631
(panting frantically)

431
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:04,592
- Shuurei.

432
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,096
(grunts)

433
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,055
- We were worried.

434
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,641
- Come with me, quickly.

435
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,686
(soft piano music)

436
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:20,984
- [Shuurei Voiceover]
You've never once called me

437
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,862
by my real name,
either, did you?

438
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,117
- Goodbye, Shuurei.

439
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,747
(somber piano music)

440
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:52,766
(melodic music in
foreign language)

441
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,129
- What's the matter, Seiran?

442
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,839
You're so unsteady on your feet.

443
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,174
Come on, you've gotta
get your act together.

444
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:11,302
Okay, now to put an end to
this conflict once and for all.

445
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:12,762
{\an8}Come on, everyone.

446
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,681
{\an8}It's time to go and
rescue Yushuun Tei.
