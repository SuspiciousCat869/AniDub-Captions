00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,758
(logo swooshing)

00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,765
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,313
(acoustic music)

4
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,191
- [Man] On this day invoice
from the Imperial court

5
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,276
have come to visit Shuurei Hong.

6
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,278
They have come to inform
her of the results

7
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,490
of her Aptitude Test and
based on that let her know

8
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,493
whether or not she'd be
permitted to take the last test

9
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,286
of the national exams.

10
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,664
(epic music)

11
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,876
(Shuurei sighs)

12
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,969
Shuurei Hong,
Aptitude Test pass.

13
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,767
Now it is up to Shuurei
to study for her first

14
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,520
and last attempt at
taking the final.

15
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,606
It's a big step towards
realizing her childhood dream

16
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,233
of becoming a court official.

17
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,363
(acoustic music)

18
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,582
(indistinct chatters)

19
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,797
(footsteps approaching)

20
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,467
(horn blowing)

21
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,595
- I finally made it

22
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,272
(indistinct chatters)

23
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,026
This is the end of the road.

24
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,821
(footprints scatters)

25
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,407
(epic music)

26
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,994
- It's just over a
month until the final,

27
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,622
there's been a sharp increase
in visitors as a result,

28
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,956
how's town security?

29
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,917
- As in past years, the
gangs will see to it

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,418
that the streets are safe.

31
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,837
However, there are some
new rumors going around.

32
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,964
I'll look into it and provide
you with a full report,

33
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,883
once I've gathered
more information.

34
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,969
- Things are likely to get busy.

35
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,806
I'm counting on you both.

36
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,475
- Live it to us your majesty.
- Live it to us your majesty.

37
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,481
(acoustic music)

38
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,903
- Hey, you wanna get some food?

39
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,781
- I'd love to, but unfortunately
I've got somewhere to go.

40
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,449
- Huh?

41
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,450
- Actually, I'm headed to
the Red Light District.

42
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,910
- Red Light District?

43
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,079
- Don't look at me like
that, this is also part

44
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:06,955
of my duties you know.

45
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,124
- Oh, is it really?

46
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:14,337
(indistinct chatters)

47
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,689
(epic music)

48
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,068
- Shuurei, hey, come on.

49
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,529
You're going somewhere
again, aren't you?

50
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,532
I hear you've been making
farewell visits all around town.

51
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,619
You know, you're at
that ripe age now.

52
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,831
Why not quit wandering around
and settle down already?

53
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,375
You're getting a bit
old to be unmarried.

54
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,669
It's gonna get more and
more difficult to find

55
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,714
a good partner that'll
take you without a dowry.

56
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,675
But I, well I'm from
a pretty rich family,

57
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,552
so I wouldn't ask for a dowry.

58
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,972
(Shuurei sighs)

59
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,474
- It's none of your
business, how late I marry

60
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,933
or how few men
are gonna take me.

61
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,477
You're just a childhood friend,

62
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,812
so it's not any
concern of yours.

63
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,564
- The point I'm tryna make is.

64
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,066
- Look at any rate,
I don't have the time

65
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,026
to deal with you today.

66
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,487
Why don't you just hurry
up and go home Santa?

67
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,822
- Don't call me Santa,
please call me Keichou.

68
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,032
- You never seem to grow up,

69
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,992
so I'd say Santa is
more than appropriate.

70
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,827
(Keichou sighs)

71
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,998
- My my, if it isn't Master
Rosyang son come to visit.

72
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,417
- Oh, Ms Kochou.

73
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,128
- What is it this
time young man?

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,714
Are you trying to
hit on her again?

75
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,719
Oh you never learn, dear boy
just wait until night time

76
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,137
then I promise
I'll play with you.

77
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,476
I'll even set some time
aside especially chest free.

78
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,978
- No, that's fine, I'd
never have enough money

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,147
to pay for your services
anyway, Ms Kochou.

80
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,733
Later.

81
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,861
(Kochou giggling)

82
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,240
- Honestly, talk about gutless.

83
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,618
- I'm surprised to see you
up and about so early, ma'am.

84
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,453
- My client left my
bed in the middle

85
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,996
of the night yesterday.

86
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,832
- Someone left early from the
room of the number one lady

87
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,500
of the Red Light District.

88
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,503
- There are some truly
foolish men out there,

89
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,130
but there is a
bright side to it.

90
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,132
It means I can spend
more of what little time

91
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,758
you have left you with you.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,301
- Huh?

93
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,595
- Soon you will be leaving us,
by my reckoning you'll only

94
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,889
be working for us
for seven more days.

95
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,101
- Yes.

96
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,938
- When I look at you, I still
remember that little girl,

97
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,566
who came to my door
all on her own.

98
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,610
You bowed your head and ask
politely if you could work here,

99
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,989
you'd obviously been
brought up very well,

100
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,575
even beyond bearing the
Hong name and being part

101
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,993
of that noble family.

102
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,121
You had such a grim
look on your face.

103
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,748
You'd more than prepared
yourself to come

104
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,792
and work in a Red
Light District,
whatever that entailed.

105
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,712
- Madam, I have to prepare
dinner in the evening,

106
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,548
so I'll need to be home
by sunset every night.

107
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,550
- Hmm?

108
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,220
(soft music)

109
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,515
(Kochou giggling)

110
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,725
- Ms Kochou please.

111
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,643
I asked you to forget
about that already.

112
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,522
- Quite a long time
has passed since then.

113
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,817
The days go by so quickly.

114
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,570
Oh, by the way, would
you do me a favor?

115
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,655
Make certain you come and
see me on your last day

116
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,075
of work here, I have
something I wanna give you.

117
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,326
- Please, you mustn't.

118
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,578
- Now now child
there's no need to be

119
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,289
so cold and polite about
it, you're the only person

120
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,084
I've come across who's ever
been able or will ever be able

121
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,003
to make me promise an honest
date and keep it do Shuurei.

122
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,089
Got that?

123
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,840
As I said, a promise.

124
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,677
Otherwise they'll be forced
to tell Mr Hong and say on

125
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,970
that you've been working
in the Red Light District.

126
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,723
- No, no please,
anything but that,

127
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,809
I'll come you have my word.

128
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,977
(Kochou giggles)

129
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,938
- By the way, I
forgot to mention it,

130
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,941
we had a rather unusual
guest arrive yesterday

131
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,318
- An unusual guest you say?

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,571
(soft gentle music)

133
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,300
- A child?

134
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,595
- I'm guessing is around
12 or 13 years old at most.

135
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,014
- Wow!

136
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,850
Well that certainly does
qualify as an unusual guest.

137
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,935
- [Eigetsu] Hey,
what is this place?

138
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,064
- It seems like he's awake.

139
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,195
- So you don't even
remember how you got here.

140
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,282
- Oh, right I'm Eigetsu To.

141
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,825
- Hi, Eigetsu.

142
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,286
- Let's see, I just
arrived in Kiyo yesterday

143
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,663
and got tangled up
with some gangsters.

144
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,914
I remember everything
up until the point

145
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,833
of them dragging me
into a restaurant.

146
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,084
But um...

147
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,878
How did I end up in this place?

148
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,255
- It's quite simple, really.

149
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,299
One of our regulars carried
you here and asked us

150
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,301
to put you up for
a little while.

151
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,720
He was willing to pay us
very handsomely for it,

152
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,804
so we agreed.

153
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,014
- What?

154
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,432
I can't possibly
impose like that.

155
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,933
How much did he pay?

156
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,103
I can pay for everything so
please give him back his money.

157
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,231
Huh, why is this so light?

158
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,987
- What, this is nowhere near
what I'm supposed to have.

159
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,322
- You don't even have
enough for a month

160
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,282
at the cheapest lodging in town.

161
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,327
- I was sure I had a lot
more in my bag yesterday.

162
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,953
What should I do?

163
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,456
- Why not accept the man's
generosity and stay here

164
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,665
for the time being.

165
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,375
- I, but.

166
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,087
- If not, how about at my place?

167
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,674
Well, it's a bit rundown,
but there's lots of space

168
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,343
and last year we had a bear
like man stay without any notice

169
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,804
so, we're used to having
unexpected visitors.

170
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,808
- I'm truly sorry for
imposing on you like this.

171
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,893
Are you sure it's really
all right for me to stay?

172
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,270
- If you're worried, why don't
you help me with something?

173
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,230
- What?

174
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,815
- To tell the truth,

175
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,983
I could use some help
finishing the accounting.

176
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,153
- Oh sure, I'm pretty good
at that sort of thing.

177
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,156
- In that case, I'll leave
it all to you, Eigetsu.

178
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,199
- Yes ma'am.

179
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,375
- Wow, you're really
something else Eigetsu,

180
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,752
who could have guessed you'd
be so fast and accurate

181
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,046
with your calculations,
you are amazing.

182
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:30,922
- Thank you.

183
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,215
But you're too kind.

184
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,091
- My lady.

185
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,887
- Hello Seiran, what is it?

186
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,056
- I thought we might go to a
restaurant for dinner tonight,

187
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,391
so I came to meet you.

188
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,518
- But isn't that extravagant?

189
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,270
- I know it's a little
bit on the late side,

190
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,063
but you can consider
it a special dinner

191
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,150
to celebrate passing
the Aptitude Test.

192
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:50,984
- For me?

193
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,531
Thank you so much Seiran.

194
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,118
(epic music)

195
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,336
- My, my my, must have been
quite a journey all the way

196
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,795
from Koku province.

197
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,339
- Well, sort of.

198
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,258
- Pretty impressive
considering he's only 13

199
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,802
but just to warn you, the
final exam is coming up

200
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,096
and lots of people are
here from out of town.

201
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,307
It's kind of a dangerous
time to be in the Capital

202
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,225
if you're not familiar with it.

203
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,561
I don't know what brings you
here, but I suggest you finish

204
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,521
it up quickly and return home.

205
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,523
- I guess you're right.

206
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,484
- By the way, have
you heard those rumors

207
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,903
about this year's final?

208
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,031
They say a lot of kids
are showing up to take it.

209
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,116
Rumor has it,
there's even a girl.

210
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,285
- Yeah, I heard about that.

211
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,955
She's only 16 or 17 and
supposedly she's guaranteed

212
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,167
to win top position, so I'm
gonna put 30% of my fortune

213
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,044
on her getting the
number one ranking.

214
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,546
- Didn't you lose your entire
fortune doing the same thing

215
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,256
a few years back?

216
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,384
- Jeez, you keep
bringing that up.

217
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,053
That was the time those two
long shot teens took first

218
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,012
and second spot.

219
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,181
Nobody expected that to happen.

220
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,059
- Oh yeah, I remember, but as
I recall, they were both kids

221
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,977
from really high class
families weren't they?

222
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,437
- Must be nice.

223
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,980
Have your parents pay for
everything while you focus

224
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,400
on studying and your future
will be safe and secure.

225
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,069
- But all that aside, I
don't think I've ever heard

226
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,114
of women being allowed to
take the national exams.

227
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,241
I mean, a highly respected
teacher once tried

228
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,284
and didn't get anywhere,
so there's no way

229
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,413
some ordinary woman can
make it to the final exam.

230
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,374
- You got that right, besides
what business is a woman

231
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,292
have taken the exams
in the first place.

232
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,462
(men laughing loudly)

233
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,470
(men grunting)

234
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,935
- What's just happened?

235
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,645
- [Kou] I wonder,
very mysterious.

236
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,564
- [Seiran] Serves
them right. Anyway,

237
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,190
- We should really
start eating before all

238
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,400
this food gets cold.

239
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,318
Eigetsu you be sure to
drink all your soup,

240
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,155
you look like you need
to warm yourself up.

241
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,281
- Yes, sir.

242
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,037
(Eigetsu sipping soup)

243
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,580
- One thing's for sure.

244
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,374
No one in this entire
world, can hope to gain

245
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,376
what's truly important to
them, unless they're willing

246
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,627
to work hard for it.

247
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,590
Take General Ran and
Lord Kyou, for example.

248
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,301
In the beginning they were
constantly ridiculed because

249
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,095
they were so young, but in
the end they shut everyone up

250
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,930
and prove themselves
thanks to the type

251
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,058
of strength we call effort.

252
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,686
This is just my opinion, but
perhaps all you really need

253
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,604
is effort.

254
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,690
- Thank you father.

255
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,323
(acoustic music)

256
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,668
Here, have some wine father.

257
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,211
- Thank you.

258
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,422
- Would you like to try a sip
of this as well and Eigetsu?

259
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,092
- No, thank you.

260
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:02,967
- Really?

261
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,968
Are you positive?

262
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,014
- Yeah, I'm really weak
when it comes to alcohol.

263
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,976
To tell you the truth, I try
to avoid even snowing if I can.

264
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,478
- Hey, that reminds me.

265
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,979
Do you think it's possible
that the money you're missing,

266
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,565
could've been stolen by those
gangsters you mentioned?

267
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,526
Maybe they forced you to
drink some strong wine

268
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,152
and you passed out or something.

269
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,447
- No, I, I don't think
that's very likely,

270
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,118
but, I guess it'd be
possible that there'd be one

271
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,121
or two very skilled people in
the Capital who could do it.

272
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,664
Maybe, but.

273
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,417
- If that's the case, it would
have to be the Seikin Gang.

274
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,627
- Seiran, you know
something about this?

275
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,130
- A little, from what I've
heard, it's a gang of thugs

276
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,133
and hooligans who arrived
in town just recently.

277
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,301
They wear a blue cloth
somewhere on their bodies

278
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,554
to mark themselves
as gang members.

279
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,805
- That is not good.

280
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,557
Do you mean to tell me
that the crime bosses

281
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,308
have been turning a
blind eye to them?

282
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,395
- Up until now, but
lately the Seikin Gang

283
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,730
has been getting more
flagrant and open

284
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,565
in their criminal activities.

285
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,484
- In that case, maybe it will
spur the bosses into making

286
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,069
them move soon.

287
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,654
- Wow, by the sound of
it, it seems pretty clear

288
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,698
that this gangs leaders
from outside the Capital.

289
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,242
- [Seiran} I agree,
otherwise their actions

290
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,285
would be suicidal.

291
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,202
- Excuse me.

292
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,664
- Oh, of course I'm sorry.

293
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,666
You don't know too much
about the city, do you?

294
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,709
- Not really.

295
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,295
- Kiyo City may be the capital,

296
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,130
but there's a very clear
distinction between

297
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,507
who governs the State
and who governs Downtown.

298
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,551
- A clear distinction.

299
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,469
- Yes.

300
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,348
Kiyou the underground
crime boss is responsible

301
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,600
for managing the
Downtown hooligans

302
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,810
at this time of year when
there's an increase in visitors

303
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,687
from other provinces
for the final,

304
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,774
it's their job to protect the
piece of the downtown core.

305
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,817
The bosses take pride
in ensuring everything

306
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,488
is kept under control,
specifically their control.

307
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,156
- Usually that's
the case but then

308
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,200
what are the bosses waiting for?

309
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,409
They've let it go too far,

310
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,828
Eigetsu even had
his money stolen.

311
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,207
- Let's not jump to
conclusions just yet.

312
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,709
Actually, the money wasn't
mine, it was gathered

313
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,628
from the people in my hometown.

314
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,547
I feel really bad
about losing it, but.

315
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,383
- That makes matters even worse.

316
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,218
- But it's not the
end of the world.

317
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,303
I'm fine as long as
I still have this.

318
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,435
(Eigetsu crying)

319
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,520
- What's wrong?

320
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,813
- It's gone.

321
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,648
- W www what's gone?

322
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,817
- I'm really sorry
I have to go back.

323
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:24,693
- Ww wait What?

324
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,652
Where are you going?

325
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,779
I mean just hold on a minute

326
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:28,697
Eigetsu

327
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,200
- I'll follow.

328
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,121
(acoustic music)

329
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,581
(Shuurei panting)

330
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,708
- Oh, where'd he go?

331
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,676
There he is.

332
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:54,264
They're wearing blue cloth,
they must be the Seikin Gang.

333
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,683
- Hey, you're the one we're
looking for, aren't you?

334
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,643
The little brat, who
not only embarrassed

335
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,855
my boys last night, but ended
up robbing them blind too.

336
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,191
- Oh my goodness, I did that?

337
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,444
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

338
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,988
- Eigetsu did what?

339
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,615
I can't believe it, these
guys have gotta be mistaken.

340
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,325
- You making fun of us, kid?

341
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,787
- Do you know if I dropped
something yesterday?

342
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,664
A token around this big?

343
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,623
Did you happen to see it?

344
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,292
- A token?

345
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,879
Yeah, we got it, we've been
making a little collection.

346
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,172
- A collection?

347
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,214
- Hey, Eigetsu

348
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,425
- Who the heck is she?

349
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,469
- Now's not the time
to be having a chat,

350
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,803
hurry up and run.

351
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,348
- Nice try kids.

352
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,687
Damn, go after them and
get that money back.

353
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,899
(men shouting)

354
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,484
(both panting)

355
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,736
- Miss Shuurei We shouldn't
run, wait a minute.

356
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,821
- I'm not waiting, it's no
use trying to talk sense

357
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,699
into that sort, discretion
is the better part of valor.

358
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,326
- But

359
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,953
- Eigetsu, was it true
what they said back there?

360
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,331
About you taking their money?

361
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,249
Do you remember
anything about it?

362
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,668
- No, but maybe yes.

363
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,710
- Which is it?

364
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,630
- where'd those two brats go?

365
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:10,882
- Oh no.

366
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,967
- There they are damn.

367
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,472
- I'm the one the thereafter
so please try and get

368
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,890
away by yourself Miss Shuurei.

369
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,311
- Hey wait, that's no good.

370
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,854
You don't know your
way around this town.

371
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,023
I can't just abandon
you like that.

372
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,233
- But Miss Shuurei.

373
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,487
- At last, found you.

374
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,614
(Shuurei screaming)

375
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,325
(man grunting)

376
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,829
- Hurry, let's go Eigetsu.

377
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,372
- Wow!

378
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,499
- Seiran told me that if
you kick a man in the groin,

379
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,875
he drops like a rock.

380
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,379
- Yes, I did good job Shuurei.

381
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,257
- Seiran did you just see that?

382
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,884
- Thanks to you, I couldn't
make much of an entrance.

383
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,845
- Hey, find them?

384
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,054
- They can have gotten far,

385
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,389
they should still
be in the area.

386
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,557
- Search everywhere.

387
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,766
- Right.

388
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,769
(footsteps fading)

389
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,732
- We can't go home at this
rate, they would probably follow

390
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,400
us to the residence.

391
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,736
Eigitsu where were you
going when you ran out?

392
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,280
A place called Kogaro in
the Red Light District.

393
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,573
When I met Shuurei,

394
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,449
(Eigitsu mumbles)

395
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,950
(shuurei laughs)

396
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,911
- Lady Shuurei have been
looking for you everywhere.

397
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,329
- Really?

398
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,289
- Yes my lady.

399
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,374
Ms Kochou sent me to find you.

400
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,002
It's not safe out here,
please return to Kogaro

401
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,795
along with the young men
and if it's not too much

402
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,089
of a problem, Mr Seiran as well.

403
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,466
We'll have our
underlings take care

404
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,676
of those annoying
Seikin Gang members.

405
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:37,552
- What?

406
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,928
Take care, how?

407
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,681
- It's a good idea,
given the Kogaro status,

408
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,850
those hooligans won't be
able to enter the premises.

409
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,101
- What?

410
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,936
Seiran how the heck
did you know Kogaro

411
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,314
- We'll talk about
it later, hurry.

412
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,023
- Right?

413
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,612
(indistinct chatters)

414
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,864
- Give me a break, what
on earth were you thinking

415
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,824
when you left that
boy at some brothel?

416
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,078
- I was thinking that it was
the safest place for him.

417
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,455
- But the Red Light
District is dangerous.

418
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,332
- That's just your
prejudice talking,

419
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,833
it's actually very safe.

420
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,711
Keep in mind that the
underground is in control here.

421
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,005
Of course, considering
you never come here,

422
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,925
it's not surprising you'd have
no clue about such things.

423
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,512
- You come here way
too much, by the way,

424
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,097
what's with all these women?

425
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,892
- [Woman] You haven't been here
for a while, we missed you.

426
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:30,021
- [Woman] Hey, hello there Mr
Ran, Maya here early today.

427
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,107
(indistinct chatters)

428
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,608
- This place is incredible.

429
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,694
Is this district
your Harem Shuei?

430
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,112
- Well, I guess
you could say so,

431
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,739
although its purpose is
rather different from yours,

432
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:43,159
it's a place for men to enjoy
themselves and have fun.

433
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,036
If you wanna think
of it in other terms,

434
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,955
think of it as
every man's heroine.

435
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,500
The brothel we're going
to now, has many women

436
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,585
who are both beautiful
and accomplished.

437
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,671
They're easily the equals
of any of the ladies

438
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,131
in your residence.

439
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,133
You've got something
to look forward to.

440
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,178
- Ah, Kochou.

441
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,598
- Oh Lord Ran, as always,
your timing is perfect

442
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,934
and who might these
two young men be?

443
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,394
- They're my companions.

444
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,397
They've come to see the
boy I left with you.

445
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,898
- Your companions?

446
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,816
Interesting.

447
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,945
- She's certainly is beautiful.

448
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:23,825
I've seldom seen so much
beauty, she's equal to Shusui.

449
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,036
- Dear me, I'm
afraid that last part

450
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,913
is absolutely
unacceptable young master.

451
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,540
If you mean to
compliment a woman,

452
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,917
then you must never dream
of comparing her to another.

453
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,087
- Oh, is that so

454
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,923
(dog barking)

455
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,718
- I don't believe,
you let them get away.

456
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,137
This is no time to
be fooling around.

457
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,598
We are here to make a name
for ourselves in the Capital,

458
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,641
and become the boss
to the downtown core,

459
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:51,728
so why in the hell aren't you
able to catch one single boy?

460
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,730
- You're right boss,
but we got it covered,

461
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,523
in fact, we have
word of him going

462
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,900
into a place called Kogaro

463
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,486
along with some girl who
was carrying an Abacus.

464
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,072
- Kogaro.

465
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,531
Hey Keichou.

466
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,699
- Yes.

467
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,867
- What is Kogaro?

468
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,410
Some kind of bravo?

469
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,246
- Yes, actually it's the top
brothel in the whole district.

470
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,790
The famous courtesan Kochou

471
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,626
has clients paying 1000
gold coins for her.

472
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,463
- The right to make up for
the trouble I'd been through

473
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,591
I think I'll make
this Kochou my girl.

474
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,468
- Boys, I got a
great idea why don't

475

new base of operation?

476
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,472

Could it be..

00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,274
- Hmm I've definitely
made the right choice

480
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,569
in going after those, steal
that thing from someone

481
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,698
threatening you'll pay
any price to get it back,

482
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,534
his businesses is gold,
this is a great one.

483
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,787
Located boys start
getting things packed up.

484
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,498
(men shouting)

485
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,043
- Huh.

486
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,879
(dogs barking)

487
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:03,174
(footsteps approaching)

488
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,516
- [Man] Shuurei.

489
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,727
- Oh jeez, what are doing here?

490
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,857
So you decided to sneak
out with General Ran

491
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,901
and Lord Kyou and go have
some fun in a brothel, did ya?

492
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,696
- No you're wrong Shuurei.

493
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,656
I don't need to come to
this kinda place for that,

494
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,742
I can do as much as
I like in the palace.

495
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,331
(giggling)

496
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,584
Well, I mean. I.....I

497
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,638
(singing in foreign language)

498
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,962
- Before I knew it,
I was back at Kogaro.

499
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,006
What's Shi Ryuuki doing here

500
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,466
and why is Eigetsu being
hunted by gangsters?

501
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,677
Hey Santa what's that you say?

502
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,054

gonna attack Kogaro.
