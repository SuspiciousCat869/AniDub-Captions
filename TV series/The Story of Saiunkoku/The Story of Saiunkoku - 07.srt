1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,050
(bright music)

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,099
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

3
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,824
{\an8}(upbeat music)

4
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,854
(eerie music)

5
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,859
- [Narrator] Shuurei Hon's
kidnapper was Advisor Saw.

6
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,029
Hoping to surpass his friend
and rival Advisor Sho.

7
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,366
This was his first
and last gamble.

8
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,702
In order to bring
her back, Riokishi,

9
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,538
the king of Sion Koku
and Shuurei's husband,

10
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,415
decided to enter
the ministry of the

11
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,458
enlightened one's cave alone.

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,376
However.

13
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,753
- Don't do it, Riyuki.

14
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,672
Don't go over there.

15
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,801
Yuki!

16
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,429
(eerie music)

17
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,643
- Yuki, Yuki! where are you?

18
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,564
(crying)

19
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,523
There you are.

20
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,942
- Sayin

21
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,485
- You always come and
hide here in the garden

22
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,613
when you're upset, don't you?

23
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,366
Its okay now, I'm here with you.

24
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,037
(sigh)

25
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,580
- Sayin

26
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,665
(crying)

27
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,336
- Riyuki

28
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,507
Really, you can be so reckless.

29
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,051
(footsteps)

30
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:56,968
Huh?

31
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,929
- Find Advisor Saw immediately!

32
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,805
- Yes, sir.

33
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,393
(gasp)

34
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,311
- Sayin

35
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,025
- General run.

36
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,777
- Hurry and take them
to doctor Toe at once.

37
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,694
- Yes, sir.

38
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,537
- I can't imagine
Sayin did this.

39
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,831
But who then?

40
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,046
(footsteps)

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,801
(evil laugh)

42
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:38,968
- What are you doing, Riyuki?

43
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,969
Don't get any closer.

44
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,721
That isn't me down there.

45
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,764
Oh, you idiot.

46
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,851
(clank)

47
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,739
- How could you

48
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,699
have known

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,158
that wasn't the princess?

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,827
- Sorry to disappoint you
but Shuurei is no where

51
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,495
near as heavy as your comrad.

52
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,456
She couldn't make the
sound that he made.

53
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,878
- You'd make an
exceptional assassin.

54
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,887
- If I became that
kind of person,

55
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,431
then Shuurei would hate me.

56
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,943
- Riyuki

57
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,820
wait, you can't have.

58
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,071
You're not dead, are you?

59
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,865
- Shuurei

60
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:46,911
are you all right?

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,914
- Yuki

62
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,711
I'm so glad you're safe.

63
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,883
Thank you for saving me.

64
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,552
Its so dark in here,
you must've been scared.

65
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,598
- Even in the darkness,

66
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,059
I'm not afraid as long
as you're here, Shuurei.

67
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,813
- Then I'm glad.

68
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,740
- Shuurei!

69
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,657
Hey!

70
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,076
Pull yourself together!

71
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,160
Shuurei!

72
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,078
Shuurei!

73
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,211
- Koyu, so how is Shuurei doing?

74
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,420
- I don't know.

75
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,507
Doctor Toe and Advisor
Sho are look after her.

76
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,216
- I see.

77
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,052
What about Advisor Saw?

78
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,887
- My subordinates are
searching for him now.

79
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:46,930
I imagine its only
a matter of time

80
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,139
before he's caught.

81
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,103
I heard that Kodeen tried to
commit suicide with poison.

82
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,647
In order to protect Advisor Saw.

83
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,483
She wanted to shoulder all
the responsibility herself.

84
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,196
- If I had been there any later,

85
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,824
her life owuldve been in danger.

86
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,118
That's why I always
say women are stupid.

87
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,286
She never even thought
about why Advisor Saw didn't

88
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,663
involve her in all of this.

89
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,124
She never realized how
much he cared about her.

90
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,250
She just went ahead on her own,

91
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,502
but in the end she
made things even worse.

92
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,880
- You know when it
comes down to it,

93
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,674
you and Kodeen are
very much alike.

94
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,970
Both of you were taken in
when you were very young.

95
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,930
And raised with a
lot of love and care.

96
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,807
You have both always
loved the person

97
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,518
who took you in more than
anyone else in the world.

98
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,815
But, still.

99
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,859
Even though you are alike,
you're not the same.

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,611
For one thing, if you start
going off too far on your own,

101
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,280
you'll always have
me to stop you.

102
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,825
After all, bringing you
back whenever you're lost

103
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,618
seems to be my responsibility.

104
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,831
- She's so stupid!

105
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,834
Advisor Saw didn't
involve her because

106
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,794
he cared so much
about her safety.

107
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,713
But, still.

108
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,175
I understand exactly
how Kodeen feels.

109
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,885
She wanted to do
something in return

110
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,845
'cause she was
treated so preciously.

111
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,191
- Advisor Soe, Doctor Toe.

112
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,319
How's Sayin? Sayin and Shuurei?

113
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,988
- The good news is that
Sayin is now in stable

114
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,740
condition and out of danger.

115
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,117
Council Han's condition
is another matter.

116
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,578
- What is it?

117
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,788
- Thanks to the antidote
your majesty has

118
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,247
been giving her,

119
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,876
the majority of the poison
has been safely neutralized.

120
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,587
But it seems there was
kind of poison used

121
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,339
that I'm not familiar with.

122
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,092
As such, I am unable
to counteract it.

123
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,969
At this rate, I'm
afraid that Council Han,

124
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,055
- Don't be ridiculous!

125
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,683
How dare you take
Shuurei's life so lightly?

126
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,809
What kind of
ingredients do you need

127
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,935
to make the antidote?

128
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,895
Whatever they are,
I'll get them.

129
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,730
No matter where in
the country they are.

130
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,899
I'll find them and
bring them here.

131
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,777
Just hurry up and counteract
the poison for Shuurei.

132
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,821
- Your majesty, I don't
even know what poison

133
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,322
was given to her.

134
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,117
- You're supposed to be the
best doctor in the country!

135
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,368
If you don't know
how to cure her,

136
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,911
then who else will?

137
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,163
Who else will?

138
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,377
Unacceptable.

139
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,174
Shuurei, I will not accept this.

140
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,719
To have you go somewhere
where I cannot reach you.

141
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,263
To have you go where I
can no longer follow.

142
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,806
I will never accept that!

143
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,351
- Pardon me, but I
just might be able

144
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,894
to get the antidote.

145
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,812
- Hmm?

146
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,149
- Hmm.

147
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,363
- It was you, wasn't it?

148
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,449
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

149
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,284
- Stop this nonsense!

150
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,995
You were the source of
Kodeen's poison, weren't you?

151
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,413
You were giving it to her.

152
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,707
So give me the antidote.

153
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,958
If you want something
in exchange,

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,168
then I'll give you
my word of honor

155
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,337
that I will fulfill
your one true wish.

156
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,714
- How interesting.

157
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,424
My one true wish, you say.

158
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,800
- Don't play innocent!

159
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,261
That's your reason
for doing all this!

160
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,137
I swear to you.

161
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,684
I swear I will become a
king you can approve of.

162
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,439
- A good promise.

163
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,151
Make certain that you never
forget those words of yours.

164
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,111
- The king will
always keep his word.

165
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,949
- King Riyuki has
certainly become

166
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,243
a much more competent
ruler of leet.

167
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,913
Well, wouldn't you agree
with me, black wolf?

168
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,916
In all these years you haven't
changed a bit, my lord.

169
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,959
Even since the days
of the former king.

170
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,296
That's an interesting
choice of words.

171
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,714
- You're always
thinking of the king

172
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,216
and nothing but the king.

173
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,010
It was the same eight years
ago and its the same now.

174
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,471
Why does your life
revolve around this?

175
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,015
Why are you so
obsessed with the king?

176
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,308
- Obsessed, you say?

177
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,270
Yes, it certainly is
an obsession for me.

178
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,106
But its not with
the king himself.

179
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,024
It's with an old promise.

180
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,359
A promise?

181
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,944
from a long time ago.

182
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,280
I promised them that
I would serve only

183
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,991
a king I deemed
worthy of my support.

184
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,370
And that I would guide
him without self interest.

185
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,455
I would never think
to serve the country

186
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,790
or its people.

187
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,875
Nor, would I ever
handle political affairs

188
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,211
based on my own
personal beliefs.

189
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,922
Therefore, no matter
the consequence,

190
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,174
without a king
worthy of my support,

191
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,553
I am not permitted
to act in any way.

192
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,429
So,

193
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,223
that is my obsession

194
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,434
and that is the promise
that I must keep.

195
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,227
No matter what the cost.

196
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,896
- To whom did you first
make this promise?

197
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,150
- I do not believe that is
something you need to know.

198
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,777
The reason you served
the former king was for

199
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,155
the sake of this
country and its people.

200
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,241
For me, the king himself
comes before all else.

201
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,494
For his sake, I am willing
to sacrifice anything.

202
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,414
- I have followed
your orders and taken

203
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,042
countless lives up
until this moment.

204
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,252
With every head that
fell, the world would

205
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,421
become a little better
for those in it.

206
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,465
However, the country
is stable now.

207
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,884
That is why I dissolve
the wolves of the wind

208
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,052
once and for all.

209
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,472
Only criminals should
be put to death.

210
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,307
That is my principle
and I would never,

211
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,558
ever breech it.

212
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,269
- Have I ever made you
breech that principle?

213
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,897
Shooswi is also a
wolf of the wind.

214
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,816
You went so far as to use
my people in that manner.

215
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,151
- Oh, come now.

216
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,986
Advisor Saw was a criminal
who intended to take

217
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,446
King Riyuki's life.

218
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,573
- Yes, but it was
because of you.

219
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,367
You sent Shuurei to the harem.

220
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,453
You had Sarem assigned as
King Riyuki's personal guard.

221
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,872
You played Shooswi at
Advisor Saw's side.

222
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,375
And you drew his attention
to King Sayin's existence.

223
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,293
You were behind
everything, weren't you?

224
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,212
All of these circumstances
were constructed

225
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,547
in order to sway Advisor
Saw's heart and make him

226
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,093
believe that at last he had
a chance to surpass you.

227
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,302
- For what purpose?

228
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,553
- For the king.

229
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,514
All of this was simply
for the sake of pushing

230
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,599
Riyuki to become
a competent ruler.

231
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,977
Advisor Saw was only a pawn
being used to that end.

232
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,522
- Hmm.

233
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,482
It's times like
these that remind me

234
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,109
how outstanding you are.

235
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,152
If you had been one of the
royal court's principle

236
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,612
ministers eight years ago,

237
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,948
the country would likely
never have fallen into

238
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,533
such chaos and despair.

239
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,953
So, you named him Sayranshi.

240
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,498
Shi means purple plant
representing his ties

241
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,083
to the royal family.

242
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,627
Thirteen years ago,
you took in Prince Han.

243
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,212
After he was exiled.

244
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,090
Educated Prince Riyuki and
encouraged him to study.

245
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,384
As so to train him
in martial arts.

246
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,970
And of course raised
a wonderful daughter

247
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,388
who's accredit to your name.

248
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,350
- Is that sarcasm?

249
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,309
- Far from it.

250
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,644
It's heartfelt gratitude.

251
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,396
It's because of
people like you that

252
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,981
this country carries on.

253
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,900
Though, we'll always be
a need for your kind.

254
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,236
- I will not forgive you
for what you've done.

255
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,530
Shuurei and Sayin have
served th eking diligently.

256
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,407
Yet, you wouldn't care
if they were killed.

257
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,076
- I had no intention
of killing them.

258
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,245
- But you were willing to
consider them dispensable

259
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,538
in this plan, weren't you?

260
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,082
Please be prepared.

261
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,044
I will definitely come and
kill you one of these days.

262
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,504
- I'll be looking forward to it.

263
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,002
- Riyuki

264
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,673
- Oh, thank goodness. Shuurei.

265
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,601
- Well that's a great relief.

266
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,811
Now that it's all been settled,

267
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,688
I'll leave the rest to you.

268
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,314
- I owe you an apology.

269
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,149
You ended up being
dragged down this path

270
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,609
all because I took you in.

271
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,154
- Do you truly regret
it that much, my lord?

272
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,739
Taking me in like you did.

273
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,159
- I didn't mean it
like that Shooswi.

274
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,161
My only regret is
that I wasn't able

275
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,497
to send you along a
better road in life.

276
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,541
- Its not that, Lord Shoka.

277
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,377
I just wanted to be by
your side, helping you.

278
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,547
But look at everything that
wish ended up leading to.

279
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,090
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,133
I'm so sorry.

281
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,886
That's...

282
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,847
- I found this handkerchief
left in the archives one day.

283
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,433
It was from you,
wasn't it, Shooswi?

284
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,809
Thank you.

285
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,394
I know embroidery has never
been your strong suit.

286
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,354
But you've shown
tremendous improvement.

287
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,356
I'm amazed at how
well it's made.

288
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,649
This lion.

289
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,817
Especially the mane.

290
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,318
Look at it, it's so

291
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,862
- It's a flower.

292
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,321
- Eh?

293
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,740
- It was supposed to
be a floral pattern.

294
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:08,867
- Why, of course it is!

295
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,493
How silly of me?

296
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,786
This is wonderful!

297
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,121
A flower.

298
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,080
With a mane.

299
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,295
I'm guessing when that damn
old man approached you,

300
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,798
he promised you that Shuurei's
wouldn't be in danger, right?

301
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,759
Don't worry, you're
not the one at fault.

302
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,218
You are a wolf of the wind.

303
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,220
And as such, you had
an obligation to obey

304
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,847
Advisor Sho's orders.

305
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,559
I'm the one to blame for not
realizing his intentions sooner

306
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,812
This must've been very
hard for you, forgive me.

307
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,105
- Lord Shoka.

308
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,534
- I've grown so old.

309
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,619
- Nonsense.

310
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,498
If you ask me, you haven't
changed a bit over the years.

311
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,756
You could be at least
a little surprised.

312
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,342
- Do you honestly expect
me to be surprised

313
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,260
by every trivial thing you do?

314
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,764
- Tell me Enjune
Saw, why was it me?

315
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,474
Why did I have to be
the person for you

316
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,352
to pour all your
strongest emotions into?

317
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,354
Surely, you must have known.

318
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,941
In the end, I'm not the person
you always believe to be.

319
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,901
- Oh, I think you are.

320
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,277
I was chasing after you,

321
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,571
because it was you, Sho.

322
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,409
Your identity, who you are,
that had nothing to do with it

323
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,786
It wasn't your shadow
I was chasing after.

324
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,622
It was you, as you stand
before me right now.

325
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,212
- Fifty years, we been
through a lot together.

326
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,588
Myself, you and Soe,

327
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,841
it was always the three of us.

328
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,758
- You're right.

329
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,722
You know, I hated you so
much for the longest time.

330
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,724
All those years, you'd
walk in front of me

331
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,185
with that aloof and
unreachable look on your face.

332
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,187
- You're stubborn
right until the end,

333
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,439
aren't you, Enjune?

334
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,607
Like I said, you never change.

335
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,444
As for me, I liked you honestly.

336
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,697
- For just once in my
life, I would have liked

337
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,283
to leave you at a
complete loss for words.

338
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,617
- What are you talking about?

339
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,785
Up until this moment,

340
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,579
there have been many
times when you succeeded

341
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,497
at leaving me speechless.

342
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,499
It would be wise
for you to remember.

343
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,710
He who swims a lot, will drown.

344
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,253
- It's too late for that.

345
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,550
- Despite everything,
you still cared for me,

346
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,635
didn't you Enjune?

347
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,512
Isn't that why you've
granted me these last

348
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,930
few moments of your life?

349
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,357
Enjune, I loved you.

350
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,233
I always loved you.

351
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,319
These fifty years
we been together,

352
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,820
grown old together.

353
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,697
Just who did you
think I did it for?

354
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,992
I never wanted to
kill you, Enjune.

355
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,453
But no matter how much
it pained my heart,

356
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,663
taking your life was my duty.

357
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,000
It was my final obligation as
the man who ruined your life.

358
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,462
As your friend, whom
you both loved and hated

359
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,880
with your whole heart.

360
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,716
And as your friend,
who truly loved you.

361
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,718
You said that you'd grown old,

362
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,845
but you haven't aged one bit.

363
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,514
Even in this last moment,

364
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,933
you're still as you were
when you were young.

365
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,394
Rational yet extreme.

366
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,771
And always you remained
a man who was kind

367
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,439
to the women in his life.

368
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,567
I envy you, Enjune Saw.

369
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,568
For being human.

370
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,407
- Time flies, doesn't it?

371
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,908
It doesn't feel like
it's been that long.

372
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,285
But three months have
passed since we came here.

373
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,161
- You're right.

374
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,497
Time has gone by very quickly.

375
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,916
- I've decided, lets
go back home tomorrow.

376
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,586
- But m'lady, are you
quite certain about this?

377
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,672
- The king now thinks
of himself as a king

378
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,090
and knows how to be one.

379
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,009
That means there's no
longer anything left for me

380
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,760
to do here in the palace.

381
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,430
- I imagine he'll be very
lonely once you're gone.

382
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,390
How do you intend
to break it to him?

383
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,517
- Actually, I've
already told him.

384
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,435
- Huh?

385
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,395
- You know what he said?

386
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,980
- Is that so?

387
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:07,897
I understand.

388
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,817
- He could've shown a
little more reluctance

389
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,694
to part with me, don't ya think?

390
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,738
- Maybe he was
only acting calmly.

391
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,532
Tell me, did the king go out
into the garden after that?

392
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,450
- Hmm.

393
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,826
He did now that you mention it.

394
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,080
- I just noticed the trees
in the garden need pruning.

395
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,959
- He did say
something like that.

396
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,378
- I'm sure deep down,
the king is upset.

397
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,423
And he must feel very lonely
and sad to see you go.

398
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,632
- You're right.

399
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,551
Actually I already
kinda sensed that.

400
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,761
It's surprised me.

401
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,970
But he really has become
quite attached to me.

402
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,097
- Will you be lonely, my lady?

403
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,684
- I know this much.

404
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,395
That man will make
a wonderful king.

405
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,104
- Yeah.

406
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,018
- Thank you all, for everything.

407
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,438
- Huh?

408
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,065
(birds chirping)

409
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,483
- Where's Advisor Sho?

410
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,658
- I would like to have
said my goodbyes to Shuurei

411
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,992
before she left the palace.

412
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:45,161
Don't you think this a
little on the cruel side

413
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,830
to keep me locked away in here?

414
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,501
The flower that symbolizes
you and your family

415
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,877
is the daphne right?

416
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:53,795
- Yes.

417
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,717
Enjune's flower was the
chrysanthemum, wasn't it?

418
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,427
- Proud and dignified.

419
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,763
He was truly the embodiment
of that flower's virtues.

420
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,228
- That was a very stupid
thing you did Sho.

421
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,105
But you did well.

422
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,732
- Soe?

423
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,649
- What is it?

424
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,526
- Do me one favor, old friend.

425
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,112
Don't go and leave
me behind too soon.

426
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,076
- Don't tell me Advisor
Sho is thinking about

427
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,204
not paying me the reward
money he promised.

428
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,831
- Shuurei, what are you saying?

429
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:32,083
Could it be you only
married me for the money?

430
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,669
And now you've had your fun,
your in a rush to dump me?

431
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,837
- Don't put it like that!

432
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,964
This is legitimate payment.

433
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,924
- How much reward money
did that old bastard

434
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,218
promise you in return
for marrying me?

435
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,762
- Old bastard is a little much.

436
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,097
- Old bastard is
completely appropriate.

437
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:46,973
- It's appropriate.

438
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:47,974
- It's appropriate.

439
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:48,850
- More than appropriate.

440
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:49,851
- Appropriate I'd say.

441
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,063
- Oh.

442
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,481
- So, tell me how much?

443
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,692
- Hmm, 500 gold coins.

444
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:58,943
- That's all he offered?

445
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,945
Shuurei, you can't
go home just yet.

446
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:01,946
I'll pay--

447
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,281
- Okay, okay, that's enough.

448
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,866
A man who keeps badgering a girl

449
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,284
is only gonna end
up being hated.

450
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,119
Do you really think you
can hope to surpass Saydan

451
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,913
if you keep up that attitude?

452
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,499
You're gonna give it another
shot with her, right?

453
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,544
So Saydan, are you seriously
going to return to your old

454
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:17,879
position after all this?

455
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,590
- Yes, I think it's
only proper for me.

456
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:21,800
- I see.

457
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,010
Well, if you ever
change your mind,

458
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,554
feel free to call
upon the Ooreen army.

459
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,848
If it's you, we'll welcome
you with open arms.

460
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,602
- Shooswi, thank
you for everything.

461
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,814
I was able to get by
somehow because of you.

462
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,982
I'm truly grateful
for all your help.

463
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:38,900
- Lady Shuurei.

464
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,862
- When you can
get some time off,

465
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,864
please come and visit us, okay?

466
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,701
And give my best
to Kodeen, as well.

467
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,794
- This is goodbye.

468
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,215
- Shuurei, there's one
thing I forgot to tell you.

469
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,343
I'm sorry for keeping
it from you but

470
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,012
I don't only like men.

471
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,014
I like women too.

472
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:09,889
- What?

473
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,908
- You creep!

474
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,785
How could you in front
of all these people?

475
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,037
- Just wait and see.

476
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,164
I'm sure you'll be
back here soon enough.

477
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,252
- There's no way I'm ever
gonna come back here,

478
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,920
you shameless man!

479
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,763
(foreign singing)

480
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,086
- I hate the summer time.

481
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,004
It's hot.

482
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,213
There are thunderstorms.

483
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,215
There's a dirty man
collapsed at our gate.

484
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,216

00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,844
Pull yourself together!

487
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:11,761
What?

488
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:13,138
