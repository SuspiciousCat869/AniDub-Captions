1
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,342
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,351
{\an8}(anime theme music)

3
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,231
(crickets creaking

4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,484
- [Narrator] It's long been said

5
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,820
that women can
transform themselves.

6
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,822
Well, it's now been
10 days since Shuurei

7
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,615
started working
in the outer court

8
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,326
disguised at a young
man and doing odd jobs

9
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,370
for the senior
secretary of finance.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,458
- [Shuurei] Hello, I'm back.

11
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,670
- Thank you, Shu,
and welcome back

12
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,588
it must have been
scorching hot outside

13
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,549
- The heat doesn't bother me

14
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,508
- Shu Hung

15
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,592
(bell chimes)
- Yes.

16
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,971
- What can I do for you?

17
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,348
- Put these letters
in order of dates

18
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,267
and take them to the archives.

19
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,352
You can also tidy those shelves,

20
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,354
throw away all the
papers stacked over there

21
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,856
go to the archives
borrow the books

22
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,734
listed here on this sheet
and return these five texts.

23
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,694
On your way, drop
this off at the temple

24
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,112
then tell the director,

25
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,864
what's the big idea submitting
this garbage estimate?

26
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,324
Have your brains
rotted away you idiot?

27
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,617
Say it exactly as I did,

28
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,704
don't leave a single
word out, that's all

29
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,580
- Yes sir

30
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,418
(bells chimez)

31
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,345
- I must admit I'm
surprised to see her

32
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,389
working harder than the
men despite this heat.

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,767
Last time she was acting
as the royal consort.

34
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,436
This time she's dressing like
a boy and acting as a page.

35
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,605
She really is living
a full life isn't she?

36
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,026
But you came up with
quite the idea Kouyuu.

37
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,737
Not only did you manage to
stick her into the short staffed

38
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,947
department of finance,
you even specifically

39
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,284
assigned her to Secretary Kou
as his personal assistant.

40
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,661
- Hi

41
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,373
- Hello father, (clears
throat) Lord Choka.

42
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,500
I've come to return these books

43
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,918
- Hey, not to worry princess,

44
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,920
right now we're
the only ones here.

45
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,381
- It seems that Ensei is
being put hard to work as well

46
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,716
even though he only came
to watch over Shuurei.

47
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,718
- While that man is as
competent as they come,

48
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,762
he's about as weird
as they come too.

49
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,972
Everything about Senior
Secretary Kou and his life

50
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,308
is shrouded in mystery.

51
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,851
When it comes to misfortune,

52
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,646
this might end up being the
worst year of Shuurei's life.

53
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,940
- The thing that
I'm nervous about

54
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,109
is that someone's gonna
figure out I'm female.

55
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,735
- No worries about that Princess

56
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,487
Kouyuu said so
himself, didn't he?

57
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,781
- There's no need to worry, I
mean with that figure of yours

58
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,534
there's no way anyone
would notice you're a woman

59
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,410
- Am I right

60
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,038
- But senior secretary
Kou is very observant

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,666
- Don't worry, people will
definitely see you as a boy

62
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,543
so have a bit more confidence.

63
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,461
(Shuurei groaning)

64
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,589
- What is that supposed to mean?

65
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,882
(shuurei grinning)

66
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,758
- Ah, well.

67
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,846
wow, you're so amazingly
feminine Princess.

68
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,474
I mean look, you're
so good at cooking

69
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,018
- Nice try you.

70
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,146
- Once again thank you so much
general Ran and Lord Kouyuu.

71
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,440
You brought us so
much food as always.

72
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,858
- Please, it was nothing.

73
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,610
- You must enjoy cooking
given your lovely cuisine

74
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,862
- Just give it a rest

75
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,488
- Seiran, you're
still out on loan

76
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,656
to help with hunting bandits

77
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,992
so make sure you
eat properly, okay?

78
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,535
- Sure.

79
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,370
- [Kouyuu] By the way,
Shuurei, how's work going?

80
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,498
- Great, thank you,
every day is so much fun.

81
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,416
- Really?

82
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,001
fun, huh?

83
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,003
- Oh, Lord Kouyuu,
if you don't mind,

84
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,839
could you please help me
study after dinner again?

85
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,715
- [Kouyuu] Sure.

86
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,637
(soft piano instrumental)

87
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,186
- All right, we'll leave
it at that for today.

88
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,104
- Thank you very much.

89
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,106
- [Kouyuu] Now, about
today's homework.

90
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,741
- What an idiot.

91
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,162
(crickets creaking)

92
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,425
- Shu Hong.

93
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,134
- [Shuurei] Yes.

94
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,640
What can I do for you?

95
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,476
- Tell me, if there was a
surplus in the national budget,

96
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,019
what would you do
with the money?

97
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,772
- That's a good question.

98
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,067
Well, I think I would
establish financial aid

99
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,902
for midwives and pregnant women.

100
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,195
Either that or perhaps set up

101
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,947
some sort of
financial assistance

102
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,532
for poor and needy scholars.

103
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,701
Oh, and some of the
money should be allocated

104
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,452
for research on improving grains

105
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,121
that are resistant to disasters.

106
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,081
There are plenty of ways
to spend the budget.

107
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,666
Even if you have money leftover,

108
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,668
you can feed it to
people in a crisis

109
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,753
so it should be spent now
in ways that will be useful

110
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,754
in the future.

111
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,672
- Hey, I'm back.

112
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,590
- Ah, thanks for the hard work.

113
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,550
- Hi there, Ensei.

114
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,467
- Shu Hong.

115
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,719
- Oh, yes, sir.

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,805
- Return these papers to
Koro temple with Ensei.

117
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,806
- Right away, Sir.

118
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,231
- That child really
does work very hard

119
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,734
and makes some pretty
impressive comments too.

120
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,487
I can't help but think
that it's such a waste.

121
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,490
It's only a one month
temporary position.

122
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,248
- I had no idea Koro temple
was in such bad shape.

123
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,583
- [Shuurei] No wonder
they've been giving

124
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,252
such outrageous
estimates, who wouldn't?

125
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,837
- There's only one head
that's working properly

126
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,007
in this insane heat and
that Senior Secretary Kou's.

127
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,968
- Surely it's gotta be awfully
hot wearing a mask like that.

128
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,636
- Yeah, but the rumor
around the palace

129
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,263
has it that he never
takes that mask off

130
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,723
in front of other people.

131
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,974
- [Shuurei] Come to think of it,

132
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,768
he wears different
ones, doesn't he?

133
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,728
- [Ensei] I wonder how many
of those weird looking masks

134
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,729
he's got at home.

135
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,983
- I have to wonder why he wears
a mask in the first place.

136
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,985
- Supposedly, he got
rejected by a woman

137
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:24,986
because of his looks.

138
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,154
- What?

139
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,655
- It is just a rumor.

140
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,700
- But if it's true,
then that mask of his

141
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,286
must be hiding a
really hideous face.

142
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,622
But looks aren't everything
when it comes to people.

143
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,290
Secretary Kou is not a bad man

144
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,917
and while he's hard on people,

145
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,169
he's intelligent, rich and
has high social standing.

146
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,838
If you married him you'd be
able to live in great comfort

147
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,882
- That comment sure your
shows your priorities.

148
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,841
- What are you talking about?

149
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,176
Money's very important.

150
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,053
- (chuckles) When
it comes down to it,

151
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,221
I'm glad Seiron asked me

152
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,056
to be your guard
these past few days.

153
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,225
It's a lot of fun being
with you princess.

154
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,689
- [Shuurei] I wonder if Seiron
will come home safe today.

155
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,233
- [Ensei] Hey, knowing
him, he should be fine.

156
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,819
- You're right, but still,

157
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,905
I'm really glad he has a
good friend like you, Ensei.

158
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,323
- What do you mean?

159
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,783
- Seiron has a habit of
keeping a certain distance

160
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,868
between himself and others.

161
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,705
So, it's really great
that he has a friend

162
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,623
that he's comfortable
with, you know?

163
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,670
- You're a good kid Princess.

164
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,054
(shuurei gasping)

165
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,807
- Shuurei, is that you?

166
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,351
That's strange, I
could have sworn

167
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,228
I just sensed
Shuurei's presence.

168
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,355
But she can't be here,
it must be the heat.

169
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,360
(canorous music)

170
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,822
- Oh, wow, It's like he's
got an animal sense of smell.

171
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,616
- Those look heavy, please,
allow me to help you.

172
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,370
You're taking them to Secretary
Kou, aren't you (chuckles)?

173
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,749
I heard that a really
hard working boy

174
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,375
joined the Department
of Finance recently.

175
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,293
That's you right?

176
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,377
So, what's your name?

177
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,004
- I'm Shu Hong.

178
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,380
- Shu is it, huh?

179
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,717
Secretary Kou is Very
strict, must be difficult.

180
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,093
- That's true but
on the other hand,

181
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,636
I find it a challenge.

182
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,931
- What a good kid.

183
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,308
- Uh, thank you.

184
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,226
- By the way my dear young Shu,

185
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,728
What do you think of me?

186
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,979
- What do I think of you?

187
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,690
- I don't mind if you
wanna be direct with me.

188
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,651
- I think you're a nice person.

189
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,113
- You really mean
it (chuckling)?

190
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,659
- Thank you for carrying
all those books for me.

191
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,995
The Department of Finance
is right over there.

192
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,039
So, what's your name?

193
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,082
- Who, me?

194
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,166
Why I'm your...

195
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,420
nevermind that, I
have a better idea.

196
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,964
Please, call me uncle.

197
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,841
- you'd like me
to call you uncle?

198
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,302
- That's right, it's nice uncle.

199
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,137
Well then, keep doing your best.

200
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,056
- All right, thank
you for your help.

201
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,062
(uncle chuckling)

202
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,106
- Thanks uncle.

203
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,776
- (gasping) Music to my ears.

204
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,070
Goodbye then, I'm sure
we'll see each other

205
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,446
around my dear Shu.

206
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,075
- Wow, the heat really
does bring out the weirdos.

207
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,828
- Hello sir, I'm back.

208
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,706
Huh.

209
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,843
Senior Secretary Kou must
be absolutely exhausted.

210
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,394
He has such beautiful hair.

211
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,901
Wow, its so soft, its like silk.

212
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,237
(soft piano)

213
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,117
(thunder rumbling)

214
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,118
Could this be?

215
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,290
(thunder rumbling)

216
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,751
- What are you doing?

217
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,255
- I uh...

218
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,426
(thunder striking)

219
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,094
(Shuurei wailing)

220
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,431
- Shu Hong, calm
yourself, what's wrong?

221
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,145
(man grunting)

222
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,773
- My lady Shuurei.

223
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,524
- What are you doing
just standing there?

224
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,234
Back to base for now.

225
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,903
- Yes, Sir.

226
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,114
(fast paced music)

227
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,002
(thunder striking)

228
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,254
(Shuurei wailing)

229
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,548
- Hey, what's wrong ?

230
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,133
Calm down, Shu Hong.

231
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,386
(Shuurei wailing)

232
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,303
Hey.

233
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,099
(Shuurei wailing)

234
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,442
There, there,
everything's all right.

235
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,448
(both gasping)

236
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,246
- Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

237
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,582
(Ensei laughing)

238
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,959
- [Ensei] I got to see

239
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,335
something really
interesting today.

240
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,587
- Stop, it's no laughing matter.

241
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,673
- I was worried about you
when the storm started

242
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,134
because you hate thunder
so much but I'm glad

243
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,970
you didn't have to endure
it by yourself my lady.

244
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,264
- This is awful, no
doubt Secretary Kou

245
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,057
is thoroughly disgusted with me.

246
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,392
- I think this has
been quite good.

247
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,019
- What do you mean?

248
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,687
- Think about it, normally
at this time of the year,

249
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,356
you always get
depressed and feel down.

250
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,442
- It seems that working in
the outer courts this month

251
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,153
has been a good change of
scenery for you, hasn't it?

252
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,283
- Yeah, but the job is only
gonna last for a month.

253
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,451
- Shuurei.

254
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,703
- it's okay, I'm
really satisfied.

255
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,496
Even if it is only for a month.

256
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,339
(door knocking)

257
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,010
- Here, a snack for our
hard working Princess.

258
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,345
- Why thank you, Ensei.

259
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,723
- [Ensei] you know, there
was a time in the past

260
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,099
when I was thinking about taking

261
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,726
the regional civil
service exams.

262
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,064
- [Shuurei] So, you wanted to
become a Provincial Official?

263
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,440
- [Ensei] Well, yeah.

264
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,275
- [Shuurei] And?

265
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,235
- [Ensei] A number
of things came up

266
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,155
so in the end, but
you know how it goes.

267
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,531
- [Shuurei] But hey,
maybe you could take it

268
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,617
next time or sometime
in the future,

269
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,494
- [Ensei] Maybe I
wil and if I do,

270
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,372
I can study together
with you, good idea, huh?

271
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,124
- [SHuurei] Lord Koyu is an
incredibly strict teacher.

272
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,460
- [Ensei] Oh, well,
pass on that then.

273
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,088
(Shuurei chuckling)

274
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,174
- Hey, Ensei, if
someone keeps chasing

275
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:04,344
after an impossible dream,
does that make them foolish?

276
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,845
- [Ensei] Let me guess,

277
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,681
your dream is to become a
Court Official, isn't it?

278
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
- You knew?

279
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,768
- it wasn't difficult.

280
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,688
You're working hard like
this every night until late

281
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,648
and you seem to be
really enjoying the work

282
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,149
in the outer courts.

283
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,402
- Yeah, but no matter how
hard I try it doesn't matter.

284
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,154
Women can't take the
National Civil Service Exams.

285
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,823
- And yet, despite
knowing that fact,

286
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,491
you're still studying hard,

287
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,493
- I guess, but then we're free

288
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,413
to chase after whatever
dreams we desire.

289
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,833
You know, lately, it seems
to be closer than ever.

290
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,334
- [Ensei] Closer?

291
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,295
- My dream and reality
are so close right now.

292
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,798
Working in the Department
of Finance every day.

293
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,259
It's like the border of
my dream is within reach.

294
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,762
Like, if I tried, I could
grasp it in my hands.

295
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,891
I never really knew
that becoming an adult

296
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,602
makes it so much harder to
keep chasing your dreams.

297
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,357
- Even so, you still haven't
given up, have you, Princess?

298
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,115
- Well, no, I wanna
do as much I can.

299
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,534
- That's the princess I know.

300
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,204
You gotta try even if it's
a small bit at a time,

301
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,790
they say a journey of 1000
miles begins with a single step

302
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,209
and even small steps
might lead to a major goal

303
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,294
especially for you.

304
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,215
(soft folk msic)

305
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,885
- Thanks Ensei, You've
made me feel much better.

306
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,304
You're like fresh air
in a way, aren't you?

307
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,765
I can sorta understand
now why father and Seiron

308
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,558
ended up sending you in here.

309
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,771
- So, how are you able to tell?

310
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,856
from how the rice
balls are shaped.

311
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,649
Father's is the one
that's poorly formed

312
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,610
While Seiron's is
the large round one

313
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,528
that'll probably
be light on salt.

314
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,823
After all, I did say
something strange at dinner.

315
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,912
- wow, you're definitely a
sharp one, aren't you, Princess?

316
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,792
And just for the record, I
think you'd be really suited

317
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,251
to become a Court Official.

318
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,420
So, I hope you never
give up on your dream.

319
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,549
(soft folk music)

320
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,551
- Now then, back to work.

321
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,604
- [kouyuu] Are you still
working on that proposal?

322
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,231
Talk about tenacious.

323
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,401
- Well, it's lonely not
being able to see Shuurei.

324
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,820
I wanna get this bill passed
as quickly as possible.

325
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,196
- [kouyuu] In a certain sense,

326
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,948
this is all selfishly motivated.

327
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,324
- What are you talking about?

328
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,660
This world is made
of men and women.

329
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,620
The idea that politics
are only for men

330
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,205
is completely outdated.

331
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,457
Opening the doors for women
to become Court Officials

332
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,377
will not only be good for
them, but good for the country.

333
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,215
- Your Majesty.

334
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,220
- Just a little longer Shuurei.

335
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,892
- Uncle (chuckling)

336
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,562
uncle, huh, I love
the sound of that.

337
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,523
- So, Reishin Hong, are
you the one responsible

338
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,025
for sending that woman to me?

339
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,569
- No, you'd have to talk
To Kouyuu about that one.

340
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,738
No doubt he thought that
having you see firsthand

341
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,448
how she worked would
be the quickest way

342
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,367
to bring you around to
his way of thinking.

343
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,245
You knew she was a woman
yet still hired her.

344
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,372
- [Kou] We were simply
short on people.

345
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,250
Introducing a bill for women
to take the National Exams

346
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,711
is an utterly impossible
and foolish idea

347
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,463
- Because, his Majesty
wants it starting

348
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,340
from the next exam, right?

349
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,925
That's why you walked out
and killed it without a word.

350
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,553
- There's not enough time to
get things properly organized.

351
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,930
Not only will it take time
to change the preconception

352
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,599
that politics are only for men,

353
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,059
but we'd also need to create

354
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,437
a large number of programs
for women to take the exams.

355
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,855
(Reishin chuckling)

356
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,316
Why did you, the clever,
cool headed, cold blooded,

357
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,818
heartless, pettyless, icy
head of the Department

358
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,405
of Civil Affairs not oppose
this ridiculous proposal?

359
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,865
- What a foolish question.

360
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,951
Just what have you been
seeing in the child every day?

361
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,745
- [Kou] Are you suggesting
she's at a level

362
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,498
where she could pass
the National Exams?

363
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,792
- Of course, and in
the top ranks too.

364
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,336
That comes with Koyu's
close personal guarantee.

365
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,548
- If you discount the fact
that he's your adopted son,

366
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,510
Assistant Secretary Lee, he's
a wonderfully talented person

367
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,053
to bear the burden of this era.

368
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,846
And if you ignore
the regrettable fact

369
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:20,600
that Shu Hong is your niece,
she's actually quite superb.

370
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,519
Perhaps taking that
young girl as my wife

371
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,437
might not be such a bad idea.

372
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,647
- What?

373
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,440
Absolutely not,
I won't allow it.

374
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,401
- You can't even tell
you're her real uncle

375
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,861
so what right do you
have to oppose it?

376
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,863
(Reishin groaning)

377
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,700
- This one's my
latest, take it, here.

378
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,707
I must admit this latest one
of mine is a masterpiece.

379
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,418
It's the slightly done
in by summer heat look.

380
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,712
If you wear this mask, no
doubt the people around you

381
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,547
will feel more
sympathetic and realize

382
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,424
that even the
great Secretary Kou

383
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,676
must be having difficulty in
this horrible summer heat.

384
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,845
- [Kou] I don't want
it, take it with you.

385
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,100
(soft folk music)

386
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,687
- Sir, I was wondering
if you'd enjoy

387
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,855
taking a short break.

388
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,569
Even if it's only once a day
for tea, it won't hurt honest.

389
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,614
- All right.

390
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,463
(Shuurei shreaking)

391
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,382
(Kou sipping tea)

392
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,180
- [Yuri] For him to
take a break so readily

393
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,474
and drink tea,
it's very unusual.

394
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,601
- Is it really?

395
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,395
- Secretary Kou must
be quite fond of you.

396
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,106
- Of me?

397
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,651
- Yes, by the way Shu, have
you taken the National Exams?

398
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,029
- No.

399
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,572
- What?

400
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,115
I was sure you would
have tried at least once.

401
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,201
In that case, you should
write the next exam

402
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,578
and then join the Department
of Finance formally.

403
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,829
We would love to have you

404
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,166
- I'm really happy to
hear you say so, sir

405
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,794
but to tell the truth,
I'm not in a position

406
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,504
to do the national exams.

407
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,963
- You can't take them?

408
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,548
- Yuri.

409
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,759
Both Ting Gaiko and Sonchi
Hecki have collapsed.

410
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,219
(Yuri gasping)

411
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,012
- So, the heat is claimed
even those two in the end.

412
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,514
- [Kou] Summer
will be over soon.

413
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,849
We'll be fine if we
hang in a little longer.

414
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,852
- Sir, we'll be sure to keep
doing our best, right Ensei?,

415
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,105
- Oh, yeah, sure, of course.

416
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,524
Well, as long as it's something
we can handle that is.

417
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,901
- in that case,
Ensei, as of now,

418
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,778
you're temporary
Administrative Official

419
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,571
of the Department of Finance.

420
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,073
You're responsible for
the work of the two

421
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,491
that just collapsed.

422
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,618
I'll write a letter
of authority later,

423
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,453
you can handle this, can't you?

424
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,718
- Why, why can't I get
to his Majesty's rooms?

425
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,845
I've gone there countless times.

426
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,806
I don't believe this, how
can I possibly get lost?

427
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,475
- [Kei] Assistance
Secretary Lee.

428
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,811
Hello there, Assistant
Secretary Kei.

429
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,772
- I wanted to discuss
something about Shu.

430
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,899
- Have they found
out she's a girl?

431
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,776
Has he been causing
any problems?

432
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,570
Not at all, in fact,
quite the opposite,

433
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,030
he works really hard.

434
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,158
Secretary Kou seems to
have taken to him as well.

435
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,285
- Oh, the senior secretary?

436
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,537
- I think she would make
an excellent official.

437
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,622
When I asked him about
it, he was evasive

438
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:30,790
and said that he can't take

439
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,167
the National Civil
Service Exams.

440
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,296
So, I was thinking, if
there's some financial reason

441
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,131
for that, then I
would be very happy

442
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,758
to become Shu's sponsor.

443
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,887
- Assistant Secretary
Kei, I know for a fact

444
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,180
that she Hong would
be very honored

445
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,973
to hear those words from you.

446
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,226
However, I regret to inform you
he cannot accept your offer.

447
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,853
I believe that you'll understand

448
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,814
the reason later once that
person becomes an official.

449
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,983
- Then she will take
the national exams?

450
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,985
- when the time comes, I
think either my superior

451
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,862
or I will take care
of the sponsorship.

452
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,530
- That's wonderful news.

453
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,784
- By the way, Secretary Kei.

454
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,993
- Yes.

455
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,745
- Where are you on
your way to now?

456
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,790
- Oh, actually, I'm delivering
a rush letter to his Majesty.

457
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,251
- Oh, what an
interesting coincidence.

458
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,922
As a matter of fact, so
am I, let's go together.

459
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,555
- Hunting bandits
again tonight, Ensei?

460
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,559
- So, you noticed then.

461
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,894
- you could say that

462
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,854
and even if I hadn't
noticed you sneaking away

463
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:35,980
I'd have figured it out,

464
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,107
each and every
bandit we've captured

465
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,692
said they were
searching for a man

466
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,361
with a cross shaped
scar on his left cheek.

467
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,029
- Oh boy.

468
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,614
- I don't know what you're up to

469
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,866
but don't cause any trouble
for the master or my lady.

470
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,661
What?

471
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,663
- Nothing, I was just thinking

472
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,206
about how lucky you
were to be taken in

473
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,290
by such a good family.

474
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,171
Princess really works hard
every night, doesn't she?

475
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,381
- Yeah.

476
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,050
- you know, the two of
you should get married.

477
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,677
- What did you just say?

478
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,596
- That way, everything would
fall neatly into place for you.

479
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:09,973
She'd be able to
continue studying

480
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,349
and people around
her would stop saying

481
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,934
she should get married soon.

482
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,228
And as for you, well,

483
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,980
given your rotten and
grumpy personality,

484
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,356
there aren't too many women

485
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,817
you would wanna spend
your life with are there?

486
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,610
- Keep this up and I'll
inform general Hoku

487
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,820
that you've been going out

488
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,031
and hunting Sal province
bandits every night.

489
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,617
- Sorry, I won't say
another word, later.

490
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,746
- Honestly.

491
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:38,710
- A journey of 1000 miles
begins with a single step.

492
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,672
(caronous music)

493
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:50,722
(anime soundtrack)

494
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,378
- Just who is Ensei anyway?

495
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,131
He's got a shaggy beard
and is pretty uncouth

496
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,091
but he works well and
has a great heart.

497
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,759
He seems to be a good fighter

498
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,970
and is being hunted by bandits.
