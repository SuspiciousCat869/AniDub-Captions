00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,649
- [Narrator] The
imperial archives,

5
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,317
a building that sits
in a quiet corner

6
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,028
of the Saiee Koku
Palace grounds.

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,030
It has absolutely
no connection to the

8
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,949
central government
administration,

9
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,993
and few officials know the
job here since it involves

10
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,871
nothing more than taking
care of dusty books.

11
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,792
- [Shurei] Father!

12
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,210
- Oh, hello Shurei.

13
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,212
- Why don't you join
us for tea father?

14
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,131
This is Mr. Shuei Ran.

15
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,925
You know each other, right?

16
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,301
- Oh why of course we do.

17
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,679
Welcome your maj, I mean Shuei.

18
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,726
- (coughs) Good day
to you too Shoka.

19
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,313
- [Shurei] Now, let us start
preparing the tea, Mr. Shuei.

20
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,692
- [Shoka] Right, I'll
join you as soon as

21
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:35,280
I finish the work I'm doing.
(gentle flute music)

22
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,327
- [General Han] Hey Seiran.

23
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,288
- General Ran?

24
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,625
- Come here a moment.
(shoes clicking)

25
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,963
- [Shuei] Who's this?

26
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,214
- I'd like you to meet Koyu Li.

27
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,966
He's with the Department
of Civil Affairs,

28
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,968
and he's also an
old friend of mine.

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,803
- Who are you calling
your old friend?

30
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,930
An unfortunate acquaintance
is more like it.

31
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,266
- Are you the assistant
secretary of the department,

32
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,435
the youngest ever to pass
the national examinations

33
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,854
at 16 and with top marks, too?

34
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,940
- Way to go Koyu, your
reputation precedes you.

35
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,109
- But don't you usually have
official department business

36
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,277
to do in the mornings?

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,862
What are you doing
here in the archives?

38
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,781
(wood snapping)
(Koyu growling)

39
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,326
- (laughs) Actually, we're
both here on official duties

40
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,161
just like you are Seiran.

41
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,120
- You are?

42
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,664
So you mean?
- That's right.

43
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,000
Like you, Koyu and I have
been personally assigned

44
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,419
to serve the king, but I'm
afraid that we haven't had

45
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,088
much to do this whole month.

46
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,801
- You serve as Shurei Hong's
family retainer, do you not?

47
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,135
- Uh, yes.

48
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,304
- Since neither of us have
anything better to do,

49
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,431
we thought we'd come
and watch Consort Hong

50
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,809
and see how your lady
deals with the king.

51
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,310
- [Shurei] Here you are.

52
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,272
Please, enjoy.
(gentle string music)

53
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,942
- It's delicious.

54
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,403
So then, this is how it's
really supposed to taste?

55
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,155
- Oh no, don't tell me
you've been putting up

56
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,450
with that awful daddy tea
all this time. (laughs)

57
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,910
- Daddy tea?

58
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,161
- That's my name for
the awful, bitter tea

59
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,038
that my father always makes.

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,417
- I see, but I rather
like Shoka's daddy tea.

61
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,712
- He really is a nice person.

62
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,172
Do you come to the
archives often?

63
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,340
- Yes.

64
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,092
- Even though you're
in the military?

65
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:25,056
- (coughs) So, you were
serving as the royal consort?

66
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,850
- Oh, you knew about that.

67
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,727
- Yes, I found out from Shusui

68
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,061
when I was at the
royal residence.

69
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,355
- Oh, now I see, but
why were you near

70
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,065
the private imperial quarters?

71
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,235
- Well, that is to say, I--

72
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,030
- Could it be that you had
a message from His Majesty?

73
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,824
- No, uh, that.

74
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,200
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

75
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,452
- Hmm?
(wood chair clacking)

76
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,829
- Please Shoka, come sit
down and have some tea.

77
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,084
Shurei, you're a princess of
the Hong family, aren't you?

78
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,379
Then how did you come to be
so skilled at making sweets?

79
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,967
Also, there's your
(Shurei sighing)

80
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,968
- My hands?

81
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,846
- They so chapped and rough,

82
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,015
not at all like the
hands of a princess.

83
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,475
- Actually, they've
become a lot softer

84
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,019
and nicer since I
entered the royal palace.

85
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,229
My family is very poor.

86
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,358
As a result, I've had
to work hard every day,

87
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,112
and that's why my hands
aren't as fair or smooth

88
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,865
or elegant as the hands
of a normal princess.

89
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,786
But you know, I don't mind.

90
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,205
It's also that the three
of us, my father, Seiran,

91
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,248
and myself can
still live together,

92
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,334
so it's really all right.

93
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,502
- Who's Seiran?

94
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,836
- You may have
met him somewhere.

95
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,421
After all, he was
assigned to His Majesty

96
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,589
in the Left Urian Army.

97
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,010
(gasps) Look at you, dropping
crumbs all over the place.

98
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,428
You're like a child!

99
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,264
- I'm not a child,
I'm 19 years old.

100
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,432
- Oh, is that so?

101
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,559
Then you're the same
age as the king, right?

102
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,312
(playful music)

103
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,607
How many of those did you eat?

104
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,818
- Five or six maybe.

105
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,027
(hand slapping)

106
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,487
- That's too many!

107
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,447
I'll wrap them up for you so
you can take them with you

108
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,990
and have them later.

109
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,576
- (laughs) Shurei really does
sound like a nagging mother,

110
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,413
doesn't she?
- She can.

111
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,623
- Father!
- (laughs) Sorry,

112
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,958
I'm sorry Shurei.

113
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,420
- But it's really
nice like this.

114
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,090
(playful music)

115
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:28,513
(shoes clicking)
(water gurgling)

116
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,432
- Hmm, wait, that's.

117
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:35,103
(gentle strings music)
(door creaking)

118
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,523
It seems the rumors were true
about him preferring men.

119
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,484
- My lady, what are you
doing out here so late?

120
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,071
- Oh it's you Seiran, you
frightened me half to death.

121
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,449
- Could it be that you're
unhappy that His Majesty

122
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,159
doesn't come to spend
his nights with you?

123
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,286
- What, don't be ridiculous!

124
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,371
I was just.
- Yes, go on.

125
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,251
- I was just wondering, maybe
that man is really lonely.

126
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,628
That's what I think.

127
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,342
The very first time I met him,
I asked what his name was,

128
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,552
and can you guess what
he answered me with?

129
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,512
He said it was Shuei Ran.

130
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,889
- Isn't that interesting?

131
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,307
- Honestly, running
around the palace

132
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,351
without a government
uniform wearing loose,

133
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,019
luxurious clothes.

134
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,646
He's practically advertising
the fact that he's the king.

135
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,441
- [Shuei] My lady,
what are those books?

136
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,193
- Oh, these books here?

137
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,944
I'm gonna do a little studying.

138
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,030
After all, I came to the
palace with the main purpose

139
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,157
of being a kind of
tutor to the king.

140
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,034
That means I need
to be prepared.

141
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,537
I thought he would be a
stupid and hopeless lord,

142
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,539
but I realized he's
not like that at all.

143
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,250
He is kind of childish for his
age, but on the other hand,

144
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,544
he's not short-tempered
or arrogant.

145
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,547
What's more, he listens
closely to what I have to say.

146
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,549
If he can listen to
what people have to say,

147
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,927
then I think my
words can reach him.

148
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,554
He's nowhere near as
bad as I imagined.

149
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,515
(sighs) Actually, if you ask me,

150
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,184
I think he could become
an excellent king.

151
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,395
- Yes, I think he can, too.

152
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,689
- [Shurei] And that's
why I need to study.

153
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,656
(shoes clicking)

154
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,449
- [Shurei] Advisor Sho.

155
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,119
- [Advisor Sho] Well, if
it isn't Shurei, greetings.

156
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,329
- I have a favor to ask
of you, Advisor Sho.

157
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,539
- [Advisor Sho] What is it?

158
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,708
- Well I wish to do
some more studying,

159
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,252
but simply reading
books is not enough.

160
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,463
My hope was that you could
introduce me to a teacher.

161
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,465
- Oh, I understand you.

162
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,384
Please, leave it to me.

163
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,554
(gentle upbeat music)

164
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,472
- First, let's begin with
the fundamental structure

165
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,682
of the court.

166
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,600
Now Shurei, I heard that
you came to the palace

167
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,478
at Advisor Sho's request.
- I did.

168
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,314
- Then I assume you already
have a basic understanding

169
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,691
of the government.

170
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,693
Can you name the four
ministries and six departments?

171
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,320
- The four ministries are the
Ministry of State Affairs,

172
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,739
the Chancellery,
the Secretariat,

173
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,365
and the Enlightened One's Cave.

174
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,617
The six departments under
the Ministry of State Affairs

175
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,661
are the Departments of
Civil Affairs, Finance,

176
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,165
Protocol, Military,
Justice, and Public Works.

177
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,167
- Wow, you do know quite a lot.

178
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,335
- Actually, to
tell you the truth,

179
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,670
I always wanted to take
the national exams,

180
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,839
so I studied for them
under my father's guidance,

181
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,425
but after I learned that
women can't take the exams,

182
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,761
I decided to pass that
dream on to the children

183
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,387
and taught at the local temple.

184
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,639
- So you were a teacher
before you came to the palace?

185
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,433
- Yes.
- Well then,

186
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,352
if that's the case, then
I imagine there isn't much

187
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,686
left for you to learn.

188
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,687
- Far from it.

189
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,397
In fact, quite the opposite.

190
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,275
I don't believe there
can ever be such a thing

191
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,693
as a limit to learning
and knowledge.

192
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,070
Wouldn't you agree?

193
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,073
(General Ran grunts)
(gentle upbeat music)

194
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,200
(Shurei laughing)

195
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,701
By the way general,
I was wondering.

196
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,411
You're a military
officer, right,

197
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,455
so why are you
giving me lessons?

198
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,499
- Oh, that, that's because.

199
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,209
Ah, he's here at last.

200
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,127
(shoes thumping)
- Huh?

201
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,796
(Koyu breathing heavily)
Lord Koyu?

202
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,256
- Lost your way again.

203
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,258
I was beginning to think that
if you didn't show up soon,

204
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,178
I'd have to step in and
take your place as teacher.

205
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,346
- Just shut up.

206
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,223
- Although you could
say this man is a genius

207
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,433
in many respects, he has
no sense of direction

208
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,644
and tends to get
lost within 30 steps.

209
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,313
- [Shurei] No
sense of direction?

210
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
- Stop babbling and shut up!

211
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,402
- Your student has been
waiting patiently for you.

212
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,569
(Koyu grunting)

213
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,446
- [Shurei] Thank
you for helping me.

214
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,864
(books slamming)

215
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,449
- So you were being
serious when you said

216
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,576
you wanted to study for
the sake of this country?

217
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,787
Man, if you compare this
with that stupid king.

218
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,248
- Ah, the stupid king?

219
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,875
- The palace seems large,
but in reality, it's small.

220
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,877
- [General Ran] If it's small,
then why do you get lost?

221
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,254
- Shut up!

222
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,338
What I'm trying to
say is that the king

223
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,424
still doesn't
understand anything yet,

224
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,592
but here is a woman
who's keen to learn

225
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,344
because she's worried
about the country.

226
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,595
- [General Ran] Look,
don't get all worked up

227
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,431
just because the stupid
king doesn't give you

228
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,850
any work to do.
- Excuse me.

229
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,268
- What is it Shurei?

230
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,395
- The stupid king, I
shouldn't say that.

231
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,773
I mean His Majesty, has he
never left the palace grounds?

232
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,651
- [General Ran] I'm not certain,
but it's highly unlikely.

233
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,611
- You on the other hand
are always slipping out

234
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,572
to a certain district
in town to have fun

235
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,531
with the women there.

236
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,783
- Why don't you come with me?

237
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,285
- No thank you!

238
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,829
- [Shurei] A frog in the well
knows not about the ocean.

239
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,247
- [Both] Huh?

240
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,498
- No matter how stupid
the king might be,

241
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,833
if he sees the world outside,

242
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,295
it might arouse his
interest in governing, hmm.

243
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,839
- [Both] Hmm.

244
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,301
(people chatting)

245
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,553
- [Shuei] So your home
is near here Shurei?

246
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,389
- Yes, that's right.
(people chatting)

247
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,601
- Wow, this certainly is a
lively area of town, isn't it?

248
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,811
- There are all kinds of
shops in this district.

249
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,480
Naturally, there
are food stores,

250
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,649
but there are also antiques,
furniture, clothing, books.

251
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,401
You can find anything here.

252
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,530
Ah, mister, I'll
have two please.

253
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,449
- [Man] Here you go.

254
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,951
- Why don't you
try one of these?

255
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,328
- Huh?

256
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,208
(shoes clicking)
(people chatting)

257
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,418
This is good!
- Yeah.

258
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,588
- This is the first
time I've ever eaten

259
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,548
while I was walking.

260
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,384
As experiences go, it's not bad.

261
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,345
(Shurei laughing)

262
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,513
(children laughing)

263
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,514
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

264
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,848
- [Child] Hey wait up guys!

265
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,643
- Hello there, Ms. Shurei.

266
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,477
- Ryushin!

267
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,521
- We haven't seen you lately.

268
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,480
Where've you been?

269
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,565
- Well I've been a bit busy.

270
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,235
- [Girl] Um, Ms.
Shurei, where's Seiran?

271
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,697
- [Boy] And who's the
guy in the fancy dress?

272
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,409
- (gasps) Oh my
goodness, he's right.

273
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,868
- Fancy dress?

274
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,913
You think so?
(playful music)

275
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,876
- Guess it doesn't matter
of you're not Seiran.

276
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,503
Let's play together anyway.

277
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,339
(children giggling)
- Hey, wait.

278
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,009
- Ms. Shurei!

279
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,721
Kinren's in big trouble!

280
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,472
- What?

281
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,600
{\an8}(gentle flute music)

282
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,604
- A lousy comb like
this costs that much?

283
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,398
Don't screw with me kid!

284
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,902
- But, but that's, that piece
is made from genuine boxwood,

285
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,071
and it's very reasonably priced.

286
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,489
- Huh, that's a lie.

287
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,283
You're just saying
whatever you like.

288
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,744
- You know, a person can
say whatever they like.

289
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,619
- Huh?

290
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,831
- Of course, anyone who
claims that they can't see

291
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,500
the fine craftsmanship in
this piece must be blind.

292
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,793
- Hey, what was that?

293
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,754
- If you continue on
arguing like this,

294
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,381
it's only going to reveal
just how tasteless you are.

295
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,966
Are you okay with that?

296
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,053
- Huh?
(people chatting)

297
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,472
(shoes clicking)
(people laughing)

298
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,766
- Thank you for
saving me, Ms. Shurei.

299
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,768
- Not at all, it was nothing.

300
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,936
More importantly, how
is your mother doing?

301
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,397
- Well, she's been sick in bed

302
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,857
with a cold since this morning.

303
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,610
- So that's why you're taking
care of the shop, right?

304
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,614
Wait a second, I have
the perfect idea.

305
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,991
- Huh?
(frame beeps)

306
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,453
- [Kinren] Thank you Ms. Shurei.

307
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,497
- No problem, just leave
the shop to the two of us

308
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,540
and go look after
your mother, okay?

309
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,959
- Yes ma'am. (laughs)

310
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,921
- Right, let's make some money.

311
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,507
Welcome to our store.

312
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,425
How about buying a hair pin?

313
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,096
Come on, you have
to call out, too.

314
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,807
- Me, you mean
you're asking me to?

315
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,644
- Of course, I don't see
anyone else here, go on.

316
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,689
- Uh, welcome to our store.
- Say it louder.

317
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,982
- Welcome to our store!
(Shurei laughing)

318
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,776
- My, what a good-looking man.

319
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,611
- Welcome, take a look.

320
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,446
How about this hair pin for you?

321
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,365
Do you like it?

322
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,826
- My, that is a very
lovely hair pin.

323
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,453
- I can give you a special
discount on this one.

324
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,996
Perhaps you'd like
to try it on and see?

325
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,000
Why don't you go put
this in her hair Shuei?

326
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,627
(playful flute music)

327
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,129
(woman sighing)
- [Shuei] Like that?

328
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,131
- Wow, it's beautiful!

329
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,675
It really suits you very well.

330
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,677
- (grunts) I think
it suits you, too.

331
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,513
- Oh my, does it really?

332
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,391
- Yes.
(woman giggling)

333
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,018
Well in that case,
I will take one.

334
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,605
- Oh, thank you
very much. (laughs)

335
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,774
(playful music)
(people chatting)

336
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,900
- This is great having
such a good-looking guy

337
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,610
put it in for me.

338
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,487
- Me, too, I wanna be next.

339
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,740
- Oh, please choose one for me.

340
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,159
- Okay now, no pushing
please, no pushing.

341
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,744
Everyone wait your turn.

342
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,871
(women giggling)
(playful music)

343
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,664
- So the king's a shopkeeper.

344
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,876
Punishment for using
my name perhaps.

345
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,628
Hmm, wait a minute,
that's Seiran.

346
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,130
- He is a true bodyguard.

347
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,631
He watches over the
king without being

348
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,549
too close or too far.

349
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,761
- [General Ran] I
can't wait for the day

350
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,888
you finally meet
the king in person.

351
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,431
- [Kuyo] Me neither.

352
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,558
I intend to give him a
piece of my mind when I do.

353
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,061
- We made quite a
lot today, didn't we?

354
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,063
This should take care
of the cost of medicine

355
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,816
for Kinren's mom for a
while, so that's a relief.

356
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,026
Oh, are you tired?

357
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,195
- Not at all.

358
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,781
To be honest, I really
enjoyed myself today.

359
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,199
- I'm so glad to hear that.

360
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,951
I think it's a wonderful
thing helping other people.

361
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,747
- Helping other people.

362
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,753
- [Shurei] This is my home.
(gentle flute music)

363
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,926
- Your family
really is very poor.

364
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,804
- That's not very nice of you.

365
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:11,721
- I'm sorry.

366
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,767
- It's all right, it
is the truth I guess.

367
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,479
(gentle flute music)

368
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,774
- So Shurei, you used to
teach those children, right?

369
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,275
- Yes, that's right, I did.

370
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,111
- You're so energetic,

371
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,113
and you're good at
selling things, too.

372
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,616
(raven cawing)

373
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,660
Are those cherry trees?

374
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,745
- Yes, they are,
but our cherry trees

375
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,830
don't blossom any more.

376
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,581
They haven't for
eight years now.

377
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,834
- Eight years?

378
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,254
- That was when there was the
big struggle for the throne.

379
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,505
After the king collapsed,

380
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,632
the court administration
was thrown into disarray

381
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,633
by the fighting.

382
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,054
Those of us who lived
outside the castle walls

383
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,640
were hit badly in the aftermath.

384
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,559
Many aristocrats
locked their doors,

385
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,310
and the front gates were
littered with the bodies

386
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,979
of people who starved to death.

387
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,984
Father and Seiran did what
they could to help people

388
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,153
get by in those hard
times, but in the end,

389
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,780
there was very little
that we could do for them.

390
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,658
Probably the best help we
could provide was our garden.

391
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,828
We had many fruit trees,
and our pond was large,

392
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,663
so we were able to
share our fruit and fish

393
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,081
with the townspeople.

394
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,001
As a result, there isn't
a single fish in the pond,

395
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,004
and it'll be years before
the trees bear fruit again.

396
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,757
Think about it, not
even the flowers bloom

397
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,011
because we ate everything.
(melancholy music)

398
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,599
Many people died
right before my eyes.

399
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,936
- (sobs) My dear Shurei, would
you please play your Aeru

400
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,314
for the sake of
this child's spirit?

401
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,025
Please play it so he
may rest in peace.

402
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,860
- Day after day,
I played the Aeru

403
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,987
more times than I could count.

404
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,823
It was as if we were
all living only to die.

405
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,914
Why did we have to live only
to experience such hardship?

406
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,250
Father and Seiran got thinner
with each passing day.

407
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,627
I was so scared.

408
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,797
Every night, I had
nightmares of them dying

409
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,757
and leaving me behind all alone.

410
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,011
Those were truly the most
terrible days of all.

411
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,096
- I'm sorry Shurei.

412
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,183
- That's the reason I
entered the imperial palace.

413
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,228
I've had enough of being
unable to do anything

414
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,897
but cry over my
own helplessness.

415
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,358
That's why if it happens again
and there's anything at all

416
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,276
I can do, I want to do it.

417
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,406
What I'm hoping for
isn't really that much.

418
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,825
It's not like I have a
foolish wish or request

419
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,703
such as please build a country
where everyone can live

420
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,621
in perfect happiness.

421
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,249
Being happy or unhappy
is up to the individual,

422
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,293
so the king shouldn't have to
take responsibility for that.

423
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,048
A person's life is one's own.

424
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,842
There are many
options available,

425
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,136
so we should all
choose our own path.

426
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,305
- People choosing
their own paths.

427
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,433
- But there are still times
when a person isn't able

428
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,393
to choose and
doesn't have options.

429
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,103
If it's due to a
natural disaster,

430
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,980
then you have to deal with it,

431
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:10,775
but problems caused by man
should be preventable, right?

432
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,111
- That's why you
went to the palace?

433
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,989
- You see, there are
some thing people can do

434
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,198
to make life better,

435
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,660
yet there are other
things you can't do

436
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,704
no matter how hard you try,

437
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,247
and that's why
the king's job is,

438
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,707
to take care of such matters,

439
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,917
but who will do that
if the king slacks off?

440
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,046
(gentle music)

441
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,756
I don't know why he
doesn't take care

442
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,007
of his governmental duties,

443
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,759
but since he's already
taken the throne,

444
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,010
they can't really be avoided,

445
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,137
so he'll just have
to do his best.

446
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,306
In exchange, I
intend to do my best

447
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,807
and work together with you.

448
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,186
If you say you've
never studied politics

449
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,188
because you were the youngest
prince and not the heir,

450
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,939
then I'll just study with you.

451
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,442
If you're feeling insecure,
I'll stand by your side.

452
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,486
If you want to
complain, I'll listen,

453
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,904
and if you wanna cry,

454
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,697
then you can just
go ahead and cry.

455
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,909
I'm not an official, so
there's no need to act brave.

456
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,786
I didn't come here
to bear your child

457
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,080
or merely to place
blame and scold you.

458
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,708
The reason I came is
to give you my support.

459
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,960
I'm here to stand by
your side and support you

460
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,462
as you stand up to be king.

461
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,758
Well, that's what I
want to say to the king

462
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,010
when I meet him, but
I haven't been able

463
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,261
to do that yet.

464
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,180
Hey, since you know
the king personally,

465
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,100
would you mind telling him
everything I just said,

466
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,310
and tell him that if
he's interested and
would like to come,

467
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,939
I'll be waiting in the imperial
archives tomorrow afternoon.

468
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,236
(chair clattering)
(clothing rustling)

469
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,321
- All right, I'll pass it on.

470
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,247
- The tea's gotten
cold, hasn't it?

471
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,748
I'll go and make some more.

472
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,004
(water bubbling)

473
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,968
- [Seiran] My lady.
(gentle flute music)

474
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:06,266
- Hello Seiran.
(gentle music)

475
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,227
(Shurei sobbing)

476
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,937
- You really gave it your best.

477
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,482
Even though eight
years have passed,

478
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,276
just remembering those
days must still be

479
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,862
very painful for you, my lady.

480
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:23,908
(gentle music)
(Shurei sobbing)

481
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,123
- I'm sorry, I'll
be fine, I'm sure.

482
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,332
- Don't worry, I'm
certain that the king

483
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,877
will come to the
archives tomorrow.

484
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,924
(birds chirping)

485
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,802
(shoes clicking)

486
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,388
- Huh?

487
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,977
- We are known as Ryuki Shi.

488
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,439
We received your message
from a man who knows us well.

489
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,817
- Yes?
(chair clattering)

490
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,069
And what is your reply?

491
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,822
- Let us start
governing this country.

492
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,867
- (gasps) Oh thank you!

493
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,540
(Shurei laughing and gasping)

494
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:16,127
(gentle strings music)

495
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,463
Can I ask you one question?

496
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:19,673
- What's that?

497
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,299
- It is true that you
prefer relationships

498
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,343
with men as opposed
to women, right?

499
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,305
- Well, I suppose I do.

500
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:31,184
- (sighs) That's what I
thought, thank goodness.

501
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,562
Of course, there will be
an issue with successors,

502
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,648
but we can always
worry about that later.

503
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,316
For now, let's study the basics

504
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,110
of governmental administration.

505
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,489
- Huh?
(drum pounding)

506
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,200
- First, let me introduce
you to your new teacher.

507
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,203
- It's an honor to finally
meet you, Your Majesty.

508
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,122
My name is Koyu Li.

509
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,875
Please do your
best, Your Majesty.

510
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,169
- Shuei Ran, what
are you doing here?

511
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:01,339
- It has always been my
duty to guard Your Majesty.

512
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,508
Besides, I heard that
someone in the archives

513
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,551
has been using my name,

514
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,094
so I've come to see for myself.

515
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:09,180
(Seiran gasping and laughing)
(books slamming)

516
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,933
- From now on, I'll be
giving you intensive lessons,

517
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,643
so be prepared.

518
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,062
- I'm looking forward to it.

519
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,897
- [Advisor Sho] So the
king has finally taken

520
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,190
an interest in things.

521
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,234
- It seems that bringing
Shurei and her knowledge

522
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:24,529
of the people into the
palace was a wise decision.

523
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,949
Considering it came from
you, it was a splendid idea.

524
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,535
- You know, you didn't
have to add that first bit.

525
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:33,371
Now the question is whether
His Majesty will give

526
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:37,625
Koyu Li and Shuei Ran the
flowers of trust, or not.

527
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,213
(pleasant flute music)

528
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,221
(woman singing in
foreign language)

529
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:53,391
(gentle guitar music)

530
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,184
{\an8}(dramatic pop music)

531
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:40,522
{\an8}(woman singing in
foreign language)

532
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,670
- I think Ryuki's the
type who can do anything

533
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,088
he puts his mind to.

534
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,381
I've changed my mind
a bit about him.

535
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:09,175
Don't get ahead of
yourself, I said a bit.

536
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,594
So what are you
doing in my room?

537
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,722
{\an8}Didn't I tell you not to
get ahead of yourself?
