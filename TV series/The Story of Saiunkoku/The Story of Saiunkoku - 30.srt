1
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,432
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,439
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,188
(eerie music)

4
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,314
- [Narrator]
Shurei's group is now

5
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,857
only a short
distance from Korin,

6
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,652
the capital of Sa Province,
where the swearing in ceremony

7
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,321
for the provincial
governess will take place.

8
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,991
Also in that city,
that mysterious man
known as Sakujun Sa

9
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,910
has been awaiting
Shurei's arrival.

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,830
(people chattering)

11
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,666
However, with the capital
under a complete blockade,

12
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,959
Shurei and her companions

13
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,003
are stuck on the wrong
side of the town walls.

14
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,672
(people chattering)

15
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,717
(suspenseful music)

16
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,726
- So the whole place is
under total lockdown.

17
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,519
- Yeah.

18
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,814
- But the swearing in
ceremony for the governors

19
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,399
is supposed to be held there.

20
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,277
- And the day after that is
their deadline to arrive.

21
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,653
If they're late for it,

22
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,238
then they're deemed to
abandon their assignment.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,990
Both Princess and Eigetsu
would be dismissed

24
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,034
from their positions
as co-governors.

25
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,369
- Regardless of blockades,
or whatever else they try,

26
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,829
we're gonna enter Korin.

27
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,749
- There are 19 days until
the swearing in ceremony.

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,709
That means 20 days
before the deadline.

29
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,669
- Before we get that far,
we'd better make sure

30
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,464
we recover Shurei's
flower bud, right?

31
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,299
- People here are
anticipating a governor

32
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,717
with a flower bud of trust.

33
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,260
To a province that's
been abandoned

34
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,762
by the central
government for so long,

35
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,388
that symbol is crucial.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,766
That's why you must get it
back before the ceremony.

37
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,768
- In any case, the Sa
Clan is an opponent

38
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,935
we'll be able to avoid.

39
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,648
- We'll have to
samba with the Sa.

40
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,276
(gong chimes)

41
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,074
- Well, gee, that food sure
smells delicious, right?

42
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,575
- Yeah, you bet.

43
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,536
- Hey, that was really funny,
don't you think, huh, huh?

44
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,288
- Regardless of what
might come afterward,

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,664
our first priority is clear.

46
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,958
We must get past
that blocked gate.

47
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,588
- But before that, let's have
a little something to eat.

48
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,924
(eerie music)

49
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,717
- [Narrator] Meanwhile,
there is another person

50
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,761
who is on his way to Korin City.

51
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,556
The youngest son of the
Sa clan, Kokujun Sa.

52
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,851
With a mere handful of courage,
he's trying to create a path

53
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,938
towards a brighter future
for someone he loves.

54
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,649
(gentle music)

55
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,903
(boys snoring)

56
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,407
- Miss Shunki, what's wrong?

57
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,616
Need to use the bathroom?

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,494
Huh?

59
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,330
Ah!

60
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,501
Here you go, Miss Shunki.

61
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,465
- [Chouka] The man known
as Hokuto has always been

62
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,592
a treasured and
irreplaceable friend to me.

63
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,430
- Lord Chouka, please
allow me to pour the tea.

64
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,889
- It's all right,
Shusui, please.

65
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,391
Have a seat and relax.

66
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,602
Despite our close friendship,

67
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,355
Hokuto only wrote a
letter to me once.

68
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,606
It said, "Don't bother to visit,

69
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,358
"I'll come to see you someday."

70
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,362
I waited a long time for
that day to come, but...

71
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,490
- In the end, he
passed away quietly,

72
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,617
while his children
were watching over him.

73
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,578
- If you had known that
man many years ago,

74
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,954
the last thing you'd ever expect

75
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,664
would be a quiet death for him.

76
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,541
As members of the
Wolves of the Wind,

77
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,752
we entrusted our
lives to each other.

78
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,547
It was all a part of walking
the path of darkness together.

79
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,174
I'm glad that in the end,

80
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,634
he was able to leave
this world peacefully.

81
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,636
- I understand he
left two sons behind.

82
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,764
Were you the one who looked
after them, Lord Chouka?

83
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,475
- To be honest, Hokuto had
done such a magnificent job

84
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,560
of raising them that there
wasn't much I needed to do

85
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,020
when it came down to it.

86
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,397
They're sons of the Bald
Eagle of Sa Province.

87
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,192
One day, they'll soar
majestically in the sky.

88
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,527
- Yes, definitely.

89
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,697
(both sipping)

90
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,907
- Shusui, what's wrong?

91
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,617
Is the tea too bitter for you?

92
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,952
- No, actually it's very tasty.

93
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,040
- It's a really good
thing that our father

94
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,833
taught us how to read
and write and stuff.

95
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,502
- Yeah, thanks to
him helping us,

96
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,421
we're able to talk with
Miss Shunki like this.

97
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,464
- [Both] Huh?

98
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,882
- Starting this moment--

99
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,759
- I'm heading down the mountain.

100
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,679
- Youshun.

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,888
- Yes, big brother.

102
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,682
- You idiot, call
me boss, remember?

103
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,725
Now you know what it is
you're supposed to do, right?

104
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,726
- Yes, of course.

105
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,061
I've gotta get packing.

106
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,106
- Right, we hereby declare
our official revival

107
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,484
as the next generation
Bald Eagles of Sa Province.

108
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,653
- Wow, you sound
totally awesome, boss.

109
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,697
I'll pack some freshly
picked autumn fruit.

110
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,573
That'll sure keep us going.

111
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,076
- Okay, let's continue
what our father began.

112
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,204
The second generation of the
chivalrous thieves begins here.

113
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,540
- Yeah, and I'll write
everything down in my leaf diary

114
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,251
so that we'll never
end up forgetting it.

115
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,127
- Yeah!

116
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,797
(tender music)

117
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,967
What is it, Miss Shunki?

118
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,678
(gentle music)

119
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,729
No way, a journey is
all about the company.

120
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,688
Now you'd better
use the bathroom

121
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,023
before we leave, Miss Shunki.

122
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,150
Don't worry, there's no
need to be embarrassed.

123
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,032
(Eigetsu munching)

124
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,284
- This is delicious,
thanks Shurei.

125
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,536
- Yeah, it has a good
flavor, doesn't it?

126
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,290
- Hey Seiran, isn't your piece
a little bigger than mine?

127
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,000
- It is utterly
depressing to think

128
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,127
that you're the former governor.

129
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,920
But, putting that aside
from the time being,

130
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,964
what should we do?

131
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,300
If only Lord Ryuuren
Ran were still here,

132
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,802
things would be much
simpler for us right now.

133
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,138
- [Ensei] Because of the Ran
Clan crest, the twin dragons?

134
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,097
- [Shou] Right!

135
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,265
With that, all it would take

136
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,850
is saying have a
look at this token,

137
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,144
and we'd all pass through the
gate without being inspected.

138
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,520
But--
- He's not here,

139
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,938
so it's not an option.

140
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,065
- Yes, that's right.

141
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,192
- So what will you do?

142
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,028
How do you propose
we enter Korin?

143
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,905
- Well, why don't we
just walk right up

144
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,616
to the front gate and pass
on through, simple as that.

145
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,659
- [Shou] I'm sure I already
informed you earlier

146
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,078
that even the gate
guards have been replaced

147
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,997
with members of the Sa
Clan's private army.

148
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,791
- Yes, but that's
illegal, right?

149
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,001
Seiran can use his
authority to arrest them,

150
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,670
and once we push
them off to the side,

151
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,962
there won't be
anything to stop us

152
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,631
from walking through that gate.

153
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,552
So, do you have any
problems with that?

154
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,137
- I understand.

155
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,347
No problem.

156
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,057
- As for the situation
with my flower bud,

157
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,975
I'm sure that guy
will find a way

158
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,852
to approach us when
we enter Korin.

159
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,062
- [Eigetsu] Well, then I guess

160
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,689
all that's left to
do now is sleep.

161
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,232
- That's right, Eigetsu.

162
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,776
Good food, and a good night's
sleep are always necessary.

163
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,696
All right then, I'll
get to bed first.

164
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,949
Remember to put out the
fire before you go to sleep.

165
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,866
- Goodnight.

166
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,873
- Hey Shou, our bosses are
incredible, don't you think?

167
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,166
They're the best.

168
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,168
- Indeed, it seems
they'll become governors

169
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,006
who won't settle for taking a
back seat to the previous one.

170
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,716
- Hmm.

171
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,260
(intense music)

172
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,639
- At this rate, we'll
reach the goal of Kinka

173
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,182
before we even know it.

174
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,226
- Of course we will, we're the
Bald Eagles of Sa Province.

175
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,729
Mountains like this are a
piece of cake, right boss?

176
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,980
- [Shourin] You got it!

177
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,774
(both panting)

178
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,652
Miss Shunki, hold on to
me as tight as you can!

179
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,363
- [Both] Let's go!

180
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:56,411
(both grunting)
(air whooshing)

181
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,205
(people grumbling)

182
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,750
- It really is completely
blocked, isn't it?

183
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,169
- Yes, but we've gotta get
through, no matter what.

184
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,174
(horse whinnies)
(people grumbling)

185
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,259
- What's that?

186
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,761
- Well, shall we do it?

187
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,262
- Yep.

188
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,681
(intense music)

189
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,141
- Checkpoint breakers!

190
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,894
(men grunting)

191
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,947
- Okay then, let's get
this stamped already.

192
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,119
- Hey Ensei, you seem awfully
used to this kind of thing.

193
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,913
- You're pretty
experienced, huh?

194
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,289
(Ensei chuckles)

195
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,458
- Experienced in breaking
through checkpoints?

196
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,711
You're the governor's
aide, for crying out loud.

197
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,798
- Oh, hey Shou, can you
ride a horse by any chance?

198
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,716
- [Shou] Yes, I can manage.

199
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,968
- I don't suppose we could go
over to your sister's house?

200
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,762
Actually, there's
nowhere else we can go,

201
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,806
so we may as well
head over there.

202
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,350
(horse snorts)

203
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,773
(hooves clopping)
(all grunting)

204
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,985
- Wait a minute, why
are we on horses now?

205
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,363
(gentle music)

206
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,950
(horses whinnying)

207
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,201
(Shurei sighs)

208
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,369
- It must have been
tough for you, my lady.

209
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,037
Not only did you have no saddle,

210
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,497
but we were going a little fast.

211
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,124
- You call that a little?

212
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,710
My butt's hurting like crazy.

213
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,212
(gentle music)

214
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,174
What is this place?

215
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,844
- It's Mr. Sai's sister's house.

216
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,013
The residence of Lady Rin Sai.

217
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,015
- Mr. Shou Sai's older sister?

218
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,100
The garden and house
aren't exactly flashy,

219
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,020
but they definitely have a
very fashionable air to them.

220
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,856
I can see that she's a
person of excellent taste.

221
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,190
- Well, come on in.

222
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,192
I'm sure my sister has
already planned ahead

223
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,069
and left a letter or two for us.

224
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,947
(hooves clopping)

225
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,325
(gentle music)

226
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,882
- To the two honorable
new governors.

227
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,383
- Just like you said,
a letter for us.

228
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,135
But how'd she know
we'd be coming here?

229
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,846
- One of the skills necessary
for becoming a merchant

230
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,474
is the ability to correctly
predict the future.

231
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,142
Like assistant Ro said earlier,

232
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,853
this is the only place
where we could go.

233
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,897
- Hey, it's no fluke that
your sister happens to be

234
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,523
provincial leader of
the Merchant's Guild.

235
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,567
- What about the other letter?

236
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,777
- Right.

237
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,321
(gentle music)

238
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,449
(Shurei gasps)

239
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,658
- What is it, Shurei?

240
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,329
- This is an invitation
from the Sa Clan.

241
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,413
{\an8}(all gasp)

242
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,011
Wait a minute, why don't we
look at the other letter first?

243
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:00,887
- Sure.

244
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,308
It says the Sa Clan
has been causing

245
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,602
numerous disruptions
within Sa Province.

246
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,354
- Since the Sa Clan
has a tight grip

247
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,648
on even the Merchant's Guild,
the guild will only be able

248
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,025
to provide us with
minimal assistance.

249
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,904
- So, what do you
intend to do now?

250
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,073
Please don't forget that
depending on your strategy,

251
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,366
the future actions and support

252
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,493
of the Merchant's
Guild may be affected.

253
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,453
- Whoa, you really
are merciless.

254
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,623
- Since you and Officer Shi
enjoy being soft on them,

255
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,376
it's necessary for me
to balance things out.

256
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,136
- All right, Eigetsu.

257
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,470
I think this is a situation

258
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,597
where we should use
the governor seal.

259
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,183
- Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

260
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,144
The Merchant's Guild
has agreed to provide us

261
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,062
with at least minimal
assistance, right?

262
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,897
- Yes, if at all possible.

263
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,285
- Please send the following
reply to Miss Rin Sai,

264
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,579
leader of the Sa Province
branch of the Merchant's Guild.

265
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,998
We hereby request immediate
military assistance

266
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,958
from all soldiers affiliated

267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,127
with the Merchant's
Guild of Sa Province.

268
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,007
Soldiers are to take action
and control all civil conflicts

269
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,342
that have arisen,
as well as protect

270
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,218
all mayors and senior officials

271
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,970
who will be present at
the swearing in ceremony

272
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,014
of the new governors.

273
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,016
The above request for
assistance is made

274
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,310
in the names of the new
governors of Sa Province,

275
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:33,104
Eigetsu To, and Shurei Hong.

276
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,067
However, there
shall be no reward.

277
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,028
We do not intend to buy your
conscience with money or goods.

278
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,530
- This is a request,
not a direct order.

279
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,698
You shall make your own judgment

280
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,533
on whether or not you accept.

281
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,993
- [Shurei] We ask
that you provide us

282
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,037
with a reply as
soon as possible.

283
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,998
- From the governor of
Sa Province, Eigetsu To.

284
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,961
- And the governor of Sa
Province, Shurei Hong.

285
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,432
- I'm afraid it's
missing something.

286
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,600
- What do you mean?

287
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,397
- Lieutenant Governor of
Sa Province, Ensei Ro, and?

288
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,609
- Military officer of
his majesty, Seiran Shi.

289
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,322
(both sigh)

290
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,533
- You have no intention
of buying her conscience

291
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,368
with money, or goods.

292
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,787
Well, that's splendid.

293
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,331
I'll deliver the letter to my
sister as soon as possible.

294
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,459
- No matter how you look at it,

295
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,461
the Sa Provincial Army on
our side won't be enough.

296
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,338
Luckily for us, the
soldiers and mercenaries

297
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,715
of the Merchant's
Guild are talented,

298
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,216
and have good leadership.

299
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,301
- But you know, most people
would normally be too afraid

300
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,470
to request assistance
from the Merchant's Guild

301
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,305
without offering
any compensation.

302
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,349
Luckily, our princess
isn't most people.

303
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,731
- I humbly request
you deliver this.

304
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,067
- Very well, I
accept your request.

305
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,652
Now are you going to
keep us in suspense,

306
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,529
or are you going to
open the other letter?

307
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,240
(plucky music)

308
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,327
- This is bad.

309
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,038
It feels like a
cursed invitation.

310
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,331
- It does kinda give
me a bad feeling,

311
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,750
but we have no choice.

312
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,168
We still have to open it.

313
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:20,795
- Ah!

314
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,633
- Way to go, women are brave!

315
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,514
- Let me see, "We hereby
make this announcement

316
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,350
"that all members of
the clan will assemble

317
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,268
"to officially select
the clan's leader,

318
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,229
"followed by the Sa Clan
appointment ceremony.

319
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,690
"As such, we humbly
request the attendance

320
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,108
"of the two new governors

321
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,235
"to partake in this
glorious occasion,

322
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,653
"as well as to
formally acknowledge

323
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,113
"the new head of the clan.

324
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,657
"We look forward to
seeing you there."

325
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,329
- In other words, a trap.

326
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,374
- [Shou] Yeah, in a nutshell
they're saying, now come to me.

327
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,459
- In any event, the timing
for this trap of theirs

328
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,711
couldn't possibly be worse.

329
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:02,962
(Shurei sighs)

330
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,547
- Isn't this another
one of those situations

331
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,841
where we just have
to tackle it head on?

332
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,135
- They have got to be joking.

333
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,888
It's on the day before
our swearing in ceremony?

334
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,390
- [Shou] Then will
you turn him down?

335
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,642
- No, of course
we're going to go!

336
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,811
I have to get back that flower
bud that was taken from me,

337
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,355
and there's Mr. Kokujun as well.

338
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,564
- [Ensei] They must know that.

339
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,274
You could call it a
flowered invitation,

340
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,484
with the bud as bait.

341
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,277
- He sent you this
letter knowing very well

342
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,405
that you wouldn't be
able to turn it down.

343
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,156
- That's why I'm so mad!

344
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,450
(dog howls)

345
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,413
(water trickling)

346
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,210
- Mr. Shou Sai, were you able
to find what I asked for?

347
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,586
- You should know by
now that there's nothing

348
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,338
the Merchant's Guild cannot get.

349
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,924
Here's the item, as promised.

350
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,552
(eerie music)

351
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,725
- Yes indeed, thank you
for procuring it for me.

352
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,602
- It's amazing how you're
so knowledgeable in poisons.

353
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,771
I admit I was stunned
that you'd know so much

354
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,440
about those things
that spread secretly

355
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,234
through the underground
of common life.

356
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,862
- My knowledge is not
something that concerns you.

357
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,197
It's not as if I learned
about these things

358
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,158
because I wanted to.

359
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,452
- You intend to take it
upon yourself to use that?

360
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,621
- You're very nosy, at least
as far as merchants go.

361
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,457
- [Shou] Look, I'm just
saying you're overdoing it

362
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,751
for a military officer.

363
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,461
- It's a little
different for me.

364
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,962
I am the person to
whom his majesty

365
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,214
bestowed the sword Kanshou.

366
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,467
That means I am obligated
to protect the governors

367
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,427
from any and all dangers.

368
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,387
Besides, Ensei can't do this.

369
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,475
He's a man who's always
walking in the sun.

370
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,352
The tentacles of
darkness will never

371
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,520
be able to wrap
themselves around him.

372
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,315
He will never be
bothered by dark nights.

373
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:46,900
That's why Sakujun Sa is not

374
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,943
an appropriate opponent for him.

375
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,570
- [Shou] And you're different?

376
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,324
- That's right, in fact I'm
the exact opposite of Ensei.

377
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,659
I know how to handle those
kinds of dark-hearted men

378
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,495
better than anyone else can.

379
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,497
I know how to deal
with an opponent

380
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,375
who I can't kill,
or leave alive.

381
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,002
I know, because I
was once like that.

382
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,629
I was the troublesome
second prince

383
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,964
who could neither be
killed, nor be left alive.

384
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,220
- You're the real
king, aren't you?

385
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,889
(wind whistling)

386
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,434
You see, you speak in
the manner of someone

387
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,520
who walks the path
of a conqueror.

388
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,689
Are you trying to say
that light and darkness

389
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,399
have nothing to do
with hope or despair,

390
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,485
but instead are merely
part of the tactics you use

391
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,654
for the purpose of
achieving your goals?

392
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,615
I believe I might
have said too much.

393
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,950
Forgive my curiosity,

394
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,993
I shall continue to
deliver the requested

395
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,955
information potions to you
as soon as I receive them.

396
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,708
- Thank you very much, Mr. Sai.

397
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,335
(eerie music)

398
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,262
Darkness or the light,

399
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,348
I'll take advantage
of anything I can use.

400
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,560
- Seiran, Seiran!

401
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,480
- [Seiran] In order to protect

402
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,940
what I ought to be protecting.

403
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,405
- Grandfather,
stop this already.

404
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,741
It's not too late to
undo your mistakes.

405
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,996
We've committed so many crimes.

406
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,331
We have to stop,
we have to atone

407
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,000
for the sins of the Sa Clan.

408
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,878
Of course, I will bear that
responsibility as well.

409
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,088
- You are a disgrace
who has no pride

410
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,923
in being part of this clan.

411
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,717
- You've forgotten
about honesty,
righteousness, and reason.

412
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,303
Your desires have blinded you
to how soiled you've become.

413
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,554
That's the disgrace.

414
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,766
You can show your true
pride in the Sa Clan

415
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,351
by putting a stop to this

416
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,061
before you fall even
deeper into the darkness.

417
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,813
We must return to
the correct path.

418
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,899
- Pride in the Sa Clan, you say?

419
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,776
How dare you talk
like you know it all!

420
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,528
(ominous music)

421
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,281
- Grandfather!

422
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,450
- Don't take that tone
of voice with me, boy.

423
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,619
Meeting with you on a
whim was a total mistake.

424
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,995
I should have thrown
you in the same place

425
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,039
as that foolish man
right from the start.

426
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:06,956
- What?

427
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,460
- Yes, the same place
I put your father.

428
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,336
- Father?

429
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,631
But I thought you said
Father was recuperating

430
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,633
from an illness
in a far off place

431
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,592
where he could get better!

432
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,928
Are you saying that was a lie?

433
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,971
- That's what makes
you foolish and naive.

434
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,015
But that man is currently
sitting in his prison,

435
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,726
not even aware of
who he is any longer.

436
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,020
- But that's, how can
you be so heartless,

437
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,480
Grandfather Chuushou?

438
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,649
- I'll let you out for
the selection ceremony.

439
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,817
Take him away.

440
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,818
- [Kokujun] Grandfather!

441
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,985
- For far too many years,

442
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,987
you've admired my
elder brother, Enjun.

443
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,990
Know this, even if you do
have intentions of leading,

444
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,827
I will inherit that position
from my brother first.

445
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,161
- What?

446
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,996
What are you planning
to do, Grandfather?

447
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,039
No, Grandfather!

448
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,042
- [Man] Come on!

449
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,047
(somber music)

450
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,509
- [Shou] Eiki, if you wish it,

451
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,720
I could free you from
this prison right now.

452
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,850
- Shou, the great arrogance
snob adviser, Shou.

453
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,436
Why would an old man like you
come here looking like that?

454
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,397
You're a sly fox in
a young man's skin.

455
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,899
I would never accept
any help of yours.

456
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,569
I have one question.

457
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,987
Tell me, where is the ring

458
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,780
belonging to the
head of the Sa Clan?

459
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,574
The one you stole a
year and a half ago?

460
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,867
- I stole?

461
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,786
It won't be long before
the ring returns here.

462
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,163
- Is that right?

463
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,040
Well then, I have nothing
further to say to you.

464
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,584
You may leave, get
out of my sight.

465
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,960
- Eiki.

466
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,421
- It would be a simple
matter for me to leave here,

467
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,132
take over, and smack those
fools into utter submission,

468
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,633
but then what would happen

469
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,927
after I leave this
world for good?

470
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,721
Old people like me
should stick to giving

471
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,014
whatever knowledge is requested,

472
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,016
and providing
guidance to the young.

473
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,769
That's why I'm still
sitting here waiting.

474
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,645
Right now, I am in the
middle of surmounting

475
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,065
one of the most significant
challenges of my life.

476
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:56,983
- What are the odds?

477
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,193
- That's why men are useless.

478
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,736
They waste all their
time and energy

479
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,488
worrying about such things, ha.

480
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,743
(shrill flute music)
(crickets chirping)

481
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,620
- Maybe we were going too fast.

482
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,579
- Let's rest a bit.

483
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:10,789
Are you all right, Miss Shunki?

484
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,500
(shrill flute music)

485
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,209
- Shunki?

486
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,126
Huh.

487
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,630
You, boys and girl over there.

488
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,757
You young children
who are few in years,

489
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,592
where are you going?

490
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,094
(all sigh)

491
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:27,555
- Well, Kinka, and after
that, we're headed to Korin.

492
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,808
- Wow, he's cool.

493
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,478
- [Man] If that's the case,
you shall accept my charity.

494
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,523
(crickets chirping)

495
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,609
You don't need to thank me.

496
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,945
I wish you happiness
on your journey.

497
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,905
Now as a farewell gift,
I will play a tune

498
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,782
that just came to
me this moment.

499
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,952
(shrill flute music)

500
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,665
- So as long as
we have this token

501
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,751
that super cool guy gave us,
we'll be able to enter Korin

502
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,169
without having to
go through Kinka.

503
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,546
- Great.

504
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,755
- But what about
what Ensei told us?

505
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,048
He said that before
we get to Korin,

506
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,634
we had to talk with an
important man in Kinka.

507
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,594
- Why don't I run
to Kinka on my own?

508
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,222
- Great idea, then I'll go
ahead to Korin with Miss Shunki.

509
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,223
- [Both] Let's go!

510
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,227
(Shourin panting)

511
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,814
- Listen, Shunki.

512
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,983
This is a promise between
you and your grandmother.

513
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:22,277
Use your power only for
the sake of the person

514
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,862
most important to you.

515
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,616
Until then, I shall
seal your voice.

516
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,119
(somber music)

517
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,298
- [Shurei] I'm coming,
you just wait for me.

518
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:51,306
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

519
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,379
We've entered Korin at last.

520
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,755
I'm going straight to the place

521
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,882
where that guy from
the Sa Clan is.

522
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,301
I'll find Lady Eiki and
the others, and wait,

523
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,761
what are you doing here?

524
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:13,888
{\an8}Huh, you've come to get me?
