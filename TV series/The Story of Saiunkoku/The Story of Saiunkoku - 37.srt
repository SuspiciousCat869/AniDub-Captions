1
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,306
{\an8}(intro music)

2
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,481
- You never called
me by my real name

3
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,565
not even once.

4
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,738
I love you, the way you
play with your hair,

5
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,324
the way you always
make tea for me.

6
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,326
Everything about you.

7
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,540
(gasps)

8
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,253
(cries)

9
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,764
(barking)

10
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,016
- [Narrator] The days
pass by, and soon

11
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,767
Autumn was about to end.

12
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,311
However, for Shurei and Eigetsu,

13
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,688
the brand new Governors
of Sa Province,

14
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,565
their duties and
responsibilities

15
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,525
had only just begun.

16
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,319
- Hmm

17
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,572
Its just as we thought, there
isn't much to work with.

18
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,240
I can finally understand why

19
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,325
Sa Province was abandoned
by the central government

20
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,577
for such a long time.

21
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,454
How's the crop situation?

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,664
- Not too good, most
of the land is barren.

23
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,499
- On top of that, because
the Sa Clans strangle hold

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,460
lasted so long,
relations with other

25
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,337
provinces are non-existent.

26
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,380
- And since this
province is isolated,

27
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,507
peddlers and traders
don't come here.

28
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,051
- Well, what about
the mountains?

29
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,387
Maybe there's some iron
ore, or even gold or silver.

30
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,805
- [Shurei] There all kinds
of places that haven't

31
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,599
checked out for
things like that yet.

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,893
But if we're basing our
infrastructure off an industry,

33
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,811
we need to pick something
like agriculture.

34
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,730
Something that'll
produce goods every year

35
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,608
and will still be around
100 years from now.

36
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,610
- 100 years from now?

37
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,819
Really?

38
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,029
- Yep, that's right.

39
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,406
That's why we've gotta
think hard about it.

40
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,409
(Windows opening)

41
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,371
- [Eigetsu] Wow, the morning
sky is really beautiful

42
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,497
isn't it?

43
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,790
- No, now that I think about it,

44
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,917
they still haven't
found the Sturioran.

45
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,502
- You're right.

46
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,379
I guess its not surprising,
we did drive them away

47
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,381
pretty harshly last time.

48
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,632
- We've watched the
daybreak countless

49
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,509
times together, but
it must be really

50
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,635
lonely for him.

51
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,428
Watching it all by himself.

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,096
- [Ensei] Oh?

53
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,639
(gasps)

54
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,807
- [Ensei] You've seen the
sun come up a lot lately?

55
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,643
- So are you planning
to make a habit of

56
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,646
staying up to watch the
sun rise from now on?

57
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,940
- Uh, no it's not like we
pulled another all nighter

58
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,441
or anything.

59
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,859
- I thought you said you were
gonna go home last night.

60
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,445
That was the only reason
why Seiran, Yuushun and I

61
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,614
agreed to do some extra work.

62
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,782
- [Ensei] You should be
sleeping at the Governors

63
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,117
residence right now.

64
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,576
What are the two
of you doing here

65
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,829
surrounded by books and
getting bags under your eyes?

66
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,833
- Uh, come on your
imagining things Ensei.

67
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,460
- Oh I am, am I?

68
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,337
Well, what do you think?

69
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,882
- Oh uh, Seiran

70
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,759
- All right you two come here,

71
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,553
its been a long time
since I had to teach

72
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,430
anyone a lesson.

73
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,347
- Yes

74
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,726
(tap)

75
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,562
- Don't get me wrong.

76
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,896
I'm very happy you're
both so enthusiastic

77
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,981
about your work.

78
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,441
But if you ruin your health by

79
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,567
pushing yourself too hard,

80
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,610
that won't do anyone any good.

81
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,778
- [Yuushun] Taking regular
breaks and maintaining

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,697
your health while
performing your duties

83
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,574
is also an important
part of the Governors

84
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,576
responsibility to the province.

85
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,493
- Yes

86
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,411
- We're sorry.

87
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,581
- Even if they get
a lecture like this.

88
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,790
- I bet you anything,
they'll still keep

89
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,500
forcing themselves
for quite a while.

90
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,877
- Yeah

91
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,463
- As long as she has trouble
forgetting about him.

92
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,757
- (grumbles)

93
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
- [Shurei] The
palace celebration?

94
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,052
- When the new year arrives

95
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,845
representatives from
the seven colored clans,

96
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,388
as well as officials
from each province

97
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,848
go to Kiyou City
in order to extend

98
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,516
their greetings to the king.

99
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,894
- (thinks) to the king, to Ryuki

100
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,854
- [Ensei] More than that,

101
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,481
- Hm

102
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,857
- It's a once a year
opportunity for important

103
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,692
people from across the
country to gather together.

104
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,069
That means, there's
a considerable amount

105
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,614
of diplomatic exchange
going on behind the scenes.

106
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,032
- [Shurei] Diplomatic exchange?

107
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,950
- The discussions between
officials are important.

108
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,744
- You wouldn't be
exaggerating to say

109
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,871
they have a direct
influence on everything

110
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,539
that's decided for
the rest of the year,

111
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,874
from personnel, to budgets.

112
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,709
- And it's not as easy
as just turning up,

113
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,628
saying a few casual
hello's to people,

114
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,796
then coming home again.

115
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:39,881
- [Ensei] So which
one of you will go?

116
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,091
- Huh

117
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,634
- Since there's still
quite a lot of work

118
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,760
that needs to be done here.

119
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,428
Either Governor
Hong or Governor To

120
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,888
should stay behind
while the other makes

121
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,181
the official visit.

122
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,433
- I think you should be
the one to go Shurei.

123
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,435
I'm sure Mr.Shoka will
be happy to see you.

124
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,645
- Huh

125
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,522
- Besides, that's
not the only reason.

126
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,524
You've got a lot more
weapons in your arsenal

127
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,526
when it comes to
diplomatic maneuvers.

128
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,568
- I

129
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,986
- I hope I'm not
insulting you by

130
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,571
pointing that out.

131
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,576
- Oh very well, yes I'll go.

132
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,038
- [Yuushun] You
won't be going alone.

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,998
I'll be accompanying
you along with Mr.Seiran

134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,584
The Merchants Guild
representative, Ms.Sai Rin Si

135
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,794
and Lord Kokujun,
will be offering his

136
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,546
greetings as clan head.

137
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,463
- Hm

138
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,594
(barking)

139
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,474
- I'm glad I'll be
able to see father

140
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,728
but, to see Ryuki
when I feel this way.

141
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,063
- [Ensei] Princess?

142
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:38,940
- What's wrong?

143
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,694
- Oh don't worry, it's nothing.

144
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,612
- Hey that's obviously not true.

145
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,489
- I just feel a little uneasy.

146
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,116
You won't be going to
the palace celebration

147
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,075
will you Ensei?

148
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,578
It just made me
realize how much I've

149
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,704
been depending on you without

150
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,789
being aware of it.

151
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,624
- That makes me very
happy to hear that.

152
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,709
(chuckles)

153
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,710
- But come on, will you be

154
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,128
that lonely separated from me?

155
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,962
- [Shurei] Mhmm

156
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:01,838
- Huh

157
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,006
- (Giggles)

158
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:03,965
But don't worry,
this time I'll do

159
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,842
my best to get by without you.

160
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,010
Good night Ensei.

161
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:08,720
- [Ensei] Wait a minute.

162
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,721
- Huh

163
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,514
- Princess, why don't I make you

164
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,933
some delicious tea, right now?

165
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,936
(tea pours)

166
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,021
- [Ensei] Here ya go.

167
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,065
- [Shurei] Thank you.

168
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,608
- For crying out loud

169
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,776
this is supposed to be
your private residence

170
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,778
but, it looks more
like a library.

171
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,781
- [Shurei] I feel
more at ease this way.

172
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,660
- Ensei, do I really
look so depressed

173
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,745
that you felt like
you had to make

174
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,330
some tea to cheer me up?

175
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,750
- No, it's all just me
worrying about you Princess.

176
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,877
- I heard they've
recently finished cleaning

177
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,546
away the debris from the
building that collapsed.

178
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,632
- [Ensei] Oh, right.

179
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,758
You mean the trap
where the whole place

180
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,759
falls down when
you apply a certain

181
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,802
amount of weight to it?

182
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,969
That was pretty smart of Chusho

183
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,971
to come up with
an idea like that.

184
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,640
- [Shurei] They founds
lot of gun powder and

185
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,100
jars of oil
underneath the floor.

186
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,769
I guess he wanted
to make sure but,

187
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,020
luckily they
finished the clean-up

188
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,689
without incident.

189
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,357
- So in the end, the only
thing they couldn't find

190
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,650
was Saku himself.

191
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,110
(gasps)

192
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,695
- That's right.

193
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,697
It's just like him to
cause trouble for me.

194
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,156
Even up to his
very final moments.

195
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,076
I know that man was involved in

196
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,036
so many dreadful deeds.

197
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,789
And yet, he never
treated me cruelly,

198
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,082
not even once.

199
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,668
He never forced me to
do or feel anything.

200
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,087
'Play the erhu for me,
brew some tea for me.

201
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,798
Please do up my hair.'

202
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,634
Those were the only things
he ever asked of me.

203
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:35,807
I, just couldn't bring
myself to hate him.

204
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,809
- It's fine for you
to feel that way,

205
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,977
of course you would.

206
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,687
You were the first
and only person in

207
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,064
Saku's whole life that he
cared not to be hated by.

208
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,733
Because of that
he only showed his

209
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,943
prettiest colors to
you, and you alone.

210
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,862
There's no way you could
hate him after that,

211
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,989
and there's not really
any need for you to.

212
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,744
- But you know, I wasn't
really fair to him either.

213
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,705
I couldn't help but be
charmed by that man as well.

214
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,248
And it kept me from
telling him properly

215
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,833
until the very end.

216
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,917
- Telling him what?

217
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,877
- I should have told him,

218
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,961
I can't be with you.

219
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,087
(laughing)

220
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,255
- Stop it, it's no
laughing matter.

221
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,715
(laughing)

222
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,967
- Oh sorry, it's
just, a guy like him

223
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,635
would never go along
with a line like that.

224
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,887
- Ah you're right.

225
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,096
Even if I did say that,

226
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,848
he'd probably play
it off as a joke.

227
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,058
But

228
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,102
I still should have
said it over and over.

229
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,980
Until the words finally
reached his heart.

230
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:24,898
- Hm

231
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,111
- Uh

232
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:30,987
- I thought you
might be out here.

233
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:31,988
- [Seiran] Yeah

234
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,199
- Honestly I'm fine, okay?

235
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,034
Don't worry about me.

236
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,787
(water trickling)

237
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,872
(Dog Barking)

238
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:41,998
- [Ensei] I'm afraid
I wasn't able to

239
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,792
do anything for
her either Seiran.

240
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,003
On the contrary, you
and I are the ones

241
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,797
being worried about as usual.

242
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,173
- [Seiran] You're pathetic.

243
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,884
- Yeah but, so are you.

244
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,094
- It's all because you and I are

245
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,303
too deeply involved
with this whole thing,

246
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,180
and neither of us can
help her like this.

247
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,474
- Somebody died right
before her eyes.

248
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,685
There's no way anyone
as kind as Princess

249
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,769
wouldn't be upset.

250
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,895
Damn, Saku.

251
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,689
Even when he's dead,
he's still causing

252
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,982
trouble to the bitter end.

253
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,317
(sigh)

254
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,485
- [Seiran] Right now,

255
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,153
only Master Shoka or completely

256
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,698
neutral third party
can make a difference.

257
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,081
- Uh!

258
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,959
What a klutz I am.

259
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,757
(drips)

260
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,178
Oh no

261
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,263
I can't cry.

262
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,766
(sobs)

263
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,860
(flute plays)

264
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,199
You know, when you're
visiting someone's house

265
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,076
it's generally considered
polite to announce

266
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,038
yourself first, Rykren.

267
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,081
- If you had some more
elegance and surprise

268
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,750
to the myriad aspects of life

269
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,294
then you'll find it more
satisfying and fulfilling.

270
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,755
- It's already
way past midnight.

271
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,757
Next time, please at
least try to get here

272
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,092
before the sun sets, okay?

273
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,552
- Sure, but

274
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,262
I want some rice
porridge with mushrooms

275
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,221
for dinner then.

276
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,890
- All right I got it, now

277
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,224
get inside quick.

278
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,226
The nights have been
getting a lot colder lately.

279
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,145
(thud)

280
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,023
(window creeks)

281
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,070
- Hey, what happened to
those feathers you wore?

282
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,237
- Well in the midst
of my travels,

283
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,781
I re-encountered
two young men who

284
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,240
were enamored of my feathers.

285
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,368
In the end I traded
them for some things.

286
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,913
- [Shurei] It couldn't be.

287
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,998
(shivers)

288
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,916
- Uh

289
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,797
- By the way, I'm
sorry I chased you off

290
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,673
the last time.

291
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,216
I said some pretty harsh things.

292
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,845
- What the?

293
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,181
- No one can know
what goes on in

294
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,307
other people's hearts.

295
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,434
And no one can really predict

296
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,395
where following the
heart will lead you.

297
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,440
Ever since Sakujun
Sa's rampage stopped,

298
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,943
casualties have been
reduced to the minimum.

299
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,112
You were the only one
who succeeded in that.

300
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,989
In fact only you could do it.

301
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,826
- Yah and what about it?

302
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,035
I still

303
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,079
I'm stil the one who killed him.

304
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,124
- [Rykren] That's true.

305
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,834
While he chose death for
his own satisfaction,

306
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,961
you were the one who drove
him to make that choice.

307
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,295
(gasps)

308
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,297
He merely existed
until he met you.

309
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,049
Then he developed
an interest in life.

310
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,343
That's what made the
choice important.

311
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,928
In the end, you
were the only one

312
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,638
who could save Sakujun Sa,

313
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,640
and the only one
that could kill him.

314
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,183
That means, you're
the only person in

315
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,060
this whole world
who's allowed to cry

316
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,020
for his sake.

317
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,939
The funeral right
are finished and

318
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,649
judgements all laid down.

319
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,318
That means the only thing
that remains for you to do,

320
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,654
is to cry for him.

321
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,990
- If I'm allowed to
cry then, I'll cry.

322
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,199
You'd better be
ready for clothes

323
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,993
you're wearing to be
soaked and ruined.

324
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,327
If not, just tell me
how much the whole

325
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,079
outfit is gonna cost to replace.

326
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,497
I should be able to
hold my tears back

327
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,207
if I hear the price.

328
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,500
- If you like, I
can play you the

329
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,377
tragic song of the century.

330
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,381
- Oh Rykren, I'm gonna
cry even without the song.

331
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,135
(sobs)

332
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,102
They say tears from eyes
and rain from Heaven,

333
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,396
those will always be part of
the natural way of things.

334
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,981
(sobs)

335
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,358
And justice and blue
sky eventually beats

336
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,276
through the clouds,

337
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,403
Tears will also dry away.

338
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,117
(high flute playing)

339
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,038
(pours)

340
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,627
- [Shurei] I was wondering.

341
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,380
Did you come all this
way just to cheer me up?

342
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,090
- I had heard from
Kokujun that you were very

343
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,092
cheerful and excited.

344
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,136
But you can never truly
fool a kindred spirit.

345
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,263
- Huh, you met Mr. Kokujun?

346
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,640
- [Rykren] Of course I have.

347
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,101
Since I'm staying at his
place, I see him everyday.

348
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,102
- What?

349
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:12,811
You're staying with him?

350
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,229
But how did that happen?

351
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,438
(flute playing)

352
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,648
- [Rykren] While I was
walking in the city

353
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,316
and he called out to me.

354
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,651
- [Kokujun] Please
excuse my rudeness but,

355
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,236
I was wondering, would
you be willing to help

356
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,113
me select a new wardrobe?

357
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,572
I'm supposed to be going
to the palace celebration

358
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,658
in the new year but I
have no idea what to wear.

359
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,244
I don't know anything about
fashion trends in Kiyou.

360
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,830
If its all right with you
Sir, please come to my home

361
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,582
as my guest, and offer me
some advice about my wardrobe.

362
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,501
- No matter how you look
at it he picked the wrong

363
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,253
guy for the job.

364
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,421
- As we're the same
age, I couldn't help

365
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,839
but sympathize.

366
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,133
And when he insisted, I couldn't
very well turn him down.

367
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,134
- Huh

368
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,135
What's that?

369
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:45,719
You're the same age as him?

370
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,178
- That's right.

371
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,513
On top of that, he
and his new bride

372
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,181
appreciated my flute playing and

373
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,517
applauded all of my tunes.

374
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,519
- If he can be that
diplomatic, maybe he will

375
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,478
make it big.

376
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,691
- You have a strange way of
opening paths for people.

377
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,109
Look at all that's happened.

378
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,279
Me coming here, Kokujun becoming
the head of the Sa Clan.

379
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,364
Ensei taking the Basic
Provential Exams.

380
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,408
And even the Provential
government becoming

381
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,659
as stable as it is today.

382
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,536
All these things are
because of your actions

383
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,704
aren't they?

384
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,289
- And you have a
strange way of knowing

385
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,207
a lot about
everything don't you?

386
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,170
- I suppose that's what
I means to have the name

387
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,087
Rykren Ran.

388
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,551
(grunts)

389
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,511
- And with that, I'll
have to excuse myself.

390
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,472
Being in a women's
bedroom at midnight

391
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,557
might lead to a
rather bad reputation.

392
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,517
(laughs)

393
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,354
(flute playing)

394
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,109
- All right, I've
gotta give it my best.

395
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,406
- Let's see if
agriculture and forestry

396
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,575
won't work, and the city
can't be turned into

397
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,118
a commercial center.

398
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,372
I wonder what we can make into
Sa Provinces main industry.

399
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,458
What is it, something
on your mind?

400
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,460
- Oh nothing, it's
just that, well

401
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,545
I was thinking that you
look a lot more refreshed

402
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,130
and relaxed, that's all.

403
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,509
- Maybe because I
cried my eyes out.

404
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,760
- Huh

405
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,679
- I'm sorry that I made
you worry about me.

406
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,597
But I'm feeling much better now.

407
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,265
As long as I'm alive,

408
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,476
I'll keep putting one
foot in front of the other

409
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,478
and do the best that I can.

410
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,147
- Yeah you're right.

411
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,774
As long as we're around,

412
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,609
we'll do our best.

413
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,486
- Having said that,
when it comes to setting

414
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,613
up new industries to base
our infrastructure on,

415
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,365
there's a limit to
what you and I can come

416
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,491
up with on our own.

417
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,617
- That's very true.

418
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,369
We should probably
ask for the opinions

419
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,371
of specialists in
various fields.

420
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,497
- For example?

421
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,540
- [Eigetsu] Well
like applied arts,

422
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,499
fine arts.

423
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,793
- [Shurei] Pharmacy, medicine.

424
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,628
We'd have to gather
specialists in those

425
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,338
fields together and then,

426
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,466
(gasps)

427
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,384
- [Both] Aha!

428
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,593
- Eigetsu.

429
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,263
- Yes that's it, there
is that possibility.

430
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,597
- Right!

431
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,267
- In any case, lets start
working on that idea.

432
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,686
(upbeat music)

433
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,528
- Huh

434
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,322
(dreamy sound)

435
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,289
- [Ensei] Are you two
planning on watching

436
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,540
the sun rise again?

437
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,752
- Oh uh, Ensei

438
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,503
We were just thinking of
going home in a few minutes,

439
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,671
really.

440
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,340
- [Ensei] So what's
that you go there?

441
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,300
- Please give it back, it
isn't even finished yet.

442
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,676
- Aye, perfect timing.

443
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,594
Catch Yuushun.

444
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,222
- [Yuushun] Hm, what is it?

445
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,604
- Hm, Ensei, please gather
all of the provential

446
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,314
officials here for a meeting.

447
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,441
Also, please invite
Mrs.Sei Rin Si as well.

448
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,526
As for the two of
you, if you can,

449
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,320
please collect all
the documents relating

450
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,364
to this matter as
quickly as possible.

451
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,743
- [Yuuhsun] Now I
would as you both to

452
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,536
explain your proposal
to those gathered.

453
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,330
- The two of us have
been considering how best

454
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,873
to raise the entirety
of Sa Province from

455
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,708
its current depression.

456
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,627
- Not only must we
continue the work that

457
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,338
Lieutenant Governor Ryou,
Lieutenant Governor Tei began.

458
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,714
But it is also our
responsibility to take

459
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,591
the province to the next level.

460
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:12,467
- To the next level huh?

461
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,635
Huh

462
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,887
- And that's what this
plan is all about.

463
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,682
- We'd like too create
a research institution.

464
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,559
To make Sa Province a center
for academic research.

465
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,396
- We believe this will lead
the province to prosperity,

466
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,524
as well as guarantee a strong
future 100 years from now.

467
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,402
(crowd mumbles)

468
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,654
- It's and interesting idea.

469
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,741
- Of course the plan still
has quite a few holes.

470
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,327
But it's definitely
worth discussing further.

471
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,663
- I would agree.

472
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,417
- [Sai Rin] Indeed, it is
quite a promising plan.

473
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,670
- [Yuushun] Ms. Sai Rin Si.

474
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,297
- Of course it's also
incredibly far reaching.

475
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,383
And would require considerable
funds, significant land,

476
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,511
and many talented people
to complete it properly.

477
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,388
- We invited you with
the intention of asking

478
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,682
the Merchants Guild for
cooperation in areas

479
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,434
such as, financial assistance.

480
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,686
- Personally, I would
like to help you.

481
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,771
But I can not officially
support a plan that

482
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,690
may be aborted
while in progress.

483
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,817
As Chief Representative
of the Merchants Guild,

484
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,611
I'm afraid I am unable to
give my assent so readily.

485
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,696
- Sister please.

486
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,619
- However I can't
help but be touched by

487
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,121
the spirit the two
Governors have shown by

488
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,416
thinking of Sa Provinces'
future for 100 years from now.

489
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,876
It votes well for the project.

490
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,627
We'll consider the
proposal further

491
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,588
with all intentions
of making it work.

492
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,424
- Well then we will
reveal the find points

493
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,759
of the plan thoroughly and

494
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,427
- [Yuushun] Let us reconvene
in one months time.

495
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,553
- Huh

496
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,512
- One month?

497
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:41,639
- This is an
important matter when

498
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,641
it comes to Sa
Provinces' future.

499
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,810
I hope that everyone
will do their best.

500
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,812
- In other words, it should
be ready by the new year.

501
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,731
Right Yuushun?

502
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,358
- For the new year?

503
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,650
You mean the celebration?

504
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,777
- Right.

505
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,986
If we finish in one month

506
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,780
we can present the
matter officially during

507
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:57,822
the palace celebration.

508
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,782
- Hm

509
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,454
- All right I understand.

510
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,790
I'll do everything that I
can while in Kiyou City.

511
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,668
(Cheers)

512
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,585
- Well done

513
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,503
well done

514
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,757
(calming music)

515
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,889
- [Ensei] So you're
admiring the sun set today

516
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,016
instead of the sun rise huh?

517
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,643
- [Shurei] Ensei.

518
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,649
- You're really
amazing Princess.

519
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,775
- You came up with an
incredible plan like that

520
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,568
out of the blue.

521
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,530
- I have to keep moving forward.

522
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,493
I realize now, the
reason I could never

523
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,786
take that mans hand

524
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,788
is because I want to
keep fortune ahead

525
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,039
one step at a time.

526
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,708
You know I'm very greedy.

527
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,626
I can't give up the things
that are important to me,

528
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,503
and the things that
I've cultivated.

529
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,505
When it comes down to
it, I can't trade away

530
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,507
all the feelings and
hoped I hold in my heart

531
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,051
in exchange for living my
life only for his sake.

532
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,929
I'm just not willing
to make that sacrifice.

533
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,932
If I were able to throw it
all away just like that,

534
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,809
I would never have
taken the national exams

535
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,519
in the first place.

536
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,439
I wanted to become a government
official for so long.

537
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,815
But all I had were
these vague idea like,

538
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,526
I'll become an official
and work diligently

539
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,778
to prevent the country
from collapsing.

540
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,572
Now its different.

541
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,657
I want to become a
government official who earns

542
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,535
the acknowledgement of
the people I respect.

543
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,579
And I want to become
an official who will be

544
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,456
capable of helping those I love.

545
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:31,833
And that means, I'll
have to keep moving

546
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,793
much further up.

547
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:34,711
- Huh

548
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,758
That's a pretty astounding
confession Princess.

549
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,093
It's not fair catching
me off balance like that.

550
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:42,969
- Hm

551
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,930
- You know, you shouldn't
be in such a hurry

552
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,557
to become and adult.

553
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,767
- But I intend to.

554
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,934
After everything
that's happened,

555
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,562
I realize that I
can't remain a child.

556
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,106
I've decided that I won't
make the same mistake again.

557
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,567
So I'll give everything
lots and lots of thought

558
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,610
so it doesn't happen.

559
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,820
I can do it.

560
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,947
I swear, I'm going
to do it Ensei.

561
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,997
(crow caws)

562
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,040
- Well then, we'll be
going back to Kinku now.

563
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,541
- Right, take care.

564
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,670
- Oh, headed home?

565
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,882
- What's got you in
such a satisfied mood?

566
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,884
- I was just thinking
about how fortunate I am

567
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,719
to have such a great boss.

568
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,596
- Thinking ahead one
hundred years down the road.

569
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,306
Pretty impressive.

570
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,809
It's not a simple thing
for most people to imagine.

571
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,519
It's the sort of
thinking a Prime Minister

572
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,729
might use as he
oversees a country.

573
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,856
Lieutenant Governor, you
and I and everyone else

574
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,900
may be assisting in
the first steps of two

575
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,735
soon to be legendary officials.

576
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,862
Who will have their
names etched in history.

577
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,740
- I know, it's giving
me chills down my spine.

578
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,952
- Still, the real battle
will be at the palace.

579
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,830
(peaceful music)

580
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,543
- Hey Shurei

581
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,752
- What is it?

582
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,754
- I'm glad that we're
in this together.

583
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,798
I'm proud to serve with you
as a government official

584
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,882
of Sa Province.

585
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,721
- I feel the same.

586
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:12,684
- I brought a midnight
snack for you two.

587
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,979
Please, I hope you
enjoy it, Lady Shurei.

588
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,063
- Thank you Karin.

589
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,982
Oh you've made
meatball soup for us.

590
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,820
This is really delicious.

591
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,572
Not only is the soup good but,

592
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,657
the texture of the meatball
soaks it up perfectly,

593
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,034
its fantastic.

594
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:29,909
Right?

595
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,119
- Yes I agree.

596
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,580
Actually this is one
of my favorite dishes.

597
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,789
- What do I care,
I only made it for

598
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,249
Lady Shurei.

599
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,711
- [Eigetsu] Maybe but, it truly
is delicious all the same.

600
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,680
(end song)

601
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,045
We're on our way to Kiyo

602
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,755
To attend the New Year's
Palace celebration

603
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,132
Eigetsu, Ensei,

604
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,384
Please look after Sa
Provence while I'm gone

605
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,261
I'll be seeing you soon Father

606
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:15,015
Lord Koyu, General Ran, and...
