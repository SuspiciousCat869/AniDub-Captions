1
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,551
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,808
(singing in Japanese)

3
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,815
- [Narrator] Before they could
understand what was going on,

4
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,401
Shuurei and Eigetsu found
themselves being chased

5
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,277
by member of the Seikin Gang.

6
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,822
They escaped into Kogaro,
the number one brothel

7
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,323
of the red light district.

8
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,909
There, Ryuuki Shi,
the king of Saiunkoku,

9
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,662
was reunited with
his beloved Shuurei.

10
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,248
It was quite the
heart-warming scene.

11
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,625
(gentle music)

12
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,506
- Well?

13
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,591
Aren't you going to tell
me what you're doing here?

14
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,927
- Actually I came
to see your friend.

15
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,761
- [Shuurei] What?

16
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,263
To see Eigetsu?

17
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,848
- From what I understand,
Shuuei took him

18
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,976
under his protection yesterday
and brought him here to rest.

19
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,437
- Lord Ran was in my room,
but he was called out

20
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,563
in the middle of the night.

21
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,023
It turns out it
was because the boy

22
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,400
was being harassed by gangsters.

23
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,361
- Then Miss Kochou, you mean
the customer who left you early

24
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,946
was actually General Ran?

25
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,822
- Huh?

26
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,407
- (chuckles)

27
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,659
- He's got quite the nerve
treating someone like me

28
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,578
that way, don't you think?

29
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,495
- Ah, yeah.

30
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,707
- Excuse me sir, but
did I have anything

31
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,875
taken from me back then?

32
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,959
- Hmm, that's odd.

33
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,336
You're like a completely
different person

34
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,254
from the boy I met yesterday.

35
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,505
- Huh?

36
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,257
- Well, see, what
actually happened

37
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,011
- It's that Seikin gang
again, that poor kid.

38
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,764
What's wrong boys, the
loser of the drinking

39
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,601
game pays for all the
drinks, and 10 gold coins

40
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,727
that was the deal.

41
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,729
- You've got to be
kidding, there's no way

42
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,731
a little fret like you
could drink so much,

43
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,399
you must have cheated.

44
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,027
- You were the ones who
insisted on the drinking match,

45
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,529
How could I possibly
have cheated?

46
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,366
Being treated to free
booze was certainly nice

47
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,742
but you could have
at least picked a

48
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,410
better quality wine for me.

49
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,745
(laughs)

50
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,663
- What! Why you
little jerk, I'm gonna

51
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,665
strip you clean
and sell you off.

52
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,377
(Fight noises)

53
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,420
- What the...

54
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,339
- 1,2,3

55
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,799
- [Ryuuki Shi] Wow, not bad.

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,301
- He barely had 10
gold coins on him.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,974
- Wait, that's...

58
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,812
I lost track of you for
a little while after that

59
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,398
but when I found you later,
you were half asleep.

60
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,441
You insisted on going to
the number one brothel

61
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,069
in Keio, so I brought
you here, you didn't

62
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,613
appear to have anything
stolen from you however.

63
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,073
- Oh but...

64
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,950
- [Ryuuki Shi] What
was it you lost?

65
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,412
- Er, well, to tell you
the truth, it was my

66
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,496
admittance token.

67
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,790
(Gasp)

68
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,834
- It seems I was
targeted because of it.

69
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,421
They said they had
already collected many so,

70
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,588
it's possible that
other people may have...

71
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,091
- The gang is collecting
them!? Is this true?

72
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,677
- [Eigetsu] Yes! Those
guys we encountered

73
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,553
said so.

74
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,470
- Hm

75
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,888
(Door opens)

76
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,806
- Madam Kocho

77
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,808
- Mm, yes what is it?

78
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,893
- A member of the Seikin
gang just walked in

79
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,061
and surrendered himself.

80
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,646
- [Madam Kocho] What?

81
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,481
- In fact it's someone we
know, it's that kid who

82
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,525
always comes here
to see Miss Shuurei.

83
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,860
- What!? Saunta?

84
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,904
Saunta, you idiot...

85
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,990
- What kind of relationship
do those two have?

86
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,492
- They've been friends ever
since they were children,

87
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,453
he has been hitting on
Lady Shuurei as long as

88
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,539
I can remember, it's been
tough keeping him away.

89
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,126
I even had to throw him in
the river during winter once.

90
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,711
After that, I'm
surprised to hear

91
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,046
he's still hanging around.

92
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,382
- I thought it'd be
cool, I wanted to have

93
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,134
something special about
me that would impress

94
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,845
the girl I like and
earn her respect.

95
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,597
Not to mention, to
prove to my love rival

96
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,515
that I could do
just as well as him.

97
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,018
- What does he mean by that?

98
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,728
- What are you going
on about Saunta?

99
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,688
For one thing, I don't
have the faintest idea

100
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,148
of who this girl you like is!

101
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,026
But I can tell you that
your logic is way off!

102
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,528
If someone tried to
impress me with "Hey, look

103
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,947
at me, I think I'm head
of a pack of thugs"

104
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,449
(laughs)

105
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,409
"awesome aren't I"

106
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,870
If I heard that, heck,
I'd drop him so hard

107
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,955
he'd bruise.

108
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,957
Now do you think you've
outdone that love

109
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,085
rival of yours by
joining a gang? Hm?

110
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,462
I didn't think so.

111
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,839
- [Saunta] I'm sorry.

112
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,216
- But what about my
token? Do you know

113
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,635
if it's at the Seikin
gang stronghold?

114
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,844
- [Saunta] I think
so. But they're

115
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,638
planning to come here
and make this place

116
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,014
their new base of operations.

117
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,683
- [Lord Ron] When?

118
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,059
- Tonight

119
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,727
- So they'll be coming
here, bringing all of those

120
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,104
tokens with them.

121
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,897
How convenient for us.

122
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,649
- [Madam Kocho] Just
a minute Lord Ron

123
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,568
as you well know, the
Seikin gang is our quarry.

124
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,488
- The circumstances have
changed somewhat, if possible

125
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,739
id like for us to
handle the matter.

126
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,949
- No!

127
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,659
If we're not the ones to
deal with these people

128
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,703
it will undermine our
standing in the city.

129
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,204
- Miss Kocho

130
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,498
- Then in the case, how
about on the condition

131
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,083
that we'll back off
as soon as we find

132
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,209
what we're looking for.

133
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,921
- Hm, I suppose that's fine.

134
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,631
We were only going to
give them a few more

135
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,133
days of free reign anyway.

136
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,263
- [Lord Ron] Shuurei

137
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,639
- Uh yes?

138
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,141
- Kocho is one of the
underground crime bosses

139
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,685
of Keio, she's the
leader responsible for

140
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,020
the Red Light District.

141
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,938
They say she's the the
heroine controlling the

142
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,982
gang alliances from
behind the scenes.

143
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,782
- So this is Kokaro huh?

144
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,617
- [Thug] Boss

145
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,952
- (grunt)

146
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,705
- Don't you think it's
a little too quiet

147
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,622
in there?

148
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,627
- [Boss] They're probably
jut scared of us,

149
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,921
enough waiting
around, let's go boys!

150
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,007
(Cheers)

151
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,687
- [Madam Kocho] Alright,
that's far enough

152
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,819
so you've dared to show
your faces here did you?

153
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,113
We give you a little
freedom and you act like you

154
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,990
own the world.

155
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,742
We'll show you what you
get for messing around

156
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,077
in our territory.

157
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,162
And we won't go easy on you.

158
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,623
Tonight this place has
been surrounded by all

159
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,917
the bosses of Keio's underworld.

160
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,172
- What was that you
just said? What the...

161
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,845
- [Madam Kocho]
You'll regret that you

162
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,807
ever dared set foot
in here. Now...

163
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,850
Let them have it!

164
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,894
(Cheer)

165
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,318
- Miss Kocho was one of the
underwolrd bosses all this time

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,697
- Glad now that I didn't
take her up on her offer

167
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,615
- You idiot, you don't
seriously think she'd spend time

168
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,866
with you, do you?

169
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,703
- Hey! Keep in down you
three, for Pete's sake.

170
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,082
- [Eigetsu] Sir, I've been
thinking I should go out

171
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,376
there too, the item is
very important to me,

172
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,086
if I lose it then coming to Keio

173
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,838
will have been a waste of time.

174
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,215
- [Ryuuki Shi] The
more important issue
is, can you fight?

175
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,677
- No, I can't, in fact
I'm actually kind of weak.

176
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,220
- [Ryuuki Shi] I'm
pretty weak too.

177
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,931
That means for the most part
the best I can do is search

178
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,391
thugs that are already down.

179
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,892
- Thank you so much.

180
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,811
- [Ryuuki Shi] Shuurei,
you come along too.

181
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,312
- Er, okay.

182
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,815
- [Ryuuki Shi] You and Eigetsu
stay where I can see you.

183
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,941
- And what about me?

184
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,067
- [Ryuuki Shi] I
don't care about you.

185
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,737
- (sad noise)

186
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,324
- That wasn't part of
the plan at all, damn!

187
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,791
Well as long as I have
these I won't have to worry

188
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,709
about money.

189
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,970
- Its not here

190
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,726
- I'll use you as a hostage
and get myself out of here.

191
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,393
- Shuurei!

192
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,062
- Shurrei!

193
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,814
- So you're the litte
snitch that ratted us out!

194
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,649
- I am so sorry boss.

195
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,778
Wait no that's not
right, let go of Shuurei!

196
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,169
(harp noise)

197
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,468
- Why hello there Eigetsu,
is it my turn yet?

198
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,972
- Eyogetsu, please I
beg you, save Shuurei.

199
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,185
- That's not any of
my concern, but still.

200
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,861
- [Shuurei] Eigetsu!

201
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,406
- Stand still!

202
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,449
(smash)

203
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,037
- Are you alright?

204
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,955
- Yes

205
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,292
- How dare you, you bastard!

206
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,712
( screams)

207
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,801
You!

208
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,725
- Eigetsu! Look out!

209
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,856
- I'm not Eigetsu.

210
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,898
- Huh?

211
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,191
- [Eyogetsu] My name...

212
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,776
(lightning)

213
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,902
Is Eyogetsu!

214
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,195
- Eyo..Eyogetsu?

215
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,538
- [Saunta] So he's the guy
Shuurei saw last night.

216
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,873
Is that wine?

217
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,832
- [Shuurei] It's
not that he simply

218
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,042
gets nasty when he's drunk,

219
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,170
he becomes a completely
different person.

220
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,048
- Huh? Here they are! This is it

221
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,257
help me pick them up Shuurei.

222
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,175
- Okay

223
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,846
Admittance tokens!
For the final exam!

224
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,265
How dare you do this
to people, Seikin Gang.

225
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,391
- Hey!

226
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,976
- Huh?

227
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,061
- [Saunta] Shuurei!

228
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,396
- (screams)

229
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,776
- What? Shuurei!

230
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,986
- Ryuuki!

231
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,823
- Be more aware of your
surroundings next time.

232
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,205
I did help you, but only because

233
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,541
Eigetsu asked me, don't
expect it a second time.

234
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,545
Oh and one more thing,
Eigetsu's token isn't here

235
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,089
(stumbles)

236
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,174
The alcohol is wearing off

237
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,391
- Mm, this young mans
skills really are

238
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,934
something.

239
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,310
- [Boss] Quite impressive
I have to admit,

240
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,105
of course my organization
will be taking him in.

241
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,941
- Are you kidding? I was the
first to set my eyes on him.

242
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,359
- [Ryuuki] I hate to
break it to you gentlemen

243
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,319
but we had an
interest in him first.

244
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,195
- Huh?

245
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,071
- And who might you be?

246
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,280
What's your name?

247
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,074
- [Ryuuki] Ryuuki,

248
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,992
my name is Ryuuki Shi.

249
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,330
(Laughter)

250
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,207
- [Boss] You have the
same name as the king huh?

251
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,043
I guess that means we'll
have to obey you then, right?

252
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,379
But anyway, the bottom
line remains the same,

253
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,006
we saw him first.

254
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,217
- [Ryuuki] Not quite, from
the moment Eigetsu accepted

255
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,137
this token, we had already
set our own eyes on him.

256
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,557
- A kid like this
is a final examinee?

257
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,350
But that means he
would have damned those

258
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,269
Seikin bastards!

259
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,521
- A commendable sentiment
but I hope next time

260
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,606
you'll take action
a little sooner.

261
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,234
- Your delay almost put
is in a very undesirable

262
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,527
position.

263
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,362
To think, they take
examinees admittance

264
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,448
tokens which they value
more than their lives

265
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,450
and use them for
blackmail purposes.

266
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,994
We trust that you will
give them the punishment

267
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,412
they deserve.

268
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,123
- One moment, are you
allowing us to repay our debt

269
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,459
to you by handling this
matter from here on?

270
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,420
- That seems only proper.

271
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,215
- Hm, we do not bow
before you simply

272
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,218
because of the seat
you occupy you majesty.

273
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,636
- To me personally then?

274
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,057
- Indeed. We bow
before you because you

275
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,018
are the one who righted
the mistake we made,

276
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,312
you were able to intervene
before matters became

277
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:36,149
irrevocable. And we bow
to offer our sincere

278
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,692
apologies for failing to uphold

279
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,402
our end of the agreement.

280
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,572
(Shocked whispers)

281
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,699
- (sigh)

282
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,093
- After today's incident,
the gang alliance

283
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,136
owes us a favor.

284
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,263
But more importantly, for
time being it would seem

285
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,140
that they've acknowledged
us as worthy allies

286
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,433
to have.

287
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,103
This is certainly an
unexpected surprise.

288
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,606
- Pardon me, but is
that my exam token?

289
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,442
- No it isn't, Shuurei,
have you found it yet?

290
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,320
- I'm afraid not, when
the other Eigetsu came out

291
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,490
he insisted that it wasn't
here with the others.

292
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,200
But he fell asleep
before he could tell me

293
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,451
where it really was.

294
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,369
- Hm

295
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:32,747
- Eigetsu?

296
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,124
- I'll drink some wine.

297
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,044
- [Shuurei] But I thought
you couldn't have alcohol?

298
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,630
- I'll get Eyogetsu to
come out, and then you can

299
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,507
ask him where he put it!

300
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,219
- I'm not gonna let you do that

301
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,722
- I have no choice, they
won't give me another token!

302
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,640
I have to find it,
no matter what!

303
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,726
- I know and I
understand how you feel

304
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,977
but...

305
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,479
- [Saunta's Father] Erm,
excuse me, please pardon

306
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,355
my intrusion

307
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,358
- [Shuurei] It is
Saunta's Father.

308
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,527
- Oh Miss Shuurei,
it's been a while,

309
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,362
it's so good to see you again.

310
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,531
As always I must thank
you for being so good

311
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,657
to my foolish wayward son.

312
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,328
Well then, to my business,
is there a Mr. Eigetsu To

313
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,538
in the building?

314
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,832
- Er, I'm Eigetsu To.

315
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,417
- [Saunta's Father]
Yes yes it was you!

316
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,502
Thank you so much for
the order to placed at my

317
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,254
store last night.

318
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,174
It was truly an honor to
have such a fine upstanding

319
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,176
young man visit
our store, to think

320
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,802
we were visited by
the youngest person in

321
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,138
history to pass the
provincial exam,

322
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,057
I was happy to be of service.

323
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,437
- My admittance token! Did you
get, er, did I give you this?

324
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,064
- Have you already forgotten?

325
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,776
- [Eigetsu] I went a
little overboard today,

326
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,735
it could lead to
trouble, please deliver

327
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,278
this along with the wine

328
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,155
otherwise the nitwit
is likely to end up

329
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,573
losing it in the chaos.

330
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,242
Send them to the number
one brothel in Keio.

331
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,286
Late tomorrow evening should do.

332
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,537
- [Sauntas Father]
Those were your words,

333
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,747
were they not?

334
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,874
By the way, here's
the bottle of wine

335
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,668
you ordered. You certainly have

336
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,379
discriminating taste,
even the king himself

337
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,214
rarely enjoys wine
of such quality

338
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,091
if I do say so myself.

339
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,301
It's a premium item
of course, one bottle

340
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,262
alone costs 10 gold
and 30 silver coins.

341
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,390
- No wonder you had
so little money!

342
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,558
- Now then, since my third
son seems to be intent

343
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,228
on sleeping like a baby,
I'll leave him to it.

344
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,813
When he wakes up,
please be so kind as

345
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,857
to tell the boy to
walk home by himself.

346
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,401
I hope you'll
patronize our humble

347
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,819
store again in the future.

348
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,410
- [Ryuuki] Eigetsu, from Saka
village in Koko province,

349
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,121
sweet Kyodo temple
serving as your sponsor

350
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,164
at age 12 you taught
the Koko provincial

351
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,374
exam.

352
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,792
This year, you'll be
taking the final exam

353
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,502
at only 13.

354
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,588
We're glad to token was
returned to you, do well and

355
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,549
pass the exam, then please

356
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,508
come and serve me.

357
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:54,597
- Then you're.. yes sir.

358
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,141
- That goes for you too.

359
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,478
I'll be waiting for you.

360
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,614
- [Madam Kocho] So today
is your last day isn't

361
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,615
it Shuurei?

362
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,285
- [Shuurei] Yes, thank you
for everything you've done.

363
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,954
- Like I said before,
I have a gift for you

364
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,457
a complete makeup set, with

365
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,375
instructions on how to apply it.

366
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,712
- It's very beautiful Miss
Kocho but I don't wear makeup.

367
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,547
- We had a promise didn't we?

368
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,843
Got that? As I said a promise

369
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,803
otherwise I'll be
forced to tell Mr Hong

370
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:34,971
and say you it all that
you've been working

371
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,598
in the Red Light District.

372
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,641
- Now that you mention it,
I was wondering, do you

373
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,518
know Sadon and my father?

374
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,732
- Yes I do. I first
met your father

375
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,276
a little while after
you began working here

376
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,320
one day he visited
me all on his own.

377
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,281
- Wait, so you mean that
father knew I was working here?

378
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,950
- He was very polite, he
bowed his head deeply and

379
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,495
said to me "Please take
good care of my daughter."

380
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,996
- What? He..he said that?

381
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,957
- He said "My daughter has
only recently lost her mother,

382
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,877
from here on in she will
encounter many things that I,

383
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,672
as a man, cannot
understand, that is why I am

384
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,632
asking you to take
good care of her."

385
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:14,969
Then not long after that I got
a visit from Sadon as well.

386
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,848
He said exactly the same
things Mr Hong had said and

387
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,724
then left.

388
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,894
I couldn't help
but laugh about it.

389
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,689
- [Shuurei] Sadon was here too?

390
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,899
So that's how he
knew about Kogotto.

391
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,359
- Alright it's done.

392
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,362
Take a look

393
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,490
- (gasp)

394
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:40,328
- Remember this well,
makeup is the war paint

395
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,246
of a woman.

396
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,457
Whenever you find yourself
heading into battle,

397
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,292
make sure you wear it.

398
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,628
That way you'll be certain
that you'll never cry,

399
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,339
if you cry your makeup
will run and no matter

400
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,341
how little you apply,
your face will end up

401
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,968
looking disgraceful.

402
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,387
That's why no matter
how difficult things get

403
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,930
you'll keep yourself
from crying.

404
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,643
You are headed into
battle aren't you?

405
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,896
Give it all you've
got, your courage

406
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,607
and determination make me
very proud to have known

407
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,401
you Shuurei.

408
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,986
- Thank you Miss Kocho.

409
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,364
- Come on, don't you
start crying, and remember

410
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,825
no matter what others
say you must never lose

411
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,577
pride in being a woman,

412
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,538
even if you find yourself
on the same stage as men,

413
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,667
don't try to become one, instead
be a woman and do all those

414
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,377
other things that men can't.

415
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,339
And if anyone gives
you a hard time,

416
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,466
be sure to tell me!

417
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,718
If he dares to come to
the Red Light District,

418
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,012
I'll give him a beating he
won't forget before I throw him

419
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,597
out.

420
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,640
- Coming from you I know
that's not supposed to be

421
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,850
a joke.

422
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,811
- Of course it isn't,
I'm being quite serious,

423
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,606
I'm not the only one either,
the same goes for Mr Hong

424
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,982
and Sadon.

425
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,650
You're surrounded by people
who care about you and

426
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,652
want you to succeed.

427
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:59,407
Go forth Shuurei, one day,
you will become a wonderful

428
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,325
woman.

429
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:06,915
(Soft Japanese music)

430
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,973
- Here I go, I'm going to
fight with everything I've got

431
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,894
- [Ryuuki Shi] Am I
making a big mistake?

432
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,397
I was so determined to open
the exams to women that

433
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,023
I didn't really think
about what it could mean

434
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,068
for me personally,
Shuurei said she wants to

435
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,987
become an imperial court
official and I know

436
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,532
she'd fulfill her
duty without question.

437
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,995
Yet I can't help but feel
that it's different from what

438
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,622
I want.

439
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,125
We'd be closer but somehow
I sense there'd be more

440
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,002
distance between us.

441
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,880
- Your majesty, in the end
the circumstances don't

442
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,466
matter at all, no matter
what you might think

443
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,510
it doesn't change how
difficult it is to try and

444
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,512
attract someones
affections towards you,

445
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,598
so what if Shuurei does
become a royal court official?

446
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,726
What difference does
that make? As far as

447
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,770
you're concerned, you
still have to take the same

448
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,773
actions and stay the
same course, don't you?

449
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:20,739
- You're right, you're
absolutely right.

450
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,037
- [Other Examinee] A woman
is taking a national exam?

451
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,913
- [Examinee] There's
a kid here too.

452
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,750
- Everyone's gawking at
us like we're a couple

453
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,418
of rare animals aren't they?

454
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,091
- Has another rare animal
arrived or something?

455
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,429
Wait a minute, don't
tell me that's...

456
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,184
Fioren!

457
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,644
(Flute)

458
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,897
It's been a long time hasn't it?

459
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,191
Oh this is Fioren,
general Ron's brother.

460
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,069
He's also taking the
final exam with us.

461
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,112
Fioren, I'd like you
to meet Eigetsu To

462
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,156
he's a.. we're friends, right?

463
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,032
- Yes

464
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,620
- [Fioren] Any friend of
Shuurei's is a friend of mine.

465
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,080
(gasp)

466
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,124
Eigetsu To, from now on
you're my kindred spirit too.

467
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,920
Look around us! Even the
weather is giving its approval

468
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,546
to our meeting,

469
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,090
the snow is blessing our
friendship and our bright

470
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:23,927
future ahead. So let's go!

471
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,097
Let's march on together,
into the final exam,

472
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,223
and into battle.

473
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,476
(Flute)

474
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,070
(Giggle)

475
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,280
- We definitely
have to pass okay?

476
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,491
- That's right! Definitely

477
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,992
- So let's get going!

478
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,538
By the way, I meant to tell you,

479
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,581
you look really pretty
with your makeup on.

480
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,875
- No way, I know I'm
lousy at applying it.

481
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,545
So there's really no need
to flatter me, Eigetsu.

482
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,048
- [Narrator] The results
of this years national

483
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,093
civil service examination
shocked everyone.

484
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,846
Standing above all other
examinees and impressively

485
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,725
taking first place position,
Eigetsu To, age 13,

486
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,686
was awarded the title of
Jogan, he thus became the

487
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:18,106
youngest person in history
to pass the national exams.

488
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,778
Second place, and the title
of Bogan, were awarded

489
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,532
to Fioren Ron, 18 years old,
and an incredibly gifted

490
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,241
eccentric.

491
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,037
And third place, along
with the title of Tanka

492
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:36,291
was awarded to Shuurei Hong,
age 17, thus the winter

493
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,169
of the third year of the
Jochi era, saw the birth

494
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,256
of Sian Koko's first female
imperial court official.

495
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:52,599
(Soft Japanese outro music)

496
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,878
- [Shuurei] A dream I never
thought would come true

497
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,339
has been realized, I've
taken my first step in

498
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,134
becoming a court official,
I wonder what my first

499
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,802
assignment will be.

500
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,096
What? Clean the toilets?
