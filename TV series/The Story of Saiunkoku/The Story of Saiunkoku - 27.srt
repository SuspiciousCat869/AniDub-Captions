1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,342
(electronic chords)

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,640
(soothing Japanese singing)

3
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,689
(tense music)

4
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,649
- [Voiceover] Sakujun
Sa, the man who had been

5
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,275
controlling the
murderer's blades

6
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,945
from behind the scenes
has disappeared.

7
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,239
Shortly afterwards,
Shuurei encountered

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,324
the mayor of Kinka, Shinsai.

9
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,910
However, almost immediately...

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,454
(harp music)

11
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,878
- [Seiran] Sakujun Sa.

12
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,467
I will not forgive that man.

13
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,886
(tense music)

14
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,893
- So, Sojun has died.

15
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,521
You may take your leave.

16
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,196
Sakujun, to think he has
started to make his move.

17
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,532
I thought he was no more
than a vain hedonist.

18
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,784
I mustn't underestimate him.

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,370
(dark music)

20
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,832
(gasping)

21
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,502
- Is that you, Chushou?

22
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,588
- Elder brother.

23
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,547
(gasping)

24
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,507
The eldest on of the main house.

25
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,676
I thought the two of
you got along well.

26
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,888
(gasping)

27
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,350
- Every last heir of
the main house is dead.

28
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,561
As of now I will be the
head of the Sa clan.

29
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,939
- It's quite
possible that Sakujun

30
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,983
might take after
my elder brother.

31
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,987
The brother who never let
anyone see his other side,

32
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,531
and who, once the
opportunity presented itself,

33
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,534
made a blood bath out of all
the men of the main house.

34
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:27,916
(horse neighing)
(rain falling)

35
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,295
- Until Koren then.

36
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,758
(soft music)

37
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,726
- My lady.

38
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,773
(sighing)

39
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,782
(birds chirping)

40
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,869
(sighing)

41
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,460
- Such beautiful weather.

42
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,344
- [Kourin] Lady Shuurei?

43
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,971
- Oh, sorry, the tea's ready?

44
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,347
Thank you very much.

45
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,601
Kourin, by the way, I'm
really glad your safe.

46
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,687
- That's supposed to be my line.

47
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,605
You were unconscious
for so long.

48
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,482
I'll have you know
that I was so worried

49
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,775
I couldn't even sleep.

50
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,736
- I was only sleeping
because I was exhausted.

51
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,446
Isn't that right, Eigetsu?

52
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,905
- That's right.

53
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,824
You probably didn't rest
much during your long voyage.

54
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,617
So this was just a result of it.

55
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,454
(dinging)

56
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,788
- You get out already,

57
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,498
I can take care of
everything here on my own.

58
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,959
So scram you quack doctor.

59
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,378
(groaning)

60
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,758
- In that case, please
take this medicine

61
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,884
with your tea, Shuurei.

62
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,093
- Thank you.

63
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,846
(growling)

64
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:05,805
What's wrong?

65
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,057
You're being very cold to him.

66
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,768
- But lady Shuurei, he
was just terrible to me.

67
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,562
He collapsed after Lord Ryuuren
made him drink some wine.

68
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,897
So I was trying to
take care of him,

69
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,523
and then suddenly...

70
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,567
- [Eigen] Move it,
out of my way girl.

71
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,985
- And saying that
he pushed me away.

72
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,862
- Well that's because-

73
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,405
- I don't like those
kinds of people,

74
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,907
and that's that.

75
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,950
(soft harp music)

76
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,994
(laughing)

77
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,789
Lady Shuurei, this is
no laughing matter.

78
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,458
- But I haven't seen you so
lively in quite some time.

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,709
It's nice, Kourin.

80
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,088
I guess we have Eigetsu
to thank for that.

81
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,425
Hey, Kourin, please smile again.

82
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,512
The truth is I really
like seeing you smile.

83
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,721
- Lady Shuurei?

84
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,515
- And thank you so much
for all your efforts

85
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,058
in becoming my replacement.

86
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,644
You did it even though
you were in great danger.

87
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,150
(knocking)

88
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,694
- Princess, do
you have a moment?

89
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,028
If you don't mind,
there's someone here

90
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,530
who would like to
speak with you.

91
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,698
- Speak with me?

92
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,867
What is it?

93
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,536
(chuckling)
- Nothing.

94
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,706
I'm just glad to see you're
feeling better today.

95
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,082
- I'm so sorry I worried you.

96
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,542
I'm all right now.

97
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,835
- Good to hear.

98
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,877
Koku, come on it.

99
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,629
- Koku?

100
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,844
- I'm pleased to meet
you, I'm Kokujun Sa.

101
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,761
- You're Kokujun?

102
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,765
That person's younger brother.

103
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,893
They don't look at all alike.

104
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,894
- [Ensei] Princess?

105
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,731
- Oh, I'm sorry.

106
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,650
It's just that even
though you're brothers

107
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,736
you seem like completely
different people.

108
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,654
- That's true I guess.

109
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,615
The oldest, Sojun was
always very hot tempered.

110
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,201
And in the other extreme,
the second son Sakujun

111
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,038
is so beautiful you'd never
guess we were related.

112
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,748
And as I'm sure you can see,

113
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,584
as a third son I'm no
better than a commoner.

114
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,085
- No, I disagree.

115
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,546
If it weren't for your
bravery and support

116
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,881
I probably never would
have been able to see

117
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,924
Eigetsu and Kourin alive again.

118
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,636
Thank you for protecting the
people who mean so much to me.

119
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,721
I'm in your debt.

120
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,683
- I...

121
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,019
I have a small favor
I'd like to ask of you.

122
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,604
- Yes, what is it?

123
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,939
- It's about my elder
brother, Sojun's remains.

124
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,026
Would be all right if I could
see to his burial by myself?

125
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,950
(suspenseful music)

126
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,954
- It's been a while since
your last visit home,

127
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,581
hasn't it, Enjoun?

128
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,501
- The chrysanthemum residence.

129
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,170
- The chrysanthemum emblem out
front has been scratched out.

130
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,756
And the Sa clan crest,
the profusion of peacocks,

131
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,675
has been carved in its place.

132
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,176
- It's Sakujun's doing.

133
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,096
- To think that he's the one

134
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,598
who would dare to erase
the chrysanthemum,

135
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,811
the flower specially bestowed
upon you by the previous king.

136
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,188
- He's finally making
his move, the monster,

137
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,316
who at the age of 15
manipulated the murderous blades

138
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,901
however he pleased.

139
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,198
- Let's see, where
should I be taking this?

140
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,991
To the new Ko
governors, perhaps?

141
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,161
Or maybe to where
Yuushun Tei is waiting?

142
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,539
Or perhaps I should
give it to Eiki?

143
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,092
- [Shosai] I must
say, I'm glad to see

144
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,844
that you're feeling better.

145
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,012
- Wait a minute, you're-

146
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,181
- Let me introduce
myself, I'm Shou Sai.

147
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,934
Head of the merchant's guild
special district of Kinka.

148
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,104
- Sai, than you must be
the son of the mayor.

149
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,981
And you're the leader
of the special district

150
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,649
at such a young age?

151
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,860
- May I point out
that I'm nowhere near
as young as you two.

152
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,154
I'm a little hurt that
you're so surprised.

153
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,197
- I'm sorry, it's
just that I assumed

154
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,908
the other man I met was the
special district leader.

155
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,037
- Nope, this guy
really is the head

156
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,122
of the merchant's
guild of Kinka.

157
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,249
Not only that, but he
has an older twin sister

158
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,001
who's leader of the
provincial branch.

159
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,669
In other words, together,

160
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,130
these two siblings control all
the commerce in Sa province.

161
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,715
- I've heard the
merchant's guild

162
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,134
places great importance
on merit and practicality.

163
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,844
Becoming the leader
at such a young age

164
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,722
shows you must be an
incredibly capable businessman.

165
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,890
- Governor Hong,
the time has come

166
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,892
to fulfill my promise to you.

167
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,393
You have my solemn
word as leader

168
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,896
that the merchants guild
of Kinka will devote 80%

169
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,398
of its strength to
the new governors.

170
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,608
- 80%?

171
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,610
Well, that's a merchant for you.

172
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,236
- It has been a constant
principle of mine

173
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,030
to always keep some
strength in reserve.

174
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,032
In case of emergency.

175
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,993
- Well I certainly don't
dislike that way of thinking.

176
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,621
- Princess is always looking
for ways to save costs.

177
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,957
- Well, then I'm sure
we'll get along just fine.

178
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,335
I'll get in touch
with my elder sister.

179
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,254
We will also provide
you with an ample loan.

180
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,049
Of course, we'll be
claiming due compensation.

181
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,886
- Is that compensation
something we'll be able to pay?

182
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,846
- Our price is that you
help the merchant's guild

183
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,057
better carry out business
in this province.

184
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,810
You can best do that by
bringing order to the land,

185
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,687
driving out the
Sa clan's tyranny

186
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,188
that has become so entrenched,

187
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,773
and governing the
land in a manner

188
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,858
fair to business ventures.

189
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,819
How does that sound,
governor Hong?

190
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,321
- You're extremely
generous to accept payment

191
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,782
long after the fact.

192
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,826
- However, we won't be
giving you any breaks

193
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,077
when we collect.

194
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,662
- I could discuss
this with Eigetsu,

195
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,415
but I'm sure he'd have
the same thoughts as I do.

196
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,791
Ensei?

197
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,959
It appears we're going
to be in serious debt

198
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,252
before we even take office.

199
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,420
Will you help?

200
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,296
- A debt with Shou on your case?

201
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,133
You're gonna have to work
extra hard to pay that one off.

202
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,093
- I look forward to it.

203
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,761
- Then it seems we have a deal.

204
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,180
We'll work out the terms
before leaving for Koren,

205
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,808
if that's acceptable for you.

206
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,893
Governor To is currently
working with my father

207
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,187
getting the disturbances
in town under control.

208
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,772
So we'll begin with just you.

209
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,232
- [Shuurei] Yes.

210
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,776
(soft music)

211
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,365
(sighing)

212
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,909
(soft music)

213
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,892
(string music)

214
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,060
- [Shuurei] Would you
hurry up and go home?

215
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,229
- [Eigetsu] Yes, please
go home Mr. Ryuuren.

216
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,273
- Thank you so much

217
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,942
for bringing the
governor's seal and charm.

218
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,069
Now you can finally
return to your journey.

219
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,320
- Mr. Ryuuren?

220
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,530
Please visit us again

221
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,323
once things have settled
down a little bit.

222
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,827
- But kindred spirit
number one and number two.

223
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,578
- Please, just go home.

224
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,205
We don't want to get
you dragged into this

225
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,207
any further than you
already have been.

226
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:39,926
(sighing)

227
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,512
(flute playing)

228
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,066
- I was staying so I could get
dragged into things further.

229
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,903
There are only two
people in the world,

230
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,823
kindred spirit number
one and number two,

231
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,534
who have the power to take
advantage of Ryuuren Ran.

232
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,247
(flute playing)

233
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,009
- It was the right
thing to do, right?

234
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:21,885
(knocking)

235
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,594
Come in.

236
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,430
- Please excuse me.

237
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,516
I brought some tea for you.

238
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,434
- Thank you.

239
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,940
Say, Kourin, mind if
I ask you something?

240
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:36,649
- Yes?

241
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,652
- I ask only in
an innocent sense.

242
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,948
It's about advisor Enjoun Sa.

243
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,201
What was he to you?

244
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,209
What's that?

245
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,502
- A remembrance of him.

246
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,546
Lord Enjoun was
everything to me.

247
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,093
If it weren't for his sake,
I would have no regrets

248
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,220
even throwing away my own life.

249
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,098
- Is that love though?

250
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,976
- I don't really know.

251
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:12,686
It's just,

252
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,523
I wanted to exist for his sake.

253
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,528
I had no hesitation dirtying
my hands in sin for him.

254
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,074
So maybe the word love
wouldn't really be suitable

255
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,951
to explain the
things that I felt.

256
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,413
I believed that I
was the one person

257
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,456
who cared the most
about Lord Enjoun,

258
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,417
more than anyone
else in the world.

259
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,420
But I was mistaken.

260
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,256
I can't even begin to
compare with his wife.

261
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,465
- Advisor Sa's wife

262
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,467
that much be Lady
Eiki, I assume.

263
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,677
- Yes.

264
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,095
When I compared my
feelings with hers

265
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,055
they seemed to tiny.

266
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,100
When she first welcomed me to
Sa Provence when I returned,

267
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,602
Lady Eiki told me something
I'd always remember.

268
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,106
- Choosing Enjoun to
adore at such a young age

269
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,734
shows you to a great
judgment in character.

270
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,695
The man I chose is the best
man in all the country,

271
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,657
so I can understand all
too well how you must feel.

272
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,993
However, it must have been hard.

273
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,786
While he may have
been the best man

274
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,663
he was always the worst lover

275
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,707
when it came to the
women in his life.

276
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:21,129
- Those were the very first
words that Lady Eiki said to me.

277
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,465
- She's a very strong
woman, isn't she?

278
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,424
- Yes.

279
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,675
I think it was that moment

280
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,510
that I realized deep
down in my heart

281
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,431
that to Lord Enjoun, she was
the most important person.

282
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,099
Even though they
lived far apart,

283
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,602
their commitment to each
other never wavered.

284
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,397
- They loved each other
even though they were apart.

285
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,692
I see, there are many different
forms of love, aren't there?

286
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,323
(soft bell music)

287
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,547
- So I take it this
is your true nature

288
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,174
showing itself at last.

289
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,552
What do you want, Lord Sakujun?

290
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,179
- You've been locked
up in this dungeon

291
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,348
for over half a year.

292
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,851
Tell me, how could you not get
bored in there, Yuushun Tei?

293
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,103
- Are you joking?

294
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,480
I would love to be bored
if that were possible.

295
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,566
Unfortunately, there's just
simply too much work to be done.

296
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,486
If you have no business
here, then please leave.

297
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,071
- You're no fun.

298
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,572
- I'm just very busy right now.

299
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,785
(klinking)

300
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,204
Lord Sakujun, what is that?

301
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,455
- What do you think it is?

302
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,252
Hey, Yuushun, isn't it strange?

303
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,214
It's so mysterious because
this simple hairpin

304
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,716
decorated a certain
woman's hair,

305
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,176
it now has exceptional meaning.

306
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,595
I have never felt
this way before now.

307
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,306
- Love, is it?

308
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,810
- Yes, my first
real infatuation.

309
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,563
Spring has come
late into my life.

310
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,734
I'm already in the 29th year
since my birth into this world.

311
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,652
- I don't care to have you
warding off your boredom

312
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,238
by making advances
toward my dear superior.

313
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,490
I suggest that you think
things over quickly

314
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,743
and return that flower
you have in your hand.

315
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,580
- I truly believe that
I must have been blessed

316
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,750
to meet that noble woman and
hear her beautiful Erhu music.

317
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,128
I could very well go
through my entire life

318
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,671
and never again be
able to find a person

319
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,798
who captures my
attention so thoroughly.

320
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,426
Should ever grow
weary of that music

321
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,803
I feel that I would lose
all reason to go on living,

322
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,513
and simply fade away.

323
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,434
They say the prettier that
flower, the higher the branch.

324
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,562
But I will get that
flower, rest assured.

325
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,731
I'll have her no
matter what it takes.

326
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,318
By the way, grandfather
wishes to make use

327
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,695
of your authority as
acting provincial governor.

328
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,240
He wishes to have you seal
off Koren immediately.

329
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,868
- Would you be so kind
as to tell me why?

330
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,789
The new co-governors have yet
to enter Koren city properly.

331
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,332
- Exactly.

332
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,833
- [Yuushun] And if I refuse?

333
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,670
- I'm guessing some bad
things could happen in Koren.

334
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:09,923
It's all right, Yuushun Tei,

335
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,635
your superiors should still
be able to enter the capital

336
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,513
even after it's been
blockaded, isn't that right?

337
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,515
Until next time.

338
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:22,977
- [Yuushun] Everything
that needs to be done

339
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,688
has already been set in motion.

340
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,607
There's no reason
for fear and doubt.

341
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,859
It's all just a
matter of time now.

342
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:30,777
Lord Sakujun.

343
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,786
- To think that my
oldest brother Sojun

344
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,747
would rest in a place
like this all on his own.

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,918
It's true that I
was afraid of you.

346
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,504
But I never hated
you, big brother.

347
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,507
The Sa clan is making
a grave mistake.

348
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,009
As a member of the family,

349
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,553
I intend to do as much as I
can to set things right again.

350
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,974
I must stop my big
brother Sakujun.

351
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,812
- [Ryuuki] Second son of
the Sa clan and Shuurei?

352
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,980
- [Kouyuu] That's right.

353
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,523
Lord Reishin send
out a personal letter

354
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,775
to confirm matters regarding
that man's proposal.

355
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,569
There should be no
mistake about it.

356
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,112
- Sakujun Sa?

357
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,364
He's the grandson of advisor
Sa's younger brother Chushou,

358
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,824
if I'm not mistaken.

359
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,243
Rumor has it that he's a
completely hedonistic playboy

360
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,995
who spends all of his
time messing around.

361
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,747
- Impressive, Ran clan.

362
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,957
You're pretty well informed
when it comes to good gossip

363
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,625
on the seven clans of Color.

364
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,545
- Well, Lord Reishin has
already taken action, right?

365
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,964
Is this Sakujun even
still alive after that?

366
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,466
- Yeah.

367
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,719
- Wow, then he must be either
clever, stubborn, or both.

368
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,887
- One thing's for sure,

369
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,680
he's not just some
simple hedonist.

370
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,265
Don't underestimate him.

371
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,558
There may be more disturbances,

372
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,268
much like there
were when advisor Sa

373
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,020
took over the main
branch of the clan.

374
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,410
- All right, as soon as we
get all of this work completed

375
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,788
we need to head to Koren
as quickly as possible.

376
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,542
Huh?

377
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,508
It's Ganlu tea,
don't you remember?

378
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,926
I promised to make
lots of it for you

379
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,552
back at the inn in Sakyou.

380
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,596
- My lady.

381
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,931
- Yes?

382
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,850
- Am I a special
person to you, my lady?

383
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,604
And what about that man?

384
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,980
The man who said he loves you.

385
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,941
Please tell me.

386
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,442
What is he to you?

387
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,951
- That man was like Ryuuki.

388
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,619
- They're not alike.

389
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,830
- You're wrong, they're
very similar in some ways.

390
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,375
They're both adults who
act like they're children.

391
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,837
Yet they're complete opposites.

392
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:54,796
That's why...

393
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:56,715
- That's why?

394
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,050
- I guess that it's just that

395
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,969
he leaves a long
lasting impression, huh?

396
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,887
- You haven't once called
him by his real name,

397
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,014
have you my lady?

398
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,975
Is it that you don't
want to acknowledge it?

399
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,769
The fact that he's actually
a member of the Sa clan?

400
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,771
- No, it's not
anything like that.

401
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,816
- It's very unusual for
you to lie to me, my lady.

402
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:15,817
- Seiran.

403
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,028
- That man is too dangerous.

404
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,071
There's nothing in him
but eternal darkness.

405
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,115
Please, don't get
dragged into that.

406
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:25,577
And don't let yourself
be deceived by him.

407
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,121
He may say things like he
loves you more than anyone,

408
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,040
but those words are lies.

409
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,836
You haven't tied your hair back.

410
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,629
Did that man say
something to you?

411
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,674
- Aha, just as I thought.

412
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,718
You look much nicer
with your hair down.

413
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,013
- One day you will fall in love.

414
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,311
I know that,

415
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,605
it's something I've been
aware of for a long time now.

416
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,109
- Seiran.

417
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,529
- But if he's the
one you fall for,

418
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:04,115
you should know that I would
be a much better choice.

419
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,744
Understand, my lady, I
want you to be happy.

420
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,038
I remain by your side
for that purpose alone.

421
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,093
That's why I won't forgive him.

422
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,891
(soft music)

423
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,494
(tense drumming)

424
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,790
You bastard.

425
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,126
You have the guts to
pick a fight with me.

426
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,044
I'll admit you have
some courage to do so

427
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,005
after knowing that
I am prince Seiran.

428
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,007
Sakujun Sa.

429
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,885
(soft music)

430
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,958
- [Sakujun] And as for you,

431
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,127
come to the provincial
capital of Koren.

432
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,545
I'll be waiting for you.

433
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,264
(soft Japanese singing)

434
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,129
- [Shuurei] We need
to hurry to Koren.

435
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,630
We also have to find and free

436
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:09,092
lieutenant governor Yuushun
Tei, who's being held captive.

437
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,343
Who are you?

438
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,302
What?

439
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,221
You're Junyu, from Koren?
