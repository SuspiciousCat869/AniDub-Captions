1
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,939
- Shurei Hong. The first
woman in Son Goku to pass

2
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,774
the national examinations,

3
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,734
and thirteen year old Egitsuto

4
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,404
the youngest candidate
in history to pass

5
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,406
had both been struggling
with harsh treatment

6
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,449
and harassment in the
course of their training

7
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,575
as new officials.

8
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,204
(sighs)

9
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,831
However, it is often said that

10
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,417
there are no demons
in this world.

11
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,669
Even in such hardship,
there are still people

12
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,337
around them who care for them

13
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,880
and watch over
them protectively.

14
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,901
- What're you doing here again?

15
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,449
- Uh- I promised I would
guard you two didn't I?

16
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,450
- Who do you think you are

17
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,035
running around like a soldier?

18
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,578
If we need a guard
what's wrong with getting

19
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,954
Satan to do it?

20
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,330
- Uh he can't.

21
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,832
- Why not?

22
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,293
- Because I'm afraid that
Satan is just a grainery guard

23
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,878
his rank doesn't
qualify him to serve

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,962
as a body guard.

25
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,883
While I'm sure he
worries a lot about you,

26
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,260
there are still things
he can and cannot do.

27
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,639
- But still why should
you have to do it?

28
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,309
- This is the most dangerous
time for the two of you

29
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,520
you have no rank or status
and basically no support.

30
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,022
If you were to
disappear suddenly

31
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,899
nobody would bother
to look into it.

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,817
- Are you suggesting
our lives are in danger?

33
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,362
- In the worst case
scenario, yes they are.

34
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,405
There are many people
all over the place

35
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,491
who would not hesitate to
take another person's life

36
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,034
simply because they
didn't like them.

37
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,703
There was strong opposition
to admitting female officials

38
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,788
right from the very beginning

39
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,374
and that hasn't
changed much. Even now.

40
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,418
- Yes but nevermind me,
what about Egetsuto?

41
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,504
- He's rejected every marriage
proposal offered to him

42
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,422
by the noble families.

43
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,383
Some people who care
greatly about rank

44
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,718
are angry that a new
official dare reject them.

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,761
(gasps)

46
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,346
But there's no need to worry

47
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:45,600
as your personal guard I
will diligently protect you.

48
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,644
- It's a little less
convincing coming from

49
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,312
someone with rice on his face.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,066
(peaceful music)

51
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,911
- Although it's a regular
occurrence this time of year

52
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,789
I can't help but be amazed
with this pile-up of yours.

53
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,874
- Hm. Honestly do
those guys really think

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,626
that sending me bribes
is gonna make me think

55
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,794
favorably of them?

56
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,129
- They just don't
have the guts to wait

57
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,923
for a legitimate outcome.
It's to be expected.

58
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,426
People believe that you
and Senior Secretary Hong

59
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,554
have the final word
on promotions and
demotions after all.

60
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,347
- Wish they'd use
material goods.

61
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,682
Whether I end up selling them

62
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,100
or using them as
proof of bribery

63
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,893
at least they're of use to me.

64
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,479
- Aha! I take it then
that you've been receiving

65
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,440
batches of marriage
proposals again.

66
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,401
- Good lord! How many time do
I have to tell these people

67
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,861
that I hate women!

68
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,113
Besides, it's ridiculous to
think a marriage proposal

69
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,033
is gonna guarantee anyone a
promotion in the first place!

70
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,369
- He's offering this girls?

71
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,163
- Yeah. It's
interesting isn't it?

72
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,956
- Yes, certainly interesting.

73
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,458
But to think he'd
still offer you

74
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,834
his daughter's hand in marriage

75
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,586
after you and the Senior
Secretary of Civil Affairs

76
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,838
put him through that
horrible experience!

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,131
That man continues to show us

78
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,591
just how thick-skinned he is.

79
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,508
- Uh huh.

80
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,973
(footsteps)

81
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,061
- Hmm.

82
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,649
(grunting)

83
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,692
- Watch out sir!

84
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,653
(painful grunting)

85
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,575
(gasps)

86
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,876
- That incident was
a very scary reminder

87
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,045
of why you'd never
want to become a target

88
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,713
of Rayshi Hong.

89
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,840
But I must admit that
man must have guts

90
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,550
to still wear a
wig even now as if

91
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,843
nothing had ever happened.

92
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,221
- Uh so look. Is there
something you wanted

93
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,514
to talk to me about?

94
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,557
- Oh yes I forgot.

95
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,975
I received a letter from Ensei

96
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,061
saying that he's
left Za Province.

97
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,522
He should arrive in about
one and a half months.

98
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,608
And one more thing, that
girl Kodi was with him.

99
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,735
- Kodi's coming here?

100
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,529
- It seems she wants
to report events

101
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,197
within the Za clan personally.

102
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,033
I also gather that she
wants to see Shurei, so.

103
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,992
- Hm.

104
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,661
- What do we do about Shurei?

105
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,663
She was never told
the real reason why

106
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,208
Kodi had to leave
for Za province.

107
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,461
That in her efforts
to help Advisor Sa

108
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,964
she poisoned Shurei and
attempted to take her life.

109
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,470
- What reason is there
to hesitate anyway?

110
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,598
The circumstances have changed.

111
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,684
She's an official
now, not a consort

112
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,227
she can't be protected.

113
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,771
This is something she
has to come to accept.

114
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,691
- Yes, my thoughts exactly.

115
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,151
- Hm.

116
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,112
- Well I'll be going
then. I have a lot to do

117
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,531
and I'm very busy
with other matters.

118
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,241
- Other matters?

119
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,242
- Yup.

120
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,994
(laughs)

121
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,829
(wolf howling)

122
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,789
- (grunts) There's
no end to this.

123
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,624
- No not that I can see.

124
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,251
- These go to the
department of public works,

125
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,878
those to the
department of justice,

126
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,629
these to the
department of protocol,

127
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,173
and um-

128
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,799
- Last year's budget balance
for the department of protocol

129
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,593
is let's see-

130
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,553
first of all the
breakdown of the salaries

131
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,554
for the top marshal-

132
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,182
- Working hard?
- Ugh not again.

133
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,893
- Simply admirable.

134
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,811
That gives you a mind
to take care of these.

135
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,272
Well then, I'm certain to you

136
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,609
this work is as easy
as child's play.

137
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,154
(books falling)

138
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,115
I myself have been
frightfully busy as you know.

139
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,867
Have it finished today!

140
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,078
(laughing)

141
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,750
- Would it not be wise
to get rid of this man?

142
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,794
(gasps)

143
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,213
Yes it would not be wise.

144
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,174
- Ugh that bastard!

145
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,176
He always gets the
floor dirty on purpose

146
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,136
as soon as I'm done
cleaning the toilets.

147
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,763
What's with his ego anyway?

148
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,181
I overheard in the
toilets that he had

149
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,225
to pull strings to
get his position!

150
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,852
- Official Wa from the
department of protocol right?

151
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,104
He comes by to get
his shoes polished

152
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,314
as well and usually
after he's gone

153
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,649
through the trouble
of deliberately

154
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,818
making them really dirty.

155
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,319
- Will your calculations
be all right?

156
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,738
You're dealing with some
really large numbers.

157
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,782
- It's fine. I still
remember the figures

158
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,826
I just calculated.
But what about you?

159
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,120
You're the one who has to
sort those files again.

160
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,873
- Hm. Human beings are creatures
that learn from experience.

161
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,917
I made a point to
mark all the documents

162
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,085
that I'd already sorted.

163
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,255
(laughter)

164
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,715
- [Man Offscreen]
Hello there you two.

165
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,216
Is everything all right?

166
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,343
Why don't I make you some tea?

167
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,680
- No you stay back father.
If we drink that tea

168
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,890
you make we'll lose every
drop of energy we have left

169
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,600
before dying horribly.

170
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,810
- That's mean of you.

171
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,228
- By the way, what're
you still doing here

172
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,730
this late at night?

173
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,982
Poor Seidon must be
sitting all alone at home.

174
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,819
- Oh, well you see, I
still have some work to do

175
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,905
around the archives. I
couldn't go home anyway.

176
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,407
Hahahahaha.

177
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,283
Hm.

178
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,921
(gasps)

179
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,928
- All right I'm gonna go
deliver these documents.

180
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,139
- Okay, see you later Shurei.

181
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,351
- Huh?

182
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,817
- They left something
for us again?

183
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,905
- Yeah. It smells like
today its uji tea.

184
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,448
- That tea's supposed
to be good for relieving

185
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,866
fatigue isn't it?

186
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,242
I don't know who's
doing this for us

187
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,036
but it's certainly nice
to have it every day.

188
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,454
- Mhm.

189
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,998
I'll be sure to have
some when I get back.

190
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,458
You go ahead and help yourself!

191
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,334
- Thanks!

192
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,092
- Department of protocol next.

193
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,886
(panting)

194
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,680
(gasps)

195
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,307
- Ah hit! Look I got her!

196
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,142
(laughter)

197
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,686
Honestly it's such an eye sore

198
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,146
to have a woman running
around, don't ya think?

199
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,816
- Now they've sunk to the
level of school yard bullying.

200
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,776
Are they stupid or something?!

201
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,694
Ah!

202
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,990
(splat)
(gasps)

203
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,993
(nervous babbling)

204
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,080
- It seems a strange
game has become popular

205
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,457
with the department of
protocol Secretary Sei.

206
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,836
- What? What on
earth are you doing?

207
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,338
Just what is going on here?!

208
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,382
- Please excuse us,
it was official Roe.

209
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,467
- Well what about him?

210
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,052
- This is all
because I've failed

211
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,388
to supervise them adequately!

212
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,934
- Oh unless I missed my guess
isn't that official Roe now?

213
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,062
(nervous stammering)

214
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,190
- What are you doing just
sitting there initiate Hong?

215
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,109
Could it be you have
enough free time

216
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,944
to be taking a break
in a place like this?

217
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,112
- No, that's not-

218
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,031
- Since you seem to have
an abundance of time

219
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,867
to spare I'm putting you in
charge of cleaning this area.

220
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,076
- But-

221
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,369
- You have some
objections to that?

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,419
- From here on out
you're on your own Sudei.

223
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,130
Don't expect any help
from Shuei or myself.

224
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,887
(dramatic music)

225
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,975
(sighs)

226
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,269
(footsteps)

227
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,522
- Seidon.

228
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,235
- My lady-
- No go away.

229
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,404
When it comes down to
it I can't rely on help

230
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,032
from anybody else. Not from you

231
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,408
and not even from father.

232
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,994
This was my decision after all.

233
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,246
I took this path out
of my own desire.

234
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,917
No matter what happens I
can't rely on anyone else.

235
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,379
Besides, I'm really
happy ya know?

236
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,922
I've been able to
realize a dream

237
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,091
I never thought would come true.

238
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,010
Until now I've always burdened
you with my complaints

239
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,846
and cried on your shoulder,
but I won't this time.

240
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,140
I can't let you spoil
me like that Seidon.

241
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,183
Not now.

242
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,023
Please go while I've
got my eyes closed.

243
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,194
- If you ever start feeling
you can't take anymore of this

244
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:20,490
please come to me. Not
for your sake, my lady,

245
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,408
but for mine.

246
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,412
(grunting)

247
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,163
- You can't go over
there your majesty

248
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,581
if she can't get
through this on her own

249
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,208
no one will ever
acknowledge her.

250
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,127
She didn't even
accept Seidon's help

251
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,129
if the king protects
her, all of her efforts

252
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,964
up until now will go to waste!

253
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,594
- Do you think
Shudei will be able

254
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,179
to become a good official?

255
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,265
- If she can keep at
the way she is now

256
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,474
it's quite likely.

257
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,935
- You're right.
Shudei's an official

258
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,311
but she's still Shudei.

259
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,856
Right now my greatest wish
is to have that Shudei

260
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,107
by my side.

261
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,568
Do you think that
dream is possible?

262
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,195
- Well that really
depends on her doesn't it?

263
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,406
If she can become an official
with everyone's approval,

264
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,241
maybe it will be.

265
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,617
- That's gonna take awhile.

266
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,662
- That will depend
on both her and you.

267
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,956
- Will I be able
to wait that long?

268
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,500
- Good question. But
considering that you not only

269
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,211
respected Shudei's feelings
about the national exam,

270
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,506
but also waited an entire
year without making a move?

271
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,383
I'd say it's very possible.

272
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,434
(peaceful flute playing)

273
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,278
- [Group] Hm?

274
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,698
- Shudei Hon reporting for duty.

275
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,576
- Good morning. Egitzuto
here reporting for duty.

276
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,704
- May I presume you finished
all of your assignment?

277
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,122
- Yes sir.

278
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,248
- We finished all of it.

279
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,126
(scattered gasps)

280
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,463
- Pardon me Official Roe.

281
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,382
Since they've worked all night
for several days straight

282
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,634
these two are
extremely exhausted.

283
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,594
I believe you should allow
them to get some rest

284
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,429
in another room for awhile.

285
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,181
- In that case Initiate Hakume,

286
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,724
perhaps you would
like to take up

287
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,269
cleaning toilets and polishing
shoes in their place.

288
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,438
- Fine then, I will.

289
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,273
But first I would
like to take these two

290
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,025
to their sleeping
quarters to rest.

291
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,110
Please excuse me.

292
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,238
- Ah, Um.

293
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,991
(scattered gasps)

294
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,329
Uh, thank you for this.

295
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,373
- Yes, thank you
very much Hakume.

296
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,250
- Don't misunderstand.

297
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,127
I'm only doing this because
if you were to collapse

298
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,586
from exhaustion,
you'd cause trouble

299
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,754
for the rest of us.

300
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,132
Use this time well.
Get some sleep.

301
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:45,301
(door closes)

302
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,512
(giggles)

303
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,810
- Hah! Female
officials what a joke.

304
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,770
Women should focus
on serving men,

305
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,356
pleasuring them and staying
at home behaving themselves.

306
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,067
Like you my dear, who does
this girl think she is

307
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,694
being a smart ass and
trying to get involved

308
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,363
in government affairs? Honestly!

309
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:10,201
- You're so smart.
Oh, by the way my lord

310
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,661
that little box you have there,

311
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,788
does it contain what
you lost the other day?

312
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,124
- No, that's still
hasn't been found.

313
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:20,086
- My, but it was
such a valuable ring.

314
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,339
- I had several copies
made in case the real one

315
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,174
never shows up again.

316
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,718
I think this one is the
closest to the original.

317
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,638
- You certainly seem very
attached to it, don't you?

318
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,142
- This is the goose that
will lay golden eggs for me.

319
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,519
If I can convince them
that this is the real thing

320
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,689
I'll be promoted and have
lots of money coming in.

321
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,524
I know, if everything works out

322
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,526
this could give
me the opportunity

323
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,696
to finally get rid of that
annoying female official

324
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,824
and that little girl
sponsoress, Wei Shi Hong.

325
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,202
It could work out
perfectly if I use this

326
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,079
to bring about his downfall.

327
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,164
The chance I've been
waiting for for so long

328
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,875
is within my grasp! Kotcho,

329
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,419
I may need to ask
you for some help!

330
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,839
- Ooo, whatever
you wish my lord.

331
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,719
- This isn't the same one
as Advisor Sah had is it?

332
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,681
- No, this is likely one of the
several copies that man made

333
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,433
in order to replace the
real one that was lost.

334
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,103
Apparently one of his
subordinates needed the money

335
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,604
and sold it on the black market.

336
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,565
- One question: do we know
whether or not the ring

337
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,442
that idiot found then lost again

338
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,236
is really the one
signifying leadership

339
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,445
of the Sah family?

340
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,739
- Hmm. After Advisor Sah's death

341
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,324
we searched for it
for a whole year

342
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,327
with no success, why has
it suddenly turned up now?

343
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,912
The timing is way
too convenient.

344
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,581
- These events certainly
are unsettling.

345
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:42,919
It's almost as if another
power is at work here.

346
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,462
- What do you want to do?

347
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,589
Should we resume our
search for the real ring?

348
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,717
- Yes I think so.

349
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,760
Continue searching just in case.

350
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,638
- What about the matter of
the department of protocol?

351
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,391
We have enough evidence
to make an arrest.

352
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,851
- We'll wait a little longer.

353
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,811
This is a very critical period.

354
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,234
- Excuse me! I'm Sudei Hong.

355
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,820
I'm here to deliver some
documents as requested.

356
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,787
- I have to admit,
she works really hard

357
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,663
for a woman doesn't she?

358
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:19,622
- Uh huh.

359
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,915
- I heard some of the new people

360
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,667
have been sending
bribes to Official Roe

361
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,169
to have their workload reduced.

362
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,629
In comparison she's
really got guts.

363
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,965
- She's full of energy
and always smiling!

364
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,802
Having a female official
around might be nice after all.

365
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,638
(Peaceful music)

366
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,728
- Hm. For some reason
this isn't quite right.

367
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,646
- Funny you should mention it,

368
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,316
I also found something that
looks a bit out of place.

369
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,318
Would you mind taking
a quick look at it?

370
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,862
- Sure. And would you mind
taking a look at mine too?

371
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,618
Its- the same department?

372
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,496
- Both involve the
department of protocol.

373
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,831
- Hey, why don't we make
this a joint project

374
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,667
for that report we have to do?

375
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,002
- Yeah! That sounds
like a really good idea!

376
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,296
Official Roe did say
we could write about

377
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,673
whatever we want!

378
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,591
All right lets see if we
can put something together

379
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,009
when we finish our
work for the night.

380
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,552
- Don't tell me you're
planning on doing

381
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,763
something else after
finishing all this work?

382
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,851
- Okume hello. Have you
come to help us again today?

383
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,687
- I'm not doing
this for you two.

384
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,647
Like I said before,
if you collapse

385
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,565
it's just going to cause
trouble for everyone.

386
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,567
(giggles)

387
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,486
- Ya know, we're really thankful

388
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,530
that you've been helping
us with our work.

389
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,365
But are you sure it's okay?

390
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,867
I heard that Official Roe
has his eye on you now

391
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,245
and has increased
your workload a lot.

392
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,374
- Forget it. That amount
of work is nothing.

393
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,042
Listen up you two!

394
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,877
My role model is
Lord Koy Lu Lei,

395
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,879
secretary of civil affairs,

396
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,464
aid to the King at
a very young age,

397
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,633
a testament to the
human mind's potential,

398
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,468
he could become the youngest
Prime Minister ever.

399
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,388
He's cool, composed,
incredibly intelligent,

400
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,016
sharp, and decisive!
Truly an iron wall

401
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,475
of perfect reasoning.

402
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,477
- All though he tends
to get lost easily.

403
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,563
- All though he often
loses his temper.

404
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,523
- He is so worthy of my respect,

405
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,525
I'd be happy to get
even one step closer

406
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,818
to being like Lord
Koy Lu, in fact,

407
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,903
it wouldn't be an
exaggeration to say

408
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,697
I want to become Lord Koy Lu.

409
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,869
- Uh, Sei. Is it true
about you postponing

410
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,329
your national exams for one year

411
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,664
out of respect for Lord Koy Lu

412
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,000
earning the jo gan
title at sixteen?

413
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,960
- If it's true, what's
wrong with that?

414
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,421
But then, after waiting
until I became seventeen

415
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:32,922
to take the national exams some

416
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,383
easy-going little animal
of a thirteen year old

417
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,844
comes along and grabs
the jo gan title anyway.

418
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,388
Some weirdo from the
Ran family takes jo gan

419
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,766
and tanka was taken
by a little girl,

420
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,517
leaving me in fourth place.

421
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,394
Something's very wrong
with this picture.

422
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,562
You and your friend over there

423
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,397
have totally
screwed up my plans.

424
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,692
But from now on, I won't let
either of you ruin my dreams.

425
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,110
I'm going down the
road to success

426
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,821
purely on my own
ability. Heheheheh.

427
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,742
I realized that's the path
Lord Koy Lu had to take.

428
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,410
To find myself in
the same situation

429
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,079
can only be explained by fate.

430
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,623
There's no way I'm
ever going to give in!

431
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,417
Just wait, in a few years
I'll have risen above

432
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,127
Official Roe. I'll be
looking down on him

433
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,631
and ordering him
around. Hahahahahahahah.

434
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,466
Anyway, you two
get back to work.

435
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,009
Tomorrow's the one day
off we get this week.

436
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,969
If you don't finish you'll
end up having to work

437
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:20,970
on your day off again.

438
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,430
- Yes.
- Right.

439
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,640
Lets get back to it.

440
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,894
(Birds chirping)

441
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,148
- Oh, good morning father.

442
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,067
- Good morning to you Mr.Shoka.

443
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,111
- Good morning! I
wasn't going to wake you

444
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,071
you can sleep in
longer if you want.

445
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,739
Today is your day off isn't it?

446
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,033
- Thanks, but I can't
sleep the whole day away.

447
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,454
- Oh that's right I forgot.
A letter arrived for you.

448
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,498
There's also one for you Agutsu.

449
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,001
- Somebody sent me a letter?

450
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,669
- I would imagine it's
a response to that

451
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,671
letter you sent home
a little while ago.

452
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:55,505
- Oh!

453
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,017
(gasps)

454
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,144
- What? It's about
the money that I sent.

455
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,105
The courier from the department
of protocol hasn't arrived.

456
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,732
How can that be?

457
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,691
- Hey Agutsu.

458
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,775
- Yeah?

459
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,152
- Lets go out this afternoon.

460
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,488
Ms.Kotchos just invited
us to pay her a visit!

461
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,741
We'll be on our way.

462
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,742
- Have a good time.

463
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,705
(footsteps walking away)

464
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,915
Good of you to come,
I've been wondering

465
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,876
when and if you would.

466
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,878
- I never thought the estate
of a Hong family descendant

467
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,630
would be in such a
run down condition.

468
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,549
Without even a
guard at the gate.

469
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,009
- Long time no see Kudo.

470
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,766
- Yes it's been
awhile big brother.

471
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,979
- Have you heard? Apparently
there was improper conduct

472
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,898
involved in the national exams.

473
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,483
- Yes I heard that
rumor as well,

474
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,901
everyone's talking about it.

475
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,194
- Something about Ray Shin Hong

476
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,695
from the department
of civil affairs

477
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,489
manipulating things
from behind the scenes

478
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,698
in order to let that
woman pass the exam.

479
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,700
- Who would think
the Senior Secretary

480
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,534
would do such a thing?

481
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,580
- Quite a difference
don't you think?

482
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,082
Shurei has only
been absent a day

483
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,583
and already the
entire atmosphere

484
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,585
around the palace has changed.

485
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:19,130
- Yes. A strange rumor
has been going around.

486
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,759
It's as though someone has been
spreading it intentionally.

487
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,095
- It seems we're about to
have some uninvited guests.

488
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,764
I leave it to you to do
what must be done now.

489
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:28,932
- Yes.

490
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,604
- Oh. Secretary Han!

491
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,106
You are under arrest
due to suspicion

492
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,109
of improper conduct in
regards to the national exam!

493
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,696
- I certainly expected problems
but not something like this.

494
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,531
So it's confinement is it?

495
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,825
Very well, take me
away if you must.

496
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,035
I'll allow you to
take me into custody

497
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,621
but just so we're clear
don't blame me for what

498
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,790
might happen to you
silly boys as a result.

499
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,252
- Trying to tarnish
everything that girl

500
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,712
worked so desperately to achieve

501
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,716
purely out of selfish
greed. You bastard!

502
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,719
(suspenseful music)

503
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,107
- Hello Ms.Kocho!

504
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:23,278
- Uh thank you for coming. Its
been quite awhile hasn't it?

505
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,072
I haven't seen you since you
passed the national exams.

506
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:35,290
(evil laughter)

507
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,291
- Ms.Kocho?

508
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,961
(evil laughter)
