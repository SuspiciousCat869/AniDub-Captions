1
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,558
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

2
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,814
- [Narrator] On the
day of the new moon,

3
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,607
in the dark of night,

4
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,526
the selection ceremony
for the new head

5
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,445
of the Sa clan was concluded.

6
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,198
Once Kokujun had been
named head of the family,

7
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,575
the principal members of
the clan were arrested.

8
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,661
In the meantime,

9
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,205
Sakujun lost his final
gamble with Shuurei

10
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,623
and despite her best efforts,

11
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,834
his life was fading away.

12
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,962
(gentle flute music)

13
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,298
(crickets chirping)

14
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,510
- I didn't find anyone nearby.

15
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,804
Look Shuurei, I understand
that you must be worried

16
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,224
about Mr. Sakujun, but
there are other things

17
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,642
that we have to do right now.

18
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,979
Shuurei!

19
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,606
- (sighs)

20
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,652
- You and I are the governors
of Sa province, right?

21
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,570
- Eigetsu.

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,872
Let's go.

23
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,874
We'll go and save Mr. Yuushun

24
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,460
and put a stop to
this once and for all.

25
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,758
(chariot wheels rattling)

26
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,887
(melancholy music)

27
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,013
- Shuurei, look!

28
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,641
- (gasps)

29
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,355
Mr Yuushun!

30
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,941
(people yelling and crying)

31
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,446
(fire roaring)

32
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,577
(Shuurei and Eigetsu panting)

33
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,372
- Right on time,
just as I'd expect.

34
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,957
- Ensei, we're going in to
save lieutenant governor Tei.

35
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,584
- We'll have to be careful.

36
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,878
Sa clan soldiers probably
have the prison surrounded.

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,339
- Mr. Shou Sai, we'll
need the help of soldiers

38
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,965
from the merchants' guild.

39
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,385
What are you waiting
for, Ensei, hurry up!

40
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,762
- Princess, Eigetsu, now
just hold on for a minute.

41
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:41,971
- We can't wait!
- We can't wait!

42
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,598
- If we don't get in
there and save him,

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,100
lieutenant governor Tei will--

44
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,477
- [Yuu] It won't be
necessary to save anyone.

45
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,690
- Official Yuu!

46
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,817
What do you mean, it won't
be necessary to save anyone?

47
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,110
He's in danger!

48
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,529
- Yuushun Tei is already
safe and out of prison.

49
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,030
As a matter of fact,
he's on his way

50
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,116
to Korin castle right now.

51
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,077
- Then Lieutenant
Governor Tei is all right?

52
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,704
But where is he now?

53
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,621
- Right here.

54
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,583
He's standing right in
front of you, princess.

55
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,501
- Then you mean...

56
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,803
(dramatic music)

57
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,558
(flame whooshes)

58
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:29,686
- Yosei Sho.

59
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,398
You were the one who
killed Enjun, weren't you?

60
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,525
- That's right.

61
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,820
Would it be easier for you
to hit me in this form?

62
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,780
- I would rather hit
you as an old man.

63
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,866
That way there's a
better chance you'll die.

64
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,993
- You've always been a
very scary woman, Eiki.

65
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,579
(hand slapping)

66
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,956
- I always knew. (sighs)

67
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,378
I knew that Enjun would
eventually be killed by you.

68
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,964
I knew it from the start.

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,469
That's why I've always
hated you with all my heart!

70
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,472
You were the only one that my
husband would ever focus on!

71
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,183
(whimpers) He was so
busy chasing after you

72
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,935
that he only stopped to look
back at me occasionally.

73
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,396
But in the end I didn't mind.

74
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,066
It was enough for me just
to love him and be his wife.

75
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,527
- Eiki.

76
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,989
- However, that doesn't
mean my heart is kind enough

77
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,408
to forgive you for your
miserable existence.

78
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,410
You were always interfering
in my relationship

79
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,412
with Enjun, even
to the very end!

80
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,792
But there was something he once
said to me a long time ago.

81
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,714
- [Enjun] I feel like
the manner of my death

82
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,091
has already been decided.

83
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,969
- Enjun. (gasps)

84
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,971
- When the time comes,
I want you to promise

85
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,559
not to cry for me because I
know I'll pass away satisfied.

86
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,855
- (whimpers)

87
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,817
(melancholy music)

88
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,612
- Did Enjun, did he
at least die happy?

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,120
- He lived as he wanted
until his last moment.

90
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,830
- [Eiki] Is that so?

91
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,040
Did he say anything
about me before he died?

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,045
That's why he was
always the worst lover.

93
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,757
- Even so, I know
Enjun loved you

94
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,759
more than anything
else in the world.

95
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,136
- I knew that
already, I don't need

96
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,595
someone like you to tell me!

97
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,514
He was simply that kind of man

98
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,558
and that's the reason
I loved him so much!

99
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,059
I have no regrets.

100
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,564
- Live a long and
peaceful life, Eiki.

101
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,025
When I get home, I'll send you
some wrinkle-removing cream.

102
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,152
People in the Capitol
say it's very effective.

103
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,403
(fan whirring)
Ugh!

104
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,904
- Get out of my house,
don't you ever let me

105
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,114
see your face again!

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,492
- There's something
I forgot to tell you.

107
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,287
Just so you know, Kokujun
didn't kill anyone.

108
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,205
But then, you knew
that didn't you?

109
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,507
(crickets chirping)

110
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,677
- [Tei] It'll be daybreak soon.

111
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,641
- I still can't believe it.

112
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,019
Official Yuu was actually
Lieutenant Governor Tei

113
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,020
all this time?

114
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:17,937
- Huh?

115
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,901
Well, as they say,
to fool your enemies,

116
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,653
start by fooling your
friends! (laughs)

117
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,739
- [Tei] I'm truly sorry
for deceiving you.

118
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,994
- [Eigetsu] But how exactly
were you able to escape

119
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,329
from that prison tower?

120
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,998
- To be honest, I
don't even know myself.

121
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,168
You see, I had entrusted the
task to master Naan, but--

122
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,836
- Master Naan?

123
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,797
- He's Ensei's
mentor, you could say.

124
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,552
All I remember was that I was
suddenly struck from behind.

125
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,681
(fist thumping)

126
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,641
- You mean he punched you out?

127
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,851
- My master's always
been enthusiastic.

128
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,355
- I was knocked unconscious
and when I came to,

129
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,565
I found myself
abandoned in Kinka.

130
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,567
- He left you there?

131
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,569
- Hey, my teacher's
a generous guy.

132
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,738
- That's not what
the problem is.

133
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,699
- I was surprised too.

134
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,117
I woke up feeling really cold.

135
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,995
That was how I realized
I was in Kinka. (laughs)

136
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,708
(Eigetsu and Shuurei
chuckling nervously)

137
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,917
- Lieutenant governor
Tei, were you the one

138
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,128
who dispatched the
provincial guards?

139
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,255
- [Tei] Yes, I
imagined that by now

140
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,340
the people who accepted
Chuushuo Sa's orders

141
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,259
and attempted to set
fire to the city of Korin

142
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,302
had been found and arrested.

143
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,054
Of course, I had
the two bald eagles

144
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,848
of Sa province helping as well.

145
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,767
- Huh?

146
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,146
- With the head of
the Sa clan decided,

147
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,107
the two provincial governors
safely inside Korin castle,

148
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,985
and the town no longer in
danger of going up in flames,

149
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,070
we can welcome this
morning in peace.

150
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,033
All is right with
the world, indeed.

151
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,325
- [Men] Heave ho!

152
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,326
(building creaking)

153
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,120
- Heave, that's right!

154
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,250
(building crashing)

155
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,295
(gentle flute music)

156
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,089
- Chuushuo's trap has
crumbled and fallen at last.

157
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,259
The long darkness has
finally come to an end.

158
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,266
- A new day is about to begin.

159
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,644
(gentle guitar music)

160
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,360
(footsteps tapping)

161
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,201
- I suppose my punishment
has been decided.

162
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,995
Governor Hong and
governor To, I promise

163
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,081
in order to atone for
the countless wrongdoings

164
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,376
committed by my clan, I shall
humbly accept any punishment.

165
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,340
(water trickling)

166
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,968
Is it okay for me to be
walking around free like this?

167
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,140
- We've decided not to
charge you with any crime.

168
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,309
- But considering everything
the Sa clan has done

169
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,228
up until now, it wouldn't
be out of the question

170
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,479
for you to have me beheaded!

171
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,231
- Executing you would
accomplish nothing.

172
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,358
It wouldn't change
the past at all.

173
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,735
- Rebuilding the Sa clan
is what you should be

174
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,404
focusing on now, Mr. Kokujun.

175
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,782
- Lord Kokujun.

176
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,704
- [Shuurei] I know
you'll do your best.

177
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,997
Hand-in-hand with Shunki.

178
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,875
(uplifting music)

179
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,350
(birds chirping)

180
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,106
- [Shunki] Grandmother?

181
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,071
- I realize you must
all be busy dealing

182
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,449
with everything the
Sa clan has done.

183
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,160
Please forgive me for asking
you to come all this way.

184
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,369
It won't take long.

185
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,582
- What is it you
wanted to tell us?

186
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,335
- It's time I finally
tell you the truth.

187
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,171
The whole truth of
what really happened.

188
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,255
- What do you mean?

189
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,092
- It's important to those
who will lead the Sa clan

190
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,053
and those who will
guide Sa province.

191
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,096
Kokujun.

192
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,514
- Yes?

193
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,975
- [Eiki] Chuushou Sa and
your father are both dead.

194
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,271
- I know.

195
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,148
- You should also know
you didn't kill them.

196
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,526
I can already tell
from looking at you.

197
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,111
You haven't killed anyone.

198
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,280
It had all been planned
by someone else.

199
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,366
By Sakujun.

200
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,576
- (gasps)

201
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,040
- During that time, in the
cellar under the shrine,

202
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,333
incense was burning.

203
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,378
It was Sakujun's incense.

204
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,089
It took away the mental clarity
of whoever breathed it in.

205
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,216
- [Kokujun] So,
that sweet smell--

206
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,385
- [Eiki] That's
right, and then--

207
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,388
(sword clattering)

208
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,603
(sword scraping)

209
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,318
(footsteps receding)

210
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,453
(Kokujun grunting)

211
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,707
- [Visitor] Kokujun.

212
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,589
(Kokujun panting)

213
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,512
(bars rattling)

214
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,311
(door creaking)

215
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,691
(gentle guitar music)

216
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,742
- [Eiki] But contrary
to Sakujun's plans,

217
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,327
that monster Chuushou
fell to his only son,

218
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,747
the one he had always
considered an idiot.

219
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,750
Your father protected you
right through to the end,

220
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,003
even as he took the final
blow from Chuushou's sword.

221
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,132
- Father, he did
that for my sake?

222
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,510
- You haven't killed
anyone, Kokujun.

223
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,180
And yet you tried to bear
all the responsibility.

224
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,059
It seems you really
are just like Enjun.

225
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,019
- Huh?

226
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,688
- Huh?

227
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,273
- He was said to have
killed all the men

228
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,067
from the main branch
in order to become

229
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,485
the head of the Sa clan.

230
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,196
Everyone believed the rumor
and he never denied it.

231
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,491
But that story was a lie.

232
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,786
My husband never killed a
single person in his life!

233
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,662
- Wait a second, you're
saying old man Enjun

234
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,122
never killed anyone?

235
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,499
- If that's true, then
who killed the heirs

236
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,542
from the main branch
of the family?

237
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,711
- [Eiki] It was a man of the
main branch who had always

238
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,421
respected and admired Enjun.

239
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,339
- Huh?

240
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,176
- [Eiki] That man was
willing to commit murder

241
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,345
and wipe out all the heirs
in order to hand the clan

242
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,138
over to my husband.

243
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,516
Without saying a word
in his own defense,

244
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,768
Enjun stepped forward
and took all the blame

245
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,395
upon his shoulders.

246
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,480
- Great uncle did that?

247
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,691
- I don't understand why
Advisor Sa would be willing

248
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,527
to take all of the blame
without clearing his name.

249
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,737
- I think that I
finally understand!

250
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,533
I've been thinking
about it for a while,

251
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,160
about why Advisor Sa
would start a rebellion.

252
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,371
- Huh?

253
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,832
- I always thought he started
it because he wanted power!

254
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,749
- That's right.

255
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,251
That's how most people saw it.

256
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,755
But the truth was very
different, wasn't it?

257
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,216
Advisor Sa wasn't
doing it to seek power

258
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,136
or further his own ambition,
nor was he actually trying

259
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,846
to bring Ryuuki down
from the throne!

260
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,807
He really cared
about the Sa clan.

261
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,145
And it's not only that,
he cared about Sa province

262
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,731
and its people more than
anyone else, didn't he?

263
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,315
That's why he wanted
to rebuild it,

264
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,860
even if it meant sacrificing
the rest of his life.

265
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,404
I'm sure he must have thought

266
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,740
about what to do
for a long time.

267
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:10,660
- So that's why Advisor
Sa, as head of the Sa clan,

268
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,537
felt he had to take
action and rebel

269
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,748
against the King to
get things moving.

270
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,125
- If the head of a clan
instigates a rebellion,

271
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,461
the King would have a reason
to investigate that clan

272
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,754
and then sentence them.

273
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,422
- Guess he saw the
festering rottenness

274
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,175
in the heart of the clan and
was trying to drive it out.

275
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,719
- Then the only reason
Advisor Sa started a rebellion

276
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,221
was to take everything
apart and then rebuild it

277
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,306
from the ground up.

278
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,310
- And now finally, his
hopes have all come true.

279
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:38,355
The sickness that's infected
Sa province has been cured,

280
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,150
the rottenness driven out,
and the land has been revived.

281
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,196
- It feels like the
beginning of a new era.

282
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,282
- Grandfather.

283
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,703
- Enjun was always a
foolish man, believe me.

284
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,623
But in the end,
this was something

285
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,750
that no one else could do.

286
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,378
Of course, only my
husband could manage it.

287
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,925
- [Kourin As Voiceover]
I'm so sorry, Lord Enjun.

288
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,843
I thought I understood
what you were planning,

289
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:12,263
but I didn't really
understand at all, did I?

290
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,349
- After hearing this, I don't
think I'll ever come close

291
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,184
to being like great uncle Enjun.

292
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,811
- Lord Kokujun!

293
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,521
- It's too great
a goal for anyone,

294
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,356
let alone someone like me.

295
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,358
But I'll swear it
all over again.

296
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,403
I'll spend my life working hard
to take even one step closer

297
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,862
to being like him.

298
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,615
- Yes, and I'll be sure to
be by your side helping you.

299
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,618
- Oh, come to think of it.

300
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,828
Shunki, Kokujun.

301
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,663
- Yes?
- Yes?

302
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,456
- You had better see
a fortune-teller soon

303
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,209
to choose an auspicious
date for your wedding night.

304
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,716
(everyone giggling and laughing)

305
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,725
(slow somber music)

306
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,377
- (crying)

307
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,255
- My lady, are you awake yet?

308
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:28,840
- Yes.

309
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,008
- You should start getting ready

310
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,634
for the governor's
swearing-in ceremony.

311
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,638
- [Shuurei] Thanks, I'll
start preparing right away.

312
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,851
I'm so sorry, Mr. Yuushun.

313
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,520
I feel bad about having
you help me dress!

314
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,396
- Not at all.

315
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,397
It's fine by me.

316
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,274
Besides, unless I miss my guess,

317
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,942
it's better for Kourin
to help governor To

318
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,362
get dressed and prepared,
wouldn't you say?

319
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,446
- (laughs) Absolutely.

320
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,698
- I can't believe this.

321
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,492
Why on earth am I
stuck helping you

322
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,619
get ready for the ceremony?

323
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,913
- Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,706
- (chuckles)

325
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,416
- Mr. Yuushun?

326
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,834
- It's nothing.

327
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,628
I was just thinking
about that little girl

328
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,547
and how happy I am to see
her all grown up like this.

329
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,759
- Wait a minute, have
we met somewhere before?

330
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:13,968
- In a manner of speaking.

331
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,929
It's more like I was
forcibly dragged along

332
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,057
by a couple of friends to
secretly watch over you.

333
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,644
(slow sentimental music)

334
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,069
- (chuckles)

335
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,529
- Huh?

336
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,072
- [Eigetsu] Shuurei!

337
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,325
- Oh, looks like you're all
dressed up and ready to go!

338
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,993
- And it looks like
you're all ready, too!

339
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,706
- Lady Shuurei, you're
incredibly beautiful!

340
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,499
- [Shuurei] Come on,
you're exaggerating!

341
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,627
- But in comparison, this
little idiot can't even tie up

342
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,338
his own sash without someone
there to hold his hand!

343
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,966
Really, you need to
pull yourself together!

344
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,427
- Well, shall we be on
our way, governor Hong?

345
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,803
- Please wait, not just yet.

346
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,555
Before we go--

347
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,056
- Hey, what the--

348
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,642
- I, Shuurei Hong, hope to
follow in both your footsteps

349
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,977
and fulfill the royal mandate

350
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,687
with which we have
been presented.

351
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,773
To that end, I will work with
utmost diligence every day.

352
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,608
I ask that you offer
me your guidance

353
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,736
and kind encouragement
in the days to come.

354
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,115
- Likewise, I, Eigetsu To,
despite my lack of experience,

355
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,034
intend to put forth
my best effort.

356
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,370
Please do me the kindness
of offering your guidance.

357
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,997
- Ah, you're making me blush.

358
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,040
Look, enough of this!

359
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,624
You can stand up now.

360
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,792
- He's right, you know.

361
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,004
After today's ceremony,

362
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,964
you can't do anything
like this again in public.

363
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,716
You must always be
aware of the differences

364
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,009
in rank, Governor.

365
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,510
- Jeez, you kids.

366
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,680
- Now, it's time to go.

367
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,058
- Right.

368
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,061
(intense music)

369
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,981
(Shuurei and Eigetsu gasping)

370
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,488
- We're not exactly being
welcomed with open arms.

371
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,198
- Oh, we just have very
stern-faced officials

372
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,616
in our province.

373
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,493
Underneath that, they're
all happy to welcome

374
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,453
two adorable young
governors like you.

375
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,413
It'll be a change from
the previous unsteady

376
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,664
and unlovable governor.

377
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,874
- Is that so?

378
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,543
- Well, excuse me,
if I wasn't lovable.

379
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,713
- Governor Hong and Governor To.

380
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,757
From the bottom of our
hearts, we hereby declare

381
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,760
our sincere joy upon your
acceptance of this position.

382
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,513
From this moment on, all the
officials within the government

383
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,141
of Sa province offer to support,
guide, and serve you both.

384
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,018
- [Shuurei] I, Shuurei Hong.

385
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,645
- And I, Eigetsu To.

386
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,272
- Will from now on,
- Will from now on,

387
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,607
- devote our entire efforts
- devote our entire efforts

388
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:33,817
- to the governing
- to the governing

389
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,984
- of Sa province.
- Of Sa province.

390
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:38,738
(officials cheering
and applauding)

391
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,117
- What?

392
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,535
- What's going on?

393
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,203
- Like I said, despite
their stern looks,

394
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,081
they're all extremely happy
to welcome the two of you.

395
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,666
- Oh, yeah.

396
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,794
- Aah, finally, everyone's
here together again.

397
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,462
Let's do our best from now on!

398
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,686
(crickets chirping)

399
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,615
- So, you made it home at last.

400
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:23,742
Then it's all over?

401
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,868
- It's over.

402
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:26,619
- I see.

403
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,499
It's finally finished.

404
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,045
- [Shou] The governors have
arrived at their assignment

405
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,672
and the new head of the
Sa clan has been decided.

406
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,675
- Is he similar to Enjun at all?

407
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,011
- He's still a long way
from matching Enjun.

408
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,555
But yes, he's like him.

409
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,850
He's in the habit of being too
kind for his own good though.

410
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,060
- Now that
everything's in order,

411
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,645
Enjun's soul can
finally rest in peace.

412
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:58,985
- Shou, I'm sure you realize
I'll be dying before you

413
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,862
in the not-too-distant future.

414
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:04,157
- You shouldn't talk about
such an unlucky subject.

415
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,618
- Enjun and I lived
and went on living

416
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,662
for more than long
enough, no regrets.

417
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,790
Even when we're gone, it's
not as though the time

418
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,668
we've spent together
will ever go away.

419
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,545
(sword clanging)

420
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,673
Rest when you're
tired, old friend.

421
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,341
If you grow weary of
living, be certain

422
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,677
that Enjun and I
will come to get you.

423
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,179
- It's a promise.

424
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,767
- We just received a
report from Sa province.

425
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,853
The swearing-in ceremony has
finished without incident.

426
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,313
- The word is that
they are both well

427
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,273
and doing a good job so far.

428
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,316
- Is that right?

429
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:43,154
The future of Sa province
looks bright, perhaps.

430
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,365
- Knowing those two, I
think we can count on it.

431
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,867
They certainly won't
give up without a fight.

432
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,911
- And they have Ensei
Ro and Yuushun Tei

433
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,371
as their assistants.

434
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,873
If that weren't enough, they
also have Seiran on board.

435
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,250
- You're right.

436
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,212
By the way, I wonder who
will be Sa province's

437
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,881
representative at the
New Year's celebrations.

438
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,219
- Since there are two
governors for Sa province,

439
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,721
I should think that
only one of the two

440
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,973
will come to the Capitol
for the celebrations.

441
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,267
- Is that right?

442
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:17,814
(gentle contemplative music)

443
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,890
(singing in foreign language)

444
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,379
- [Shuurei As Voiceover]
All right, Eigetsu.

445
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:07,090
Let's rebuild Sa province
and pull it out of its slump!

446
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:09,050
As the new governors, we'll
spend every free minute

447
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,012
on the job, and that means
working without stopping.

448
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,806
We don't have time to think
about unnecessary things!
