00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,717
{\an8}(logo trills)

00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:17,100
{\an8}(woman singing in
foreign language)

3
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,690
(bright music)

4
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,820
(woman panting)

5
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,322
- [Shuurei] Hey, Ryuushin, wait!

6
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,324
(both panting)

7
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,284
- (laughs) You can run faster
than that, Miss Shuurei.

8
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,703
Come on, catch me if you can.

9
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,413
- Don't give me any
of your lip, Ryuushin.

10
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,664
Today you've gone too far.

11
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,873
I won't forgive you for this.

12
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,500
It's one thing to
forget your homework,

13
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,585
but doodling on
the temple walls?

14
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,337
- [Narrator] Despite
the bitter winter cold,

15
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,756
Shuurei had reason to be heated.

16
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,883
This happened after she
took the aptitude test

17
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,845
but she was still waiting for
the results to be released.

18
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,347
- Hey!

19
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,223
What are you doing?

20
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,307
Stop that!

21
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,517
Ryuushin!

22
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,727
- I bet you can't reach me

23
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,770
all the way over
here, Miss Shuurei.

24
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,648
- (grunts) All right,
you asked for it.

25
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,400
- Huh?

26
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,568
Oh, no, no wait, on
second thought this
is too hard for you.

27
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,736
No, don't, stop it!

28
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,738
- You just wait right
there, Ryuushin.

29
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,489
- I said it's too hard.

30
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,826
(Ryuushin grunts)
(Shuurei screams)

31
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,411
Miss Shuurei, no!

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,958
(light music)

33
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,961
- You've caught a cold,

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,589
jumping into a river in
the middle of winter.

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,382
I'm just glad your heart
didn't stop beating.

36
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,967
You're very, very lucky.

37
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,388
- I wonder how long it's
been since I had a cold.

38
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,892
- Well the least I can
do is take care of you.

39
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,061
I'll make you a warm
drink and an ice pack.

40
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,480
So just lie back and
get a little rest, okay?

41
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,818
Hmm?
(light music)

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,613
- Sorry, I'm being childish.

43
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,282
(light music)

44
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,827
Huh?

45
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,579
- [Seiran] I'll stay with
you a little while longer,

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,748
so please, just get some sleep.

47
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,960
- Your hand is cold, but right
now that feels really good.

48
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,295
- Huh?

49
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,756
(light music)

50
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,764
- [Young Shuurei]
Seiran! (giggles)

51
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,892
- My lady, I thought I
told you to rest quietly.

52
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,061
You have a bad fever
so stop rolling around

53
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,439
and pull the covers
over yourself.

54
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,857
- What's this I hear?

55
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,485
Speaking to such a young
child as if she's an adult.

56
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,697
You certainly are an
interesting fellow, Seiran.

57
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,490
- [Seiran] Madame, what
about her medicine?

58
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,367
- Don't worry I
have it right here.

59
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,328
My, Shuurei really has
taken quite a shine to you,

60
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,413
hasn't she?

61
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,331
- Madame.

62
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,458
What are you doing?

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,043
Please, stop.

64
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,004
- I told you to
stop looking sullen.

65
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,880
I won't have that in my house.

66
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,341
It's a waste to have a cute
face looking like that.

67
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,467
Come on, cheer up.

68
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,847
(icepick tapping)

69
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,601
(Seiran chuckles)

70
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,354
- What's this I hear
about Shuurei being sick?

71
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,731
- Master Shouka.

72
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,898
I thought you were planning

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,692
to spend the whole
night at the archives.

74
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,360
What's that?
- Huh?

75
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,072
How did I end up
carrying these things?

76
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,033
But we have to keep
her warm with blankets.

77
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,493
And we need some
nourishing food,

78
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,537
and, right, and icepack.

79
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,122
Wait, what?

80
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,749
That doesn't make any sense.

81
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,917
Why keep warm yet cool her down?

82
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,502
- [Seiran] Please,
calm down, master.

83
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,837
- Ah, yes, of
course, you're right.

84
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,547
I really must calm down.

85
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,759
You know it's been
a very long time

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,677
since anybody got
sick in this house,

87
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,429
so I was very surprised.

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:09,392
Hmm.
(light music)

89
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,193
(icepick tapping)

90
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,862
(upbeat music)

91
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,073
Oh, Seiran, I'll
take care of it.

92
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,699
(upbeat music)

93
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,619
- [Seiran] Please, master,
let me take care of this.

94
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,496
- [Shuurei] What's going on?

95
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,082
- Ah, are you feeling
all right, Shuurei?

96
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,583
- [Shuurei] Yeah.

97
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,960
- Wait just moment, I know
the very thing to perk you up.

98
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,880
I'll go and make you some
of my special ginger tea.

99
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,465
- Huh?

100
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,842
- Father, it's okay, really,
you don't have to do that.

101
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,719
- It's not a problem,
you just rest.

102
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,096
One small sip

103
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,931
and your cold will be
blown away in an instant.

104
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,017
- [Shuurei] If you do that.

105
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,645
- [Seiran] It's the kitchen
that'll be blown away.

106
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,814
- Seiran, you have
to go stop father.

107
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,149
If this house falls apart
any more than it already has

108
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,193
we're gonna have
nowhere to live.

109
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,946
- [Seiran] Yes, please
just get some rest, milady.

110
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,240
(Shuurei groans)
(dishes clatter)

111
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,116
Master!

112
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,831
- I remember this sort of
thing happening before,

113
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,208
now that I think about it.

114
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,502
(coughs)

115
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,923
- [Seiran] Madame, what
did you have her drink?

116
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,591
- [Shoukun] Well she's
always complaining,

117
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,927
"It's bitter, it's bitter,"
so I tried to make it sweet.

118
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,179
- [Seiran] Oh,
this is too sweet.

119
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,140
- That's strange, I
asked Shouka to try some

120
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,684
but he just smiled and
said it was sweet enough.

121
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,103
Now that reminds me,

122
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,023
Shouka said he'd make some
ginger tea for Shuurei.

123
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,900
(Seiran grunts)

124
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,903
(water bubbles)

125
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,656
(fire crackles)

126
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,658
- [Shouka] Let's see.

127
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,828
Where on Earth
would the ginger be?

128
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,498
- [Seiran] In all these years
he hasn't changed a bit.

129
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,083
- Excuse us.
- Huh?

130
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,628
- I hope you don't mind
us barging in like this.

131
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,756
No one came when we called
so we decided to just

132
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,965
come on in.

133
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,508
We couldn't help but
be a little worried.

134
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,926
Lord Shouka dashed
home immediately

135
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,179
once he heard Shuurei was sick.

136
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,765
We brought medicine
and vegetables for her.

137
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,059
- Well, now who do we have here?

138
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,561
Hello, General Ran,
and you too, Kouyuu.

139
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,773
I take it you've come to
pay poor Shuurei a visit?

140
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,274
(Ran groans)

141
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,861
(laughs) I was just making
some ginger tea for, Shuurei,

142
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,821
but I can't find
the ginger anywhere.

143
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,281
- I guess that's a
problem, you know?

144
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,700
Can't ginger it up
without any ginger, right?

145
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,077
(Seiran and Kouyuu scoff)

146
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,203
(Shuuei stammers)

147
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,205
Okay, that was pretty
bad, forget it.

148
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,831
- [Seiran] Master, don't worry,

149
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,166
we'll take care of
everything from here.

150
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,919
So please, go back and
sit with her ladyship.

151
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,212
- Really?

152
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,006
And here I was all fired
up to do some things.

153
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,008
Very well then, I'll
leave you to it.

154
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,678
- [Seiran] Don't worry
about a thing, sir.

155
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,887
- [Shuuei] Now then, Seiran,

156
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,097
you're gonna have to
walk me through this,

157
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,849
I've never held a
kitchen knife before.

158
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,559
- Maybe not a kitchen knife,

159
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,853
but you've certainly held
swords before, right?

160
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,106
They're both blades so
the basics are similar.

161
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,233
At the very least you
should be more helpful

162
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,693
than the master.

163
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,277
And if that's not
really your thing,

164
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,239
I can have you take care of
cleaning this place up instead.

165
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,949
- In case you've forgotten,

166
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,703
I happen to be a much higher
ranker officer than you are.

167
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,371
- [Seiran] How are you
at cooking, Lord Kouyuu?

168
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,872
- If it's fairly simple stuff

169
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,666
I should be able to
manage pretty well.

170
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,126
How 'bout yourself, Seiran?

171
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,836
- Well I've mastered
the innermost secrets

172
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,213
of replacing roof tiles,
repairing the outer walls,

173
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,049
getting rid of pests, and
bargaining for vegetables.

174
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,467
Given those facts I'd say

175
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,053
that's a rather foolish question
to ask, don't you agree?

176
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,849
- All right then!

177
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,227
(frantic violin music)

178
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,855
- [Reishin] Ooh,
she's sound asleep.

179
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,606
Her face is all flushed red.

180
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,066
She looks so pitiful.

181
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,986
- [Kijin] (coughs) I still
don't quite understand

182
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,612
why we have to act like thieves

183
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,156
and clamber over
the wall in secret

184
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,074
just to visit your niece.

185
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,994
- As I told you, I still haven't
been able to prepare myself

186
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,746
to tell her who I really am.

187
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,748
- [Kijin] Well, I'm going
to the front entrance

188
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,915
to visit properly.

189
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,375
If you wish to hang around here

190
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,336
and cling to the wall like
the dead shell of a cicada,

191
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,670
then go ahead.

192
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,089
- (scoffs) How pompous.

193
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,133
And bringing orchids no less.

194
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,926
- [Kijin] It is customary
to bring flowers

195
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,179
to someone who's not
feeling well, is it not?

196
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,099
- What are you doing, skulking
around outside like this?

197
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,225
Hello, Reishin.

198
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,394
Oh, Senior Secretary
Kou as well.

199
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,729
(Reishin grunts)

200
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,064
- [Reishin] Oh, big brother!

201
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,940
- You're so hopeless,
little brother,

202
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,692
but thank you so
much for coming by

203
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,027
to check on everything.

204
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,153
Please, come on in.

205
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,029
- Really?

206
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,197
Are you sure?

207
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,782
- Of course, I'm
not about to leave

208
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,326
two senior secretaries
out here to catch cold.

209
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,370
Besides, I can't
exactly ignore my dear,

210
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,164
younger brother as he sits
out here in the snow, can I?

211
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,416
But there is one thing, Reishin.

212
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,959
- Yes, what is it?

213
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,796
- Why not try the door
instead of a window?

214
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,964
- [Reishin] Oh, sorry.

215
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,842
I was so happy that I must've
gotten a little carried away.

216
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:56,262
(Kijin whooshes)

217
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,681
- [Kijin] I've brought flowers,

218
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,141
as well as some herbal medicine
that boosts resistance.

219
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,310
- Why thank you, Secretary Kou.

220
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,561
- Hey!

221
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,105
How dare you make your
entrance ahead of me?

222
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,232
I'm coming too, big brother.

223
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,109
(objects clatter)

224
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,778
They say that eating lots of
fruit is good for illness,

225
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,822
and I brought pretty
much every medicine

226
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,864
that we had available.

227
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,741
- But you brought way too much.

228
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,451
Honestly, it's the
same as always,

229
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,370
you run from one
extreme to the other.

230
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,831
And why did you bring
medicine to improve virility

231
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,416
and fight constipation?

232
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,333
- Huh?

233
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,170
I will have the herbalist
beheaded immediately.

234
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,922
- Don't be ridiculous.

235
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,132
Nevermind.

236
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,175
I do appreciate the
sentiment, Reishin.

237
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,722
(Reishin laughs)

238
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,724
- [Reishin] It's been
awhile since I last saw her

239
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,225
from this close.

240
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,144
- [Kijin] You followed her
around all during the summer.

241
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,771
You even went so far as to
have her call you uncle.

242
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,148
- I really am her uncle though,

243
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,816
so there's nothing
wrong with that.

244
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,985
In comparison, you're
her former boss,

245
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,278
almost a stranger.

246
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,405
Since dear Shuurei
is yet to be married,

247
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,366
I hereby forbid you to
come any closer to her!

248
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,368
- [Kijin] Remember that she
is not even acknowledged

249
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,370
your very existence yet?

250
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,790
(Shouka laughs)

251
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,083
- Pardon me, master,

252
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,878
but we're finished with
the meal preparations.

253
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,879
- Well thank you.

254
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,422
Well, then--
(Kouyuu gasps)

255
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,508
- Lord Reishin, you're here!

256
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,385
- [Reishin] And what, pray
tell, is wrong with me,

257
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,929
as a devoted uncle,
visiting my sick niece?

258
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,223
And now that I am here
I can see clearly.

259
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,975
It seems you've been
jumping the gun on things

260
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,769
without my knowledge,
haven't you, Kouyuu?

261
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,145
I'll deal with you later.

262
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,939
- [Kijin] (chuckles) I
wouldn't be surprised

263
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,399
if he throws you
out of the house.

264
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,942
(Kouyuu yelps)

265
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,320
(heavy banging)

266
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,237
- Who's that?

267
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,908
{\an8}(light music)

268
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,331
- [Man] I'm deeply sorry

269
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,583
our foolish son has caused
you so much trouble.

270
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,335
- Oh, don't worry,
it's all right.

271
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,337
There's nothing to
be concerned about.

272
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,880
- Yes, but.

273
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,507
- [Shouka] Is there
something else?

274
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,259
- Actually, I was
wondering about Ryuushin.

275
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,261
Did he happen to
drop by here today?

276
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,513
- Huh?

277
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,014
No, he's not been
here at all today.

278
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,432
When did you see him last?

279
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,642
- [Man] Shortly after noon.

280
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,018
He said he was going
to the mountain

281
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,478
and hasn't been back since.

282
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,064
(grunts) I'll keep
searching for him.

283
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,900
- Wait one moment.
- Huh?

284
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,402
- Perhaps we can help.

285
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,446
Ryuushin said he was going
to the mountain when he left?

286
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,781
- Yes, sir, that's right.

287
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,616
- If he's talking about
a mountain close to here

288
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,034
perhaps he went to Mount Ryu

289
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,494
where madame's grave is.

290
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,663
- If it's Mount Ryu we
can get there by horse.

291
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,206
We'll go back to the
palace right away

292
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,541
and get some horses saddled up.

293
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,042
- Right, in the meantime,

294
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,919
I'll head back to the
main Hong residence.

295
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,338
I can get some protective
gear and torches ready.

296
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,050
- Do whatever you wish to.

297
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,261
But remember if you get
lost in the mountains

298
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,596
it won't matter how
extensive your knowledge is.

299
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:47,726
Against the snow and ice it
will essentially be meaningless.

300
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,601
- Yes, sir.

301
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,564
(hand whacks)

302
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,524
- [Shouka] Reishin,
at a time like this

303
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,109
the proper thing to say is,

304
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,069
"Be careful and
come home safely."

305
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,070
Got it?

306
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,488
- Yes, big brother.

307
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,407
- [Kouyuu] I can't believe
he did something like that

308
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,160
to the ever so
shrewd Lord Reishin.

309
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,077
Look at him.

310
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,080
He actually seems a bit happy.

311
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,167
- Seiran, I'd like you
to help the Kouyuu.

312
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,668
Could you go with him
to my brother's house

313
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,962
and help carry the torches
and protective gear?

314
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,422
- Yes.

315
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,382
- We could go back to the
palace for horses, General Ran,

316
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,384
but I'm afraid time
is of the essence,

317
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,095
so we'll borrow horses from
the main Hong residence.

318
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,638
- [Shuuei] Very
well, understood.

319
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,640
- [Kijin] My home is
closer to Mount Ryu.

320
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,517
If you do happen
to find that child

321
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,102
you should take him there.

322
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,437
- [Seiran] All right,

323
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,439
then the rest of us will
head to the Hong house.

324
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,108
(light music)

325
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,361
- That's a shame.

326
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,653
Kouyuu and the others
went to all the trouble

327
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,031
of preparing this meal
but now it's gone cold.

328
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,578
If necessary I'll go as well,

329
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,622
that way there'll be no
chance of anything happening

330
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,415
to Kouyuu and you can rest easy.

331
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,669
No need to worry about him.

332
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,587
- I would never
ask you to go out.

333
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,381
I'd rather have people
from the Hong family

334
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,341
sent out to conduct
a search instead.

335
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,386
- [Shouka] Mm, bell pepper pork.

336
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,096
It's a bit on the watery side

337
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,056
but very well made
for a first timer.

338
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,475
- I don't want you
do anything anymore.

339
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,061
In the end the goal
doesn't really matter.

340
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,313
There's only one thing
I truly want out of life

341
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,690
and that's for you and Shuurei

342
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,025
to live happily and peacefully.

343
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,486
- I'd say you've already
achieved that goal,

344
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,697
thanks to your keeping me
assigned to the archives

345
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,490
I've been able to read
the books that I like

346
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,201
as often as I like and
live happily and quietly

347
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,619
for the past 10 years.

348
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,079
I'm sincerely grateful.

349
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,706
- But that's only 10 years!

350
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,375
And those years haven't
been quiet or peaceful.

351
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,336
You've still been trapped by
all the political intrigue.

352
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,714
When I'd learned that you'd
gone to find the exiled prince,

353
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,257
I took the initiative

354
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,634
and sent assassins to
eliminate the previous king.

355
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,304
- (laughs) But your
efforts were thwarted

356
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,472
by Advisor Sho, right?

357
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,724
- Yes, the were.

358
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,393
Just what is he, some
sneaky raccoon spirit?

359
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,438
So much for his faithful promise

360
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,689
to have you live peacefully.

361
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,274
He's nothing but a liar!

362
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,359
He cheerfully used
you to the very end

363
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,070
and put all the
heaviest burdens on you.

364
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,531
- Everything that happened
was by my own will.

365
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,284
These bloody hands of mine
are nobody else's fault.

366
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,372
Thank you for always worrying
so much about me though.

367
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,707
I'm a very lucky man

368
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,376
to have two such adorable
younger brothers.

369
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,669
(chuckles) And yes,

370
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,379
regardless of what Kurou
might have you think,

371
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,131
he also worries about us.

372
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,343
At any rate, there's
something else,

373
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:29,095
I want you to properly
introduce yourself to Shuurei.

374
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,638
- But, big brother, I can't.

375
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,100
After what I did, Shuurei
must think I'm a bad person.

376
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,519
No doubt she believes I'm a
cruel villain of an uncle,

377
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,230
having thrown you out,
cut all ties with you,

378
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,399
and taking over as
head of the family.

379
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,276
"You're the worst
possible uncle.

380
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,278
"I despise people like you."

381
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,572
To think of her
saying that to me.

382
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,116
(light music)

383
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,409
- Reishin, what do you think?

384
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,702
Isn't our daughter cute?

385
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,164
Your niece carries my
blood and Shouka's,

386
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,124
and by extension,
your blood as well.

387
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,295
But Shuurei doesn't know
yet the depths of spite,

388
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,590
your utter self-conceit, or
your extreme selfishness.

389
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,467
Perhaps you'd like
to keep it that way.

390
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,554
You can make a start on it
by practicing your smile.

391
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,307
If you smile nicely then
Shuurei will smile back at you,

392
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,476
so you should start
practicing right away.

393
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:22,440
(light music)
(Shuurei cooing)

394
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,862
You know, Reishin,
it would be very nice

395
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,825
if one day everyone in this
family could find happiness.

396
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,494
(light music)

397
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,876
- This isn't looking very good.

398
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,004
- Ryuushin may be reckless

399
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,297
but he always has a
reason for his actions.

400
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,716
Let me think a minute.

401
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,176
His reason for coming to a
snowy mountain this season

402
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,469
would be--

403
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,263
- Medicinal herbs.

404
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,973
- In that case we should
concentrate our search

405
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,767
on places where medicinal
herbs are known to grow.

406
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,477
- All right, let's get going.

407
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,188
- [Reishin] You
know, the truth is,

408
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,232
I seriously did
practice smiling.

409
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,693
- [Shouka] You certainly didn't
improve very much, did you?

410
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,986
- Why are only Shouka

411
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,613
and the Senior Secretary
of Civil Affairs here?

412
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,783
Well, nevermind that, I
have another purpose here.

413
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,411
(light music)

414
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:20,790
She's hot.

415
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,336
(light music)

416
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,682
That's right, Shuurei
gave this to me.

417
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,269
(light music)

418
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,250
That was a gift from me.

419
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,380
It's all right, I can
still wait for her.

420
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,548
(Shuurei moans)

421
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,716
- Water.

422
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,426
- Oh, she's thirsty.

423
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,969
Water, water.

424
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,473
This is awful,

425
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,559
I really hope that she
doesn't get sick too often.

426
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,853
To think that a sick
woman, once full of energy,

427
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,482
can become so unguarded
and defenseless like this.

428
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,067
It's torture.

429
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,487
(light music)

430
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,446
Not good.

431
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,364
The medicine.

432
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,579
Given the reason,

433
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,580
this is forgivable.

434
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,834
(cup rattles)

435
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,461
(light music)

436
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,810
(Shuurei screams)

437
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,937
- Shuurei, what's the matter?

438
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,647
(both gasp)

439
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,982
(Shuurei moaning)

440
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,650
- Well, you see.

441
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,362
(both growl)

442
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,822
- Ryuushin!
- Ryuushin!

443
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,407
- Ryuushin.
- Where are you?

444
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,995
- Seiran, Shuuei, over here!

445
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,789
(calming music)

446
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,005
(Seiran sighs)

447
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,638
- [Ryuuki] Look, I told him,
I didn't do anything wrong.

448
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,474
- I bet I can guess
what happened.

449
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,476
You gave her the master's
special ginger tea

450
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,810
with no ginger, right?

451
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,731
- Nevermind that now, tell
me how's Ryuushin doing?

452
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:50,940
- At the moment
he's being treated

453
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,026
at Senior Secretary
Kou's residence.

454
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,944
His hands and feet are
slightly frostbitten

455
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,029
but there's no need to worry,

456
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,030
he's going to be fine.

457
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,783
- Geez, that boy is so reckless.

458
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,534
- Well you seem a lot perkier.

459
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,912
I suppose your fever
must've gone down somewhat.

460
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,663
Although that's a
little bit of a shame.

461
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,791
You looked very
lovely and attractive

462
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,377
when your cheeks were
all flushed like peaches.

463
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,127
- (giggles) Yeah.

464
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,296
- Oh boy, I don't believe you.

465
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,507
Why don't you go stick
your head in a snow bank

466
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,092
until spring?

467
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,718
- [Seiran] My lady?

468
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,678
- I'm leaving.

469
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,429
I've gotta go check on Ryuushin.

470
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,764
- That's not a good idea.

471
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,517
- But I'm really
worried about him.

472
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,061
(door slams)
- Huh?

473
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,938
- [Shuurei] Ryuushin!

474
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,564
- [Kijin] He insisted
on coming to see you

475
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,732
and wouldn't listen to reason.

476
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,652
- Miss Shuurei, I'm so sorry.

477
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,698
- Aw, Ryuushin.

478
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,700
- Miss Shuurei, you said
you'd be taking a break

479
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,159
from teaching at the temple.

480
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,704
I thought you only meant
for a little while.

481
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,497
But then I heard
from the head monk

482
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,541
that you might not be
coming back at all.

483
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,501
I was so worried.

484
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,961
I've been doing my homework,

485
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,172
but if I handed it in then
that would be the end of it.

486
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,884
I didn't ever mean to cause
you trouble, Miss Shuurei, but.

487
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:04,180
- Oh, Ryuushin, I'm sorry to
have put you through all that.

488
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,057
- [Ryuushin] I don't
want you to go.

489
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,017
Please don't do it!

490
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,560
Please don't get married!

491
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,729
- Married!

492
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,897
- Promise, in another
five years I'll become

493
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,567
just as good a man as
Seiran is right now.

494
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,152
- Now wait just a
minute there, young man.

495
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,112
Give me another five
years and I'll--

496
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,864
(fan whooshes)

497
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,073
- [All] Huh?

498
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,575
- What the?

499
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,492
- A fan?

500
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,536
Where'd the heck that come from?

501
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,747
(door creaks)

502
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,166
- Oh my, your majesty,
I'm very sorry about that.

503
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,835
The silly thing must've
slipped from my hand.

504
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,671
(Reishin grunts)

505
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,089
Come on, Ryuushin,

506
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,091
your father's bound to be
very worried about you,

507
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,052
so we better get
you home quickly.

508
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,179
Thank you very much
for gathering herbs

509
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,805
to help Shuurei get better.

510
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:46,723
- Yes, sir.

511
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:48,933
- [Kijin] Take care
of your health.

512
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,268
Once you're fully recovered

513
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,771
I'll send some camellias to you.

514
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,189
- Thank you very much, sir.

515
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,275
- [Kijin] I'll you
see to your home.

516
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,902
(door slams)

517
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,780
Reishin, I'm afraid you're
not doing anyone any favors

518
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,823
by acting like an
ornament out here.

519
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,535
- Uncle, I'm Reishin,
you're uncle.

520
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,246
I've been constantly watching
over you from the shadows

521
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,623
all these years.

522
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,791
- [Kijin] We're going.

523
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,627
- [Shuuei] Well then,
we'll be on our way too.

524
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,587
- [Kouyuu] Take care
of yourself, Shuurei.

525
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:18,880
- [Seiran] Hey, you two,

526
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,508
the kitchen still needs
cleaning, you know?

527
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,885
- Huh?
(Seiran chuckles)

528
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:27,180
- We can't ask that of
General Ran and Lord Kouyuu.

529
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,057
- Honestly, it's quite
all right, Shuurei.

530
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,934
- Don't worry,
just get some rest.

531
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,936
- I'll help out too.

532
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,729
I'm sure I can be useful.

533
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,523
- Thank you very
much, your majesty.

534
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,025
I have no doubt that
scrubbing pots and pans

535
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,569
will be of valuable
use to you someday.

536
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,571
- [Shouka] In that
case, I'll help out too.

537
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,864
- [Seiran] No, no,

538
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,950
please retire and rest
for the evening, master.

539
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,660
(door slams)

540
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,579
(melancholy music)

541
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,750
- [Shuurei] If only some
beautiful and kind person

542
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,169
could come into your life
and become your consort.

543
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,842
We keep drawing closer because
of your strong desire for me,

544
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,218
but I--

545
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,720
- [Shoukun] I think you
must be the biggest fool

546
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,096
I've ever met.

547
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,556
Do you honestly think
I'll ever come to call you

548
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:10,974
"Husband of mine?"

549
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,184
Falling in love with the
one you're supposed to kill?

550
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,854
In all my years I've
never heard of such a

551
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,188
laughable assassin.

552
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,735
Hey, Shouka, I love you.

553
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,194
I really do.

554
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,072
Shuurei and Seiran are
the cutest things ever.

555
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,908
I'm truly fortunate
to be your wife.

556
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,826
Thank you.

557
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,664
- It seems what
they say is true,

558
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,916
there's no medicine
for lovesickness.

559
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:51,222
{\an8}(woman singing in
foreign language)

560
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,003
- [Shuurei] This
is the last time

561
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,462
I'll be working at Kougaro,

562
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,923
the number one brothel of
the entertainment district.

563
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,216
All I need to be focused on now

564
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,968
is the main national exam.

565
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,844
Huh?

566
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:11,970
Miss Kochou?

567
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,054
Who's that boy?
