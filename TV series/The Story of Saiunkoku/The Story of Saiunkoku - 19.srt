1
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,271
- [Narrator] From the very
day after the inquiry,

2
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,315
people's views and
opinions of Shuurei

3
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,817
had completely changed.

4
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,319
There was no longer a
single person in the palace

5
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,737
that doubted her ability.

6
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,657
With the swearing in ceremony
only a few days away.

7
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,909
Shuurei was intent on
preparing the evening meal,

8
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,785
as usual.

9
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,672
- So I don't suppose you
mind me staying here again,

10
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,340
huh Princess?

11
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,551
- You intend on staying here
even if I say no don't you?

12
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,469
(laughs) - You got that right.

13
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,352
To think someone this small has
become jogen this year, huh?

14
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,688
Quit amazing if I
do say so myself.

15
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,941
- Oh I'm sorry, I forgot
to introduce myself.

16
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,403
I'm Eigetsu To, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

17
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,697
- Wow what a polite
introduction.

18
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,283
Please to meet you
too, I'm Ensei Ro.

19
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,326
- What? You're Ensei Ro?

20
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,579
You were selected as the
governor of Sa Province,

21
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,331
even though you've never taken
the national exams right?

22
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,751
- Nevermind the national
exams, it gets better.

23
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,627
He hasn't even passed
the qualifying exam

24
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,004
to become the regional official.

25
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,715
- Really? He didn't
even do that?

26
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,717
(laughs)

27
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,135
- What is it Ensei?

28
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,597
- Just that I passed the
qualifying exam for Sa Province.

29
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,974
- Congratulations,
that's so great!

30
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,601
- Yeah, eh I tell you though

31
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,520
I don't think I've ever
studied so hard my entire life.

32
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,397
Hey why don't you ask
me where I ranked?

33
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,899
- Oh you must have
done well then,

34
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,525
so what rank?

35
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,652
- Second from the bottom.

36
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,281
(scream)

37
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,075
- My lady, Eigetsu,
please allow me

38
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,369
to dispose of this
idiot somewhere.

39
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,286
- Hey!

40
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,872
Passing is what counts! Passing.

41
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,291
Top or bottom, you're still
an official if you pass.

42
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,752
- Just try telling an official
who passed with top marks

43
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,504
that the former
governor of Sa Province

44
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,381
was only second from the bottom.

45
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,758
They probably despair for the
world and join a monastery.

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,718
- Well, wow, this
is the first time

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,762
I've ever seen
Mr.Seiran like this.

48
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,722
- I guess it is,
he only seems to

49
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,807
act that way in front of Ensei.

50
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,393
They get along really well.

51
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,602
- Well anyway,

52
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,938
I'm afraid I gotta
go out for a bit.

53
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,107
Oh, by the way Princess.

54
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,400
- What is it?

55
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,651
- This time I
brought someone along

56
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,444
with me from Sa Province.

57
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,530
I don't suppose you'd mind
seeing her once you're free?

58
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,823
- [Shuurei] Huh? Who is it?

59
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,617
- Your old handmaid, Ms. Kourin

60
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,910
- Hmm

61
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,954
- Kourin! Well that
brings back memories,

62
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,330
I'd love to see her!

63
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,790
- Well it seems she
has various errands

64
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,667
to take care of in Kyo city.

65
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,794
So I'll bring her once
things have calmed down.

66
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,878
- Sure!

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,964
(laughs) - Oh and don't forget

68
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,091
to set aside some food for me.

69
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,802
- All right, see you later.

70
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,020
- This ring is
really badly made,

71
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,397
so this is what the
old man commissioned

72
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,858
in such a rush, and
hid under his wig huh?

73
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,068
- Then it really was
a fake all along.

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,404
- Well we had already
figured as much.

75
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,823
- So it seems the original
ring Senior Secretary Sai

76
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,450
was said to have lost
in the first place

77
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,909
is yet to be found?

78
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,078
- Yes, but we have people
searching for it right now.

79
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,455
- The question is

80
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,999
whether that one is
actually the real thing.

81
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,044
- By the way, you've got
quit a collection here

82
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,629
- There items we confiscated
from Secretary Sai,

83
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,131
he was planning to
use them as bribes.

84
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,924
- What's this?

85
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,139
- It's a portrait of Senior
Secretary Sai's daughter,

86
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,684
he was offering her to call
you as a potential bride.

87
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,644
- Wow, you passed on
a great opportunity.

88
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,771
- Oh, shut up!

89
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,646
(gasp)

90
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,898
- What is it?

91
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,733
- Look? Found it.

92
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,945
(gasps all around)

93
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,615
- I had it brought from Senior
Secretary Sai's residence.

94
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,866
- So what do you think?

95
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,827
- It's extremely
well made, but fake.

96
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,580
- Hmm

97
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,167
- Geez to have it stolen so
openly by his own daughter,

98
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,002
and then have her portrait
painted without even

99
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,545
noticing she had it on.

100
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,756
Wow that' pretty laughable
as far as families go.

101
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,091
- But if that's the case,

102
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,592
it still leaves us
with the question

103
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,135
of where the real one might be.

104
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,513
- I'll have my people
continue searching.

105
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,183
- [Ensei] This was
a really close call,

106
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,768
if it had gotten back
to the main house

107
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,604
of the Sa Clan, anyone would
have believed it was real.

108
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,898
- What's the current
situation in Sa Province?

109
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,650
- Ever since Lord
Enjun passed away,

110
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,527
the Sa Clan has
been in disarray.

111
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,195
Everyone has been
fighting over leadership

112
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,571
of the family.

113
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,531
- Hmm

114
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,032
- As part of that struggle,

115
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,659
they've all been
frantically searching

116
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,911
for ring of the
Sa Clan's leader.

117
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,206
And now it's been almost a
year since Lord Enjun died.

118
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,749
- If a full year passes without

119
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,960
the official ring of a
clan leader's being found,

120
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,546
the family is then permitted
to install a provisional leader

121
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,798
and have a new
ring made for him.

122
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,550
- That's right. At this point,

123
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,010
there'd be nothing
more troublesome

124
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,470
than to have some dubious
character end up as clan leader.

125
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,596
It's the regular people

126
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,181
who would end up
caught in the fall out.

127
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,268
In Sa Province, the authority
of the Sa family is absolute.

128
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,270
Only a proper governor
with the full support

129
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,604
and backing of the king

130
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,940
would have the power
to counter them.

131
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,442
- Yes, we already know.

132
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,570
But first we wish to have
the consent of those present.

133
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,489
Is anyone against
our recommendation

134
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,616
regarding the governorship
of Sa Province?

135
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,666
(dog howl)

136
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,594
- You've always been skilled
in so many things, Kurou.

137
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,263
I guess it was because you
have an insolently smug Reishin

138
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,640
and and awkward me
as elder brothers.

139
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,142
As a result you
ended up being able

140
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,144
to do almost
anything on your own.

141
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,105
There's a name they have
for that sort of thing.

142
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,566
Right! They call it
"the capable poor".

143
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,943
- Just what is there
about me that's poor?

144
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,613
- It is only a saying,
but unlike Reishin,

145
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,157
you're very serious. So people
tend to rely on you a lot,

146
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,868
and you often end up with
the short end of the stick.

147
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,621
Of course I'm the one
responsible for that.

148
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,624
Since I abandoned
the responsibilities
of the eldest son,

149
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,001
it was inevitable that all
of father's expectations

150
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,753
would fall upon you in the end.

151
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,922
After all it wasn't like Reishin

152
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,548
was the type of
child who would pay

153
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,008
the slightest
attention to father.

154
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,761
My actions must have caused
you a lot of loneliness.

155
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,679
Didn't they?

156
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,182
- Not particularly,
the way I see it,

157
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,726
I was fortunate enough to
be spared the companionship

158
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,269
of an idiot elder
brother like you.

159
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,479
(laughs)

160
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,731
- When you put it like
that, you may be right.

161
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,817
- Now don't me
wrong, I do hate you.

162
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:08,029
But still, even now I
can't help but regret.

163
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,115
Regret not being able to
stop what happened here

164
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,951
in this residence when
elder sister Shoukun died.

165
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,371
- Hmm you shouldn't feel guilty,

166
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,206
you were in Kou
Province at the time.

167
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,916
- It's still my fault,

168
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,668
the servants I assigned
to you were supposed

169
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,877
to take care of you,

170
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,379
but they were nothing
more than vultures.

171
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,131
They set their sights
on the valuables

172
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,841
and eldest sister's keepsakes.

173
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,050
And even robbed you

174
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,969
while you were still in
shock over her death.

175
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,097
- It was my own fault for
having been in such a daze.

176
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,224
- That's the point.

177
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,809
That's exactly why brother Rei

178
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,103
and I were supposed
to watch over you.

179
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,355
Since everything had
already happened,

180
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,940
the only thing I
was able to do was

181
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,776
hunt down every
last one of them.

182
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,319
And show them all
what a living hell

183
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,113
worse than death would be like.

184
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,994
- It's not like I
lost everything Kurou,

185
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,413
the most important and
precious things in my life

186
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,249
are in places where no one
can ever hope to steal them.

187
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,711
- I'm sorry brother.

188
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,173
- You came to visit my house
so you could say that to me,

189
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,341
didn't you?

190
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,718
That's a very kind
gesture, I'm touched.

191
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,803
- And just what is
that supposed to mean?

192
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,764
- Huh? Well, that is say-

193
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,724
- Don't you dare
take me for a fool,

194
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,185
it would be the death of me
to have you feel sorry for me.

195
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,020
- Uh I'm sorry.

196
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,315
- You must know I came here
for Kouyuu and Shuurei's sake.

197
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,941
- Oh

198
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,735
- Someday, in the future
Kouyuu is to take Shuurei

199
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,780
as his wife and take over
the Kou Clan as it's heir.

200
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,948
- Well I certainly
won't oppose it.

201
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,117
But I have a feeling that
the issue won't be coming up

202
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,243
for a while yet.

203
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,121
- Huh? Then you
intend to let her go?

204
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,083
- There's no doubt that
child will say yes.

205
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,672
(gentle music)

206
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,769
- Being king is a difficult job.

207
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,024
Hmm

208
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,701
oh Shuurei.

209
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,457
(sigh)

210
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,334
- I guess today's the last
day I'll ever wear this,

211
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,252
my uniform.

212
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,216
Hmm.

213
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,097
(murmuring)

214
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,019
- Now then, I wonder where
we're all going to be assigned.

215
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,396
I'll definitely be in
central administration.

216
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,065
- If possible, I'd
prefer regional post,

217
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,859
and how about you Shuurei?

218
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,068
- It doesn't really
matter where.

219
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,196
After all what we have
to do is still the same.

220
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,990
- That's quit right.

221
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,535
- Oh Official Ro! I
mean Senior Secretary-

222
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,872
- It's all right, they're both
the same thing in the end.

223
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,208
What Initiate Kou just
talked about is the truth.

224
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,210
When it comes down to
it, it does not matter

225
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,880
what position or location
you're assigned to.

226
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,048
It doesn't change what you must

227
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,091
do for the sake of this country.

228
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,968
There's an important
question to answer.

229
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,346
For what reason do
officials exist.

230
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,805
If you do that you'll soon

231
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,266
realize for yourself
what you have to do.

232
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:30,231
Now then, today you take your
first steps as new officials.

233
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,399
[All Together] Yes.

234
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,497
- Hakumei Heki, you
are to be assigned

235
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,332
to the department
of civil affairs.

236
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,292
- Yes, sir.

237
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,044
- That's the same
department as Lord Kouyuu,

238
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,171
whom he respects so
much; how wonderful!

239
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,464
- The department is challenging,

240
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,925
but we believe Senior
Secretary Ro's report.

241
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,636
It says you'll be readily
able to meet that challenge.

242
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,596
We're counting on you.

243
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,973
- I most humbly accept this.

244
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,981
- Lastly, we ask
that Initiate Tou

245
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,235
and Initiate Kou come forward.

246
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,611
(everyone gasps)

247
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,113
- What? Both of us together?

248
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,325
(crowd muttering)

249
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,581
(footsteps)

250
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,625
- Initiate Eigetsu Tou,
who passed this year

251
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,670
with top rank of Jougen
and Initiate Shuurei Kou

252
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,715
who passed this year with
rank of Tanka, you are hereby

253
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,592
both assigned as
co-governors of Sa Province.

254
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,387
(crowd mutters)

255
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,305
- But Your Majesty, you're
entrusting these two

256
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,474
complete novices with the
position next to the rank

257
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,060
only to a leader of
one of the ministries!

258
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,271
With all due respect, what
on earth are you thinking!?

259
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,398
- Not to mention, two
people at the same time!

260
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,525
- Each of them can do
the job of half a person,

261
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,361
so both of them together
should be just about right.

262
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,238
- [Official] Just about right!?

263
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,658
- Well then, will you go forth
as governor of Sa Province?

264
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,454
Are there any others who
believe they are most

265
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,580
fit for the position?

266
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,209
There was also much
dispute before the previous

267
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,253
governor of Sa
Province was chosen.

268
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,380
You know what
happened in the end?

269
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,674
An unknown young man who
hadn't even passed the

270
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,052
national exams was sent,
despite having neither

271
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,429
rank nor experience, he
carried out his duties

272
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,098
as governor of Sa
Province admirably.

273
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,975
- But that's because he
had an extremely capable

274
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,227
man as his assistant.
Official Tei was the one

275
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,604
who helped him.

276
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,481
- Certainly, that was a
major factor. That is why

277
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,275
we will be assigning
assistants this time as well.

278
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,444
As there are two new
leaders, we will assign two

279
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,446
officials to
properly assist them.

280
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,115
One is Lieutenant Governor
Tei, who will remain in his

281
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,452
current post in Sa Province.
The other is former

282
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,121
Governor Ensei Ro. Step forward.

283
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,164
- Yes.

284
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:52,749
- Huh?

285
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,000
- Ah?

286
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,669
- As a successful former
governor of Sa Province,

287
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,712
no doubt you will be
able to provide excellent

288
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,339
guidance for these two.

289
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,342
Accompany them both and
go forth to Sa Province.

290
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,470
- I humbly accept this
appointment, Your Majesty.

291
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,348
- And given the unusual
situation in Sa Province,

292
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,059
a military officer is to
be exclusively assigned

293
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,645
to them. Now, Seiran Shi.

294
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,105
- Huh?

295
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,523
- Yes sir?

296
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,692
- As of now, you are to be
assigned as their officer.

297
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,778
The authority of this
position shall be higher

298
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,446
than that of a
provincial general.

299
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,948
Together, with Ensei Ro,

300
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,368
proceed to Sa Province and
assist the two new governors.

301
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,329
Kanshou. Bakuya. The twin swords

302
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,249
once wielded by our highly
esteemed elder brother.

303
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,377
Kanshou and Bakuya were both
formed from the same ore.

304
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,296
And even though he was given
both, Elder Brother Seien

305
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,340
was generous enough
to give Bakuya to me

306
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,510
as a gift. At that time,
I was too young and

307
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,263
small to wield it or
even carry it properly.

308
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,682
All the same, Bakuya
has always been my most

309
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,351
precious treasure. And
now, it is my honor to

310
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,729
present you with Kanshou,
the twin sword that

311
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,149
elder brother Seien
wielded. You are most worthy

312
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,692
of this distinction, Seiran.

313
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,450
(coronary music)

314
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,414
- I most humbly
accept this gift and

315
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,498
your charge to me.

316
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,711
(crowd muttering)

317
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,213
- Finally, Initiate
Tou and Initiate Kou,

318
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,549
we must ask for
your official reply.

319
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,719
As you well know, Sa Province
is a dangerous region.

320
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,221
While we intend to everything
we can to protect you,

321
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,390
our influence can
only grant so much.

322
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,392
We cannot guarantee your safety.

323
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,395
With this in mind, will you
still go forth as governors?

324
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,147
- [In Unison] Of
course we'll go!

325
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,195
We humbly accept this
post, Your Majesty.

326
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,406
- Hm, in that case, we
entrust you with the charm

327
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,743
and seal of the governor.
You can understand that

328
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,703
we cannot make
duplicates of these.

329
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,540
Thus, from now on, you should
each carry one of the two.

330
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,585
In other words, both of you
together are the governor.

331
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,380
- It's unprecedented!
The birth of co-governors

332
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,756
in our country!

333
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,342
- There is still one more
gift Initiate Tou and

334
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,637
Initiate Kou. I wish to
give you each a flower,

335
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,513
from me to you.

336
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,559
- A flower is proof
of absolute trust!

337
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,770
- Until now, Kouyuu and
I have been the only ones

338
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,522
to receive flowers
from the king.

339
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,485
(music)

340
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,780
- These are buds.

341
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,198
- That's right.

342
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,950
They represent infinite
possibility and hope.

343
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,326
We look forward to seeing you

344
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,494
how the two of you are able

345
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,746
to make them bloom
in the future.

346
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,374
Once those buds
have fully opened,

347
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,877
we'll present you a
flower in full bloom.

348
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,963
- This indicates
their potential,

349
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,548
and that those two are expected

350
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,717
to support the king and
the nation in the future.

351
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,219
- It means that those who
seek to harm either of them

352
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,721
are enemies of the king.

353
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,322
- Sa Province, I wonder what
it's going to be like there.

354
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:13,700
- Shuurei.

355
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,956
- Ryuuki, what are
you doing here?

356
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,541
- I told you before
that I wanted

357
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,501
to talk to you after your
assignment was decided.

358
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,711
Don't you remember?

359
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,645
Shuurei?

360
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,985
I had a very hard time
making this decision.

361
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,698
They say you should send
your dear child on a voyage.

362
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,991
But the truth is I didn't want

363
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,452
to have you go to Sa Province.

364
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,412
I don't think you could
ever really understand,

365
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,040
the way I felt when I
wrote down your name

366
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,541
on the scroll of parchment.

367
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,543
The truth is I wanted
you to stay here,

368
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,712
by my side.

369
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,047
- That's very flattering of you,

370
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,965
but you're more than
capable of doing things now,

371
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,426
without having me
around to help you out.

372
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,928
Don't you think that's right?

373
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,888
And it's not only because
Lord Kouyuu and General Raien

374
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,348
are here with you.

375
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,934
You know what it kind
of hurts to admit it,

376
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,894
but right now, you don't
really need me anymore.

377
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,521
- You're wrong!

378
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,361
I've told you so many times,

379
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,655
I've always said
you're very dear to me.

380
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,533
By that I mean I don't
want you below me,

381
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,451
I want you to stand by my side.

382
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,747
- I can't do that.

383
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,749
- Don't worry, I know.

384
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,918
I know not to hope for
that much right now.

385
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,504
But I do want you
to remember this,

386
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,715
I don't intent to
marry anyone but you.

387
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,759
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

388
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,969
- But why?

389
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,013
- Because I can't
become a consort.

390
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,849
The goal that I'm striving
for is completely different.

391
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,311
- Shuurei, be honest,
do you care about me?

392
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,523
- I do, but I imagine that

393
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,358
it's probably quite different

394
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,318
from what you must
feel about me.

395
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,865
- That's good enough,
I'll say it one more time.

396
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,827
I will not take anyone
but you to be my consort.

397
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,747
I was alone for an entire year,

398
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,416
it's simply a matter
of doing that again.

399
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,377
But still, I am
very lonely Shuurei.

400
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,089
I only have one wish,

401
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,675
I know it can't be helped
in official situations.

402
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:39,637
But beyond that, I don't want
to distance yourself from me.

403
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,974
I don't want to kneel before
me, I want you to see me,

404
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,643
not as a king, but as who I am.

405
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,812
If you don't I'll be
so sad and lonely,

406
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,105
I won't be able to sleep.

407
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,358
You don't want me to
lose sleep do you?

408
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,490
I know you probably
can't return my feelings

409
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,075
and I'm not asking
you to but please,

410
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,452
don't ever use my
being king as an excuse

411
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,620
to run away from me.

412
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,622
You're the one who found me

413
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,998
and made me king
in the first place.

414
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,834
So running away at this
point would be unfair.

415
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,587
- Maybe but you were always
doing silly things back then.

416
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,382
- For some things, I
was always serious.

417
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,760
Please, never forget Shuurei,

418
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,887
the only thing I want is you.

419
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,848
- I have no doubt that
the woman whom you love

420
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,016
will be very happy.

421
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,851
But I'm begging you please

422
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,145
find someone else to
give that happiness to.

423
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,815
I didn't take the national
exams and work so hard

424
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,858
just so I can become your wife.

425
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,860
I came to serve and support you

426
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,029
as king from
beneath your throne.

427
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,116
- You're so stubborn, but
you know that's all right.

428
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,159
That's because I'm stubborn too.

429
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,620
If you should happen to fall
in love with someone other

430
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,122
than me while you're out there.

431
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,623
You have to promise that

432
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,750
you'll contact me
before you get married.

433
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,419
- Why do you want me to do that?

434
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,504
- Isn't it obvious? It's
so I can come running,

435
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,672
challenge him to a fight,

436
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,048
make you realize just
who the better man

437
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,050
really is and break
off your engagement.

438
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,887
(laughs) - All right I
promise I'll contact you

439
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,222
if I get engaged.

440
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,641
And I also promise that
I won't kneel to you,

441
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,601
I won't look at you through
your position as king.

442
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,936
I'll look at you as a man.

443
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,986
I'm sure you're going to
become a great king Ryuuki.

444
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,655
And knowing you,
you're probably going

445
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,948
to become a great man too.

446
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,888
- You won't be able to
forget me now will you.

447
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,599
- You um, well I um

448
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:53,646
- Please don't forget, don't
forget that I love you Shuurei.

449
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,163
(crowd murmuring)

450
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,505
- Wonderful aren't they?

451
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:21,132
- Yeah and in an
instant, just like that,

452
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,301
she's merged the idea
of women officials

453
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,678
into this court of men.

454
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,971
- Yes and so very naturally too.

455
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,848
- [Masked Man] It's not unlikely
that she could very well

456
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,227
go through life changing many
other things in this way.

457
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,812
- [Another Official]
Changing the world quietly.

458
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,146
Little by little.

459
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,148
- One day those buds
presented by His Majesty.

460
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,526
- Will bloom beautifully
without fail.

461
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,201
- We give our heartfelt
blessings to all of you.

462
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,247
Ensei Ro, together with
the help of Yuushun Tei,

463
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,916
may you guide these two
well on the road ahead.

464
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:55,792
- Yes, sir.

465
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,630
- And you Seiran Shi,
may you keep them

466
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,882
from even the slightest harm.

467
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:06,011
- I swear upon this royal sword
that I will not fail them.

468
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,305
- And you Eigetsu Tou, as
someone pure and not bound

469
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,726
to any previous ties, we'll
be counting on you greatly.

470
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,811
- I'll do everything
within my abilities.

471
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,273
- And finally Shuurei Kou.

472
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,899
- Yes.

473
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:24,696
- Now as a woman, freely and
fully do all that you wish.

474
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,158
- As long as this body is able.

475
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,201
- [King] We look
forward to the day

476
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,580
when the buds you've been
given, bloom for all to see.

477
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,624
Today from this moment on,

478
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,085
you shall become the
pillars of this nation.

479
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:04,045
- [Shuurei] We're getting
ready to leave for Sa Province

480
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,797
and there's just so much to do.

481
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,299
But with both Seiran and
me gone from this house,

482
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,968
will father be all
right on his own?

483
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,388
Will he even be able
to survive without us?
