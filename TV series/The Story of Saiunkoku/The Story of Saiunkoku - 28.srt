1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,050
(bright music)

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,724
(light Japanese into music)

3
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,313
- [Narrator] Several
days have passed since

4
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,732
the liberation of the
mayor of Kinka, Shin Sai,

5
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,983
from his confinement.

6
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,860
And the banishment of
the murderous Blades

7
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,570
from the city.

8
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,906
A government official said
to have arrived from Koren

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,659
has appeared before Shuurei,
Eigetsu, and the others

10
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,411
as they were busy
processing matters

11
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,954
relating to the incident.

12
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,665
- So you're Mr. Jun
Yu from Koren City?

13
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,708
- [Jun Yu] Yes.

14
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,875
(laughs)

15
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,460
- Then you've decided
to come after all.

16
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,504
Is everything all
right over there now?

17
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,880
- I think for the time being.

18
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,674
What's important is
that we work together

19
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,343
to immediately bring
the situation back
to normal in Kinka.

20
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,679
- Uh, right, yeah, of course.

21
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,347
You're absolutely right.

22
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,558
- Hey, maybe you should
properly introduce him to us

23
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,351
rather than just
telling us his name.

24
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,562
- Don't worry, we can
save that stuff for later.

25
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,356
We've got a mountain
load of work to do.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,692
- Save that stuff for later?

27
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,278
(soft music)

28
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,911
(sighs)

29
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,788
- Excuse me, Official Yu?

30
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,998
About this document.

31
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,042
- Hm.

32
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,668
Ah yes, of course.

33
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,503
Since it's necessary
that this be checked

34
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,380
and verified against
the taxation records

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,508
from last year, I will
take care of this for you.

36
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,719
More importantly, I'd
like to have your approval

37
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,471
on this document.

38
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,347
- [Eigetsu] Hm?

39
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,556
Uh, right.

40
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,308
- Could you stamp this
document with your seal

41
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,892
as well, please?

42
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,143
- Sure.

43
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,688
- [Ensei] After that,
there's this, and this.

44
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,773
Oh and these, too.

45
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,611
- Oh dear, you've gotten
quite a lot of work again.

46
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,029
- Yeah.

47
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,989
But you know, if we can
bring happiness and peace

48
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,408
to the people of Kinka by
doing our job like this,

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,576
I don't really mind.

50
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,952
- Right.

51
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,454
But just imagine what
things could've been like

52
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,830
if we didn't have
those two here to help

53
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,832
us out with all of this.

54
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,502
- Even though we were
appointed as co-governors

55
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,712
we still are total
novices to government.

56
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,422
The fact is, as we are now,

57
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,965
we don't know left
from right, do we?

58
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,801
- Right now, our
entire job description

59
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,552
is just putting our
signatures and seal

60
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,513
on the documents
that they verified.

61
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,598
Official Yu's assistance
has been really helpful.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,766
He's very precise and quick

63
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,518
when it comes to
this sort of thing.

64
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,727
Oh?

65
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,312
- Come on, don't just
sit around talking.

66
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,356
I need a stamp on
this too, please.

67
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,733
(sighs)

68
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,943
- For crying out loud!

69
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,486
Why is there so
much work to do?!

70
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,821
(splatters)

71
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,030
Ah!

72
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,950
Official Yu, I am so, so sorry!

73
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,951
(laughs)

74
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,703
- No, it's perfectly all right.

75
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,038
None of it got on the
documents, so it's fine.

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,418
- This is so embarrassing,
I'm utterly ashamed of myself.

77
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,420
- Yeah, me too.

78
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,463
- Oh, it's to be
expected at this stage.

79
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,798
- Oh yeah, that's right.

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,675
Actually, you two are
doing a whole lot better

81
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,051
than I did during my time.

82
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,553
- If you don't mind me saying,

83
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,013
that's not something
to brag about.

84
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,764
Or are you trying to
make excuses for the way

85
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,891
you irresponsibly put
your seal on documents

86
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,476
when you hadn't even
read through them?

87
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,645
Or how you used to act
recklessly whenever you had

88
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,980
a spare moment or two.

89
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:32,814
- Agh!

90
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,357
That couldn't be helped.

91
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,860
Back then, the assassins from
the Sa Clan were persistent.

92
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,570
And besides, that
was 10 years ago.

93
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,530
You certainly have
a good memory.

94
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,574
- [Jun Yu] Yes, I
remember it very well.

95
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,786
Even in 100 years, I could
never forget your kind act

96
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,372
of pushing me into a
manure pool with a warning.

97
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,666
- [Ensei] But that was to save
you from a poisonous arrow!

98
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,668
And besides, thanks
to that incident,

99
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,754
all those people who used
to think you were too cool

100
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,797
and calm to approach,
they warmed up to you

101
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,175
and started coming
to you more often.

102
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,634
- Look, please
refrain from making

103
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,762
pointless excuses for yourself.

104
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,180
We have more important
things to do.

105
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,015
The taxation information
for last year

106
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,850
is on the bookshelf
on the north side.

107
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,935
Second from the right,
fifth shelf from the top.

108
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,853
- Yes, sir.

109
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,524
Wow, Official, you and Mr.
Ensei really get along well.

110
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,068
- Yes, they do, but
have you noticed

111
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,028
that Ensei is the
one running around?

112
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,696
I don't think I've
seen Official Yu

113
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,948
get up from his
seat a single time.

114
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,700
- [Ensei] Is that so?

115
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,910
- It makes perfect sense.

116
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,495
Ensei's the type
of man you'd assume

117
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,538
has muscles in his
head instead of brains.

118
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,541
He's got to be moving
continually, or
he gets restless.

119
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,709
- Yeah, exactly.

120
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,294
That's right.
Hey!

121
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,755
Wait just a minute, why would
you go say a thing like that?

122
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,508
(laughs)

123
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,885
(soft music)

124
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,055
- Huh?

125
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,016
- Huh?

126
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,229
- [Seiran] I understand
you buried Soujun's son

127
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,106
in that courtyard
all by yourself.

128
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,693
- Yes, as a member
of the Sa Clan,

129
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,945
it was the very least
I could do for him.

130
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,905
- That's very impressive of you.

131
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,115
- No, you're wrong!

132
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,574
You guys are the ones
who are impressive!

133
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,535
You were able to chase
the murderous Blades

134
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,453
out of Kinka, and
liberate it from the hands

135
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,705
of the Sa Clan.

136
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,456
- [Seiran] Maybe, but
we weren't able to do

137
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,874
any of that by ourselves.

138
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,085
- Even so, you're
all incredible.

139
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,671
Especially Miss
Shuurei, I think.

140
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,048
(soft music)

141
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,096
- [Seiran] I should be
getting back to work soon.

142
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,100
(light music)

143
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,811
- In comparison,
all I can do, huh?

144
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,816
(light music)

145
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,871
- [Eiki] Listen to
me well, Shunki.

146
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,915
Read the stars, and
gage the right moment.

147
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,625
And when that moment comes--

148
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,835
- Oh, Miss Shunki!

149
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,133
Wow, so you've come all the
way down here, have you?

150
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,052
I guess your legs have
become a lot stronger

151
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,137
since you arrived, Miss Shunki.

152
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,388
Ah?

153
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,640
You've cut your hand on
a thorn or something.

154
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,226
I'll mix up some medicine
for it when we get home.

155
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,645
I feel kinda bad, your
hands were like a princess'

156
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,980
when you first came
to stay with us.

157
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:19,856
Huh?

158
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,610
I only wish I had some
kind of medicinal herbs

159
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,862
that could bring your voice
back to you, Miss Shunki.

160
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,658
(light music)

161
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,787
- Huh?

162
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,747
Boss, Miss Shunki,
you're right on time.

163
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,248
I just finished preparing lunch.

164
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,087
- You were able to
pick quite a lot!

165
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,088
Huh?

166
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,714
Those mushrooms are poisonous.

167
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,966
- [Shorin] Yoshun, you idiot!

168
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,009
What are you trying to do?

169
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,552
Embarrass the poor girl?

170
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,720
If something like that happens,

171
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,555
you tell her later in secret.

172
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,390
- Ah, you're right!

173
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,974
I'm stupid, I wasn't thinking.

174
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,560
I'm sorry, Miss Shunki,
please forgive me.

175
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,649
- Listen Yoshun, Miss
Shunki was entrusted to us

176
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,859
by Ensei Ro, and we have
to do everything we can

177
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,277
to protect her, right?

178
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,655
But there's no way we'll
accomplish this important task

179
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,031
with half-hearted devotion!

180
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,366
- Got it!

181
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,118
- If we can fulfill
this mission,

182
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,954
we'll mature into a
second generation of
chivalrous thieves!

183
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,873
The Bald Eagles of Sa
Province will fly again!

184
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,250
- You said it, boss man.

185
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,379
(wind blows)

186
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,297
- [Eiki] And when
that moment comes,

187
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,759
you shall do what you
need to do, Shunki.

188
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,641
- This is delicious.

189
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,935
Kourin, your skills improved.

190
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,145
- Nonsense.

191
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,106
I still hardly compare
to you, Lady Shuurei.

192
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,733
- [Ensei] Hey!

193
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,819
Could I have two sweet bean
paste ones as well, please?

194
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,863
Why should only Princess
get more than one?

195
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,240
- It's a difference
of affection.

196
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,743
- Never in my life have
I been shown so clearly

197
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,286
the difference in the
amount of affection

198
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,912
someone has for me.

199
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,247
- Don't sulk, Ensei.

200
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,874
It's not just you.

201
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,917
Official Yu and Eigetsu
only got one each as well.

202
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,836
- Yes, but look at mine.

203
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,254
Mine's the smallest!

204
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,757
- Nice try, but they're
all the same size.

205
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,092
Fine then, I'll give
you half of one of mine.

206
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,802
- All right!

207
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,846
(sighs)

208
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,349
- Huh?

209
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,938
A chestnut?

210
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,358
(light music)

211
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,777
I see.

212
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,653
A difference in
affection, indeed.

213
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,119
- I'll go make some more tea.

214
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,206
- By the way, I
meant to ask, Ensei,

215
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,415
would you mind filling us in

216
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,751
on exactly what's going
on in Koren right now?

217
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,294
- Such as?

218
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,879
- [Shuurei] I, mean you made
such an effort to get us into

219
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,090
Sa Province quickly, but
you haven't said a word

220
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,300
about moving on since
we arrived here.

221
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,802
- [Eigetsu] It's true
that we can reach Korin

222
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,304
in five days travel,
even at a relaxed pace.

223
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,181
But we only have 20
days before our deadline

224
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,974
to arrive and take our post.

225
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,267
- If we miss that date,

226
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,811
then our post as
co-governors will be stripped

227
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,771
from us regardless
of the circumstances.

228
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,982
- Yes, I realize that, but
bear with me a little longer.

229
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,984
I would prefer to wait
until we get the latest news

230
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,071
on Korin by way of Sho Sai
and that sister of his.

231
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,115
- I see.

232
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,703
But Ensei, will Lieutenant
Governor Tei be all right?

233
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,330
(chews)

234
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,998
- Yuushun, huh?

235
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,834
Yeah, I think
he'll be just fine.

236
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,751
- That's your answer?

237
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,169
Aren't you worried about him?

238
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,379
- Yes, that's right.

239
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,922
Until now, as acting governor,

240
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,841
he held the highest
decision-making authority

241
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,884
in the Province, so
he was still safe.

242
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,095
But the moment we take
our posts and he transfers

243
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,931
his authority over to us,
his life could be in danger

244
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,933
from the Sa Clan!

245
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,184
(laughs)

246
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,352
- I think if Yuushun
heard you say that,

247
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,855
he'd be so happy,
he'd burst into tears.

248
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,857
- Yes, he sure would.

249
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,192
- In his case, there's
no need to worry.

250
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,069
- Are you absolutely sure?

251
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,279
- I'm positive.

252
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,281
Not even Sakujun Sa
himself would be able

253
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,117
to do anything about
Yuushun at the moment.

254
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,037
(dramatic music)

255
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,205
The two of us already decided
together that we would

256
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,082
transfer all authority
as governors to you

257
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,751
in the best possible state.

258
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,795
So I ask you to put
your trust in Yuushun.

259
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,047
- You know, it looks
like the two of us

260
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,174
are truly blessed,
aren't we, Shuurei?

261
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,508
- It's true.

262
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,135
Sending you to Sa Province
was a wise decision

263
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,511
by His Majesty.

264
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,056
This will be an ideal
first assignment for you.

265
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,515
- [Both] Huh?

266
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,934
- Given that your predecessor
is the unusual Ensei Ro,

267
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,854
the unique circumstances
regarding your age and gender

268
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,774
will not even be an issue to
the people of this Province.

269
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,233
- You've got some
nerve to say that

270
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,985
while I'm sitting right here.

271
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,945
Of course, you are quite right.

272
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,198
This place has always been
a Province mostly abandoned

273
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,033
by the central government.

274
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,786
- Deep down, everyone was
anxious and ill at ease.

275
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,871
But then, people
received the good news

276
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,248
that truly legitimate
governors would be arriving;

277
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,043
governors to whom His
Majesty had bestowed flowers.

278
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,253
The citizens of Sa
Province were overjoyed

279
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,880
upon hearing that.

280
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,466
- Why were the people so happy
about us receiving a flower?

281
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,467
- [Jun Yu] The flower is proof

282
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,511
of His Majesty's absolute trust.

283
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,263
Those with flowers
bestowed upon them

284
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,432
are rarely assigned to
work in other districts.

285
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,934
By dispatching such governors,

286
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,268
His Majesty is
telling the people

287
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,603
that he is clearly committed

288
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,980
to paying close attention
to this Province.

289
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,608
Not only does bestowing
the flower upon you

290
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,277
protect you personally,
it also spares Sa Province

291
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,113
from much of its
laments and fears.

292
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,572
It's a brilliant move.

293
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,199
- [Ensei] There's one more
reason why it was good for you

294
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,243
to come to Sa
Province, Princess.

295
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,536
- What's that?

296
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,496
- Well, the headquarters
of the Merchant's Guild

297
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,499
in Sa Province is run by
Sho Sai's older sister.

298
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,960
Her ability to run
things puts men to shame;

299
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,920
multiple times, as
a matter of fact.

300
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,256
- For that reason, there
will likely be less prejudice

301
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,384
towards a female governor here
than in the other Provinces.

302
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,511
I believe this would be
the most appropriate place

303
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,847
for the first female
government official.

304
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,141
- [Shuurei Voiceover]
I can't believe

305
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,143
how much Ryuuki thought
this assignment through.

306
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,519
(knocks)
- [Messenger] Excuse me.

307
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,146
- [Shuurai] Huh?

308
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,440
- Lord Sho Sai has
asked to speak with you.

309
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,983
- Oh, so he's arrived already?

310
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,109
Please, show him in.

311
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,279
Well, how was everything?

312
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,490
- As of four days
ago, by the order

313
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,285
of Lieutenant Governor Tai,
an official announcement

314
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,287
has been issued ordering
the complete blockade

315
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,872
of all Korin traffic.

316
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,874
- What?!
A complete blockade?!

317
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,334
- [Ensei] Well that's
certainly a pretty in-your-face

318
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,918
move from the Sa Clan.

319
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,545
- The official story is
that the two new governors

320
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,005
are already in the city.

321
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,215
They say the blockade
is for safety.

322
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,592
It's supposed to
protect them from any

323
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,303
possible danger until
the assignment ceremony.

324
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,513
- [Shuurei] Ugh,
that's ridiculous!

325
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,307
- [Sho Sai] As well,
rumors are spreading

326
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,351
throughout the city alleging
that the new governors

327
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,311
are under the protection
of the Sa Clan.

328
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,229
People have interpreted
this as a sign

329
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,939
you are under Sa Clan control,

330
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,192
and your popularity
is declining.

331
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,027
- Great, as if things
weren't already hard enough,

332
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,155
we have the Sa Clan spreading
preposterous rumors.

333
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,032
- What should we do now?

334
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,159
(laughs)

335
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,578
- Okay then, why don't we
leave tomorrow morning?

336
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,038
- Huh?

337
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,206
- We'll start out first thing,

338
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,291
so get to bed early
tonight, got it?

339
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,542
{\an8}(laughs)

340
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,212
{\an8}(light music)

341
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,135
(knocks)

342
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,011
- Yes?

343
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,598
What is it, Ensei?

344
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm busy packing right now,

345
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,185
so I don't have very
much time to be chatting.

346
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,437
You did want to leave
really early, right?

347
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,647
- Hm.

348
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,315
Say, Princess, I was wondering,

349
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,150
have you talked
with Seiran lately?

350
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,531
- [Shuurei] Uh no, we've both
been busy with work, I guess.

351
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,157
- Sorry to butt in,
but would you mind

352
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,618
having a heart to heart
talk with him soon?

353
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,494
- Huh?

354
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,039
(dramatic music)

355
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,625
- Ensei certainly doesn't
seem like the sort of guy

356
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,420
who notices details, but
he's really perceptive

357
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,295
where it counts.

358
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,296
- [Seiran] My lady.

359
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,007
So this is where you are.

360
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,718
- Oh, yeah.

361
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,345
(soft music)

362
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,350
Seiran, let's have
some tea together.

363
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,728
(soft music)

364
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,022
- You sure about this?

365
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,232
There's not much
time left for sleep.

366
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,483
- [Shuurei] If I
went to bed now,

367
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,527
I don't think I'd be
able to wake up in time.

368
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,238
(sips)

369
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,407
- [Seiran] May I ask, why are
you making bean paste buns

370
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,742
at this time of night?

371
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,660
- Well, I suppose I--

372
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,620
- Is there something
bothering you?

373
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,665
(sighs happily)

374
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,584
Well, it's just that you're
my second favorite person

375
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,585
in the world, Seiran.

376
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,503
(spits out tea)

377
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,130
Are you all right?

378
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,758
- What's gotten into
you all of a sudden?

379
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,053
- I'm just as surprised
at myself for saying that.

380
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,597
It's not really like me to
say things unintentionally.

381
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,350
But you know, it kinda came
out naturally, didn't it?

382
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,311
Like saying peach buns are my
second favorite in the world.

383
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,397
(laughs nervously)

384
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,648
- [Seiran Voiceover] Her
second most favorite person

385
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,233
in the world?

386
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,652
Am I supposed to be happy
about that or miserable?

387
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:48,531
My lady, please stop giggling,
and give me an explanation.

388
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,454
(sighs)

389
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,497
- [Sa Kokujun] I don't
know what I should do.

390
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,082
- [Ensei] About what?

391
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,667
- Ever since I was a child,
I've always been watching

392
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,752
and seeing what crimes
my Clan commits.

393
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,587
I saw how much
they did to torment

394
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,756
the poor citizens
of Sa Province.

395
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,385
And now, even my older
brother Sakujun is doing it.

396
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,260
- So?

397
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,098
(sighs)

398
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,683
I'm sure that deep
down in your heart,

399
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,435
you already know what to do
without having to ask me.

400
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,480
Believe in yourself.

401
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,316
Do what you feel you have to
do, and nevermind the rest.

402
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,318
- [Kokujun] Mr. Ensei.

403
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,282
Thank you very much.

404
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,119
(crickets chirp)

405
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,206
- Now, I gotta wonder
what's happening over there.

406
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,626
(light music)

407
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,421
- [Shuurei] It's been a
while since we've sat down

408
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,673
and talked like this, hasn't it?

409
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,843
- Well, yes, I suppose so.

410
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,554
- [Shuurei] Seiran, is there
something you'd like to ask me?

411
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,764
- Uh, like what, my lady?

412
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,183
- I seem to have caused you
a lot of worry and upset

413
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,145
because of that incident with
that stupid young master.

414
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,855
Ask me whatever you want
so we can clear the air

415
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,897
before we leave.

416
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,608
- [Seiran Voiceover] It's
supposed to be my job

417
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,152
to support you.

418
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,778
I'm pathetic.

419
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,613
(light music)

420
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,906
My lady.

421
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,742
- There's the old Seiran.

422
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,326
Yes?

423
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,245
- Is it all right if I ask
you who your number one

424
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,413
favorite person is?

425
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,331
- It's father, of course!

426
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,750
Even though he's
a hopeless father,

427
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,585
he's always been my number one.

428
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,296
Mother's in a different
category altogether.

429
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,466
- So, my lady, do you
like Sakujun Sa at all?

430
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,468
(spits tea)

431
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,178
- [Shuurei] Whoa, as far
as Seiran's concerned,

432
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,721
that's pretty straightforward.

433
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,806
- I don't really have any
choice but to answer that

434
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,516
I don't really know.

435
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,726
- You don't?

436
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,686
- [Shuurei] Seiran, I'm
sure you understand.

437
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,313
When it comes to
this kind of thing,

438
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,482
I'm totally unfamiliar with it.

439
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,649
But I remember the way that

440
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,526
Mother got along really
well with Father.

441
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,861
You remember, right?

442
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,488
- [Seiran] Yes.

443
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,365
- As a child, there was always
something to laugh about.

444
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,742
I remember just how lively
and fun it always was

445
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,327
in our house.

446
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,329
- That's true, but only
because Madame would insist

447
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,624
on making medicinal soup
and cause an explosion.

448
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,417
(coughs)

449
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,211
- [Hyou Shoukun]
Wait just one moment.

450
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,254
Your medicine will
be ready very soon.

451
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,008
(explodes)

452
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,385
(screams)

453
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,220
Oh dear, I'm sorry
that I scared you.

454
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,514
Shh, shh, it's all right.

455
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,349
- What on earth are you doing?

456
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,517
What if she had been hurt?

457
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,310
What would you do then?

458
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,895
- My goodness, you can talk.

459
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,691
- If I remember correctly,

460
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,567
those were the very
first words you ever said

461
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,319
after you came to live with us.

462
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,570
- That's because
there was a real risk

463
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,406
of you burning yourself.

464
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,699
- Yes, but after I would drink

465
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,701
Mother's special medicinal soup,

466
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,829
I'd become as healthy as
any other child for a while.

467
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,789
Then she'd teach me
how to play the erhu.

468
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,626
We went persimmon picking, she'd
teach me all about manners,

469
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,295
we even made bean
paste buns together.

470
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,923
I think we did as much as
we could in a short period

471
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,550
so that we wouldn't
run out of time

472
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:57,012
before I came down with a
fever again, or even worse.

473
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,056
But in the end, it wasn't
me that time ran out on.

474
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:00,974
It was Mother.

475
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,477
(dramatic music)

476
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,771
The reason I hadn't pursued
things like love or romance

477
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,606
might be because of Mother.

478
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,942
Her death made me really scared.

479
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,695
I guess it may have made me
afraid to let my guard down

480
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,572
and fall in love with someone.

481
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,323
I have no confidence in myself.

482
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,368
Maybe that's why I haven't
been making any effort

483
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,787
to find a person who's
especially important to me.

484
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,832
And although I
always looked away,

485
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,917
that man was
extremely aggressive.

486
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,837
He was very strange, but he
had such a beautiful face.

487
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,840
My heart would sometimes
start pounding despite itself.

488
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,342
(laughs)

489
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,844
- That's certainly a very
objective analysis of yourself.

490
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:38,720
- Hey!

491
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:39,679
Why are you laughing?

492
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,847
You probably don't understand

493
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,724
because you're a very
handsome man, too.

494
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,934
But it can be quite
important to a normal person

495
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,978
whether your looks
are good or bad.

496
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,646
- That's a very nice
thing for you to say.

497
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,856
I'm flattered.

498
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,400
- For all the trouble
that young master was,

499
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,028
he was good at exposing
that weak point of mine.

500
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,946
Or maybe I'm just
generally weak.

501
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,616
Weak against that special
kind of pressure, anyway.

502
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:03,578
Sorry, I guess my answer's not
making a lot of sense, is it?

503
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,954
- No, it's all right.

504
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,456
If anything, I should
be thanking you

505
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,750
for thinking so much
about my feelings.

506
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,335
- Do you really mean that?

507
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,379
(yawns)

508
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,631
That's not good.

509
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,966
Now I feel like I'm about
to fall fast asleep.

510
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,635
(light music)

511
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,012
- I'll be sure to wake
you up in the morning.

512
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,889
Please, get as much
sleep as you can.

513
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,683
- But what about you, Seiran?

514
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,478
- I have more stamina,
so don't worry about me.

515
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,980
- In that case, I
think I might go to bed

516
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,732
for a little while.

517
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,650
- Okay.

518
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,488
- [Shuurei] I still have to
take that flower bud back, but,

519
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,658
(yawns)

520
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,493
that flower belongs to me,

521
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,955
so I'll do everything
I can on my own.

522
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,376
You really shouldn't
spoil me so much, Seiran.

523
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,757
(sighs)

524
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,510
- [Seiran] Hey.

525
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,762
- Oh, so you noticed
I was here, huh?

526
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,639
I was just curious as
to what was going on

527
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,849
since it looked like

528
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,392
you were going to worry
yourself to death.

529
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,810
As I thought, all you had
to do was talk with her,

530
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,520
and your problems were solved.

531
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:11,855
I knew things would get better.

532
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,857
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

533
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,400
(chews)

534
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,401
It's been a while since I've had

535
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,069
any of Princess' steamed buns.

536
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,781
You know, I don't think
Princess has any idea

537
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,783
just how much you
really depend on her.

538
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,705
You're the type of guy who
needs at least three adults

539
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:31,166
on hand to make certain you
don't forget how to breathe.

540
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,127
Without three babysitters,
you're completely lost.

541
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,506
But Princess, Mr. Shouka, and
myself make up those three.

542
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,716
- Well, I'd happily trade

543
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,843
that last one in
for a grasshopper.

544
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,720
It's not like I've
got any use for you.

545
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,055
- A grasshopper, huh?

546
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,848
Well at least I work all
year round, unlike them,

547
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,058
I'll have you know.

548
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,601
The problem with being
your friend though,

549
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,770
is figuring out
how to spoil you.

550
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,897
Oh, by the way, looks
like the Senior Secretary

551
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,106
of the Department
of Civil Affairs

552
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,733
won't be taking action.

553
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,735
He must truly cherish Princess.

554
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,029
- In which case,
that means Sakujun--

555
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,739
- If he sees the
head of the Han Clan

556
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,532
isn't acting, he
won't see a point

557
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,118
in pursuing the position of
head of the Sa Clan anymore.

558
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,120
So I guess in the
end, Soujun was killed

559
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,580
for no good reason.

560
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,873
- At least he was
properly buried

561
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,668
by his younger
brother's own two hands.

562
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,878
- [Ensei] Koku says he's
gonna make his move today.

563
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,255
But his opponents are
Chuushou and Saku.

564
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,590
- He's well-aware of that,

565
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:21,966
yet he's still
acting on his own.

566
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,594
I see surprising potential
in that young man.

567
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,806
- Yes, well, hopefully
that will be true.

568
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,768
- I'm taking a nap, so wake
me up when it's time to go.

569
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,520
- Hey, what about me?!

570
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,772
- Let's see, you have
more than enough stamina,

571
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,607
and you've done
nothing but desk work.

572
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,775
You can stay awake.

573
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,151
- But that's not my fault!

574
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,154
Somehow I don't think
you're being fair at all.

575
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,949
(birds chirp)

576
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,617
- Goodbye, Elder Brother.

577
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,202
I'm off now.

578
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,787
- [Eigetsu] You're
going aren't you?

579
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:51,955
- Hm?

580
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,707
- So you really have
made a decision?

581
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:54,708
- Yes, I have.

582
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,294
Do you mind if I ask a favor?

583
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,587
- [Eigetsu] What is it?

584
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,089
- Please take care of Shunki.

585
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,008
I know I could just
go ask Mr. Ensei

586
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,677
and have nothing to worry
about on that end, but...

587
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,180
- I understand, and
yes, I promise you.

588
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,142
- And just in case
I should die--

589
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,519
- [Eigetsu] I won't listen
to the rest of that!

590
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,605
I'm also not going to accept
any messages for Miss Shunki.

591
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,608
You should not be speaking
of death and dying so easily.

592
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,530
- You've always given me nothing
but strong encouragement.

593
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,575
I'll do my best, and I
won't die that easily.

594
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,246
I will go and stop Grandfather
and my big brother Sakujun.

595
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,831
I swear it.

596
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,625
(dramatic music)

597
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,764
(soft Japanese outro music)

598
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,169
- [Shuurei] We're finally
going to depart for Koren

599
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,672
in order to arrive in
time for our assignment

600
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,465
as governors of Sa Province,

601
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,301
and to settle all the
problems facing us.

602
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,845
Now, is everybody ready?

603
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,221
Then let's get going!
