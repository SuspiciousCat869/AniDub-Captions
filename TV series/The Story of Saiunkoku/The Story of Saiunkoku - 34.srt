1
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,607
- The destined day has arrived.

2
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,234
The night of the new moon,

3
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,694
a night of darkness.

4
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,821
This evening, the
selection ceremony

5
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,990
for the new Head of the
Sa Clan will take place.

6
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,326
In an attempt to resolve
the endless strifes

7
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,494
surrounding the Sa,

8
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,705
Shuurei and Shunki
set foot inside

9
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,790
the courtyard
shrine of the clan.

10
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,796
(screaming)

11
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,256
- Lord Kokujun!

12
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,529
- It's been extremely
entertaining,

13
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,615
however, it will
all be over soon.

14
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,498
- Lord Eigetsu To, Governor
of Sa Province has arrived.

15
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,916
Along with Lord Ensei Ro,

16
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,294
Lieutenant Governor
of Sa Province.

17
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,346
- Lord Kokujun.

18
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,607
Lord Kokujun!

19
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,276
- Calm down,

20
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,736
what I need to do
here is see things

21
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,404
with they eyes of a Governor

22
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,781
and judge him accordingly.

23
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,700
- Lord Kokujun?

24
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,618
Lord Kokujun?

25
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,661
Lord Kokujun!

26
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,582
Snap out of it!

27
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,626
(slaps)

28
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,756
- Lord Kokujun.

29
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,301
- Shunki?

30
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,354
Shunkin.

31
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,689
I...

32
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,023
I killed my father.

33
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,403
I stabbed Grandfather Chuushou.

34
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,865
Now there's...

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,702
There's... There's nothing
left for me anymore.

36
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,747
I've lost everything
I've held dear.

37
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,998
Even my own soul.

38
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,760
- It's impossible
that you killed them.

39
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,722
I refuse to believe you could
ever do something like that.

40
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,558
You've always been
the type of a person

41
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,810
who would dig up a flower
before bringing it to me.

42
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,020
Just because you
couldn't even bear

43
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,688
to break its stem and kill it.

44
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,984
Afterwards, the two of us
replanted the flower together

45
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,444
in a corner of the garden.

46
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,361
Remember?

47
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,031
I know you.

48
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,950
You could never be
capable of killing anyone.

49
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,502
- I must've become
crazy down here.

50
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,880
The only thing I could
think about was killing.

51
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,842
I thought the only thing I
could do was destroy everything

52
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,927
and start again from the ashes.

53
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,847
- No, please don't think
that way, Lord Kokujun.

54
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,974
I truly believe in you.

55
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,559
You haven't killed anyone,

56
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,687
I know it and there are
other ways to start over.

57
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,401
If you seriously want
to begin a fresh,

58
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,696
then please, become
Head of the Sa Clan.

59
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,615
- Huh?

60
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,451
No, that's ridiculous.

61
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,869
- How is it ridiculous?

62
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,871
You've always gone to any
effort to help our clan

63
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,539
and restore its old strength.

64
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,126
- But in the end, I
wasn't able to do anything

65
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,212
and now, I can never undo this.

66
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,130
- Please, Kokujun,
that's enough!

67
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,841
For you, the issue
is not only whether

68
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,718
or not you killed
you father, is it?

69
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,928
The thing you really regret is

70
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,054
that you weren't able
to save to save him

71
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,514
before it came to this.

72
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,725
Whatever the actually
truth might be,

73
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,560
you'll continue to
blame yourself like this

74
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,104
for the rest of your life

75
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,939
and feel like you
failed somehow.

76
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,485
But even as you bear guilt
and regret on your shoulders,

77
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,736
as long as you're alive,

78
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,780
there are always things
you can accomplish.

79
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,907
You can start over.
Am I wrong?

80
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,952
But if the burden
is too great for you

81
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,787
and you don't think you
can take another step,

82
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,913
then it can't be helped.

83
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,124
You should remain here then.

84
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,792
I'll be the one to go.

85
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,086
I shall become the new
Head of the Sa Clan

86
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,629
and as our family's leader,

87
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,047
I will do what I must to atone

88
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,841
for the crimes
that has committed.

89
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,514
This is the path
I decided to take

90
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,057
the moment I found this ring.

91
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,731
- The ring of the
Head of the Sa Clan?

92
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,733
But it was supposed to be lost.

93
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,067
- There is no mistaking it.

94
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,028
This was the ring
that Grandfather Enjun

95
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,821
always used to
have on his finger.

96
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,907
From this moment onwards,

97
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,744
I, Shunki Sa, will wear
the ring of the clan.

98
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,212
- Wait.

99
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,636
I can't allow you to atone
for my guilt and regrets.

100
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,681
It is my burden to
carry, Shunki, not yours.

101
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,774
Great-Uncle Enjun always wore it

102
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,233
on this finger, didn't he?

103
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,825
Like you said, I will
continue to regret

104
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,661
what happened here for
the rest of my life.

105
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,830
Because if you
believe that the path

106
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,665
I've taken has led
me to this moment,

107
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,961
then regardless of the
truth, I did kill him.

108
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,171
In a sense, at least.

109
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,008
If I had only gone down
another road sooner,

110
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,096
maybe things wouldn't
have ended like this.

111
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,683
Again and again,

112
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,727
I'll always remember today.

113
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,688
I'll dream about it until I die.

114
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,981
I must never forget about it.

115
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,233
But what you're saying is

116
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,027
that feeling alone won't
help matters, right?

117
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,866
- It's your turn to
walk down the same path

118
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,160
Grandfather Enjun
once did long ago.

119
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,042
Huh?
- Huh?

120
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,721
- That person, wait!

121
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,722
I've seen him before.

122
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,682
- I don't believe it.

123
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,933
Great-Uncle Enjun?

124
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,269
- Advisor Sa?

125
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,896
- So in the end,

126
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,273
it's you who's come
forward, Kokujun.

127
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,275
It must have been a
painful decision for you,

128
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,943
given your youth and kindness.

129
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,030
Should you become the
Head of the Sa Clan,

130
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,408
you'll experience many
painful feelings from now on.

131
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,786
The kinder you are, the
more tears you will shed.

132
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,288
But it will be all right.

133
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,750
Above all, be sure never to
let go of your warm heart.

134
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,295
Don't try to become a man
who never shows emotion.

135
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,922
Let yourself cry whenever
your heart is pierced

136
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,092
then stand right back
up and go forward again.

137
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,636
And do not forget whom
you should be protecting.

138
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,097
No matter who stained
in blood you may become,

139
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,807
make sure you never
heart the ones

140
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,060
you are bound to protect.

141
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,229
Become a kind and
strong man, Kokujun.

142
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,356
Shunki will be there for you

143
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,399
just like Eiki was there for me.

144
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,074
- Grandfather.

145
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,663
- I don't have a single
redeeming quality

146
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,374
and I've never
succeeded in anything.

147
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,836
But still, even though
it'll be slow and difficult,

148
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,046
if I put in the effort

149
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,131
and walk in Great-Uncle
Enjun's footsteps,

150
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,300
I think even someone
like me can do it.

151
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,098
It'll be a long hard
journey, Shunki.

152
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,142
Sometimes it'll probably
seem close to eternal.

153
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,018
- I know.

154
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,188
- I'm still a
really weak person,

155
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,316
I'm sure I'd be crushed
if I were all by myself.

156
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,401
So my--

157
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,241
- I promise I'll stay by
your side and support you

158
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,868
now and forever,
my dear Kokujun.

159
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,124
- Thank you, Shunki.

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,763
- Lord Kokujun Sa, have
you made your resolution?

161
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,850
Moreover, do you understand
the full implications

162
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,435
of the decision you have made?

163
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,310
- Yes.

164
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,066
- Then I hereby acknowledge,
Lord Kokujun Sa's

165
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,027
appointment as Head
of the Sa Clan.

166
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,155
I , Shuurei Hong,
Governor of Sa Province,

167
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,199
offer my heartfelt
congratulations.

168
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,868
Regarding this current incident,

169
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,244
once the facts have
been made clear,

170
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,370
I'll be in touch with you

171
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,039
to discuss the
responsibilities you're

172
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,874
to incur as clan leader.

173
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,209
I shall decide what
that may entail then.

174
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,254
- I will abide by
whatever decision you
make, Governor Hong.

175
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,257
- Hmm.

176
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,011
- Father,

177
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,764
I swear I will become
Head of the Sa Clan.

178
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,932
I'll spend my life
atoning for their crimes.

179
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,977
Now, let's go.

180
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,438
You will rest in peace
under the light of the sun.

181
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,253
- Hmm.

182
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:02,931
Oh.

183
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:05,975
Hmm.

184
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,605
- Great-Aunt Eiki.

185
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,981
- That ring you're wearing,

186
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,400
does it mean you
are prepared to walk

187
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,527
the same path that
my husband has tread?

188
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,195
Speak, boy.

189
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,530
- I'm prepared,

190
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,407
rather, I at least
believe that I'm prepared

191
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,950
but please,

192
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,119
I need you to help me along
the road that I'm about take.

193
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,043
- Hmm.

194
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,963
Hmm, very well said of you.

195
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,549
You are no more than
an ordinary man.

196
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,717
- Yes, ma'am.

197
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,427
- But because you
admit your weaknesses,

198
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,012
you can become strong.

199
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,430
And because you have nothing,

200
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,639
you can moved forward

201
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,433
without discarding
what's precious to you.

202
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,643
It seems that there's
nothing that you lack.

203
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,064
Well, then.

204
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,232
What are you waiting for?

205
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,192
Hurry up and get yourself ready.

206
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,569
- Get ready?

207
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,486
- You fool.

208
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,990
Tonight is the
selection ceremony.

209
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,492
Go and get dressed up for it.

210
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,368
- Right.

211
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,329
- He is so undependable.

212
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:11,458
- Grandmother.

213
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,088
- So this must be
Advisor Sa's wife,

214
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,340
Lady Eiki Hyou.

215
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,429
- I offer you my most sincere
apologies for the trouble

216
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,182
that the Sa Clan has
caused you and yours.

217
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,641
Still, may I trouble you further

218
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,770
by asking you to stay with
us for just a little longer?

219
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,355
- Yes, of course I'll stay.

220
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,522
That was my intent.

221
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,192
- Thank you very much.

222
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,152
By the way, I meant
to ask Shunki,

223
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,612
are you sure you
won't have any regrets

224
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,447
in choosing that man?

225
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,907
- I believe that in time,

226
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,285
I will become at least as
happy as you were, Grandmother.

227
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,496
- As happy as me, you say?

228
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,247
(laughs)

229
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,166
- Well, I sincerely
doubt you'll manage that

230
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,210
but I challenge you to
make the effort, at least.

231
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,503
- Yes.

232
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,256
(Shunki and Shuurei laugh)

233
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,394
(murmuring)

234
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,146
- So that kid's supposed to be
the Governor of Sa Province?

235
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,357
- He doesn't look like
he'd be good for anything.

236
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,608
- That'll work in our favor.

237
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,694
He's so timid that he'll
probably do exactly

238
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,238
what we, the Sa
Clan, demand of him.

239
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,406
- Don't worry about it.

240
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,574
- Just like we thought.

241
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,743
Neither Mr. Sakujun nor
Mr. Kokujun are here.

242
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,661
- Right.

243
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,419
Huh?

244
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,298
Hmm.

245
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,383
- You know, now that
I come to think of it,

246
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,884
it was at a gathering
just like this

247
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,429
when Enjun Sa killed all the
heirs from the main branch.

248
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,556
- He probably figured he
had the trust of the King

249
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,890
and lost control of himself.

250
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,850
- But what about Chuushou,

251
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,143
how arrogant is that bastard

252
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,228
summoning us all as if
he owns us or something?

253
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,313
Huh, you'd think he
was the clan head.

254
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,482
- At least, there's no real
reason to wait for him.

255
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,736
Let's raise our glasses in a
celebratory toast by ourselves.

256
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,488
(toasting)

257
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,240
- This hall is strangely built.

258
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,701
The walls are thin and there
are only a few pillars.

259
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,206
- Deputy Governor--

260
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,541
- Wait, Shou!
Stop!

261
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,338
Don't come in any
further no matter what.

262
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,590
- It's slanted to one side.

263
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,592
- Don't tell me that
old man Chuusho...

264
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,595
I really hate to order
around beautiful girls

265
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,763
such as yourselves,

266
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,223
but make your way
out in a single file.

267
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,767
Otherwise, this whole building

268
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,602
and everything inside
it will collapse

269
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,354
and we'll all end
up dying together.

270
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,480
(exclaiming)

271
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,606
- Take a closer look.

272
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,316
The roof is slanted to one side

273
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,651
and there are way too few
pillars to support the weight.

274
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,861
They're not sound.

275
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,237
Not to mention that
the floor is thin

276
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,198
and the center of
gravity is unbalanced.

277
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,908
It's been purposely
built so that one step

278
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,951
or movement could bring
the entire thing down.

279
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,536
- Damn that Chuushou.

280
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,289
- The old bastard's trying
to wipe us all out at once.

281
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,166
- Show your face Chuushou.

282
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,752
- Shou, have you been able
to talk with Chuushou?

283
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:01,795
- Yes, I have.

284
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,421
- So?
How is the old man?

285
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,802
- I believe that by this point
he's probably passed away.

286
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:09,803
- What did you say?

287
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,346
- What do you mean by that?

288
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,683
- Oh, the timing's
perfect as usual.

289
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,892
Excellent work, Yuushun.

290
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,652
- At this time, we
have received evidence

291
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,654
submitted by various
district officials.

292
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,489
Highlighting numerous
improprieties

293
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,949
committed by the Sa Clan.

294
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,951
After deliberation on
what has been received,

295
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,494
the court has determined
that there is more

296
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,830
than adequate proof to
place you under arrest.

297
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,331
Starting this evening,

298
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,542
we are launching a full-scale
investigation of the clan.

299
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,668
- What are you saying, brat?

300
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,211
What makes you so important?

301
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,505
- Remember your position on
where you are, you lowly cur.

302
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,425
- How dare you insult one of
the proud Seven Colored Clans.

303
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,927
- I am the Co-Governor
of Sa Province

304
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,429
and as provincial governor,

305
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,764
I promise to make a
fair and proper judgment

306
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,642
but that judgment will
not be overruled by you.

307
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,811
I will give the Head of
the Sa Clan the chance

308
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,229
to talk with me,

309
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,981
of course, that
person will also bear

310
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,025
the greatest
responsibility and guilt

311
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,568
for your clan's crimes.

312
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,986
(murmuring)

313
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,738
- Fortunately, today is
the day of the selection,

314
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,865
as well as the
Swearing-In Ceremony.

315
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,533
So, please, make your
choice and decide

316
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,577
who shall be the next
Head of the Clan.

317
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,874
- Well, the process
involved in deciding

318
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,001
on leadership of one of
the Seven Colored Clans

319
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,628
is an important
and serious matter.

320
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,546
Could you...

321
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,882
Could you at least
give us until,

322
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,717
say, tomorrow morning?

323
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,801
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

324
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,679
- You pathetic, old
fools just don't know

325
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,056
when to give up, do you?

326
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,891
Wait until tomorrow
morning, you say?

327
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,726
There's no need
to wait that long.

328
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,895
(murmuring)

329
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,438
- I will take the position.

330
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,774
Wearing this ring,

331
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,776
the legitimate symbol of
the Head of the Sa Clan,

332
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,943
from this day forward,

333
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,488
I, Kokujun Sa,
will take my place

334
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,906
as leader of the Sa Clan.

335
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,408
- So you had it all
along, Eiki Hyou?

336
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,035
- No! It's gotta be a fake.

337
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:57,994
- Stop your whining.

338
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,204
It is the real ring

339
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,955
so you can cease your
useless complaining.

340
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,751
From here on, I shall
become Kokujun Sa's advisor.

341
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,879
What he lacks due to
youth, I will make up for.

342
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,756
Now tell me, you
foolish, old men,

343
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,008
is there any among you with
the guts to step forward

344
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,469
and claim leadership of
the clan for yourself?

345
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,515
- I hereby acknowledge,
Lord Kokujun Sa's,

346
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,642
appointment as Head
of the Sa Clan.

347
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,936
I, Eigetsu To, Governor
of Sa Province,

348
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,646
offer my congratulations.

349
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:25,814
- Thank you, Governor.

350
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,068
- So, you've finally arrived.

351
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,111
Arrest them...

352
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,821
But do it, carefully.

353
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,448
I wouldn't advise resisting.

354
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,493
One clumsy move and you could
all be crushed in an instant.

355
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,998
- That man isn't here.

356
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,042
- We'll be separated
for a while, Shunki.

357
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,377
As leader of the clan,

358
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,421
I have to take responsibility
for their actions

359
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,464
and share their confinement.

360
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,009
- No. I will stay by your side.

361
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,472
- By the way, I might
be late in saying this

362
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,642
but you have an absolutely
wonderful voice.

363
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,352
I'm really glad I could hear it.

364
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,909
- Enjun.

365
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,119
- It's over, Shou.

366
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,912
You've come just in time.

367
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,914
- I didn't bring you
here to get you involved

368
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,000
in something
complicated like this.

369
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,794
I just wanted to show you
the beginning of a new era

370
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,796
and the man who would
inherit your intentions

371
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:32,714
for that future.

372
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,007
I wanted you to stop worrying

373
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,676
so you can finally
rest in peace.

374
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,970
- It was the last matter
I wanted to settle.

375
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,056
I prefer to rest only
after I've been able

376
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,974
to help the best I can.

377
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:43,892
- Enjun.

378
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,020
- There's one last thing I
want to make clear to you,

379
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,855
Kokujun, never killed anyone.

380
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,148
- I know, old friend.

381
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,691
I already knew.

382
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,402
You don't have to worry
about anything else anymore.

383
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,529
You may have died but it
seems that death did nothing

384
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,406
to cure you of your stupidity.

385
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,991
You didn't even see Eiki.

386
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,077
- Whose stupidity was
it that didn't allow

387
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,579
a dead man to rest in peace?

388
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,831
- You never change, do you?

389
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,084
Right to the very last moment.

390
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,543
(laughs)

391
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,045
- Goodbye, Shou.

392
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,088
- Enjun, wait.

393
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,593
Rest in peace, Enjun.

394
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,096
Pleasant dreams.

395
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,854
- Wow, you're pretty
skilled with that thing.

396
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,898
- I never expected to
receive such a compliment

397
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,525
from a former prince,

398
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,694
especially one with so
much talent and taste

399
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:36,945
in the finer arts.

400
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,113
But on the other hand,

401
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,073
I don't remember ever
inviting you here.

402
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,786
What is it I can help you
with, little whirlwind?

403
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,916
- Well, I was planning
on having you drink this.

404
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,126
- My, oh my.

405
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,837
You know, it would
be much quicker

406
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,131
if you simply killed me
with that sword of yours.

407
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,801
- I'd love to do that
but it's more important

408
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,761
you receive judgment
for your crimes.

409
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,555
However, even if
I locked you away

410
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,057
in the most secure
prison I could find,

411
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,225
it's too risky to leave you

412
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,853
with your mental
capabilities intact.

413
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:10,812
- I take it back.

414
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,272
You don't have very good taste.

415
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,648
Honestly, trying to turn me

416
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,942
into living puppet
of all things.

417
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,486
- I'm simply fighting
poison with poison.

418
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,866
- How do you intend on making
me drink that, I wonder?

419
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,617
- Frankly, I first
considered beating you

420
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,286
until you fell
unconscious then forcing

421
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,830
the whole bottle
down your throat.

422
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,583
But in the end, that would've
taken far to much time

423
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,252
so I gave up on that idea.

424
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,628
Besides, I thought
I'd like to have

425
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,047
a little chat with you first.

426
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,134
Let's play a game, shall we?

427
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,136
We'll wager something we
each want from each other.

428
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,721
- Something I want from you?

429
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:47,182
Do you have he one thing
in this world I desire?

430
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,977
Are you telling me
she belongs to you?

431
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,062
- No, she doesn't.

432
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,730
But as long as I still exist,

433
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,066
I will never allow her to
fall into your possession.

434
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,276
- You are certainly a
hindrance in that regard.

435
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,153
My one desire is for that woman

436
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,572
to see only me and no one else.

437
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,949
And I suppose that
means your desire

438
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,117
is for me to become a puppet.

439
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,745
I see, it's a
reasonably fair trade.

440
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:09,621
All right.

441
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,580
You're on.

442
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,086
I had the bottle you brought
poured into one of these cups.

443
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,756
Of course, not even I know
which one it's been poured into.

444
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,841
How quickly does it take effect?

445
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,259
- Your body should
start going limp

446
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,929
in about the time it
takes to boil water.

447
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,889
- Then we may as well
enjoy a friendly drink

448
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,224
while we're talking, right?

449
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,894
Oh, by the way, I
neglected to mention...

450
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,604
That aside from your
drug, there should also

451
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,856
be lethal poison in
about five other cups.

452
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,858
The effect should
manifest themselves in,

453
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,695
more or less, the
same amount of time.

454
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,863
- That's disturbingly
thorough of you.

455
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,198
Am I supposed to
take it that you do

456
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,158
this sort of thing often?

457
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,869
- Excitement in
life is important.

458
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,788
Especially, for
a person like me.

459
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,583
It's not fun without a
little something like this.

460
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,711
- I'd like you to write
down what epitaph you want.

461
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,754
Something like, "I've
grown pessimistic

462
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,048
in my pathetic life
so I'm going to die."

463
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,092
- In that case, how about
writing one for yourself?

464
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,678
"Excuse me, I really
am quite careless.

465
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,305
I seem to have accidentally
swallowed poison and died."

466
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,395
As a show of hospitality,
I will go first.

467
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,980
If you don't mind, of course.

468
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,045
- Mr. Kokujun has be selected

469
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,463
as the new Head of the Sa Clan.

470
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,215
Things will be
hectic from hereon.

471
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,758
But if he works
together with Shunki

472
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,428
to overcome his difficulties,
he should be fine.

473
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,763
Huh, I don't see Seiran...

474
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:14,806
Or that man.
