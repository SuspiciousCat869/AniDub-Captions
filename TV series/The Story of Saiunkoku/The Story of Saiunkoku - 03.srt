1
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,426
(cool music)

2
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,806
(smooth music)

3
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,854
(flute music)

4
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,272
- [Narrator] One
month has passed since

5
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,358
Shuurei entered the
imperial palace.

6
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,985
In accordance with
his promise to her,

7
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,654
Ryuuki has attended
court section

8
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,447
every morning without fail.

9
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,285
And in the afternoon,
he's made a routine

10
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,538
of attending everyone
of Kouyuu's lessons

11
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,706
together with Shuurei.

12
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,503
- Well then I think we've
done enough for today.

13
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,713
- Right.

14
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,298
- Thank you very
much for teaching us.

15
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,509
So, tell me what
issue were discuss

16
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,052
in this morning's court session.

17
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,513
- Today we mainly discuss the
general lack of tax revenue.

18
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,349
- The lack of tax revenue?

19
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,767
- [Kouyuu] It's only
been eight years since

20
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,728
the chaos during this
struggle for the throne.

21
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,855
The country is not
fully stabilize yet.

22
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,691
So we can't expect
to collect much tax.

23
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,443
- On the other hand,
without enough money

24
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,278
we cannot run the country.

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,864
A suggestion was put forward
to slightly increase taxes.

26
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,824
- But you can't do
that! How can you

27
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,577
burden the people of this
country even further?

28
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,370
Instead of that you
should be thinking

29
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,456
about how to make
the people wealthy.

30
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,374
If you do that then
even if the tax rate

31
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,461
remains unchanged, your tax
revenue will still increase.

32
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,712
- Hmmm...

33
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,714
- That's very true! If
the state of the economy

34
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,300
improves the tax
revenue improves too!

35
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,385
Is really quite impressive
to have the foresight

36
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,929
to plan ahead for 10 or
20 years in the future.

37
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,474
It would be great
if you could take

38
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,476
the national exam
someday, Shuurei.

39
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,352
- Hmm mmm.

40
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,480
Yes, I would be.

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,940
(deep music )

42
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,904
(violin music)

43
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,949
- [Ryuuki] Brother? Why?

44
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,411
Don't go brother!

45
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,585
Oh! It's you Seiran.

46
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,504
- Please, forgive my intrusion.

47
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,673
You seem distress by your
nightmare your majesty

48
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,716
so I enter without permission.

49
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,842
- Ah, I see.

50
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,555
- Oh, you, you reached
out on your sleep

51
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,391
so I instinctively.

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,976
- Hmm.

53
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,521
How would you like to sleep
with me tonight Seiran?

54
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,022
- I, ahh, bahm.

55
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,484
I mean everybody has their
different tastes and so, ah...

56
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,445
- I was just joking.

57
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,035
(intriguing music)

58
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,537
- What's wrong?

59
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,416
- [Ryuuki] You're a fine man.
Perhaps a little too fine,

60
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,710
it's just, well I can't help

61
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,087
to fell that Shuurei
relays more on you

62
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,131
that she does on me. Of course,

63
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,425
You have been living with
her fro a very long time

64
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,510
so I can understand it.

65
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,596
But as Shuurei's
husband, I must admit,

66
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,682
it sometimes upsets me a little.

67
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,351
Alright. I've made a decision.

68
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,978
Starting right now I
will breach the gap

69
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,438
between my wife and I.

70
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,691
You won't need to
stand guard tonight.

71
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,609
- Your Majesty,
please wait a moment.

72
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,986
You'll catch a cold
dressed like that

73
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,404
the nights are still chilly,

74
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,114
won't you wear something warmer?

75
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,451
- I like Shuurei very much
but I like you too Seiran.

76
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,582
(dropping water)

77
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,168
- [Shuurei] Shusui, what
was that you just said?

78
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,586
- You and the king always seem

79
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,796
to get along so
well consort hand,

80
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,757
so, why is it that
you continue to sleep

81
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,761
separately at night? Everyone
finds that a little strange.

82
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,681
- Well, perhaps but that--- Ahh.

83
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,016
- Consort hand, are you alright?

84
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,726
Did you hurt yourself?

85
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,728
- I'll get the medicine
box right away!

86
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,648
- I don't know what
the confusion is about

87
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,484
the king prefers
men, wouldn't be

88
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,445
completely natural for him
not to come to my room?

89
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,490
- Oh my lady, is that
what you really believe?

90
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,408
- Think about it.

91
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,035
Whenever Seiran
and I are together

92
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,162
the king is always
staring at Seiran.

93
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,541
That mean he must have
feeling for Seiran.

94
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,878
- I think your being
oblivious ma'am. Right?

95
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,882
- Yes. There, is
all taken care of!

96
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,467
- Thank you Kourin.

97
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,886
- It's obvious that the
king cherish you very much,

98
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,472
consort hand. I'm
sure we really wishes

99
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,933
to take his time and nourish
the love between you.

100
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,521
- But still we hope to see a
royal heir before too long.

101
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,189
- Don't worry. We're
already planning

102
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,567
all the necessary preparation
for when the time comes.

103
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,654
- Preparations?
Preparations for what?

104
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,782
I do appreciate
you thoughtfulness

105
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,034
but you know this
kind of thing...

106
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,829
Well, you have to let
nature take its course.

107
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,664
- So that's how it is then.

108
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,212
Oh my! How beautiful.
Consort hand,

109
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,840
you really are
good at everything.

110
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,133
- Do you really think so?

111
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,427
I'm only good a
needlework because

112
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,804
I had to repair all
clothe day after day,

113
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,556
of course I'll be good about it!

114
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,100
- I'm afraid that my
needlework is quite terrible.

115
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,268
- Then if that's the case,

116
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,811
would you like me to teach you?

117
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,896
- Oh consort hand,
would you really?

118
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,815
- Oh, what's this? Is
there someone you'll

119
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,817
like to give a needlework to?

120
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,819
- That person that
always sends you letters?

121
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,821
You want to give
it to him, right?

122
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,031
- Yes, I do.

123
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,783
- He must be someone
very important to you.

124
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,285
I'm a little envious of that.

125
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,078
- But you shouldn't
be, consort hand,

126
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,205
you stated the king is
your important person.

127
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,958
- Well, hmm, I guest so.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,836
Shusui, why don't you join
us for needlework lessons?

129
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,839
- I'm afraid I'm not
too fond of needlework.

130
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,717
- So even you have something
you're not so good at.

131
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,303
- I was adopted in a sense
back when I was a child.

132
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,764
So I learned the manners
and etiquette of a lady

133
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,141
but I'm afraid of
this sort things.

134
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,102
- I see but even so
if he brought you

135
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,645
to work in the royal residency

136
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,814
he must have thought
very highly of you.

137
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,610
- Yes, he's a very
important person.

138
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,153
At least to me he is.

139
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,697
- So who is this person?

140
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,157
- Um um.

141
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,159
Come along child
is getting late.

142
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,911
You can learn how to
do embroidery tomorrow

143
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,996
for now we should
excuse ourselves.

144
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,958
- Yes, well then I wish a good
night and pleasant dreams.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,960
- Thank you, good
night to you too.

146
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,090
- I will be taking
my leave as well,

147
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,758
please have a good
night my lady.

148
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,802
- I will thank you
for all you hard work.

149
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,015
- Consort hand, this is serious!

150
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,017
- Kourin, where
are your manners?

151
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,104
- [Kourin] The king is
coming! He is on his way here!

152
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,647
- What? The king here?

153
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,275
What are you doing
here so late at night?

154
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,611
- I am here to breach the gap.

155
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,320
- Ahh...

156
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,743
Those flowers. Are they
supposed to be for me?

157
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:14,619
- Hmm mm.

158
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,708
- What? Don't tell me you picked
them with your bare hands,

159
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,751
They're all scratched!

160
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,337
And on top of that,
they're freezing cold!

161
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,047
That's probably because
you've been wandering

162
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,716
around with next to nothing on!

163
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,092
Hurry up and come inside!

164
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,807
(flute music)

165
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,893
- Those are pink roses.

166
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,356
- Oh, Seiran picked up those
earlier for me this afternoon.

167
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,359
Here, let me see your hands.
- Seiran...

168
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,736
Oh right.

169
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,279
- Goodness it must
be very painful,

170
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,948
didn't it hurt to pick
roses with your bare hands?

171
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,866
- Not really.

172
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,954
- These hands? They're all
calluses and thick skin.

173
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,250
Tell me, of you practice
swordsmanship Your Majesty?

174
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,835
- It's part of my
royal training,

175
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,086
So I learned a little.

176
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,089
- Oh, I see. It's just
they look like Seiran's.

177
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,050
- Shuurei...

178
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,259
- What is it?

179
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,636
- From now on call
me by my real name.

180
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,307
I just want you to
call me by my name.

181
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,100
- What's this all of the sudden.

182
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,436
- I'm the only person
you don't call by name.

183
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,812
It's not fair!

184
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,898
- It's not an issue
of being fair or not.

185
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,110
Ryuuki, like that?

186
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,112
- Hmm.

187
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,034
- Right, I understand.
But I only use it

188
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,327
when we are alone, okay?

189
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,789
- Ahh.

190
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,998
- Sorry.

191
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,418
- Why is it that
roses have thorns?

192
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,962
- Well is because the
rose princess fell in love

193
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,297
with a human man of course.

194
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,882
- What do you mean by that?

195
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,803
- Oh, don't you know it?
It's an old fairy tale.

196
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,097
- I don't know it,
no one's ever told me

197
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,807
those kind of stories before.

198
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,269
- Once upon a time,
there was a very

199
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:07,315
beautiful princess called
"the rose princess",

200
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,068
she had the amazing power
to heal all injuries

201
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,029
and cure any illnesses,
so many people

202
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,906
ask for her hand in marriage.

203
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,373
You're so hopeless.

204
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,296
Now then, where should I sleep?

205
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,009
This guy only likes
men in that kind of way

206
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,387
so is not like he's gonna
try anything weird with me.

207
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,016
At least I think, but
still just in case.

208
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,396
(yawns)

209
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,939
Good night.

210
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,734
(dropping water)

211
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,033
- consort hand! Good morn---

212
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,160
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

213
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,417
(intriguing music)

214
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,255
- What the? Your, Your
Majesty, please wake up!

215
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,758
Left go off me, please!

216
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,887
- I told you call
me by my real name.

217
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,057
- [Shuurei] No way, wake up!
Wake up right now I said!

218
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,475
Wake up!!!

219
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,186
(smooth music)

220
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,193
- [gossiping girl] I heard
the king and consort hand

221
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,903
finally share the same bed!

222
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,946
- [gossiping woman] Really?

223
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,406
- Yes. Apparently
one the mates saw it

224
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,158
with her own eyes.

225
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,868
- Well then if
that's the case...

226
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,870
- [Crowd] It's time
for celebration!

227
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,289
(calm music)

228
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,083
- So have you heard Kouyuu?

229
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,293
All those rumors about
the king and Shuurei?

230
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,128
- I'm not interested!

231
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,923
- What's wrong, you're
certainly in a bad mood.

232
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,800
- You knew, didn't
you? You knew from

233
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,343
the very beginning
that the king was

234
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,222
only pretending to be stupid!
Why didn't you say anything?

235
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,515
- You didn't need
me to tell you,

236
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,141
You still noticed it.

237
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,143
- Well, yeah. I would
be impossible to

238
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,896
learn as much as he
has in so a sort time!

239
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,314
There's no way anyone
could just take

240
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,484
only one month to grasp
what I spent years studying.

241
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:18,154
- They say a capable falcon
hides its talents, don't they?

242
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,449
Still, no matter how
talented a person is

243
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,992
if he doesn't use those talents

244
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,912
he's not different
from a useless buffoon.

245
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,916
As king he must do his best to
fulfill his responsibilities

246
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,459
but he makes no
attent to do that

247
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,130
he still the same spoiled,
stupid king as always.

248
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,339
- If you are telling
me all of this

249
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,882
then I assume you think there's

250
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,301
still hope for the
king for shape up.

251
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,846
- I supposed there
is, ever since

252
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,597
Shuurei came to the
palace's consort

253
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,350
things have become a little
bit more interesting.

254
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,185
- Maybe but if she
finds out the king

255
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,312
is only pretending to be stupid,

256
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,647
how do you thing she likely to

257
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,983
react to his little dissection.

258
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,277
- I imagined she would
be incredible angry.

259
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,946
- Hmm mm.

260
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:00,989
Serves him right.

261
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,582
- Give me a break.
What are you doing

262
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,209
walking in here
again so casually?

263
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,919
- I came to hear the
rest of yesterday's

264
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,047
rose princess story.

265
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,215
- Then I supposed you're
planing to sleep here again?

266
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,467
- Hmm mm.

267
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,136
- Alright, alright. I guess I'm

268
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,347
just gonna have to accept it.

269
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,557
We can't erase a rumor
that's already spread.

270
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,393
One night or two isn't going
a difference a this point.

271
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,564
- Were did you get those from?

272
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,274
- Oh, father gave them to me.

273
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,943
He said that his younger
brother sent them to him.

274
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,241
They're made of pure silver,
beautiful aren't they?

275
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,284
What's the matter?

276
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,288
- It's nothing.

277
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,000
- Oh, that's right!

278
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:57,712
(nice music)

279
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,589
This is for you.

280
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,424
- For me, why? Thank you.

281
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,051
Did you make this
yourself Shuurei?

282
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,388
- Well is not as if that
pattern appears on its own!

283
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,555
So, yes.

284
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,766
- You know what, this
is the first time

285
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,143
I've ever been given
anything like this.

286
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,522
- I don't do
embroidery very often,

287
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,274
so be sure to
treasure that, okay?

288
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,609
- Note even for Seiran?

289
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,153
Doesn't HE has
something like this?

290
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,573
- Hmm... I guess
not. I've mended his

291
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,785
clothes before but I never
done any embroidery for him.

292
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,703
- I see.

293
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,046
(dropping water)

294
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,799
- So last night
Shuurei gave you a gift

295
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,384
that she made by herself?

296
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,052
- Yeah.

297
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,180
- She certainly is
quite talented with
her hands, isn't she?

298
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,598
If you don't mind some advising

299
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,142
might I suggest
that you give her

300
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,310
a gift in return, Your Majesty

301
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,354
- That would certainly
make Shuurei very happy.

302
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,106
Women loves gits.

303
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,482
- A gift for Shuurei?

304
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,487
(festive music)

305
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,615
- [Gossiping Man] At any
rate the king certainly looks

306
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,160
like the ruler of the
country now, doesn't he?

307
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,703
- [Gossiping Old Man]
Marriage does change a man!

308
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,705
- [Gossiping Man] He's also
started actively participating

309
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,749
in court discussion as of late.

310
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,417
- [Gossiping Old Man] This
is really all thanks to

311
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,753
consort hand's good influence.

312
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,796
- [Gossiping Man] Look
He retains a dignified

313
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,549
presence even before the
provincial governors.

314
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,095
- Your Majesty allow me
to pour some wine for you.

315
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,224
(crowd talking)

316
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,355
- Now some wine for
consort hand as well?

317
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,272
- Thank you.

318
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,524
- Ah this one is empty already

319
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,362
you there bring some
more wine over here.

320
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,113
- Yes, right away My Lord.

321
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,373
- There you are, please enjoy.

322
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,417
- Oh, yes, of course. Thank
you very much My Lord.

323
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,256
YOUR MAJESTY!

324
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,559
- Consort hand doesn't
drink very much

325
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,146
so instead please allow me
to drink this on her behalf.

326
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,402
- Oh, impressive. I'm (mumbles).

327
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,242
- Honestly, what's
wrong with you!

328
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,535
Did that little big of wine

329
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,537
really get you this drunk?

330
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,123
- Yeah. That's
probably what it is.

331
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,250
- I'm taking you to
my room. It's closer.

332
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,589
- [Seyran] Your Majesty.

333
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,924
- Seyran?

334
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,426
- You've been...

335
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,635
Been poison.

336
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,263
- Poison? Then the
wine you drank...

337
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,686
- That's right, you were the
one that was intended for...

338
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,147
- If you knew it was poison,

339
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,523
then why did you drink it?

340
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,775
You should just have
thrown all that wine away!

341
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,527
- Rejecting any
way pour by other

342
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,321
in a banquet is considered
a incredible rude gesture.

343
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,948
If the king or the
consort would have done

344
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,700
such a thing, it
would have given rise

345
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,536
to unnecessary
speculation and rumor.

346
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,956
- But even so, wait a moment
I'll go get the doctor.

347
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,835
- Don't get it him involved.
It only make matters worst.

348
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:24,753
- But you...

349
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,382
- I'm all right. The
poison wasn't strong.

350
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,844
I doubt it was
intended to kill you,

351
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,182
anyway I should be fine
after a good night sleep.

352
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,685
Seyran, you may leave
for the evening.

353
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,520
- Yes.

354
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,647
- What about me?

355
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,232
- Please, stay here with me.

356
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,195
(dropping water)

357
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,738
I hate the darkness,

358
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:57,202
being alone in the
darkness. I hate it.

359
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,453
- Why is that?

360
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,705
- Long ago, I was
often locked away,

361
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,333
in the dark.

362
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,876
- By who?

363
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,879
- By my mother and brothers.

364
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,297
- But why?

365
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,299
- Because I was
an unwanted child.

366
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,845
The time of my birth was
inauspicious apparently.

367
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,722
I was the youngest
of six brothers

368
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,309
so my father's love for
me faded in comparison.

369
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,228
My mother was always
angry with me.

370
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,690
All I remember is
the fear I felt

371
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,817
when I was locked
in that storeroom,

372
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,862
for days on in,
my brothers didn't

373
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,739
treat me well either.

374
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,784
I was the youngest but
I was often overlooked,

375
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,746
if I was lucky, I was
kicked and beaten,

376
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,290
the perfect object to
vent their frustration on.

377
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,542
- [Shuurei] How could they!

378
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,585
- But even with
all that I was fine

379
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,380
as long as my big brother
Seien was there for me.

380
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,673
- Your big brother Seien?

381
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,385
- Yes, he was my
second eldest brother.

382
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,720
He taught me everything he could

383
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,430
from literature from math, when

384
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,639
my other brothers beat me,

385
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,725
he was the one that
treated my wounds,

386
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,603
- But wasn't your second
eldest brother...?

387
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,523
- Yes, he was. When
I was six years old

388
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,942
he was exiled from the palace.

389
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,777
(crying)
I couldn't stop crying.

390
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,365
Luckily, it was around
that time I met Shouka.

391
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,575
- [Shuurei] My father?

392
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,617
- [Ryuuki] When I
went to the archives

393
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,786
I was not longer alone.

394
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,540
But even so, I still
hate the night.

395
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,751
Being alone in the
dark makes me remember

396
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,587
things that I would
rather forget.

397
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,007
It brings back all
those terrible memories.

398
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,301
I don't wanna be
alone with them.

399
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,848
Shuurei would you
play the erhu for me?

400
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,434
(erhu music)

401
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,740
Your ehru's music sounds
like something divine.

402
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,785
It's so gentle and
warm in my heart.

403
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,833
(dropping water)

404
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,799
(flute music)

405
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,848
- Ah, Ryuuki! How
are you feeling?

406
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,141
- Don't worry, I'm fine now.

407
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,394
- Oh, thank goodness.

408
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,105
What's this on my hair?

409
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,773
- Actually, I had
originally planned

410
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,483
to give it to you yesterday.

411
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,902
- What? But, but this is...

412
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,070
One of this will fetch enough

413
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,656
money to build two
or three warehouses.

414
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:40,532
- Oh, really?

415
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,078
- Honestly, well anyway,
thank you very much.

416
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,625
Does it suit me?

417
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,420
- You look beautiful.

418
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,589
- What, what are you saying?

419
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:00,010
- So, from now on, is it
alright if I sometimes

420
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,595
come to listen to
you play the erhu?

421
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,431
- You can't sleep
alone, can you?

422
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,559
Well, I supposed
I can't be help.

423
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,980
(firmly steps)

424
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,566
- Lord Kouyuu Li,
Lord Shuuei Ran...

425
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,487
The king has sent me
to offer his greetings

426
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,989
and give these to you both.

427
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,202
- You mean the king is
offering these two flowers?

428
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,537
- Yes.

429
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,789
- Well, well. This
really is something.

430
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,792
I never expected
it to come to this.

431
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,587
But I didn't think you
usually use fresh flowers,

432
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,589
they are so common and vague.

433
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,467
- Indeed, I said the same
thing to the king, My Lord,

434
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,427
but he said it was urgent
and bid me to pick them

435
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,846
myself and delivery
to you right away.

436
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,723
- So he said is urgent.

437
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:50,602
Ah, I see. In that case,
I'll make my decision now.

438
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,565
How about you? What are
you going to decide?

439
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,151
- Please report to
the king that we have

440
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,570
both accepted the
flowers he offered.

441
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,946
- [Delivery Man] Yes My Lord.

442
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,453
- Honestly, I didn't
expect you to accept

443
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,038
the offer so willingly.

444
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,748
- To accept the
flower from the king

445
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,126
is to bow absolute loyalty
to him and his rule.

446
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:18,088
So it goes, but I
wasn't expecting him

447
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,756
to give us both irises.

448
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,925
So I figured, why not?

449
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,843
- Ah yes, the iris.

450
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,804
It carries a certain
meaning, it says

451
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,014
I put my faith in you, right?

452
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,934
- Plus they're purple, the
color of the royal family.

453
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,103
Is very cleaver of
him to use a flower

454
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,605
that conveys a double
meaning. Don't you think?

455
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,648
- Yeah.

456
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,693
- (beautiful music)

457
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,244
- Wait a minute, now
that I think about it,

458
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,579
how we could've known there
was poison in that wine

459
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,957
before he went
ahead and drank it?

460
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,751
Is it possible?
Could it be this guy

461
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,170
has exceptional
observation skills?

462
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,839
No, it's more than that.

463
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,801
During Lord Kouyuu's lessons

464
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,011
he isn't faced by anything,

465
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,929
not even the hardest questions

466
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,514
and during court
sessions he always

467
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,142
seem to rise insightful
opinion when he speaks.

468
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,272
It's so obvious, why did
I not notice earlier?

469
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,816
Ryuuki isn't a stupid king,

470
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:22,068
he's just pretending
to be one. But why?

471
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,033
HEY!, that's it. Is
because he finds it

472
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,702
amusing to watch me try so hard.

473
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,541
(furious sound)

474
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,001
Wake up Ryuuki.

475
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:39,669
- [Ryuuki] What are you doing?

476
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,755
- [Shuurei] I'm doing this.

477
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,214
- [Ryuuki] Ahhhhh.

478
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,763
(peaceful music)

479
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:04,671
- [Shuurei] That, that,
that damn Ryuuki, he's being

480
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,966
deceiving all this time. I
gonna return home right now!

481
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:11,302
What that? Don't I still
want the 500 gold coins?

482
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,722
Of course I do...
