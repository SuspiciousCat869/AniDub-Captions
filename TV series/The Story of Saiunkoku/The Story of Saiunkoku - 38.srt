00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,349
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

2
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,271
(peaceful music)

3
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,481
- [Narrator] During the season

4
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,525
when the leaves fall
from the treetops

5
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,695
and the freezing winds
chill the cheeks,

6
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,781
Shurei and her companions
were setting out for Kiyo

7
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,700
to attend the
palace celebration.

8
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,953
- Okay, we'll be off now.

9
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,788
- You know, Yuushun,
it's so like you

10
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,665
to go to Kiyo on business
for your honeymoon.

11
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,583
Honestly, it makes
me wanna laugh.

12
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,793
(coughs)

13
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,670
- Please don't worry,
my dear husband,

14
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:09,629
I don't mind at all.

15
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,297
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,508
Congratulations on your
wedding, both of you.

17
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,760
I'm so embarrassed, I didn't
realize you were engaged,

18
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,512
never mind married.

19
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,680
- It's certainly a relief

20
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,849
to see you two are
finally together.

21
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,142
- Honestly, Lord Yuushun,

22
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,935
for you to take my elder
sister as your bride,

23
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,480
you may be the most
amazing man in Sa Province.

24
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,940
- (coughs) Well, if
there's nothing else,

25
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,483
should we be getting underway?

26
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,401
- You bet.

27
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,238
- Take care of
yourselves, everyone.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,866
- We'll be sure to keep things
in order while you're gone.

29
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,409
- I'll be counting on you.

30
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,580
- (whips crack) Go!

31
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,458
(horse whinnies)

32
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,876
- I heard that Lord
Yushun and Miss Rin Sai

33
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,463
have been secretly in love
for more than 10 years!

34
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,006
It's wonderful, isn't it?

35
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:53,923
- Yeah.

36
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,555
Let's hope our proposal
has a happy ending as well.

37
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,935
(peaceful music)

38
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,031
- Oh, hello, Your Majesty,

39
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,867
you're here a little
earlier than usual today.

40
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,785
- Hmm.

41
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,922
- It seems General
Ran and Lord Kouyuu

42
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,466
have been busy making
preparations to
welcome the New Year,

43
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,843
so they haven't been by
to visit me much lately.

44
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,930
- Shouka.

45
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:42,806
- Yes?

46
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,309
- I've just found out that
Shurei is coming home.

47
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,819
I feel better now.

48
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,530
I'd better get back to work.

49
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,532
- I suppose the only
thing I can do for you

50
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,742
is give you a break
with a quick cup of tea.

51
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,786
- Shouka?

52
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,079
- Yes?

53
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,580
- Don't worry about me.

54
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,832
I'm all right, I promise.

55
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,927
- The question is, are
we going to be able

56
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,471
to get the Matter of Proof
by the Royal Council?

57
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,808
Governor Hong, everything will
be resting on your shoulders.

58
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,309
- Hmm.

59
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,520
- Think of it this way, if
we're unable to convince them,

60
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,814
we won't be able to show our
faces in Sa Province again.

61
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,025
- Hmm, yes I understand.

62
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,114
- (groans) We're almost there!

63
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,575
Kiyo City is getting closer!

64
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,118
- Of course, that's
the whole reason

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,829
we're making the horses run,
so we can get there faster.

66
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,041
- I wish I was manly and
brave like you, Miss Rin.

67
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,168
Even Ensei was saying that.

68
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,003
He said that if you
asked all the young girls

69
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,463
who they thought the strongest

70
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,131
and smartest person
in Sa Province was,

71
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,468
Miss Rin Sai would win
the vote in a landslide.

72
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,178
(Rin laughs)

73
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,679
- Huh.

74
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,514
- You should relax, we'll
be entering Kiyo soon.

75
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,392
(peaceful music)

76
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,487
- So we're back in the
Spiritual Center of Dreams,

77
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,822
guarded by the eight
colored enlightened ones.

78
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,909
- But right now, all my
dreams lie in Sa Province.

79
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:33,667
(fireworks crackle)
(crowd cheers)

80
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,170
(upbeat traditional music)

81
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,928
- (grunts) All right
now, let's see,

82
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,055
first I make some tea, right,

83
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,683
and of course they'll
probably be hungry

84
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,184
after their long trip.

85
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,728
(horse neighs)

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,147
(bird tweets)

87
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,527
- Ah, Shurei!

88
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,444
Welcome home.

89
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,907
(traditional music)

90
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,006
- Please be on your way.

91
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,298
- Huh?

92
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,676
- You've got the look of
a government official.

93
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,593
You have work to do, don't you?

94
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,515
- Yes, I'll go and do my best.

95
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,225
After that, I'll say I'm home.

96
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,936
- Welcome home, Seiran.

97
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,146
I'm happy to see you back.

98
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,063
- Huh?

99
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,232
Hmm.

100
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,901
- [Shurei] I'm sorry
to have made you wait.

101
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,029
- [Rin] Are you really
satisfied with just that?

102
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,532
You haven't seen your father
for a long time, after all.

103
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,994
- Yes, but Father told
me to be on my way.

104
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,787
He said that right now,

105
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,123
I have the air of a
government official.

106
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,792
- He sounds like a
very good father.

107
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,961
- What will you do
next, Miss Rin Sai?

108
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,755
- I'll visit the Hong
clan's main branch

109
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,298
to begin negotiations
for the rights

110
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,300
to the luminous
seven-colored paint.

111
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,719
- Good, I'll be counting on you.

112
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,513
We'll need the funds
to establish the plan.

113
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,557
- If the paint can be
manufactured in Sa Province,

114
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,975
it will lead to
significant profits,

115
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,519
which we can use to
finance our project.

116
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,897
- I suspect the negotiations
will proceed smoothly,

117
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,273
without any problems.

118
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,275
We already have a firm
promise from the Hong clan

119
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,152
that the Merchant's
Guild of Sa Province

120
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,695
will acquire the
production method

121
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,614
for the luminous
seven-colored paint,

122
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,866
as well as rights to
all derivative works.

123
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,744
- Then all that remains
is the palace celebration.

124
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,831
- (whimpers) This is it,
we've finally arrived.

125
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,750
What should I do?

126
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,711
- Ah, look, just try to
prepare yourself, okay?

127
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,548
(peaceful traditional music)

128
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,680
Well, Mr. Kokujun,
good luck in there.

129
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,889
- What?!

130
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,307
- Since the official
palace celebration

131
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,934
is only open to
the representatives

132
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,143
of the seven colored clans

133
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,937
and high officials
from the Royal Council,

134
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,773
we'll be greeting His
Majesty after the ceremony.

135
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,150
- So I'll be going
in there all alone?

136
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,694
- That's right.

137
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,028
- Please go in and formally
extend your greetings

138
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,197
as the new head of the Sa clan.

139
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,700
(whimpers)

140
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,761
- [Kokojun Voiceover]
They all seem

141
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,138
like such important people.

142
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,889
I feel so stupid.

143
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,224
I wanna go home already.

144
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,268
- Kokojun!

145
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,185
- Yes?

146
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,939
Oh, Mr. Ryuuren!

147
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:43,940
(crowd chattering)

148
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,316
- What?
- Did he say Ryuuren?

149
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,901
- [Man In Crowd] The
genius from the Ran clan?

150
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,902
- There he is!
- That must be him,

151
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,070
that's Ryuuren Ran.

152
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,364
- Boy, I am so glad
to see you here.

153
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,657
- [Man In Crowd] Who's he?

154
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,618
Ryuuren Ran just
called out to him.

155
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,747
- [Reishin] Oh, Lord Kokojun Sa?

156
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,622
- Hmm?

157
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,668
(crowd whispers)

158
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,086
- Come over this way.

159
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,129
- Ah, yes sir.

160
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:13,011
- I'm Reishin Hong, head of
the Hong clan main branch.

161
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,097
I would like to extend
my congratulations

162
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,767
on your recent appointment
as head of the Sa clan.

163
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,854
- [Man In Crowd] So that man
is the new head of the Sa clan?

164
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,773
- [Man In Crowd] Lord
Reishin congratulated him,

165
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,648
he must be.

166
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,153
- Please excuse me.

167
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,406
Lord Kokojun Sa
made his appearance

168
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,368
at the palace celebration
without incident.

169
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,119
Accompanied by the
head of the Hong clan

170
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,704
and by Lord Ryuuren Ran.

171
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,997
The court is
buzzing with a rumor

172
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,123
that we could be
witnessing the birth

173
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,750
of a young and
shrewd clan leader

174
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,294
who could surpass
even advisor Enjun Sa.

175
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,420
- Huh?

176
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,922
- (laughs) It appears
that our friend,

177
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,465
Lord Kokujun, has
been able to attract

178
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,677
some important allies from both
the Hong and the Ran clans.

179
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,429
- [Shurei Voiceover] Huh?

180
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,973
An important person
from the Hong clan?

181
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,308
Could it be uncle Kuro?

182
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,812
(peaceful music)

183
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,271
- My intention was
to wait until after

184
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,899
the palace celebration to
start negotiating, but.

185
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,275
- I understand.

186
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,111
To be frank, I wasn't
expecting to have the free time

187
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,904
to meet now, either.

188
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,739
- [Kurou Voiceover]
Elder brother Rei's
the head of the clan

189
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,990
and should be handling this,

190
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,325
but he's determined
to stay at the palace

191
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,702
and get a glimpse of Shurei,

192
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,370
even if it's only
from a distance.

193
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,830
- Anyway, regarding the matter

194
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,790
of the luminous
seven-colored paint.

195
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,001
- My niece, Shurei, I
should say Governor Hong,

196
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,336
has been kind enough to
inform me of the details.

197
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,838
- She's a good
government official.

198
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,923
She plays her cards
without any hesitation.

199
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,341
Impressive, isn't she?

200
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,510
- Indeed, she refused
to take advantage

201
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,053
of the fact that I'm her uncle.

202
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,221
She made her request

203
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,890
strictly as the
governor of Sa Province.

204
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,183
- [Kurou Voiceover]
It still amazes me

205
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,019
that someone as
absent-minded as my brother

206
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,979
could raise such a
competent daughter.

207
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,899
- The official palace
celebration appears to be over.

208
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,151
Now it will be our turn.

209
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,195
It's true that
we're not obligated

210
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,488
to make a formal appearance

211
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,198
before the officials
at the Royal Court,

212
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,825
but there may be
quite a few onlookers

213
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,452
when we make our
greetings to the King.

214
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,078
- Huh?

215
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,288
- It's common for people to
show up for the greetings

216
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,373
of officials they
take an interest in.

217
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,666
- Are you trying to tell me

218
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,169
that we're going to be
the center of attention?

219
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,128
- Why, naturally.

220
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,882
We did suppress the chaos
in Sa Province, after all.

221
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,218
This is going to be
my first time meeting

222
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,387
His Majesty since he
ascended to the throne.

223
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,057
I wonder how much he's
changed since then.

224
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,767
- Mr. Yuushun, the
way you say it,

225
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,226
it makes it sound
like you don't think

226
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,103
too fondly of the King.

227
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,521
- I suppose that's true.

228
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,398
As far as I could tell, at
His Majesty's coronation,

229
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,442
he had no motivation
or desire to rule.

230
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,235
It was rather disheartening.

231
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,904
- But now he's--

232
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,947
- Yes, I'm aware.

233
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,117
I've heard many good things
about him from Ensei,

234
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,871
but still, in the end, I have
to see it with my own eyes.

235
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,916
- That's very harsh of you.

236
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,251
- I simply feel that regardless
of what reason he had

237
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,503
for deciding to take the throne,

238
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,463
he must be willing to
carry the obligations

239
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,799
and responsibilities
that come with it,

240
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,928
even if that should result in
a path of eternal loneliness.

241
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,516
- Eternal loneliness?

242
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,536
(crowd chatters)

243
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,209
- It's finally
time, Your Majesty.

244
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,964
I wonder if Shurei is going
to be able to make it.

245
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,549
- I somehow doubt she'd get lost

246
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,384
on her way here like you would.

247
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,593
- [Kouyuu] You're right,

248
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,262
Shurei may have gotten
lost along the road,

249
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,472
but she's still
found a way this far.

250
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,390
- Hmm.

251
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,186
- Finally, the
representatives of Sa Province

252
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,479
will make their greetings.

253
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,023
- Hmm.

254
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,358
- Look at all the officials
who came out just to see them.

255
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,318
- You and I came
as well, didn't we?

256
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,404
- Huh? (chuckles)

257
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,614
- Well, look who's here.

258
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,992
Seems like everyone's
decided to show up.

259
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,745
- You're right, and that
includes you too, secretary Ro.

260
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,080
- It's one of my few
too pleasures in life.

261
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,249
Nothing can match witnessing
the triumphant return

262
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,501
of my former students
with my own eyes.

263
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,087
(panting)

264
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,005
- [Hakumei Voiceover]
She's come back?

265
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,681
- (grunts) Excuse me!

266
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,446
Secretary Ro!

267
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,656
- Hm?

268
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,116
Oh, have you come to
see your contemporary's

269
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,285
hour of triumph after ending
the chaos in Sa Province?

270
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,288
- Hmm, it may be
true that the stories

271
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,040
of governor Hong and governor To

272
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,291
taking a hand in the appointment

273
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,459
of the head of the Sa clan,

274
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,044
as well as making
the mass arrests

275
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,671
have caused a lot of shock
waves through the court,

276
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,632
but that's nothing.

277
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,134
I think I'm the only one
who wasn't surprised by it.

278
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,512
After all, it's only
natural for them to succeed.

279
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,722
- Hmm.

280
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,307
(giggles)

281
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,226
- You're being creepy.

282
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,144
Shut up, as if you could
possibly understand

283
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,146
the feelings I'm
having right now.

284
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,565
At long last, I'm finally
going to get the chance

285
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,442
to meet my adorable niece again.

286
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,777
- You mean you're
going to get the chance

287
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,362
to watch her from afar.

288
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,323
I, on the other hand, will be
congratulating her afterwards.

289
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,825
- Enough of your impudence!

290
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,452
(gong chimes)

291
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,414
- Presenting the Honorable
Lady Shurei Hong,

292
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,501
governor of Sa Province, and
the Honorable Lord Yuushun Tei,

293
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,628
lieutenant governor
of Sa Province.

294
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,631
- Hmm.

295
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:48,221
- Hmm.

296
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:57,230
(door creaks)
(gasps)

297
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,705
- [Hakumei Voiceover]
She's become beautiful.

298
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,400
- I, Shurei Hong,
governor of Sa Province,

299
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,611
along with Lieutenant
Governor, Yuushun Tei,

300
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,113
present ourselves
before Your Majesty.

301
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,164
- Both of you, please,
raise your heads.

302
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,126
(peaceful music)

303
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,150
- On behalf of Sa Province,

304
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,319
I humbly extend our
happiest and deepest

305
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,488
well-wishes on the
coming of the New Year.

306
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,672
(crowd gasps and murmurs)

307
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,808
- Yuushun Tei, you have
supported Sa province

308
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,686
diligently for
these last 10 years.

309
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:00,937
(gasps)

310
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,897
Forgive us for helping so late.

311
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,739
Our thanks to you as
well, Governor Hong.

312
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,867
(gasps)

313
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,870
- [Shurei] Your Majesty.

314
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,621
- Hmm?

315
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,206
- Hmm.

316
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,834
- While this is a ceremony
to celebrate the New Year,

317
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,504
there's another matter that I
would like to present to you.

318
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,839
- What is it?

319
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,507
- It is a very important issue

320
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,593
concerning the future
of Sa Province.

321
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,762
(crowd grumbles)

322
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,889
- [Hakumei Voiceover]
What is she up to?

323
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,474
- Governor Hong, we
are in the middle

324
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,808
of the palace celebration!

325
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,357
- What's the fuss about, let's
hear what she has to say.

326
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,526
If it's concerning the
future of Sa Province

327
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,528
then it must be
a cheerful topic,

328
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,696
wouldn't that be most suitable

329
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,240
for truly joyous New
Year celebration?

330
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,909
What do you think, Your Majesty?

331
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,413
(quiet music)

332
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,852
- Very well then,
please lift your head

333
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,604
and share your proposal with us.

334
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,572
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

335
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,533
Well then, up until now,

336
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,702
there has not been an
industry within Sa Province

337
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,704
that would serve as
a source of revenue.

338
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,996
That is one reason
why it has been

339
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,416
mired in unrest for so long.

340
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,751
Although Sa Province has
welcomed in a new era,

341
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,713
unless we aim for further
development and growth now,

342
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,089
the quality of
life for the people

343
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,550
will be no more enriched
than it was before.

344
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,885
- And so?

345
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,430
- Our intention is to establish

346
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,474
a provincial research
institution in Sa Province.

347
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,354
Be it in medicine, pharmacy,
engineering, or fine arts,

348
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,606
we would gather together
specialists and researchers

349
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,067
in different fields and
provide them with a forum,

350
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,404
and by doing so, we'd
initiate a broad range

351
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,822
of investigation
and development,

352
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,116
not merely for the benefit
of Sa Province alone,

353
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,368
but for all of
Saiunkoku's future.

354
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,334
- You wish to make Sa
Province an academic center?

355
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,460
- [Shurei] Yes.

356
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,670
- Is this your personal opinion,

357
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,673
or is this a proposal from
the provincial government?

358
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,675
- It's from the
provincial government.

359
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,472
- With all due respect,

360
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,349
we have gone to the trouble
of making a document

361
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,142
providing the contents
of our plan in detail

362
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,019
for your deliberation.

363
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,146
- You'd think just rescuing
the province from chaos

364
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,731
would take all their effort,

365
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,776
and yet they also worked
out a plan like this?

366
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,778
- [Shurei] Of course, Sa
province cannot make this plan

367
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,905
succeed alone, we
do need support.

368
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,490
- [Yuushun] One would
estimate this would require

369
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,783
a vast amount of capital.

370
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:00,950
- [Shurei] With
regards to funding,

371
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,369
we've been promised the full

372
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,037
cooperation of the
Sa Province branch

373
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,914
of the Merchant's Guild.

374
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,082
- But it would be a great amount

375
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,416
even for the Merchant's
Guild to cover.

376
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,918
Where would they
get the finances?

377
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,044
- The Hong clan will transfer

378
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,504
rights and production
methods for the

379
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,173
luminous seven-colored
paint to the guild.

380
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,675
- [Shuuei] I see.

381
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,177
- Your Majesty, would you kindly
conduct a review of my plan

382
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,846
and discuss it while the
Royal Court is in session?

383
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,939
I humbly beseech
your consideration.

384
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,486
- You believe this plan
will open up the future

385
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,071
for the country of Saiunkoku?

386
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,531
- Yes, I do.

387
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,699
I'm confident that study

388
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,867
not only opens the
path to the future

389
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,703
but helps to build it as well.

390
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,705
I myself have come
as far as I have

391
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,123
by these very same means.

392
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,501
But unless we do something,

393
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,962
Sa Province will have no future.

394
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,631
I humbly ask that you
kindly give this matter

395
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,133
your full consideration.

396
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,977
- [Hakumei] Your Majesty.

397
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,812
I, for one, would like
to hear more details

398
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,480
about this proposal.

399
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,565
- Huh?

400
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,482
Hakumei?

401
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,027
- Myself as well.

402
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,111
- I'm interested too.

403
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,947
- I would like to hear them.

404
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,034
- Well, that goes for me too.

405
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,723
- This proposal has certainly
caught our attention,

406
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,641
we find it very intriguing.

407
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,602
You have our word that
we will look over it

408
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,936
and consider your plan.

409
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,648
(gasps)

410
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,779
(crowd murmurs in agreement)

411
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,031
(applause)

412
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,145
- Governor Hong,
that was magnificent.

413
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,649
Oh dear, are you all right?

414
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,943
- I'm so glad.

415
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,237
I'm so glad the proposal
will be considered.

416
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,781
(peaceful music)

417
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:45,657
- Hey!

418
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,828
It's good to see you back.

419
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,995
- Oh, Hakumei.

420
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,125
Thank you very much.

421
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,964
- Welcome back to Kiyo, Shu.

422
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,007
- Everyone.

423
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,133
- You still have much to learn,

424
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,300
but that was an impressive show

425
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,302
of your talents as an official.

426
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,179
- But things are only gonna
get tougher from here on.

427
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,097
- Right.

428
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,225
- It's impressive
that that young lady

429
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,102
thought of a plan that
will open up the future

430
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,937
for the entire country,

431
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,190
but don't you think this
is all a little bit rushed?

432
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,693
- They say there is
no today after today.

433
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,779
I'm sure my niece
knows that to be true,

434
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,574
that there's always a chance
tomorrow will never come.

435
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,870
- The road ahead is still long,

436
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,288
but we've taken the first step

437
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,874
towards rebuilding Sa Province.

438
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,043
For the sake of
realizing this plan,

439
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,086
I've got to keep on
working hard at it.

440
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:51,681
(singing in foreign language)

441
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,169
- [Shurei Voiceover]
Many things have happened

442
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,421
since I first entered the palace

443
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,339
to help with Ryuuki's education.

444
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,049
My dream has come true!

445
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,134
This isn't the end,

446
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,927
I'll continue to keep moving.

447
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,303
Thank you everyone,

448
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,389
and please keep supporting
me from now on, too.
