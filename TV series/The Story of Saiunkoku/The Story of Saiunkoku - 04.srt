1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,676
(whooshing sound)

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,182
(foreign language romantic song)

3
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,355
- [Narrator] Even
though being angry

4
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,357
never did anyone any good,

5
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,901
Shure found herself
furious this morning.

6
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,529
She had come to the
palace to tutor the king,

7
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,281
who seemed to have no interest
in government affairs.

8
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,366
However,

9
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,534
(deep laughter)

10
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,411
- [Speaker 1] What's
so amusing, Sho?

11
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,870
- [Sho] I was just
thinking about how well

12
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,039
my plan seems to be working.

13
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,667
His majesty has begun
to learn how to govern,

14
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,960
and he even took action

15
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,546
and saved Concert
Hong from danger.

16
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,880
- [Aba] The daughter
of the Hong family

17
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,924
has certainly done her job well.

18
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,718
- [Speaker 1] Aba, to
think that all this time,

19
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,803
his blatant ignorance
and lack of motivation

20
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,763
were nothing more than an act.

21
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,723
- [Sho] It seems the king

22
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,474
should not be underestimated.

23
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,892
(door bursts open)

24
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,686
- [Speaker 2] Concert
Hong, you mustn't.

25
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,062
- [Sho] Well, if it isn't Shure.

26
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,564
- [Speaker 1] What
is the problem.

27
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,773
- [Shure] Forgive me my lords,

28
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,442
but I must request
that I be released

29
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,068
from the Royal Herm immediately!

30
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,404
- [Sho] And may I ask
what reason you have

31
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,780
for such a request?

32
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,282
- [Shure] That man is
not a stupid king at all,

33
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,743
he's just pretending
to be a stupid king!

34
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,910
- [Aba] And?

35
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,079
- [Shure] I'm
returning home now!

36
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,622
- [Sho] Thanks to
you, Concert Hong,

37
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,042
the King has changed
greatly, for the better.

38
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,209
- [Shure] Huh?

39
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,502
- [Sho] The palace
is buzzing with talk,

40
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,754
praising your efforts.

41
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,672
However, if you should leave now

42
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,716
The king would
lose interest again

43
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,511
and everything will return
to the way it was before.

44
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,513
- [Sho] There is one
other rumor that everyone

45
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,931
is talking about.

46
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,516
You might want to consider it.

47
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,934
It's the one about
you and the king

48
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,603
spending your nights together.

49
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,897
- [Shure] What! But I!

50
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,483
- [Sho] We agreed on a
reward of 500 gold coins

51
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,652
if you want to receive it
I expect you to fulfill

52
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,571
your part of the deal.

53
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,989
(evil laughter)

54
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,616
- [Shure] This is all because
I got blinded by those

55
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,658
stupid coins.

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,744
I hate being poor.

57
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,039
(whimsical flute music)

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,877
- [King Reiuke] I never
imagined she would get so angry

59
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,463
and then to learn she's
only my temporary wife.

60
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,632
- [Shureon] Huh?

61
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,425
- I'm crushed.

62
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,968
- Why were you
pretending to be stupid

63
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,595
all this time?

64
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,680
- Because I thought
it would make

65
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,015
Shure pay more attention
to me that way.

66
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,768
- Your majesty
please excuse me, but

67
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,145
the truth is you've
been with women before,

68
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:49,979
haven't you?

69
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,855
- Uh

70
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,731
- Quite a few if I may.

71
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,816
- How did you know?

72
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,484
- Mostly I can tell by the way

73
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,611
you are when you're with Shure.

74
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,154
Why have you been hiding it?

75
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,572
- Hmm

76
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,740
(slow piano music
plays in background)

77
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,534
I felt that if I
were to have children

78
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,452
it would only lead to
great trouble and strife

79
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,912
in the future.

80
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,914
- As in Civil War?

81
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,666
- I always thought
that even though

82
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,835
I'm King now, someone
else would eventually

83
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,920
take the throne instead.

84
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,006
- So in order to
avoid the risk of

85
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,091
having children, you've
allowed people to believe

86
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,634
that you only like men?

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,471
Certainly before Shure came

88
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,806
that rumor was enough.

89
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,599
It kept those with
any power from sending

90
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,684
their daughters to the palace

91
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,477
as potential consorts for you.

92
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,898
Tell me your majesty,
have you ever

93
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,525
truly been in love?

94
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,619
I can at least give you credit

95
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,954
for your taste in women.

96
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,873
However, right now
you have got to think.

97
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,207
Since you have upset Shure

98
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,126
it's up to you to make
up for what you've done.

99
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,878
In the meantime, I
will be sure to find

100
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,421
the source of that poison.

101
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,758
I'll answer to the trust
you've placed in me.

102
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,802
I have accepted your
purple iris after all.

103
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,055
- Thank you.

104
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,724
- [Aba] The king is
starting to look somewhat

105
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,975
like a real ruler.

106
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,727
What a relief.

107
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,021
- [Sho] It's too
soon to be relieved.

108
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,690
We must find the
person who attempted to

109
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,108
poison Concert Hong.

110
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,903
- [Speaker 1] Has
Concert Hong been advised

111
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,447
not to discuss that
incident with anyone else?

112
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,991
If it leaks out it
could cause anxiety

113
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,826
within the palace.

114
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,245
- [Sho] She'll keep
quiet regardless.

115
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,831
Otherwise it would
only worry her father.

116
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,668
- [Aba] I wonder who
could have done it.

117
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,253
- [Sho] If his majesty
Prince Seayun was still here

118
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,631
that stupid King
wouldn't need to pretend

119
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,882
to be stupid in the first place.

120
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,259
- [Speaker 1] Prince
Seayun he was always

121
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,762
the most outstanding
of all the princes.

122
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,181
If he were still here,
the fight for the throne

123
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,100
might never have happened.

124
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,936
- [Sho] After he was exiled
we lost track of him,

125
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,648
in fact, we don't even
know if he is still alive.

126
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,112
- [Shure] So that's what
it means to be crafty.

127
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,950
- [Shoka] Even though I
work within the palace

128
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,077
I don't involve myself
in politics at all.

129
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,914
When I allowed you to
become king's consort

130
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,249
it was not so that
our family could take

131
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,167
political advantage of you.

132
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,255
- You knew about everything,
didn't you father?

133
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,132
- I first met
Reiuke shortly after

134
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,967
I started working
in the archives.

135
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,596
One day a young
boy turned up here

136
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,557
covered in scratches
and bruises.

137
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,560
I was shocked to see
him but I treated

138
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,520
his wounds myself
as best as I could.

139
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,692
He was a rather quiet
and solemn young boy.

140
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,861
It was quite a long
time before I found out

141
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,237
who the child was.

142
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,698
But after a while
he finally opened up

143
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,617
and started to talk
to me about his mother

144
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,620
and his brothers and about
the second eldest prince

145
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,289
who was the only
person in the palace

146
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,540
who ever loved him.

147
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,626
Whenever he came to the
archives, he was always

148
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,920
covered in scratches and cuts.

149
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,881
Even after his mother
passed away his brother

150
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,758
still continued to beat him.

151
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,845
All I could do for that
small boy was to be

152
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,722
there for him and listen to him.

153
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,683
(Shure cries softly)

154
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,312
Shure that man has the highest
status, a grand palace,

155
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,939
and every material
thing that would make

156
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,025
normal people envy him.

157
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,569
But when it comes to
crucial fundamental things

158
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,905
in life we take for
granted; a mother's love

159
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,865
a tender word, a soft caress

160
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,075
he's never really known them.

161
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,910
Those joys were never
within his reach.

162
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,911
However,

163
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,958
it's all right now
that you're here.

164
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,128
You're closer to him
than I could ever be.

165
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,924
Shure, please take
care of King Reiuke.

166
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:58,937
- [Koim] Ah!

167
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,858
It looks like Shure
has figured it out too.

168
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,026
- [Shureon] Oh, you're
talking about the stupid

169
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,903
act that the King
has been putting on.

170
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,823
- Still, it doesn't
seem very likely

171
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,990
that she will leave now.

172
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,160
- It's Saeron.
Speaking of which,

173
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,664
I wonder if he received a
flower from the king too.

174
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,373
- Who knows?

175
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,087
- Hey Saeron,

176
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,049
have you heard the rumor

177
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,384
from the ladies in waiting?

178
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,386
- [Saeron] You mean the
one about Lady Shure

179
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,221
and the king?

180
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,098
- Right, what do
you think about it?

181
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,350
- Well if you really must ask me

182
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,977
I think there's only
a one in ten chance

183
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:39,978
anything happened.

184
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,898
- So composed.
Honestly, you're no

185
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,316
fun to tease at all.

186
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,405
If you're that confident
about the matter

187
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,323
there must be a
reason behind it.

188
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,742
Am I right?

189
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,036
You've been in a very
tempting situation.

190
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,455
Shoka, yourself, and
Shure all three of you

191
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,831
living together?

192
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,666
Only Shoka is
guarding the treasure

193
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,752
and he isn't much of a guard.

194
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,253
And you are a grown
man in your twenties

195
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,130
in the prime of your life.

196
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,675
(glistening)

197
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,305
Come on, tell the truth.

198
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,890
- Nothing's going on.

199
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,016
(fighting noises)

200
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,351
- [Shureon] Huh.

201
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,356
(dramatic harp music)

202
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,026
- [Shureon] Advisor So

203
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:34,115
- [Advisor So] Huh, oh, it's
Shureon, and you're, huh.

204
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,163
I would like you
to be my opponent.

205
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,206
- [Saeron] Uh, me my lord?

206
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,457
- Yes, you.

207
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,167
- Advisor So used
to be a commander

208
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,543
of unmatched prowess.

209
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,213
He has fought in many
battles and won great honor.

210
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,222
(Peaceful music plays)

211
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,398
(swords clanking)

212
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,777
- [Advisor So] Your
blocking is good.

213
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,487
- [Saeron] General So.

214
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,742
- You're Saeron right?

215
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,285
- I am.

216
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,245
- How old are you?

217
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,373
- I'll be 21 soon.

218
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,416
- Is that true?

219
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,919
- Thirteen years ago
Shoka took you in

220
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,295
did he not?

221
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,506
What were you doing
before that time?

222
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,259
- Well,

223
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,972
(swords clanking)

224
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,391
- Your skills aren't bad.

225
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,227
You appear to be self
taught but a style of

226
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,396
swordsmanship learned
while young does not

227
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,190
simply disappear
from one's memory.

228
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,109
Your form is very
similar to that of a man

229
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,153
I once knew.

230
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,030
I'm sure the gentleman
standing over there

231
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,322
has noticed it as well.

232
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,074
He is a General after all.

233
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,286
I never thought I would
live to see that style

234
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,246
of swordsmanship again.

235
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,081
Even King Reiuke
does not know it

236
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,293
despite me tutoring him in
the ways of the sword myself.

237
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,004
That Prince always used
to call me General So

238
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,089
in the same way
that you just did.

239
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,803
(dramatic drum music plays)

240
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,814
- [Shure] Saeron,
perfect timing.

241
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,483
Here, I made white radish cakes.

242
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,904
I just baked them earlier today,

243
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,614
the crispy outside and
the shredded radish

244
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,324
make a great
combination, don't they?

245
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,034
- [Saeron] They do.

246
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,494
- I was hoping that the
king would be able to

247
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,828
try a few too.

248
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,455
But I got so angry with him.

249
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,998
I wonder if he's okay.

250
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,459
- I'm sure he's fine.

251
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,086
- I guess he must
have his own reasons

252
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,630
for pretending to be
a stupid king, right?

253
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,049
It's not easy to be a king.

254
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,426
I think I understand that now.

255
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,552
- That's very true.

256
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,058
- Hey Saeron?

257
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,476
- What is it?

258
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,602
- Are the men in the Left
Urine Army harassing you?

259
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,104
Be honest.

260
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,605
You have outstanding
skills and you've got a

261
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,440
pretty face. Now that
I think about it I bet

262
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,526
someone like you
would get singled out.

263
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,986
- My lady, nothing is going on.

264
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,947
- Then what is it?

265
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,325
What is it that's been
troubling you so much?

266
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,869
- I just can't win against
you can I Lady Shure?

267
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,249
- Tell me if something
is bothering you, okay?

268
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,252
I'm always coming to you
when I want to complain

269
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,171
Searon so it's only fair
that you do the same.

270
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,216
But, that will
probably never happen

271
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,634
You've never done
anything like that,

272
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,344
not even once.

273
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,596
Honestly, how am I supposed
to even begin to repay you

274
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,473
for everything you
have done for me.

275
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,146
- You already repaid
me a long time ago.

276
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,107
Whenever I see you
just being yourself

277
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,526
it always gives me more
strength and energy.

278
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,195
- You really mean it?

279
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,113
- Yes, I do.

280
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,158
- It's just that you
always seem to be on the

281
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,035
wrong end of a deal.

282
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,536
- What do you mean by that?

283
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,122
- Well, you're always putting
others before yourself.

284
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,331
- It's not like that.

285
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,083
You and Lord Shoka
are the most important

286
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,002
things in my life. So,
of course I'm going

287
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,004
to think of you two first.

288
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,922
- That's just what
I'm talking about.

289
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,055
When I see you the phrase

290
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,266
treasure buried is treasure
wasted comes to mind.

291
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,395
You just don't realize how
special you are do you Saeron?

292
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,272
I'm very happy to
have you by my side,

293
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,733
but I keep thinking your
talents are being wasted.

294
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,402
And sometimes I wonder
if one day you'll go

295
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,238
far away to a place where
you can show those talents.

296
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,117
- I'll always be by your side.

297
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,757
- [Koim] Good lord, why hold the

298
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,634
martial arts
tournament so suddenly?

299
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,637
- [Shureon] Please choose
one; eating or speaking.

300
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,639
- What the heck is
Advisor So thinking?

301
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,557
- And he's put you
in charge of handling

302
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,767
the tournament, hasn't he.

303
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,144
- You have to make an
appearance too you know.

304
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,272
(groans loudly)

305
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,482
- What's wrong

306
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,109
- That's it!

307
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,153
This might be the plan to
draw out the Black Wolf.

308
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,698
- The Black Wolf, it's
said that he was a man

309
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,449
who led a group of
assassins known as

310
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,326
The Wolves of The Wind.

311
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,788
They were loyal and trusted
servants of the former king.

312
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,084
He's a legend, an assassin
of unmatched talent.

313
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,169
- Rumor has it that
he's still alive,

314
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,796
and it's even possible
that he still works here

315
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,423
within the palace.

316
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,674
Do you think the Advisor
might be trying to

317
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,385
use the tournament to
lure him out of hiding?

318
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,344
Unbelievable.

319
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,847
- I somehow doubt
that he's going to

320
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,349
expose his identity that easily.

321
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,518
He is The Black Wolf.

322
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,270
- You're right about that.

323
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,105
The Black Wolf is
probably the last person

324
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,648
that you'd ever
expect him to be.

325
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,194
- [Advisor So] You'll be
entering the tournament

326
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,321
taking place the
day after tomorrow.

327
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,489
- [Saeron] But, I-

328
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,657
- Make sure you
give it your best.

329
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,748
(sneezing)

330
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,459
- [Shoka] The Spring
makes my nose so itchy.

331
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,793
- [Koim] Lord Shoka.

332
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,629
- Oh, hello there Koim,
what can I do for you?

333
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,256
- I have a slight problem.

334
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,550
You see I've been appointed
to preside over the

335
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,427
tournament the day
after tomorrow.

336
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,678
- Well that's nice.

337
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,182
- So, I- Lord Shoka will
you please assist me in

338
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,433
preparing my speech.

339
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,601
- I think it would be
better if you came up

340
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,186
with it yourself.

341
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,189
But I will certainly help
with serving the tea.

342
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,528
(light-hearted music playing)

343
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,241
(Crowd chattering)

344
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,791
(peaceful music playing)

345
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,718
- [Shure] Lord Kayou

346
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,636
- [Lord Kayou] What is it?

347
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,138
- Over there, we have a problem.

348
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,766
- You're right, I
shouldn't have made

349
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,351
Lord Shoka serve tea.

350
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,477
- That's not what I
mean, father's tea

351
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,895
tastes awful!

352
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,731
(people choking)

353
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,234
Please, allow me.

354
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,153
- [Koim] It gives me great
pleasure on a blessed day

355
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,739
such as today under the
clear skies and full glory

356
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,700
of Spring to present this
joyous event and share

357
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,618
in the happiness of all.

358
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,786
(ladies giggling)

359
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,787
- [Speaker 4] You'd
think we were having

360
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,497
a wedding ceremony.

361
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,957
- [Speaker 5] It did
have a speech prepared,

362
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,375
but it looks like he's
so nervous that he

363
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,752
can't even read
what he's written.

364
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,672
- [Advisor So] Koim Lee
get this started already.

365
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,173
- [Koim] Yes, sir!

366
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,883
And without further ado
let us hereby commence

367
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,261
the first Imperial
Martial Arts Tournament.

368
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,513
- Today you will rank as
immaterial as you will

369
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,932
be competing based
on individual skill.

370
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,309
The prize is 100 gold coins.

371
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,438
(people gasp loudly)

372
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,648
- [Shure] A hundred gold.

373
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,818
I want to enter too.

374
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,403
- [Reiuke] Very well,
then we shall enter

375
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,946
and win the reward for you.

376
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,531
- Really?

377
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,491
- I would be happy to
give you as much money

378
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,326
as you want, but knowing
you you would never

379
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,494
accept it on those terms.

380
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,704
So, this will do.

381
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,332
If I do this, can you forgive me

382
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,502
for deceiving you earlier?

383
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,880
- I already did,
but do your best

384
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,298
to win that money, okay?

385
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:30,759
- Of course

386
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,887
- [Aba] I never
expected the king

387
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,388
to compete as well.

388
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,348
- [Speaker 2] And
he's made it through

389
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,016
to the semi-finals no less.

390
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,685
- He was my pupil after all.

391
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,229
He won't be defeated so easily.

392
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,857
- [Koim] And now we will
begin our semi-finals.

393
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,277
The first match is Shureon
versus Bunsheenson.

394
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,489
(crowd cheering)

395
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,448
Begin.

396
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,368
(fighting noises)

397
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,507
The winner is Shureon!

398
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,512
- [Shure] Shureon certainly
is popular with the women.

399
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,847
- [Reiuke] Well sure,
the real Shureon is.

400
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,349
(laughter)

401
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,602
- [Koim] The next match is
Reiukeshee versus Saeronshee.

402
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:24,979
- [Shure] Although
they're written with

403
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,898
different characters
Reiuke and Saeron have

404
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,900
the same family name of Shee.

405
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,443
Who should I cheer for?

406
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,738
But no matter who wins,
my family will still

407
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,448
get the one hundred gold coins.

408
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,954
(dramatic drum music plays)

409
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,425
- [Koim] Now begin!

410
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,302
(crowd cheering)

411
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,063
(swoads clashing)

412
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,606
- [Reiuke] The style.

413
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,900
- [Shure] Why does Reiuke
look so distracted?

414
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,447
- The sword style. Could it be?

415
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,073
No, that's not possible.

416
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,534
Saeron, are you -

417
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,831
(swords clashing)

418
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,713
(gasping)

419
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,014
- [Koim] Reiukeshee!

420
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,561
- [Shure] Congratulations.

421
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:50,815
What's wrong?

422
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,026
- [Reiuke] Nothing.

423
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,993
- [Shure] So in the end
General Ron won it all.

424
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,536
- [Reiuke] I'm really sorry.

425
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,998
- What's the matter Reiuke?

426
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,751
You weren't really focused
on the final match at all.

427
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,010
Reiuke.

428
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:22,847
- Excuse me.

429
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,559
- Reiuke?

430
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,481
- [Reiuke] Saeron

431
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,946
I once had an elder
brother who I loved

432
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,657
very much and
whenever I was lonely

433
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,909
he would take the
time to play with me.

434
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,578
Brother Seayun was
the only one who

435
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,873
would always be kind
to me, no matter what.

436
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,959
I loved that older
brother more than anyone.

437
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,712
He was always shielding
me with his strong

438
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,963
broad back.

439
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,551
I didn't cry even when my mother

440
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,969
and other brothers died.

441
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,722
But on the day that
my big brother Seayun

442
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,058
left the palace
for good, I cried.

443
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,436
The reason I ignored
my duties as ruler

444
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,771
was because I was
always waiting, hoping,

445
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,940
for someone to say bring back

446
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,567
Prince Seayun to rule.

447
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,778
But to think, he was so close.

448
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,198
- [Saeron] I am not your
brother your Majesty.

449
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,743
But if I were your
brother I would likely

450
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,910
say the same thing.

451
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,496
Give up that silly
idea of yours at once.

452
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,791
The Imperial Court
has already begun to

453
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,127
operate smoothly with
you at it's center.

454
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,671
Prince Seayun is not
needed any longer.

455
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,922
- That's not true!

456
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,674
- If he could see you
becoming more and more

457
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,092
like a King with
each passing day,

458
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,136
I know your brother
would be happy.

459
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,973
As long as he could support
you from the shadows.

460
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,934
It must pain him
not to be able to

461
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,604
reveal his identity,
but you still realize

462
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,022
that he's near.

463
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,774
That's enough to make him happy.

464
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,487
(soft piano music)

465
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:06,993
- Seayun, no,

466
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,998
that's not enough for me.

467
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,712
- You think it's alright to
say those sorts of things?

468
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,757
That kind of talk will
only cause trouble again.

469
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,759
If that ever happens
then Prince Seayun,

470
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,845
who's now close by
might have to flee.

471
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:26,888
- Have to flee?

472
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,849
- In other words, he
will leave you again?

473
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,935
Is that really okay with you?

474
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:32,936
- No, it's not.

475
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,272
- Then accept the fact
that he's somewhere near

476
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,774
and just leave it at that.

477
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,785
- I guess you are a
really good liar too.

478
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,791
- [Shure] What's the matter?

479
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,794
Were the two of you fighting?

480
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,172
It's a shame that neither
of you won the tournament

481
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,883
but I'm not worried
about the reward.

482
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:04,759
What is it?

483
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:05,760
- [Saeron] Nothing

484
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,970
- [Reiuke] Nothing at all.

485
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,180
It's just that seeing
you makes me very happy.

486
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,641
- That sounds like
something Saeron would say.

487
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:21,026
Oh, wait, don't tell
me that those two

488
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,569
are seeing each other!

489
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:26,573
- What's wrong?

490
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,867
- Nothing at all.

491
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,286
- Lady Shure if there's
something bothering you

492
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,872
- Oh, no, I'll just
be heading back

493
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:34,914
to my room, okay?

494
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:35,790
- Hey Shure?

495
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:36,958
- My lady?

496
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,084
- Sorry, didn't
mean to interrupt.

497
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,044
- Just wait a moment.

498
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,337
- Please, go right ahead.

499
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:43,256
- Shure! She's certainly
acting strange.

500
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:51,765
(foreign language
romantic love song)

501
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,753
- [Shure] What is this I wonder?

502
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:06,798
This distinctive flute
music, it sounds strange

503
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,842
and it makes you want
to cover your ears.

504
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,885
Wait a second, who are you?

505
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,304
Huh, General Ron's
younger brother?
