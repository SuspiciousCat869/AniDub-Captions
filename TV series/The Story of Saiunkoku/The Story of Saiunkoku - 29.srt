1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,383
(whirring)

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,556
{\an8}(light music)

3
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,190
- [Narrator] Morning had
not yet fully broken.

4
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,775
Having received word that Korin,

5
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,195
the capital of Sa Province
was under complete blockade,

6
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,490
Shuurei's party was forced
to depart early from Kinka.

7
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,741
They will try their hardest

8
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,743
to enter the sealed-off
city of Korin.

9
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,288
- Official Yu?

10
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,581
- [Yu] Yes, what is it?

11
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,874
- I was wondering,

12
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,627
would you mind apologizing
to Korin for me?

13
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,838
We're leaving without
saying anything.

14
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,841
When she finds out she's
the only one left behind--

15
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,845
- I wouldn't worry, I'm sure
she understands perfectly.

16
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,556
She already knows how
dangerous this journey will be,

17
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,725
and that she would only
be a burden to you.

18
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,560
- [Sei] He's right.

19
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,273
- [Yu] Well, please take care.

20
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,566
- Yes, we'll be off now.

21
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,527
- You look after things here.

22
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,445
- Hmm.

23
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,412
(hooves clopping)

24
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,044
- [Man] Governor Hong!

25
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:49,919
- Huh?
- Hm?

26
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,260
- It's my father.

27
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,554
- Ensei, stop,
stop the carriage.

28
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,680
(horse neighs)

29
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,848
- What did you say?

30
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,391
Of all the escorts
you could have chosen,

31
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,726
you're only taking my son?

32
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,935
- Yes, that's right.

33
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,729
Mr. Si knows the route
to Korin very well.

34
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,897
And since we're hoping not

35
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,774
to get into any battles
on our way there,

36
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,692
it would be best not
to take any soldiers

37
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,736
or armed guards along with us.

38
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,738
- I'm very honored by
you choosing my son,

39
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,740
but to put it bluntly
he will be of no help

40
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,325
as your bodyguard.

41
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,327
He's stingy with money,
and when he's most needed,

42
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,828
he may very well
leave the battlefield

43
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,831
rather than act as your
shield as he should do.

44
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,750
- Good for you,
father, and thank you.

45
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,752
You know your son very well.

46
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,421
Those are the qualities that
every merchant should have.

47
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,964
- It wasn't a compliment!

48
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,008
(Shuurei laughs)

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,426
- Well, the sun has risen.

50
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,011
Let's hurry up and get going.

51
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,597
- Normally it takes at least
five days to reach Korin,

52
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,807
but given the current situation,

53
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,017
we must try to arrive
as soon as possible.

54
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,311
- You're right, every day
we're delayed on the road,

55
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,814
the conditions in Korin are
likely to become even worse

56
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,482
thanks to the blockade
they're under.

57
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,610
- Like people always
say, time is money.

58
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,446
- You really are always working
at the abacus aren't you?

59
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,614
- Not only is it true,

60
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,658
but I'll take that
as a compliment

61
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,119
(Shuurei laughs).

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,788
(gentle music)

63
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,585
- [Narrator] Shuurei
and her companions

64
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,337
have departed for Korin City.

65
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,591
What they don't know is
that right about now,

66
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,928
Ryuuki's party is headed for
Kinka at about the same time.

67
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,770
- At last we finally made it.

68
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,938
- Right.

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,025
- Here, here, just
where exactly is here?

70
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,484
- We're in Sa Province

71
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,902
- I know that much!

72
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,654
- Being directionally
challenged could prove

73
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,573
to be fatal on a
journey like this.

74
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,741
If you get lost from the group,

75
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,950
we'll likely never
see you again.

76
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,787
- [Narrator] Ryuuki and his
party had departed from Kiyou

77
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,372
and even cut back on sleep,

78
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,625
so they could gain more ground
along a wild animal trail.

79
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,462
They will arrive in
Kinka before long.

80
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,465
- [Ryuuki] I wonder if
that's where Shuurei is.

81
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,550
- Well, we'll be
arriving in the morning.

82
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,719
- I apologize to you.

83
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,764
I made you travel
treacherous mountian paths

84
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,057
that people don't normally use,

85
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,517
and had you sacrifice
sleep to get further,

86
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,144
all for my personal desires.

87
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,523
By all rights, as king I
shouldn't be leaving Kiyou,

88
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,108
for any reason.

89
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,694
- But you didn't come here on
just personal feelings alone.

90
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,570
Did you?

91
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,532
As King you wanted to survey
Sa Province with your own eyes.

92
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,950
Am I right?

93
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,869
- Yeah, but as far as this
situation goes as king,

94
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,704
you definitely can't
get involved at all.

95
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,457
It's good you understand
that much at least.

96
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,793
- Of course, I don't
intend to help them.

97
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,504
If they can't overcome these
challenges on their own,

98
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,672
then it would have
been meaningless

99
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,590
to send them to Sa
Province to begin with.

100
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,594
All I'm able to do
is watch over them.

101
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,139
Huh?

102
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,517
(snoring)

103
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,521
- Still, given the
pace we've been going,

104
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,939
neither we nor our
horses will be able

105
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,233
to make it much
further this evening.

106
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,069
I suggest that we rest
here until morning.

107
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,070
- Good idea.

108
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,739
(gentle music)

109
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,704
- [Korin] Here you are.

110
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,205
- Ah, thank you
very much, Korin.

111
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,710
- I can't help but wonder
if Lady Shuurei is okay.

112
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,627
- Korin.

113
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,505
- It's all right, I understand.

114
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,756
I would have only been a burden

115
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,758
if I had gone with
them on their journey.

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,679
But still, I wish I
could've at least,

117
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,848
said to them have a
safe trip or something.

118
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,601
- Don't worry, I have great
faith in Governor Hong.

119
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,603
I'm sure that she'll
arrive in Korin safely,

120
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,896
and attend her
appointment ceremony

121
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,690
with no cause for concern.

122
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,941
And the same goes
for Governor To.

123
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,818
- I'm not worried about him.

124
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,155
I'm only worried about
Lady Shuurei, that's all.

125
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,492
- [Yu's Voiceover] I'm certain
Governor Hong will be safe,

126
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,161
but the others are
a different matter.

127
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,121
As far as the Sa
Clan is concerned,

128
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,956
they're merely nuisances.

129
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,501
I wonder, will they all be able
to reach Korin successfully?

130
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,547
(fire crackling)

131
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,798
- It's them.

132
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,175
- All right boys,

133
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,176
we're not to kill the
daughter of the Hong Clan.

134
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,886
We have to capture her alive.

135
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,137
- And the rest?

136
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,805
- We kill them all
and leave their bodies

137
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,015
for the wolves to eat.

138
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,017
- You're the ones who
are gonna be eaten.

139
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,605
(yelling)

140
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,815
(fire crackling)

141
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,275
- Mm-mm, delicious!

142
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,779
Was it you who made
this savory rice

143
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,238
and bean ball, Governor Hong?

144
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,448
- Yes.

145
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,116
- It's stuffed with
lots of barbecued pork,

146
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,826
so it's really very scrumptious.

147
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,997
- Mm, I'm sure this
could sell quite well.

148
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,709
- Honestly, Mr. Shosi, you
truly are always thinking

149
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,711
about business and
money aren't you?

150
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,088
- So much so that
I have the urge

151
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,298
to run back to Kinka
and sell these.

152
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,008
- But if you do that,
it'll only get you

153
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,552
into another quarrel with
your father, won't it?

154
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,222
- That argument you two had
this morning was kind of fun.

155
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,141
- Especially compared to
the Sa Clan's family fights.

156
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,226
- Welcome back.

157
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,145
- Just as we
expected, those guys

158
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,564
from the Sa Clan's private
army were wondering around

159
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,650
and waiting for nightfall
to come and attack us.

160
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,193
- Thanks for helping.

161
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,028
- I'm worried about
Mr. Kou Kijin.

162
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,699
He's facing Tu ShoSa
all on his own,

163
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,659
and I wonder if he'll
succeed in putting a stop

164
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,036
to that man's plans, as well.

165
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,830
- Princess, how about
I tell you something

166
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,581
I bet you don't even know?

167
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,041
- What is it?

168
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,710
- When things started getting
messy within the Sa Clan

169
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,294
following old man Injun's death,

170
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,713
the first thing that boy did

171
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,214
was set off for the
Sa Clan residence.

172
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,174
- Huh?
- If that weren't gutsy enough

173
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,718
Kou Kijin made his opinion known

174
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,219
that the full authority
of the clan should go

175
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,263
to old Lady AeKei of all people.

176
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,724
- Mr. Kou Kijin said that?

177
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,851
- Unfortunately, no one
would listen to his opinion,

178
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,269
but he still felt the
need to do something

179
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,062
to set things right,
so he came to me

180
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,648
while I was trapped in
that dungeon back in SeiDe

181
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,863
- I think Mr. Kou Kijin
is a man who fights

182
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,240
for what's most precious to him.

183
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,200
- In any case no one
other than a member

184
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,327
{\an8}of the Sa Clan will be
able to solve the problems

185
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,288
that are within the Sa Clan.

186
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,205
- Hmm.

187
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,417
- He has tasks only he can do,

188
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,252
and in the same way
you too my lady,

189
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,421
have tasks only you can do.

190
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,298
But I'm sure the time
will come when your path

191
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,385
and his will meet again,
and when that moment comes,

192
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,138
I know you'll make every
effort to help him.

193
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,640
- Yeah you're right, Seiran.

194
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,398
(wolf howling)

195
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,738
Once we reach Korin,

196
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,742
it means I'll have to meet
up with that man again.

197
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,372
(fire crackling)

198
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,129
- Hm, My Lady it's late.

199
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,173
- Could I have some
water please Seiran?

200
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,262
(cork pops)

201
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,180
Hmm.

202
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,310
I remember that when
I was a little girl,

203
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,813
mother always used
to tell me stories

204
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,981
whenever I was unable
to get to sleep.

205
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,149
- [Seiran] Yes, I remember.

206
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,235
- Out of all the
stories she told,

207
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,321
my favorite was always
"The Rose Princess".

208
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,370
(crickets chirping)

209
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,166
(snoring)

210
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,259
(grunts)

211
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,262
- Dammit.

212
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,222
Not only is he
directionally challenged,

213
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,349
he tosses and turns
in his sleep as well.

214
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,143
Huh?

215
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,190
Your Majesty?

216
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,066
- Huh?

217
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,404
I was watching the stars.

218
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,072
- You won't be able to
take much more of this

219
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,490
if you don't get some sleep.

220
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,075
We'll drive the
horses to their limit

221
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,952
as soon as the sky
starts to lighten.

222
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,165
- When I was little I
was afraid of the dark

223
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,792
so I would often look up
at the stars by myself.

224
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,253
But when Shuurei
was in the palace

225
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,964
I found myself looking
forward to night coming,

226
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,883
every night Shuurei
would play her erhu

227
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,427
and tell me wonderful stories.

228
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,762
- What kind of stories?

229
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,931
- Like "The Rose Princess".

230
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,852
Please continue where you left
off with yesterday's story.

231
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,896
- You'll just fall asleep in
the middle again, won't you?

232
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,857
How many times must I
tell you the same tale?

233
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,108
- As many as you can.

234
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:33,860
- Hmm.

235
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,072
Once upon a time,

236
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,909
there was a very
beautiful princess named
The Rose Princess.

237
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,495
Besides her beauty, she
possessed the amazing ability

238
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,081
to heal any injury or illness.

239
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,083
However there was
a greedy master

240
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,418
who wanted that
power all to himself,

241
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,838
so he captured
The Rose Princess.

242
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,426
Before long, the story had
spread across the country.

243
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,263
The story of this princess who
could control the mysterious

244
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,474
and whose eternal beauty
shined bright enough

245
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,810
to dim even the moonlight.

246
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,896
(gentle music)

247
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,606
Men came in great numbers,

248
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,025
all wanting to propose
marriage to her,

249
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,027
so her master
decided to take her

250
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,529
where no one could find her.

251
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,453
He gave her whatever
her heart desired.

252
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,542
Except freedom.

253
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,883
Just as I thought!

254
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,845
- I'm not asleep you know.

255
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,097
- What, you're
pretending to be asleep?

256
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,141
Huh?

257
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,018
- Go ahead, please continue.

258
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,564
- Time passed and then
one day a man was able

259
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,108
to make his way in
to meet the princess.

260
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,571
- The man jumped over the many
fences that encircled her,

261
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,323
to get to where
she was being held.

262
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,868
A single look, and he
fell in love with her.

263
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,579
Even though he had
come to kill her,

264
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,414
because she was disturbing
the country's peace

265
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,999
with the stories about her.

266
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,043
Taking the princess,

267
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,212
the man fled as far
away as he could.

268
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,883
As she spent time with the
man The Rose Princess found

269
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,885
that she had lost her
special abilities,

270
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,970
but the man didn't mind at all.

271
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,097
- What happened to the
Rose Princess then mommy?

272
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,683
Did she get to live
happily ever after?

273
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,268
- She sure did.

274
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,896
The princess gave birth to
a beautiful little girl,

275
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,648
but that little girl was
always falling ill with fevers.

276
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,027
But in her heart the
princess became aware

277
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,904
that she would be able
to have a single wish

278
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,281
in exchange for
giving up her life.

279
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,450
The Rose Princess
did not hesitate,

280
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,494
she said to the man
and her little girl,

281
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,621
"I will turn back
into an ordinary rose,

282
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,583
'but my heart will belong to
you through all eternity".

283
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,586
- It was from then
on that the rose

284
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,171
as we know it grew thorns

285
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,090
so it could never
be captured again.

286
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,217
- So the rose's thorns are proof

287
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,344
of the Rose Princess'
love, right?

288
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,220
Nice story.

289
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,056
- I don't wanna
become that master

290
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,934
who only knew how to
confine her with walls.

291
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,560
On the other hand,
I'm not in a position

292
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,728
to throw everything away

293
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,605
and flee with the
Rose Princess either.

294
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,607
- Hmm.

295
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,486
- But if I could be
the man who loved her,

296
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,071
if I could be the
man who was loved

297
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,489
by the princess in return.

298
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,534
- It's kind of strange.

299
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,245
I don't have any mysterious
power like the Rose Princess,

300
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,539
and I'm not beautiful like her,

301
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,419
but maybe I do have thorns.

302
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:45,051
- You have thorns so that
no one can capture you.

303
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:45,719
Is that it?

304
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,638
(snoring lightly)

305
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,159
(birds cawing)

306
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,831
- What did you say?

307
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,332
They've left for Korin?

308
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,626
- Apparently they set
off yesterday morning.

309
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,171
That's what I was told by the
castles' government official

310
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,048
when I asked to
have them contacted.

311
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,383
- It appears we barley
just missed each other.

312
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,345
- It looks like those rumors
we heard from the merchants

313
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,139
while we were on route
were the real thing.

314
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,557
Korin is under a blockade.

315
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,851
- Oh damn it.

316
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,395
If only we'd anticipated the
actions of Shuurei's group

317
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,189
and gone to Korin instead.

318
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,482
- The fact that they
headed for Korin

319
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,858
as soon as they
heard of the blockade

320
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,277
shows some quick reaction
on their part I'd say.

321
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,196
- Not to mention the
new Co-Governors seem

322
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,739
to be working hard of
their own volition,

323
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,532
both Shuurei and Eigetsu

324
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,368
- I found out more as well.

325
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,244
They were able to get rid
of the murderous blades

326
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,621
that were taking
control of the city,

327
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,373
and they liberated
the mayor of Kinka

328
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,208
who had been placed
in confinement.

329
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,501
- Oh?

330
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,336
- Sure Seiran and
Ensei are with them,

331
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,880
but even so I'd say
that's pretty impressive.

332
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:04,798
(sighs)

333
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,633
- Yeah, an impressive near miss.

334
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,550
- [Both] Huh?

335
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,224
- Hmm, it's not fair I
can't even get a glimpse

336
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,267
of Shuurei from
afar at this point.

337
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,105
- There's also that
monstrous Sakujun.

338
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,690
Apparently, he's planning
to take the position

339
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,734
of head of the Sa Clan,
and make Shuurei his wife.

340
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,654
According to the rumors, he's
supposed to be in Korin too.

341
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,240
- Well in that case,
shall we head to Korin?

342
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,157
- Huh?

343
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,411
- The woman you love who gives
you a thousand years worth

344
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,537
of thoughts in a single day

345
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,497
is just a short
distance away from you.

346
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,708
Although as a king it's
a pretty pathetic move,

347
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,377
as a man, sometimes, it's all
right to do foolish things

348
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,628
in the name of true love.

349
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,589
- Hmm, thank you Shuurei.

350
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,259
- Of course that's
more trouble for those

351
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,510
who serve a certain stupid King.

352
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,803
(laughs)

353
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,471
- Stop calling me stupid,
I'm king you know?

354
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,141
- Come to think of it
advisor Sho is also

355
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,434
in Sa Province now, isn't he?

356
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,768
- There is absolutely no need

357
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,895
to be worrying about
that old badger!

358
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,483
(suspenseful music)

359
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,484
- [Servant] Lady Aeki,

360
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,155
Advisor Sho has arrived.

361
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,741
He says he would like to
request an audience with you.

362
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,911
- So he's finally
decided to show up.

363
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,329
Far too late.

364
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,623
Let him in.

365
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,499
- Yes

366
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,419
- I have never liked that man,

367
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,837
and unless I miss my guess,

368
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,881
I imagine he's still
walking down the path

369
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,300
of the sly beast monster.

370
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,719
(door creaks)

371
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,814
- [Shou] Whoa!

372
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,525
(horses neigh)

373
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,573
- So that's Korin.

374
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,660
- Ugh.

375
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,870
- How did it look?

376
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,330
- Soldiers of the Sa
Clan are over there

377
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,498
awaiting our arrival.

378
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,708
Oh, Sho Sai.

379
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,002
- Yes, what is it?

380
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,337
- You take over the carriage.

381
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,672
Seiran and I will
sneak over there

382
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,341
and take out those guys
so we can open a path.

383
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,717
Of course, I don't
know we'll be able

384
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,010
to beat the whole lot of them.

385
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:14,928
- And?

386
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,346
- As soon as I give the signal,

387
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,890
go full speed ahead
down the road, okay?

388
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,558
- I've always held
the basic principal

389
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,687
of only using 80% of my power
while conserving the rest,

390
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,731
but I'll make an exception.

391
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,941
- We're counting on you.

392
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,694
Come on, Seiran, let's go.

393
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,572
- Please both of
you, be careful.

394
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,045
- Look, let me make this
clear to you one more time,

395
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,922
unlike you, I'm
a civil official.

396
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,383
- That may be so, but putting
your swordsmanship aside,

397
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,719
you are trained in
horsemanship correct?

398
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,262
By Lo Raching?

399
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:57,971
- Ugh.

400
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,642
- As you can see, the road
suddenly gets wider from here,

401
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,394
then we reach the
end of the cliff.

402
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,938
It's all forest
from this point on.

403
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,064
- If they are going to attack,

404
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,858
it will definitely be over here.

405
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,401
- Yes, you're right.

406
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,862
- If we get past it,
then we will reach Korin.

407
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,779
- Okay.

408
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,786
(dramatic music)

409
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,831
- They're awfully late.

410
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,041
- We thought so too,

411
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,084
so we went out of our
way to come to you.

412
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:28,960
Hmm.

413
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,714
(suspenseful music)

414
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,467
(men grunting)

415
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,016
(yelling)

416
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,615
- There certainly
are a lot of them.

417
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,574
- Yeah.

418
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,492
- Hm.

419
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,336
- Seiran, behind you.

420
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,505
(yelling)

421
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,009
- Huh?

422
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,138
- No Way!

423
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,014
Cool!

424
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,522
- Don't stand there, attack!

425
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,824
(bodies thud)

426
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,618
- That's pretty impressive.

427
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,044
- I can't believe you
came all the way here.

428
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,005
- Yes, I know it's
stupid and I'm sorry,

429
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,924
but at least now we can
swing these swords together.

430
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,393
- Now's the time.

431
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,522
(whistling)

432
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,565
- It's the signal.

433
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,899
- Right, let's go.

434
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,737
Hyah!
(horse whinnies)

435
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,530
- Wait, that's, damn it!

436
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,656
- Nice try.

437
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,574
- Shuurei?

438
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,618
- Don't let your guard down.

439
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,619
- Yeah, got it.

440
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,924
(panting)

441
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,563
- Miss Shuurei, be careful.

442
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,231
It's dangerous to
stick your head out.

443
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,608
- Oh right, good point.

444
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:04,699
- Shuurei.

445
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,746
(men laughing)

446
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:10,872
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

447
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,001
- So, well, uh, the
reason I came was.

448
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,545
- Hey, we won't say a
word to Princess about it.

449
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,547
- Thank you Ensei.

450
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,468
As for the rest,
I'll leave it to you.

451
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,095
- Hmm.

452
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,596
(upbeat music)

453
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:27,681
- Well, shall we get going?

454
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:28,598
- Yeah.

455
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,527
- Let's return home.

456
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:42,862
- Yeah, we should.

457
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,284
- So the nights
will be long again.

458
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,162
- If you like, I could
tell you a bedtime story.

459
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,622
Once upon a time there was a--

460
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,165
- Cut that out!

461
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,503
You, just what's going
on inside your head?

462
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,130
- You know I can't help
but feel you need to try

463
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,214
to have a bit more fun.

464
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,757
- Have a bit more fun at what?

465
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,593
What are you implying
that I should enjoy?

466
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:09,931
- Am I unable to
even touch the rose?

467
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,684
(gentle music)

468
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,024
- Governor Hong and her
party should be arriving

469
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,650
in the city anytime now.

470
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,583
- There's Korin.

471
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,179
{\an8}(soft music)

472
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,169
- [Shuurei] We've come
all the way here to Korin,

473
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,838
the capital of Sa Province.

474
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,214
It may be completely blockaded,

475
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,799
thanks to the orders
of the Sa Clan.

476
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,384
But we're not gonna just
turn around and leave.

477
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:13,179
{\an8}All right, Seiran, Ensei,
let's enter Korin carefully.
