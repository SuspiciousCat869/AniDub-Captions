{\an8}(woman singing in

00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,481
- [Narrator] Seiran,
Ensei, Eigetsu and Kourin,

4
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,608
who was acting as a
stand-in for Shuurei,

5
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,319
have all been
captured by Sojun Sa.

6
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,321
His grandfather, Chusho Sa,

7
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,907
is seeking leadership
of the Sa Clan.

8
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,784
Currently, they are
being held captive

9
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,202
in the town of Sairi,

10
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,413
the checkpoint on the
border of Sa Province.

11
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,418
(knocking at door)

12
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,758
(calm music)

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,343
- Mr. Kokujun.

14
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,387
- Wait, do you know this man?

15
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,639
- He's the younger
brother of Mr. Sojun,

16
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,307
the third son of the Sa family.

17
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,985
- Ms. Kourin, it's
been quite a while.

18
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:32,902
- Huh?

19
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,280
This isn't good.

20
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,239
He knows.

21
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,496
(birds chirping)

22
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,414
- [Narrator] Shuurei
was the only one

23
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,374
who escaped danger in Sakyou.

24
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,543
Using Kourin's
name as a disguise,

25
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,003
she is traveling with a merchant

26
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,589
by the name of Senya Rin.

27
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,007
- [Shuurei Voiceover]
It's already been

28
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,843
six days since we entered
Sairi in Sa Province.

29
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,636
I wonder if
everyone's all right.

30
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,723
- No matter what, get to Kinka.

31
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,391
Got that?

32
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,684
- [Shuurei Voiceover]
That's all well and good,

33
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,394
but when is this
prodigal young master

34
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,481
of mine planning to
depart for Kinka anyway?

35
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,774
- [Sakujun] Oh. Mm.

36
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:12,942
- Huh?

37
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,569
Good morning, young master.

38
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,071
Did you sleep we--

39
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:16,988
(enchanting music)

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,740
- Good morning to you, Kourin.

41
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,700
- Ah!

42
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,618
Young Master!

43
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,994
Could you put on some clothes?

44
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,582
You're awake unusually
early today, aren't you?

45
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,667
- It's too hot.

46
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,043
No one can sleep like this.

47
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,419
- At times like this,

48
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,712
you've got to sleep
out of sheer will.

49
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,381
- Sheer will you say?

50
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,758
Those words are not in my
vocabulary, I'm afraid.

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,052
- You really don't
have any drive, do you?

52
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,638
Anyway,

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,847
I've prepared some
ice and fruit for you

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,432
and I've brought you
your fan as well.

55
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,600
- No.

56
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,310
I'd rather have
you play your erhu.

57
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,770
If you can, please
play something that
would make me feel

58
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,605
a little cooler at least.

59
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,440
- I'm surprised you're
not tired of it by now.

60
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,442
After having me
play every night.

61
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,735
- That will never happen.

62
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,570
No one's music has
ever pleased me

63
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,864
as much as yours has, Kourin.

64
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,990
- Yes, yes.

65
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,535
But, more importantly,

66
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,787
what day are you planning
on leaving for Kinka?

67
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,038
- [Sa Hmm.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,499
It should be anytime now.

69
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,334
- Anytime?

70
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,127
- Huh.

71
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,795
Now, play on.

72
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,464
- Huh?

73
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,549
(sighs)

74
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,926
(calm music)

75
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,771
- [Sou] You look rather
troubled, your Majesty.

76
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,689
- Huh?

77
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,360
Advisor Sou, isn't there
anyone in the Sa Clan

78
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,446
as talented as advisor Sa?

79
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,864
- Why are you asking
me something like that

80
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,490
all of a sudden?

81
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,950
- Well, I've been thinking
about things ever since

82
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,494
advisor Sho said he
would go to Sa Province.

83
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,787
- [Sou] Oh yes, he
went to return the ring

84
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,789
to the Sa Clan's
leader, didn't he?

85
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,957
- Wait.

86
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,584
You knew that advisor
Sho had the ring?

87
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,501
- Hm.

88
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,591
And as for the Sa Clan,
around 14 years ago,

89
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,926
advisor Enjun Sa returned
home to take care

90
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,969
of some business.

91
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,680
When he returned
from Sa Province,

92
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,015
he was quite disturbed.

93
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,767
He said something
about the possibility

94
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,561
of a monster existing
within the Sa Clan.

95
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,564
- A monster?

96
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,732
- That was the only time

97
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,525
he ever spoke openly
of the subject.

98
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,527
But nine years ago
during the Civil War,

99
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,530
When Enjun's only son and
daughter-in-law were killed,

100
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,200
I couldn't help but
remember those words of his.

101
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,534
- [Shi] Hm.

102
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,536
- Sure Enjun was
here in Shi Province,

103
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,955
but how did the one
responsible for killing his son

104
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,875
and his son's wife manage
to slip passed Eiki?

105
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,628
- That would be advisor
Sa's lady I presume.

106
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,047
- Yes, Eiki is the
daughter of the Hyou Clan,

107
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,675
a family that possesses
unusual abilities.

108
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,552
They say she has the
power to see the future.

109
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,845
Pulling off something
like killing

110
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,431
the son and his wife
with Eiki so close by

111
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,974
is a feat that no
one in the Sa Clan

112
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,559
could possibly accomplish.

113
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,687
- So, they assumed
there was a monster

114
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,146
amongst the Sa Clan?

115
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,691
- We don't know if
there is one or not.

116
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,485
However, if there is that
person must be regarded

117
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,986
as extremely dangerous.

118
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,531
- A monster?

119
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,573
Huh.

120
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,909
(calm music)

121
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,669
- You really are extremely
good, aren't you?

122
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,546
Where did you learn how to play?

123
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,922
- From my mother.

124
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,591
She always excelled
at playing the erhu.

125
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,885
By the way, I know you
did put on some clothes

126
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,013
like I asked you and
thank you, for doing that,

127
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,556
but you've done
nothing more than just

128
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,641
drape some flimsy
robe around you.

129
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,851
- Likewise, you don't wear

130
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,936
the cute outfit I
set out for you.

131
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,022
- That's ridiculous.

132
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,732
Young master, I'm
not a princess.

133
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,859
What need is there for me
to wear an outfit like that?

134
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,777
- Because it would
be food for the eyes.

135
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,945
- Just admit it,

136
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,822
it's all a way to
tease and spite me.

137
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,574
- What a strange thing to say.

138
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,784
It's easy to see how
much potential you have

139
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,952
to be truly beautiful.

140
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,287
- Wha?

141
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,788
- [Sa] Although the word cute

142
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,998
might suit you better right now.

143
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,625
(exclaims)

144
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,878
(chuckles)

145
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,090
(footsteps thumping)

146
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,634
(gate creaks)

147
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,596
- You're not merely here
to feed us today, I assume.

148
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,056
- [Visitor] It's
been seven days.

149
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,307
You should know that Ms. Kourin

150
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,642
appears to be
feeling a lot better.

151
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,062
- Kokujun, you sure about this?

152
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,229
- Hm.

153
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,731
You were probably
waiting for Ms. Kourin

154
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,524
to regain her
strength, weren't you?

155
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,319
Knowing you, you could've
escaped anytime you wanted.

156
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,653
- Well, yeah.

157
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,946
But if I can get
away without having

158
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,240
to waste any energy
then so much the better.

159
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,577
Hey, Seiran, before
we get outta here,

160
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,912
we'd better go and
find that sword

161
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,663
his Majesty entrusted you with.

162
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,832
After all, it wouldn't
be amusing if it ended up

163
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,834
getting sold, would it?

164
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,252
- Don't worry about it.

165
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,838
That sword is actually
quite a fussy thing.

166
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,257
It won't be sold easily.

167
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,220
And besides, this sword
doesn't look too bad either.

168
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,179
- Well, in that case,

169
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,722
shall we make a run for it?

170
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,766
- Wait just a minute.

171
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,060
Don't you intend to
save the governors too?

172
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,938
- Did Eigetsu ever ask for
us to come and save him?

173
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,356
- Well, no.

174
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,817
He only asked me to tell
you Ms. Kourin's condition.

175
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,734
Nothing else.

176
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,027
- Then they should be fine.

177
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,779
- But they've both
been captured.

178
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,572
- If they've already
been captured,

179
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,950
then they're not in any danger
of being captured again.

180
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,702
That's why they're
fine where they are.

181
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,079
- Don't you think there's
something wrong with that logic?

182
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,248
I thought that as long as I
let you out of the dungeon--

183
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,626
- That everything would
turn out okay, huh?

184
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,877
- Hmm?

185
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,880
- You assumed that I'd
save Eigetsu, Kourin,

186
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,133
and even Shunki, right?

187
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,676
- Huh?

188
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,261
- Life's not that easy, kid.

189
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,637
You think you're doing something

190
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,139
but in fact you're
doing nothing.

191
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,183
All you do is sit
around and hope.

192
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,685
Hope that someone
stronger than you

193
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,895
will take care of things
so you don't have to.

194
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,272
I gotta say, Kokujun,

195
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,149
Shunki is a lot braver
and stronger than you are

196
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,358
from where I'm standing.

197
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,778
- [Kokujun] Shunki.

198
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,656
- Instead of just
worrying about Shunki,

199
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,242
why don't you do something
about it yourself?

200
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,827
- [Kokujun] What do you mean?

201
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,037
- Even though they're younger,

202
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,913
Eigetsu and Kourin have
prepared themselves

203
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,123
much better than you.

204
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,833
The reason those
two are still alive,

205
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,209
despite everything
they've been through,

206
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,045
is because they're not
afraid to go to the brink.

207
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,296
They're willing to
walk a tight rope

208
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,173
and use their wits to the limit.

209
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,300
Sometimes, you just
gotta take risks.

210
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,928
Before hoping for someone
to come to the rescue,

211
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,764
try making a
difference yourself.

212
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,350
Look, Kokujun,

213
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,934
I do admire your bravery.

214
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,936
Not only in bringing us food
and water for seven days,

215
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,938
but in even as going as
far as to unlock the door

216
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,148
for us to escape.

217
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,733
I realize that's a big thing,

218
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,778
especially considering you're
the third son of the Sa Clan.

219
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,988
If you're elder brother
Sojun finds out about this,

220
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,239
you could be in danger.

221
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,450
That's why I think you did well.

222
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,911
Nobody's telling you that
you have to risk your life,

223
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,080
but there is a difference
between the impossible,

224
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,040
and giving up right
from the out set

225
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,250
on things that
might be possible.

226
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,795
(chuckles)

227
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,671
See ya later.

228
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,674
- Huh?

229
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,425
Hm.

230
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,429
(crickets chirping)

231
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,306
- You really can be officious.

232
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,974
Not only do you tell
him to take action,

233
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,434
you give the poor man a lecture

234
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,478
and still manage to get in
a little push at the end.

235
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,980
- If something good comes
out of giving the guy a push,

236
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,774
then that's all
the better, right?

237
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,236
- Do you really believe he'll
be able to make a difference?

238
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,112
- [Guard] There they are.

239
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:12,987
It's them.

240
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,155
- Hm.

241
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,240
- [Guard] Don't
let them get away.

242
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,158
(guards yelling)

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,827
- Let's clean things
up here quickly

244
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,412
and join up with
princess and the others.

245
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,956
- Just try not to injure
any of the officials.

246
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,873
- Right.

247
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,293
(men grunting)

248
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:37,846
- [Shuurei Voiceover]
Please, be safe everyone.

249
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,055
- Damn that man!

250
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,015
(both gasping)

251
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,474
- Ensei Ro, that bastard.

252
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,268
He really did escape in the end.

253
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,146
(groans)

254
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,772
Now I'm not sure if you two
really are the governors.

255
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,233
If you were, then why would
Ensei leave you guys behind

256
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,776
and make a run for it?

257
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,028
- That's because,

258
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,280
that's because we are
the real ones, right?

259
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,406
- What?

260
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,741
- Just think about it,

261
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,492
if we are the real governors,

262
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,411
then you people can't kill us.

263
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,746
That's why.

264
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,289
- Get real you brat.

265
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,165
(grunts)

266
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,082
- Ah.

267
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,044
- The only one we
can't kill is the girl,

268
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,462
because she's from
the Hong clan.

269
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,047
Make no mistake,

270
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,131
we're only keeping you
alive for the hell of it.

271
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,299
That's all.

272
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,092
And I can kill you
whenever I want.

273
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,802
Like now, for instance.

274
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,470
(exclaims)

275
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,096
- [Kourin] Stop it!

276
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,389
- [Sojun] Huh?

277
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,351
(thoughtful music)

278
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,945
- If you doubt us then
go ahead and kill him.

279
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,531
However, expect consequences.

280
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,949
- What do you mean?

281
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,368
- If you kill governor To,

282
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,245
I promise you I will kill
myself shortly afterwards.

283
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,955
If I should die
then the Hong clan

284
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,540
will take action immediately.

285
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,085
If both of us lose our
lives on your land,

286
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,128
whose fault is it
going to be seen as?

287
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,338
- Now wait.

288
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,297
- And when you see
their revenge against

289
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,548
the Sa Clan,

290
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,467
you'll regret it so
much that not even death

291
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,386
will free you from
your conscience.

292
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,012
(grunts)

293
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,848
If you're prepared for that,
then go ahead and kill him.

294
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,392
(grunts)

295
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,976
- And besides,

296
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,311
didn't you know that master
Ensei was going to escape?

297
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,313
I remember that man
who was with you before

298
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,523
said that he would.

299
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,191
- That man who was with me?

300
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,317
Escapes?

301
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,318
- Oh, he will.

302
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,611
Don't you ever doubt that.

303
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,656
- [Sojun] Meisho.

304
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,324
(growls)

305
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,659
Damn it all.

306
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,493
(glass shatters)

307
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,869
So, that's it then.

308
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,620
I'm supposed to take
these two to Kinka

309
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,497
after Ensei escapes?

310
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,998
Damn, what a waste of my time.

311
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,333
All I wanna do is find that guy

312
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,502
and smash his head
into little pieces.

313
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,545
- In that case,

314
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,130
why don't you leave it to me

315
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,174
to take the two co-governors
to Kinka, big brother?

316
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,009
- Kokujun?

317
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,385
You?

318
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,137
Every since you fell
under Shunki's influence,

319
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,513
you've been spouting stupidity.

320
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,889
- [Kokujun] Please, Sojun,

321
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,224
I want the chance
to restore my honor

322
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,934
as the third son of the Sa Clan.

323
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,145
(foreboding music)

324
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,355
- And that idiot Sakujun
hasn't come out of Kinka yet.

325
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,317
Well, I guess even you can
babysit a couple of kids.

326
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,193
(Kourin scoffs)

327
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,570
All right, fine Kokujun.

328
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,655
Try to get them to Kinka
as soon as you can manage.

329
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,618
(door thuds)

330
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,619
- Mr. Kokujun?

331
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,457
I wanna thank you very
much for releasing

332
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,167
Mr. Ensei and Mr. Seiran.

333
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,043
- Huh?

334
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,210
- What is it with you?

335
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,670
You're too small
to be so reckless!

336
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,340
- You know, I am a lot tougher
than I appear, Ms. Kourin.

337
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,924
I feel just fine.

338
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,217
- No matter how tough you are,

339
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,595
being stabbed by a spear
will still kill you.

340
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,305
- [Ensei] The reason
those two are still alive,

341
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,681
despite everything
they've been through

342
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,391
is because they're not
afraid to go to the brink.

343
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,559
They're willing to
walk a tight rope

344
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,186
and use their wits to the limit.

345
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,229
Sometimes you just
gotta take risks.

346
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,065
(Kourin sobs)

347
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,566
- Well then, Mr. Kokujun,

348
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,234
we'll be together for
the next little while

349
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,570
so, I hope we get along well.

350
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,031
In any case, we can
finally relax a little.

351
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,408
- Are you sure the two of
you are okay with this?

352
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,994
I am still Sojun's
younger brother, you know?

353
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,246
- That's true.

354
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,664
But even though you knew
Kourin was a fake governor,

355
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,708
you didn't tell anyone about it.

356
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,294
- I have to warn you,
I'm not very strong.

357
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,505
I might even end up
betraying you later.

358
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,090
- Oh, I understand that.

359
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,133
You still have to deal with
your own circumstances.

360
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,593
Whatever ends up happening,

361
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,679
we'll all still do whatever
it is that we have to do.

362
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,097
- Hm.

363
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,098
And we'll probably end
up taking about a month

364
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,683
to go from Sairi to Kinka.

365
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,560
You should get ready
for the journey ahead.

366
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,478
- [Both] Yes sir.

367
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,148
(calm music)

368
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,612
- Its been seven days
since we entered Sairi.

369
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,281
Just when are we
gonna leave, anyway?

370
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,661
(click)

371
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,538
Huh?

372
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,414
- Uh huh.

373
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,623
Just as I thought,

374
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,291
you look much nicer
with your hair down.

375
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,751
In fact,

376
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,712
I wish you'd leave it down
because I like it that way.

377
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,630
- Please give back my hair pin.

378
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,508
I have no intention of leaving
my hair down in this heat.

379
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,098
(growls)

380
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,516
Honestly, young Master.

381
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,021
- If you don't mind, would
you do my hair as well?

382
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,690
- But I thought you just
tie it back, don't you?

383
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,692
- Yes, but it's quite
difficult to manage.

384
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,111
(sighs)

385
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,612
- All right, I'll do it for you.

386
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,116
You might've inherited
the merchant business

387
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,325
from your family,

388
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,452
but that business
will end with you

389
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,370
if you keep on like this.

390
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,538
- You're very blunt.

391
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,123
Why is that?

392
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,666
- Every merchant knows
the most important aspect

393
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,336
of a successful business
is to do things promptly.

394
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,629
But no, not you, young Master.

395
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,505
- Hm.

396
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,631
Very well.

397
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,175
In that case,
we'll depart today.

398
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,134
- Huh?

399
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,302
- We will depart today.

400
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,595
Around noon.

401
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,181
I should do things
promptly, didn't you say?

402
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:31,848
- Well, yes.

403
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,183
But still.

404
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,476
- Besides, it looks
like things can become

405
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,269
quite unpleasant around here.

406
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,729
- Oh, really?

407
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,273
- It seems there's been an
escape from the border prison.

408
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,608
(gasps)

409
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,276
- They say the escapee's
are an incredibly strong

410
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,611
pair of men.

411
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,696
- That certainly does
sound unpleasant.

412
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,531
- It's rather
frightening, isn't it?

413
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,741
- Yes, very much so.

414
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,742
- If that were not enough,

415
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,827
Sa Province has been on edge

416
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,080
over the two newly
appointed governors.

417
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,749
First the rampaging bandits
and now this escape.

418
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,709
- [Shuurei] Hm.

419
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,710
- [Sakujun] Still, don't worry.

420
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,253
It's all right.

421
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,464
I'll see you safely to
Kinka so you can rest easy.

422
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,385
After all, I took you the
first moment I saw you.

423
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,512
I would never let
anything happen to you.

424
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,475
- Would it be all right for
me to go out for a moment,

425
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,893
young Master?

426
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,561
- Hm?

427
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,106
(murmuring)

428
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,733
- [Merchant] Ah, welcome.

429
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,361
- I'd like some
ganlu tea, please.

430
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,862
I'll take all you
have in the shop.

431
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:28,863
- Huh?

432
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:29,906
All of it?

433
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:30,824
- Yes.

434
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,409
As for payment for the tea,

435
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,244
it should be sought for
my prodigal young Master,

436
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,454
Mr. Senya Rin before noon today.

437
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,330
- [Merchant] Oh, yes.

438
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,498
One moment please.

439
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,754
- At last, I can
finally move forward.

440
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:49,676
Seiran, Ensei, Eigetsu,
Kourin will meet in Kinka.

441
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,593
For sure.

442
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:54,848
(calm music)

443
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,516
- [Narrator] 20 days
and a bit later,

444
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,852
Shuurei found herself
staying in a small town.

445
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,439
- [Man] This time they
appeared in the town of Rosen,

446
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,941
it's that mysterious
bounty hunting duo.

447
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,234
- Word is that those two are

448
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,652
capturing Murderous
Blades members

449
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,862
and earning quite the bounty.

450
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,822
- Not to mention one of
them sure is handsome,

451
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:11,823
don't you think?

452
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,324
(giggles)

453
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,243
- [Woman] The other one doesn't
even look human, does he?

454
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,370
- [Woman] I hear he's part
man part bear monster.

455
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,788
(nervous laughing)

456
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,457
- [Shuurei Voiceover]
They're really something.

457
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,708
Earning travel money as they go

458
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,460
through turning in bounties?

459
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,919
And the fact that
Eigetsu and Kourin

460
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,464
aren't with them must
mean those two are safe.

461
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,631
If they weren't,

462
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,342
Seiran and Ensei
would've rescued them.

463
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,760
I'm so glad.

464
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,764
That's one last thing I
have to be worried about.

465
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,227
- This sketch of
me is really harsh.

466
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,730
I happen to be a
very good looking guy

467
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,774
when I shave my beard, you know?

468
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,568
Anyway, Princess is doing
a fantastic job as usual.

469
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,861
She's been leaving
us clear signs

470
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:50,862
of her whereabouts.

471
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,199
- I'm afraid we're
all out of ganlu tea.

472
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,408
- [Merchant] A young
lady bought it all.

473
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,328
I remember she was very
skilled with the erhu.

474
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,537
- [Ensei] All we need
to do is go to any

475
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,247
tea merchants in town
and ask if they have

476
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,541
ganlu tea and we get
news about her location.

477
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,418
We don't bring any undo
attention to ourselves

478
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,711
in the process.

479
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,421
Plus, it's much safer
and remains more vividly

480
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,548
in the shopkeeper's
minds than just leaving

481
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,758
a note or message behind,

482
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,259
where anyone can
find out about it.

483
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,261
Talk about a brilliant idea.

484
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,515
- Brilliant ideas are a
given for her ladyship.

485
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,350
- Still, it's really
quite impressive

486
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,851
for our princess of frugality.

487
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,771
To squander so much money
like that just for our sake's.

488
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,023
(laughs)

489
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,317
Guess we really
must be loved, huh?

490
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,362
- Hm.

491
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,238
Huh?

492
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,783
It's the Murderous Blades.

493
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:37,659
- Hm.

494
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,286
(tense music)

495
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,374
Sa Province is my territory,

496
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,542
as well as you should.

497
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,710
You're the Murderous Blades.

498
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,919
Are you stupid?

499
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,629
You have some nerve
coming out like you did

500
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,797
while I was away.

501
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,549
Trust me, you're
gonna regret this.

502
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,551
(upbeat music)

503
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,510
(sword clanks)

504
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,805
(men grunting)

505
00:18:58,847 --> 00:18:59,806
(yelling)

506
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,558
(yelling)

507
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,310
(men grunting)

508
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:10,734
- Kori.
- Hmm?

509
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,402
(exclaims)

510
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,737
Young Master!

511
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,697
- What do you mean by "gah"?

512
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,699
I've never before
received such a response

513
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,908
from anyone.

514
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,493
Least of all when
speaking to a young lady

515
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,411
such as yourself.

516
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,746
(chuckles nervously)

517
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,539
You just really
surprised me, that's all.

518
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,082
- I came out here to
keep an eye on you

519
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,960
so that you don't purchase
any more tea, but--

520
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,420
- Oh, I'm sorry.

521
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,421
If that's the case then
I'm afraid you got here

522
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:32,505
a little late.

523
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,381
- Huh.

524
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,799
So it appears.

525
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,010
You keep buying all the
ganlu tea everywhere we go.

526
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,428
What are you planning to do?

527
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,430
Do you intend to
open a tea house?

528
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,681
- That's not it.

529
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,308
Later on I'm going to
make lots of this tea

530
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,310
for the people who
are important to me.

531
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,395
- [Sa] Hm.

532
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,939
So you have people
important to you then?

533
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:50,857
- That's right.

534
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,900
They're precious.

535
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,362
- Well, I feel somewhat jealous.

536
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,530
- Hm?
- So, Rosa.

537
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,740
- Huh?

538
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,617
- I was just noticing
that they passed us.

539
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,660
Those two mysterious
bounty hunters.

540
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,536
- Oh.

541
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:04,788
You're right.

542
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,331
- It looks like the
Murderous Blades bandits

543
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,333
and this bounty hunting
duo are both heading

544
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,502
in the exact same
direction we are.

545
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,004
It's almost as if they
were chasing after us.

546
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,964
- You, you think so?

547
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,967
- It must be nice to be
as carefree as those men.

548
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,803
But as for us,
let's take our time

549
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,055
and go at a casual
pace, shall we?

550
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:25,058
It'll be at least another 10
days before we reach Kinka.

551
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,103
- [Sa] What you do isn't
called taking your time,

552
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,813
it's called laziness.

553
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:30,772
- Huh.

554
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,524
You have a way with words.

555
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,485
- Huh?

556
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,945
- Look, until now,

557
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,614
no woman has come to
understand me so thoroughly

558
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,990
in such a short time.

559
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,659
I think that means
there's nothing left

560
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,786
but for the two of us to marry.

561
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:45,829
- Uh.

562
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,039
Ah, you know, young Master--

563
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,917
- I wish you'd stop calling
me young Master, Kourin.

564
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,502
- [Shuurei] Huh?

565
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,005
- Rather then the young
master of the Rin family,

566
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,132
I want you to see me.

567
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,717
- Huh?

568
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,802
- [Man] Rather than the
king, I want you to see me.

569
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,389
- [Shuurei] This man...

570
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,516
- Senya, yes?

571
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,393
More than anything,

572
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,854
hmm, I wish to hear
you say my name

573
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,897
with that cute voice of yours.

574
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,858
(calm music)

575
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,526
- Uh.

576
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,112
Actually, I think I prefer
calling you young Master.

577
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,949
And also, I wish you wouldn't
joke about us getting married.

578
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,702
- I think the two of us would
make an excellent couple.

579
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,829
- Please, think about the
difference in our ages.

580
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:28,830
- Really?

581
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,081
Our ages you say?

582
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,708
Come to think of it,

583
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,084
your age and mine are
not very different at all

584
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,462
from those of the couples
in the upcoming marriage.

585
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,964
Between the governor and
the son of the Sa Clan.

586
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,674
- Is that so?

587
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,093
The new governor and
the son of the...

588
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,095
Hmm?

589
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,013
Say what?

590
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,142
That would be me, right?

591
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,020
But what's this
about a marriage?

592
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,150
- By the way,

593
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,818
there was a quite an
interesting rumor in town.

594
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,445
- [Shi] Oh yeah?

595
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,781
- Princess' marriage to the
second son of the Sa Clan.

596
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,115
- Huh?

597
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,533
- Judging by your
response, you're surprised.

598
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:06,785
Like a bolt out of the blue.

599
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,746
But, that's a pretty high road.

600
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,998
Trying to make her
theirs through marriage.

601
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,917
The eldest is our
good friend Sojun.

602
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,835
Then Kokujun is the third son,

603
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,545
so the second is Sakujun.

604
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,547
He's supposed to
be 29 years old.

605
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,049
That means he's just a
little older than us,

606
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,094
and there's a 12 year difference
between him and princess.

607
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,345
- Anyway you look at it,

608
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,889
that marriage proposal
would never be accepted.

609
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,225
And even if, by some
remote chance it was,

610
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,103
this Sakujun man would only
be assassinated immediately

611
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,771
by Lord Reishin's men.

612
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,524
He'd be a goner before
he had a chance to blink.

613
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,775
- The terrifying thing is that

614
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,568
that's actually
pretty believable.

615
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,488
Those two will make
good governors.

616
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,864
I have no doubt of that.

617
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,660
I look forward to the day
I get to work with them.

618
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,828
- [Shi] Yeah.

619
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,830
- Not to mention
you'll be around too.

620
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,751
(wind howls)

621
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,169
- [Meishou] So sorry, gentlemen.

622
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,796
- [Both] Huh?

623
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,047
- [Meishou] But I'm afraid
you'll have to give up

624
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,215
on that day ever coming.

625
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,969
- No way.

626
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,220
Meishou.

627
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,638
(growls)

628
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,806
- So the leader of
the Murderous Blades

629
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,599
is finally making a
personal appearance.

630
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,811
- It's been about
14 years, hasn't it,

631
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,230
little whirlwind and
little rascal king?

632
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,612
(calm music)

633
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:51,222
{\an8}(woman singing in
foreign language)

634
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,795
- [Shuurei] A noble lady of the
direct line of the Hong clan

635
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,338
is to marry into the Sa clan?

636
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,341
That is definitely me,
they're talking about, right?

637
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,176
How did this whole
thing come about?

638
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,720
{\an8}Sakujun Sa?

639
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,304
{\an8}What kind of person is he?
