1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,175
{\an8}(dramatic chords)

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,724
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,536
- Well, I'm finally here.

4
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,705
(chuckles)

5
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,040
- [Narrator] One
month has passed

6
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,459
since Shurei Hong
left the royal harem.

7
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,379
Since then, Saiunkoku's
capital, Kiyou,

8
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,881
has been suffering
under the scorching sun.

9
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,675
It is now the middle of summer.

10
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,762
- This weather is
intolerable, it's way too hot.

11
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,597
Huh, eh?

12
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,684
Hey, pull yourself together.

13
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,270
- [Narrator] One after another,

14
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,481
people have collapsed
in the excessive heat.

15
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,693
Eventually, the Imperial Court
found itself short-staffed.

16
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,037
- Don't overwork yourself
in this heat, Seiran.

17
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,747
- I'm only a grainery guard.

18
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,499
It's not really a job
that requires hard work.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,043
- I guess that's
true, but still.

20
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,421
- There's no need to worry
about me, I'm sure I'll be fine.

21
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,839
I'll be going now.

22
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,842
(suspenseful music)

23
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,518
- I know this feeling.

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,854
It's that time of year again.

25
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,898
(sighs)

26
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,525
- As a result of
this extreme heat,

27
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,985
many people have
been incapacitated.

28
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,529
And this is affecting
our daily work.

29
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,074
The Ministry of Finance was
short-staffed to begin with.

30
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,076
But now, we're in a
critical situation.

31
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,994
- It is just have
you have heard.

32
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,788
In light of this
crisis, we encourage you

33
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,540
to lend your staff to
the Ministry of Finance.

34
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,958
- Ministry of Finance?

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,670
- Send our subordinates
to work under that weirdo?

36
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,796
- [Man] What should we do?

37
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,590
- [Man] It's an
unreasonable request.

38
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,551
- If the Ministry of Finance
is unable to function,

39
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,804
funds cannot be
distributed properly.

40
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,806
This affects us all.

41
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,558
This is a request, not
an order from the king.

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,560
But do you not agree that
we should help one another

43
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,812
in times of crisis?

44
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,105
- Yes, of course, your majesty.

45
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,565
- My sincere gratitude
to the court.

46
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,734
Senior Secretary Kou
is also grateful.

47
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,904
- Is he serious?

48
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,574
- Well then, moving
on to the next issue.

49
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,701
It's been reported

50
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,494
that an increasing
number of bandits...

51
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,083
And that concludes
today's session.

52
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,919
- Actually, there is one other
thing we wish to discuss.

53
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,672
Concerning the
national examinations.

54
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,009
We wish to allow
women to take part.

55
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,513
(everyone gasping and murmuring)

56
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,726
We wish for the system
to be open to all women.

57
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:37,152
- So although I'm very lonely,
I'm still sleeping by myself.

58
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,529
From a-non-ne--

59
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,615
- It's pronounced
anonymous, silly.

60
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,869
This one says, I miss
Shurei's erhu very much.

61
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,538
And this one says, I
wanna sleep beside you

62
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,081
and feel your warmth.

63
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,167
What's that supposed to mean?

64
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,836
- Okay, everyone, you
don't have to read them.

65
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,546
Turn the sheets over
and use the back

66
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,881
to practice your writing.

67
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,799
We have more than enough paper.

68
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,925
- Yes, ma'am.

69
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,679
- Of all the things that
ridiculous man does,

70
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,806
some of them can actually
be pretty useful.

71
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,894
- This is a gift from anonymous.

72
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,895
- What the--

73
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,854
- To combat the heat.

74
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,732
- But I can't even move them.

75
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,776
- [Messenger] This is
a gift from anonymous.

76
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,152
(groans)

77
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,821
He said, "I found these
unusual flowers in bloom."

78
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,656
- A spider lily?

79
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,658
It's usually meant
for dead people.

80
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,785
What?

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,994
Does he think my
house is a cemetery?

82
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,997
- [Messenger] Another
gift from anonymous.

83
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,958
- Why is he sending
me boiled eggs?

84
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,920
- [Messenger] This
is a gift from--

85
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,130
(groans)

86
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,803
- Honestly, that man is
completely and utterly hopeless.

87
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,933
(calm music)

88
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:50,850
Ryuki.

89
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,232
- Shurei, you're here.

90
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,149
I love you.

91
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,068
- What are you talking about?

92
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,947
(laughs) This is the
man I'm going to marry.

93
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,157
- Very sorry about this, Ryuki.

94
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,701
- Brother?

95
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,994
- Seiran is so much more
mature and reliable.

96
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,163
You will give us your
blessing, won't you?

97
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,123
- Huh?

98
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,040
No, wait.

99
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,835
- Well, then, goodbye,
brother-in-law.

100
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,253
- Hope you find happiness.

101
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,130
See you later, little brother.

102
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,798
- Hey, wait a minute.

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,925
(screams)

104
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,012
(laughing)

105
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,055
Get out.

106
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,141
- I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to laugh.

107
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,019
It was just such an amusing
dream, I couldn't help myself.

108
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,145
- It was a nightmare.

109
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,148
(snorts and laughs)

110
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,899
(groans)

111
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,277
But that dream did have
some truth to it, didn't it?

112
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,779
- No, I told you,
it was a nightmare.

113
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,031
- Nightmare or not, Shurei

114
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,033
is about the right
age for marriage.

115
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,869
Whether it's Serian or not,
it would not be unusual

116
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,164
for her to receive a marriage
proposal from someone.

117
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,749
- But I've been
sending her letters

118
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,168
almost everyday
and lots of gifts.

119
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,171
- Huh, if you don't
mind me asking,

120
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,757
what was the last gift
that you sent to her?

121
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,175
- I gave her a voodoo doll.

122
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,176
- Hm?

123
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,844
Why on earth would you do that?

124
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,179
- Advisor Sho told me about it,

125
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,765
he said the doll's
a famous love charm.

126
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,184
I put my own hair inside
and focused on her

127
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,186
before sending it so
the heat of my passion

128
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,854
would be delivered.

129
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,022
- Yes, but you haven't received

130
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,816
a single response from
her yet, have you?

131
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,862
- Hmm, maybe I made a mistake
by sending them anonymously.

132
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,113
She probably doesn't realize

133
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,199
who those gifts
are actually from.

134
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,076
Hmm, that's it,
that has to be it.

135
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,871
- Hmm, the road of love
is long and difficult,

136
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,081
isn't it, Your Majesty?

137
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,791
- Yeah, that's why
I'm trying to think

138
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,334
of other ways to go about it.

139
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,211
So what's your opinion, Koyu?

140
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,088
- I think it needs
to be rewritten.

141
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,966
A proposal like
this will never win

142
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,260
Senior Secretary
Kou's approval as is.

143
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,013
(groans)

144
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,473
After you made your
sudden and stupid outburst

145
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,934
in the Imperial Court, he
got up and left the chambers

146
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,144
without saying a
word, didn't he?

147
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,063
- Maybe I was too impatient.

148
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,731
I just--

149
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,358
- It's next to impossible
to get a proposal passed

150
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,235
once it's been rejected
the first time.

151
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,946
Not to mention this matter is
one that needs to be handled

152
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,240
with a great deal of
caution in the first place.

153
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,742
- Very well, I understand,
I'll rewrite it.

154
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,370
And Koyu?

155
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,871
- Yes?

156
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,166
- This proposal must be passed,
and passed within the year.

157
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,086
(calm music)

158
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,755
- I hope this summer
passes by quickly.

159
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,768
- I'm back, I just got home.

160
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,853
Huh?

161
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,770
- Welcome back.

162
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,108
- Thanks, I guess.

163
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,778
- Oh, hello, Seiran,
welcome home.

164
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,405
- Who's this
stranger over there?

165
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,281
- Him?

166
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,157
Well, he's--

167
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,952
- Hm, hey, I know you.

168
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,787
Aren't you the little whirlwind?

169
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,914
(groans)

170
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,918
- What's wrong, Seiran?

171
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,005
(straining)

172
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,133
- Give me a break, don't
tell me it's you, Ensei.

173
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,052
- Correct, wow,
it really is you.

174
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,136
Long time no see.

175
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,804
You're looking really good.

176
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,432
- What in the world
are you doing here?

177
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,184
- It's just a
coincidence, I assure you.

178
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,144
I have a bit of business
to take care of in Kiyou,

179
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,438
but I haven't really
been eating well lately.

180
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,065
I collapsed outside your door.

181
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,317
Princess picked
me up and fed me.

182
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,152
- Great, now you can just
turn around and leave.

183
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,153
- What?

184
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,238
That's so cold of you to say.

185
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,157
- Go collapse in front
of someone else's door.

186
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,826
Heck, I'll write a letter
of introduction for you.

187
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,869
- You're so cruel.

188
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,332
- Seiran, what's gotten
into you all of a sudden?

189
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,042
- My lady, you
can't just go around

190
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,460
picking up trash like this,

191
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,921
even if it was just
laying on the ground.

192
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,092
- But he said he was on the
brink of dying from starvation.

193
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,344
- (laughs) Don't worry,
he's not gonna die,

194
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,845
I can guarantee you.

195
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,097
Now why don't I
take out the trash

196
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,349
and throw this thing
out at the same time?

197
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,267
- Don't the two of
you know each other?

198
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,352
- No, we don't.

199
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,937
- Yeah, of course we do.

200
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,231
The two of us were just
reminiscing about old times.

201
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,400
We're good buddies from
way back, aren't we?

202
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,277
Seiran now, right?

203
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,405
(groans)

204
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,158
- So you are an old
friend of Seiran's.

205
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,993
Well then, please
make yourself at home.

206
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,245
Father should be back soon.

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,167
- It seems you've lucked out.

208
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,044
You've been taken in by
a really nice family.

209
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,422
You actually look happy
for once, which is great.

210
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,092
I can't pay for the food,
but why don't I share stories

211
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,510
of your past as payment instead?

212
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,262
(screams)

213
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,973
- If you so much as breathe
a word about my past,

214
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,017
I will cut off
that head of yours.

215
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,480
- Geez, I was only kidding.

216
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,108
(groans)

217
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,113
{\an8}(playful music)

218
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,493
- So, Ensei, is it?

219
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,996
And what is it that brings
you here to Kiyou City?

220
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,165
- Well, I've come
here to see someone

221
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,708
but it's a little
difficult getting to meet

222
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,003
with that person, so I imagine
I'll be staying for a while.

223
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,172
- Ah, is the person
of higher rank?

224
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,548
- Yeah, you could say that.

225
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,633
- In that case, maybe
you could introduce him

226
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,303
to someone within the
Imperial Court, father.

227
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,512
- I'll only ask for your help

228
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,181
if I've run out of
all other options.

229
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,432
It's kind of secretive business

230
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,225
that brings me here, after all.

231
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,352
- [Shoka] You're
welcome to stay here

232
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,520
until you've taken
care of things.

233
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,022
- But my Lord.

234
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,025
- He is your friend,
isn't he, Seiran?

235
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,361
- No, not exactly a friend.

236
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,529
- But he isn't a
bad person, is he?

237
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,365
- No, no, he's not, but--

238
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,367
- [Shoka] Then there's
no problem, is there?

239
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,203
- You should really be
nicer to your friends.

240
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,704
- Well--

241
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,373
- As long as you don't mind
the condition of our house.

242
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,375
- Hey, I've had my fill
of sleeping outside.

243
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,251
This is more than I
could have wished for.

244
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,670
- Think nothing of it,
you're welcome here.

245
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,672
Relax and make yourself at home.

246
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,674
- Then I gladly
accept your offer.

247
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,133
Seconds, please.

248
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,301
- That's enough.

249
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,387
(laughs)

250
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,599
(mysterious music)

251
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,608
(groans)

252
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,698
- Welcome back.

253
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,408
I'll start getting
some tea ready.

254
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,284
Please have a seat.

255
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,245
- I brought some steamed
buns that I made.

256
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,579
I hope you enjoy them.

257
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,415
- You made steamed buns?

258
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,582
- Mhm.

259
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,084
Lady Shurei taught
me how to make them

260
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,420
while she was staying
in the royal harem.

261
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,422
- Oh, well in that case,
why don't we have them

262
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,631
as a snack to with our tea?

263
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,386
By the way, thank you so much
for going through the trouble

264
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,222
of taking Korin
back to Sa Province.

265
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,266
- Not at all, it was nothing.

266
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,194
The womsn who took Korin
in, Advisor Sa's wife,

267
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,739
is very, how shall I put it?

268
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,241
An extremely surprising lady.

269
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,452
- She's truly an
extraordinary person

270
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,412
who leaves a lasting impression.

271
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,539
- You're right, as long as
she has someone like that

272
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,625
to talk to, I'm sure Korin
will be able to recover.

273
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,628
Of course, that may just
be some wishful thinking

274
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,339
on my part.

275
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,798
- Don't worry,
she'll be all right.

276
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,134
And Advisor Sa has a wife
who loved him just as much.

277
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,677
In fact, she's the one
person who loved him

278
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,305
who was loved by Advisor
Sa more than Korin.

279
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,224
And more importantly, she
is a very strong woman.

280
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,644
If Korin stays with her, I'm
sure everything will be fine.

281
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,647
- Yes, I hope it won't be long

282
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,691
before that girl
can smile again.

283
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,277
- Allow me to start.

284
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,236
- Huh?

285
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,404
- Your steamed buns, of course.

286
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,447
- Oh, please do.

287
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,163
- Wow, these are delicious.

288
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,706
These are just as
good as Shurei's.

289
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,297
- Lord Shoka, your
tea is also very nice.

290
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,468
- No, that's not right.

291
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,304
This would never get the
Finance Minister's approval.

292
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,725
- Hmm.

293
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,519
- The Urin army that
guards the palace

294
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,397
is to be sent out
to catch bandits?

295
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,815
- As you know, Shi's
provincial army

296
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,316
has been so short-handed,

297
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,402
they would borrow
a cat's paw by now.

298
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,528
- I'm afraid we don't really

299
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,571
have any extra bodies
to spare either.

300
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,575
- (chuckles) Don't you
worry, I'll also lend a hand.

301
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,286
- [Shuei Voiceover] This
old man just wants a chance

302
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,705
to go wild and
fight, doesn't he?

303
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,708
- While you're at it, why
not use this opportunity

304
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,294
to convince that man to
return to the Urin army?

305
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,713
- By that man, I
assume you're referring

306
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,715
to a certain grainery guard.

307
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,466
- Generals Koku
and Haku have also

308
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,552
been quite insistent
in asking for him.

309
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,595
(laughs)

310
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,555
- Hmm.

311
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,518
(peaceful music)

312
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,564
- Huh?

313
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,315
- Huh?

314
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,859
- So where are you goin, Koyu?

315
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,610
- Where else would I be going?

316
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,446
The dinner party
is tonight, right?

317
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,322
I assume that's why
you're carrying the--

318
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,782
- Yes, but you
see, Shurei's house

319
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,868
is actually in that direction.

320
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,329
- (groans) I like to
take the long route.

321
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,248
Anything wrong with that?

322
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:15,832
- Long route.

323
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,254
- [Shurei] Welcome,
please come in.

324
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,468
- Th house and courtyard
are the same as before.

325
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,886
- I'm afraid that's
because all of the money

326
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,597
Advisor Sho gave me
has already been spent.

327
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,266
- All 500 gold coins?

328
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,601
- I heard most of it
was used for things

329
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,269
like repairing the
temple's school

330
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,772
and donations to
the local doctors.

331
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:39,647
- Ah.

332
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,444
- Wow, working
directly under the king

333
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,488
at such a young age is amazing.

334
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,615
What kind of person
is the current king?

335
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,533
- Well, if you ask
me, he's a childish,

336
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,535
natural airhead
of a 19-year-old.

337
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,787
- Hmm?

338
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,789
- He is a natural
airhead, isn't he?

339
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,291
- You know him, too, Princess?

340
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,834
- Kind of.

341
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,504
- But even so, he may surprise
us and become someone great.

342
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,924
He certainly has lots of
potential at the very least.

343
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,592
- Hmm.

344
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,386
- By the way, Ensei, I hear

345
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,638
you're originally
from Sa Province.

346
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,391
So what was your
journey here like?

347
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,600
- How was my journey, you ask?

348
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,852
Are you referring to
the mountain bandits?

349
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,355
Unfortunately, they'd
been very active.

350
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,441
- What are you talking about?

351
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,527
- There have been reports
of an influx of bandits

352
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,404
coming from Sa
Province as of late.

353
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,947
And the Urin army
is sending officers

354
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,408
to help guard the city
and apprehend them.

355
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,826
With the situation as it is,

356
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,453
I'd like to ask Seiran
to assist us as well.

357
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,621
- Huh?
- Huh?

358
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,832
- You're asking Seiran
to catch bandits?

359
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,500
But he's only a grainery guard,

360
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,544
he shouldn't have
to hunt for outlaws.

361
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,879
- Advisor So and our field
marshals are insisting.

362
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,673
And they won't take
no for an answer.

363
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,842
It seems they've all
been extremely impressed

364
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,385
with Seiran's skills.

365
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,679
- But still.

366
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,889
- It's only a temporary
job for the army,

367
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,850
so he'll be able to
return to his old position

368
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,643
in no time at all.

369
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,395
- [Shuei Voiceover]
At least possibly.

370
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,567
- General Ran, how
about this man here?

371
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,527
He has good skills,
limitless energy,

372
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,446
and is cheap to employ.

373
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,449
- Hey, wait a minute, I
have business to attend to.

374
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,617
- Well, if Seiran
says he's that good,

375
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,454
then Ensei's skills
must be beyond question.

376
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,580
- Absolutely.

377
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,373
- [Shurei Voiceover]
Wow, so he really

378
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,876
is a trusted and
reliable friend.

379
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,627
(sighs)

380
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,504
- But even if he does
end up helping us,

381
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,631
I still won't give up
trying to persuade you

382
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:29,924
to join us as well.

383
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,635
- Is that so?

384
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,721
All right, I understand.

385
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,930
- Seiran.

386
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,724
- Don't worry,
it'll be all right.

387
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,602
I'll try my best to make
it back home before dinner.

388
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,645
I'll be sure to cut
corners wherever I can

389
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,481
and if there's danger,
I'll shield myself

390
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,399
with other people and run away.

391
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,650
- Huh?

392
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,944
- In the meantime, Ensei
will take over my place.

393
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,655
Any problems with
that, freeloader?

394
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,615
- Hmm?

395
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,908
Guess not.

396
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,409
- [Seiran] Yeah, and
you'd better work hard

397
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,660
to help lady Shurei.

398
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,663
If anything happens, I
will cut off your head.

399
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,707
- [Ensei] Okay, okay, I got it.

400
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,543
- Are you really that
worried about Seiran?

401
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,671
- No, it's just that
it's summer and--

402
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,630
- Summer?

403
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,509
- It's nothing, really.

404
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,470
(nervously laughs)

405
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,935
Lord Koyu, would you
like another helping?

406
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,603
- Huh?

407
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,064
Oh, sure, I'd love to have
a little more, please.

408
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,941
And I also have a
favor to ask of you.

409
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,777
- What is it, do you want
me to catch bandits too?

410
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,945
- [Koyu] How would
you like to work

411
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,697
in the Imperial
Court for a month?

412
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,579
(calm music)

413
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,003
- [Sho] (chuckles) You look
quite troubled, young man.

414
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,546
- Huh?

415
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,588
Advisor Sho.

416
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,677
- So is this the proposal
about allowing women

417
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,638
to take the National Civil
Service examinations?

418
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,099
I would offer you my praise
if this idea of yours

419
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,102
didn't carry such
a personal motive.

420
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,104
- [Ryuki Voiceover] You bastard.

421
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,482
- You seem to have been working
very hard, Your Majesty.

422
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,109
You're not rushing to
complete the proposal

423
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,986
just to try and have
it passed in time

424
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,988
for the next exam sitting?

425
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,573
- It's for Shurei.

426
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,991
- Hmm?

427
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,993
- While she was here, Shurei
worked hard for my sake.

428
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,870
Now it's only fair
that I take my turn

429
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,621
and work hard for her's.

430
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,498
- Hmm.

431
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,043
- By the way, what's that?

432
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,588
- You mean this pot here?

433
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,716
It's a delicacy from an
island in the far east.

434
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,052
Dried pickled plums.

435
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,553
- Dried pickled plums?

436
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,931
- (laughs) Even if you want
them, I won't give them to you.

437
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,975
They're very hard
to get, after all.

438
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,148
- The Senior Secretary's
personal assistant?

439
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,775
Even if they are short-staffed,

440
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,777
they wouldn't allow me in
an important job like that.

441
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,944
- You'll only be
running errands,

442
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,155
it's not really
an important job.

443
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,698
(Shurei groans)

444
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,033
So you're not interested?

445
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,618
You don't want to
go back to the court

446
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,620
where that stupid king is, huh?

447
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,746
- It's not like that,

448
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,624
I actually quite
enjoyed my stay there.

449
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,167
And just as General
Ran was saying,

450
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,003
that man has the potential to
become someone truly great.

451
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,174
[Shurei Voiceover] But
if I go back there,

452
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,885
it'll rekindle that dream of
mine that can never come true.

453
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,553
- What a great opportunity.

454
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,555
It's pretty rare to get a chance

455
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,099
to work in the Imperial Court.

456
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,185
Frankly, I have no idea why
you're hesitating, Princess.

457
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,646
In life, it's better to
regret something you did

458
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,106
than to regret
something you didn't do.

459
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,107
Don't you agree?

460
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,067
- You think so, Ensei?

461
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,777
- Although I hate to admit it,

462
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,071
this guy does have a
good point, lady Shurei.

463
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:41,116
- If you want to do it, I
don't have a problem with it.

464
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,867
- Seiran, father.

465
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,958
Thank you.

466
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,918
I gratefully accept your offer.

467
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,796
- All right, by the way,
women aren't permitted to work

468
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,091
in the outer court, so you'll
have to wear men's attire.

469
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,592
- Won't I be discovered?

470
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,011
- There's no need to worry.

471
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,721
I mean with that
figure of yours,

472
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,931
there's no way anyone will
ever notice you're a woman.

473
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,975
(groans)

474
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,941
- The Senior Secretary
is bound to notice

475
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,860
that Shurei is a girl, isn't he?

476
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,738
- Yeah, you might just be right.

477
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,114
- Huh?
- But still.

478
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,741
I have confidence in her.

479
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,624
- That king is making a
future to look forward to.

480
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,168
Right, my old friend?

481
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,637
(playful music)

482
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,266
- It really suits you.

483
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,144
- I agree, no one would ever
realize you're really a girl.

484
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,730
- You make a very
convincing boy.

485
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:54,647
- [Shurei Voiceover]
(sighs) I don't know

486
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:55,899
if that's a compliment or not.

487
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:58,985
- Right, I'll be going then.

488
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,820
- Have a great day.

489
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,158
- Hey.
(groans)

490
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,868
You are going to go with her.

491
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,744
- Huh?

492
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:08,953
Me too?

493
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,081
- Of course, stay close
to lady Shurei's side.

494
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,749
And if anything happens--

495
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,876
- Let me guess, you'll
cut off this head of mine.

496
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,795
All right, I get it, I get it.

497
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,173
Hey, wait up, wait
for me, Princess.

498
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,884
(calm music)

499
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,311
- I never thought I
would come here again.

500
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,689
(sighs)

501
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,317
What's the Senior
Secretary like, by the way?

502
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,027
- He's very capable
and he's touted

503
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,195
to be the next prime minister.

504
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,031
But he's also strange
and mysterious.

505
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,783
He's a member of the Kou family.

506
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,201
His name is Kijin Kou.

507
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,202
- Hmm?

508
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,912
I hope you don't mean Kijin

509
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:53,039
as in the word meaning
weirdo, do you?

510
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,917
- That's right,
however, I understand

511
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,712
his original real
name is different.

512
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,213
Since people were always
calling him a weirdo,

513
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:03,216
he decided he may as
well make that his name.

514
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,801
- So even in the court,

515
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,928
they are interesting
characters like that.

516
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,055
Speaking of which, secretary Ri,

517
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,974
you said we'd be at the
Department of Finance

518
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,226
within 30 minutes, but
it's been almost two hours.

519
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,269
Aren't we there yet?

520
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,983
- (groans) When did the
Ministry of Finance move?

521
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,860
- So we're lost.

522
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,988
- Pardon me, my Lord,

523
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,948
Shu Hong and Ensei
Ro have arrived.

524
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,911
May I present the senior
secretary, Kijin Kou.

525
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,122
- [Ensei Voiceover] (groans)
This guy is definitely--

526
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,999
- [Shurei Voiceover] A weirdo.

527
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,002
(mysterious music)

528
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:50,930
(singing in foreign language)

529
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,877
I've come to
the palace again

530
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:03,920
And met a strange person

531
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,548
Well I suppose I've met
quite a few strange people

532
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,383
but this is the first time
I've ever met a man

533
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,926
wearing a mask like that

534
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,013
Kijin Kou
A very mysterious man
