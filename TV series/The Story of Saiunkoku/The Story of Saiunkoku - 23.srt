1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,217
{\an8}(electronic whirring)

2
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:15,724
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,438
(tense music)

4
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,565
- [Narrator] Sa Province is
one of the eight provinces

5
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,442
that make up Saiunkoku.

6
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,277
In its capital city of Korin,

7
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,446
in the chambers of a
particular residence

8
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,699
an old man is
gloating to himself.

9
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,284
The man is no other
than Chuushou Sa

10
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,870
the younger brother of
the late advisor Enjun Sa.

11
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,416
- At last the time has come.

12
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,711
It's been one year since you
died, my dear elder brother.

13
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,587
You can't imagine how
much fighting there's been

14
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,424
in the struggle for
the clan leadership.

15
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,884
However, that will
all be at an end soon.

16
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,303
As long as the new
governors are held in check,

17
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,681
the one who controls
their seal and charm

18
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,017
will be the one to become
the new clan leader.

19
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,519
(evil laugh)

20
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,356
First will be the
elimination of Ensei Ro.

21
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,568
- We're from the border
office of Sireen, do not move.

22
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,862
(growls)

23
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,406
(whimpering)

24
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,702
- You're charged with running

25
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,953
through the border
station twice.

26
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,872
Both last summer
and this spring.

27
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,749
You can't talk
your way out of it.

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,875
(nervous grimace)

29
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,418
- And there are further charges.

30
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,794
This past month
you've been assaulting

31
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,755
neighboring cities and
towns, committing robbery

32
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,882
of money and
valuables, even murder!

33
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,717
You shall confess to
everything you've done

34
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,927
little rascal king of
the murderous blades.

35
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,639
- Look I have no knowledge
of anything other

36
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,725
than running through
the border station.

37
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,019
I guess there's no way out
of this, I'll go with them.

38
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,645
- I'm afraid you're
not the only one

39
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,105
who will be coming with us.

40
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,983
Aren't you the little whirlwind
of the murderous blades?

41
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,944
- Don't, don't resist
Seiran, just let it go.

42
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,616
- Next we get the
two new co-governors.

43
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,744
I don't care if the
boy gets killed.

44
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,623
The main problem will
be the other one.

45
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,917
The Hong clan wouldn't
take her death lightly.

46
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,798
So we'll have to lure
her into our arms.

47
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,759
Sakujun should be most
suitable for that.

48
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,844
The time has come.

49
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,845
As soon as we get rid

50
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,723
of elder brother's his bloodline

51
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,100
will come to a fitting end.

52
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,770
Even if I die, my bloodline
will still continue.

53
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,314
You died first,
and you have lost.

54
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:57,570
I promise that I will surpass
you Enjun Sa. (laughs)

55
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,740
(dramatic music)

56
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,503
(gasps)

57
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,807
- [Seiran] You hit a government
official and used his seal

58
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,600
while he was down?

59
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,477
- Hey, I told him I
was in a hurry to go

60
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,979
and make a direct
appeal to the king.

61
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,647
But he kept searching
for faults in me

62
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,857
and refused to let me through.

63
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,609
- Ensei, you stupid idiot.

64
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,654
If anything bad happens to
her ladyship I'll kill you.

65
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,823
- Geez will you have
a little faith in her.

66
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,033
In case you'd forgotten,

67
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,993
princess remained hidden
and didn't come out.

68
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,786
If she had come out
or remained with us,

69
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,164
both governors would have
easily fallen into the clutches

70
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,874
of the Sa clan.

71
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,667
She saw what was going
on and understood

72
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,502
what the best course
of action was.

73
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,796
These are the good results
of princess's appraisal

74
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,381
of the situation as governor.

75
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,009
No matter how you look
at it, it's her job

76
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,469
to make the decisions.

77
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,513
- I'm not in the
same position as you.

78
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,599
My job is to protect
the governors.

79
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,893
Why did you drag
me along here too?

80
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,396
- If you were your usual self

81
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,106
it wouldn't be a problem, but--

82
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,316
- [Seiran] What?

83
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,401
- [Ensei] The murderous
blades are involved.

84
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,028
(gasps)

85
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,906
- After all this time,
who'd ever thought we'd hear

86
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,866
that name again here and now.

87
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,743
I'm about the only
one who can stop you

88
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,620
if you lose control
and go on a rampage

89
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,121
because of those idiots.

90
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,123
Letting you escape with princess
while you're in that state

91
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,000
would only make me worry.

92
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,628
- You're being annoying
as always Ensei.

93
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,463
- Don't worry, knowing
princess we'll be able

94
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,590
to meet up with her
and Kinka in no time.

95
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,552
(scoffs)

96
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,889
(happy village chatter)

97
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,230
- Hey princess, there are so
many delicious things here.

98
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,649
Can I go buy some?
(gentle music)

99
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,818
- It's a very lively
town isn't it?

100
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,153
Wow there's a used
book store over there.

101
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,864
- My lady, are you
sure you're not tired?

102
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,242
Shall I buy you some
ice or something?

103
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,786
- Lady Shuurei, when
I'm feeling better

104
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,080
I'll see to your needs
again, I promise.

105
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,966
(hinges squeaking)

106
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:23,842
- Ah they've come, that was a
lot quicker than I expected.

107
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,761
- Hmm?

108
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,556
(flame crackling)

109
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,807
- [Soujun] I didn't
believe it at first,

110
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,226
but it is the real you Ensei Ro.

111
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:37,022
- Hey, long time no see Souji.

112
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,857
- Address me as lord Soujun.

113
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,775
Since they were with
you I must assume

114
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,819
that the kid and the young
girl are the new governors

115
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,112
of Sa Province.

116
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,156
- Why don't you ask
them instead of me?

117
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,534
- Not that it matters whether
they're imposters or not.

118
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,578
The charm and seal
are what's important.

119
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,621
As long as I have
those, I have the power

120
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,041
to name anybody I
wish as governor.

121
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,917
But wouldn't you know,
those very things

122
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,252
are nowhere to be found.

123
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,629
Tell me, where did you
hide the charm and seal?

124
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,173
- Who knows?

125
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:07,802
- (grunts) Well,
threatening you won't work.

126
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,095
- Whoa, what happened?

127
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,972
In the short time
since I last saw you,

128
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,850
you've actually become
pretty reasonable.

129
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,978
(metal clanking)

130
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,980
- Shut up, as long as
I have you in custody

131
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,232
it doesn't matter what sort
of new governors come in.

132
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,776
And I don't care if
you don't tell me

133
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,527
where the charm and
seal are hidden.

134
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,112
You can try shipping
them in, or whatever.

135
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,114
But ultimately they'll
come to Korin city,

136
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,699
and that's our territory.

137
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,994
As long as we get rid
of you and Yuushun Tei

138
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,163
we can take all the time
we need to look for them.

139
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,166
- You really have gained
a lot of wisdom Souji.

140
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,669
So who's the poor guy
who had to teach you?

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,878
(sword clanking)

142
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,631
- Ya, damn you, if I
ever get the opportunity

143
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,133
I want to kill you
with my own two hands.

144
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,096
- That's impossible, at
least not with your skills.

145
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,182
(scoff) Well then I'll
just starve you to death.

146
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,352
- What, but that's
the worst way to die!

147
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,937
- While I'm at it here's
a little something

148
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,021
you might want to know.

149
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,190
Kinka is already under control.

150
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,983
The control of the
murderous blades.

151
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,193
(gasps)

152
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,861
- You heard me, the
murderous blades.

153
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,364
That legendary band of
vicious thieves is working

154
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,074
for our family now.

155
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,702
- I thought that group was
wiped out a long time ago.

156
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,203
- It turns out there
was a survivor.

157
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,955
The second in command at that.

158
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,165
His name is Meishou.

159
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,960
(growls)

160
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,005
- Well if you think you can
escape go ahead and try.

161
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,634
(door slams)

162
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,636
- So that's Soujun Sa?

163
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,805
- Yeah, and it looks
like someone formidable

164
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,390
has been giving him some ideas.

165
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,017
- It certainly looks that way.

166
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,644
- Souji learned and
used the word starve

167
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,271
for the first time after all.

168
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,401
Meishou he says, that's
obviously how they all knew

169
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,862
my old nickname of the
Little Rascal King.

170
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,698
Seiran.

171
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,907
- [Seiran] What?

172
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,075
- You're going to
hunt down the ghosts

173
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,618
of the past, aren't you?

174
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,246
- Yes, if there's anyone
who might threaten to reveal

175
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,874
the past to her ladyship,
then I'll send them

176
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,001
to the very depths of hell.

177
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,919
- First things first,
we'll meet up with princess

178
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,338
in the town of Kinka
as originally planned.

179
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,424
If the murderous blades really
have taken control there

180
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,676
I need to weed them out
quickly as an assistant

181
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,136
to the governors.

182
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,929
- What about Eigetsu and Kourin?

183
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,806
- Do you mind if we stay
here a little longer

184
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,391
to make a decision about that?

185
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,768
- Huh?

186
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,102
- When everything is
over let's all drink

187
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,771
ganlu tea together.

188
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,273
Delicious tea that
princess has made herself.

189
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,283
(moans)

190
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,410
- Are you feeling all right?

191
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,287
- Where's Lady Shuurei?

192
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,665
- She got away, but Mr.
Seiran and Mr. Ensei are here

193
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,250
in the dungeon.

194
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,045
- This is my fault, you
should have left me behind

195
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,130
and made your escape.

196
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,676
- Miss Kourin,
it's not like that.

197
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,804
Why do you think Mr. Ensei only
hid Shuurei and no one else?

198
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,222
- I don't know.

199
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,015
- If we are going to be
caught, then we'd be better

200
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,767
off being caught as a foursome.

201
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,019
By now everybody knows
that the new governors

202
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,814
are a 13 year old boy
and a 17 year old girl.

203
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,483
And their assistants are the
previous governor Mr. Ensei

204
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,944
and his special
officer Mr. Seiran.

205
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,947
The Sa clan was looking
for this foursome.

206
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,866
- So I'm supposed to be a
stand-in for Lady Shuurei?

207
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,452
- Mhm, Shuurei is a
lady of the direct line

208
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,079
of the Hong clan.

209
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,330
Normally you'd think of a lady

210
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,416
who's well bred and sheltered.

211
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,418
I know that Shuurei would
probably be mad at me

212
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,878
if she heard me say this,
but you fit that sort

213
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,089
of image much better
than she does.

214
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,007
- Huh?

215
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,300
- Thanks to that
mistaken identity

216
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,802
they're taking good care of you.

217
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,013
We even save on accommodations.

218
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,223
We also prevent anyone
from pursuing Shuurei,

219
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,976
so all kinds of good things
have come out of this.

220
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,519
- You know, when
you put it that way

221
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,771
I'm beginning to feel
the same way too.

222
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,357
- So let's do our best to
keep fooling them, okay?

223
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,234
- You're right, no
matter what happens

224
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,030
from here on in, I'll do my
best for Lady Shuurei's sake.

225
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:55,697
- Hmm.

226
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,451
- (gasps) Why are you smiling?

227
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,369
- Oh, I was just thinking
that you're much prettier

228
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,205
with that sort of determined
expression on your face.

229
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,248
- How rude you are!

230
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,253
{\an8}(laughs nervously)

231
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,881
{\an8}(soft music)

232
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:22,682
(windchimes chiming)
(birds chirping)

233
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,685
- Your majesty, I have
a small favor to ask.

234
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,020
- Denied.

235
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,022
- I don't particularly
need you to hear me out.

236
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,732
I'll just go anyway.

237
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,567
- What's that,
where are you going?

238
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,570
- To Sa Province, I was
planning to deliver this.

239
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,033
- The Sa clan leader's ring?

240
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,868
So you're the one who had it!

241
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,162
You really are a
scheming, evil old man.

242
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,164
- Well I suppose
I'll be off then.

243
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,668
- Just who do you intend
to hand that ring to?

244
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,795
- There's no need to
worry, Your Majesty.

245
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,506
I don't intend to do anything
like blame you officials

246
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,174
with bright futures
ahead of them.

247
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,968
Besides, I'm not the one
who will choose, this will.

248
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,805
I can at least assure
you of that much.

249
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,972
- Huh?

250
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,557
- My but I'm looking
forward to it.

251
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,560
I haven't seen Shuurei
in such a long time.

252
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,562
Perhaps while I'm there
I'll see if I can have

253
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,692
some of her homemade
sweet buns again. (laughs)

254
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,819
(growls)

255
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,488
(village chatter)

256
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,739
- This is all the money I have.

257
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,950
I'll have to watch my spending.

258
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,744
- You are to make your
way to Kinka, got that?

259
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,080
- That's right, I
have to make my way

260
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,623
to Kinka no matter what.

261
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,960
(dull thudding)
(pottery shattering)

262
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,795
- Hey!
- I'm sorry!

263
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,172
- You little idiot,
look what you've done!

264
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,591
That wine cost me
20 silver coins.

265
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,553
- 20 silver coins, it
can't have cost that much.

266
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,638
- You heard me girl,
that's what it cost.

267
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,976
Damn, this is all you've got?

268
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,519
- Give that back!

269
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,731
I'll cover the expense, but
there's no way you can convince

270
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,607
me the wine was that expensive.

271
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,860
- What did you say?

272
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,195
- [Merchant] I agree with
her, I also don't believe it

273
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,905
to be that valuable.

274
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,118
- Oh yeah, what's it to
you, and just who are you?

275
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,872
- Who am I, well as you can
see I'm a merchant dear sir.

276
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,291
And a member of the
merchant's guild.

277
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,667
- The merchant's guild?

278
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,632
- That's right, the
merchant's guild can help me.

279
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,508
- Huh?

280
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,015
- So you two are
the new governors?

281
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,142
But you're just
a couple of kids.

282
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,269
- True, for starters
we'll test them

283
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,188
and make sure they're
the real thing.

284
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,817
In the seven scriptures, what
were the nine fundamentals

285
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,612
for ruling a country as
told to King Yuu by Keishi?

286
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,114
- The elements, businesses,
objects, arrangements,

287
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,867
royal perfection, virtues,
examination of doubts,

288
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,994
verifications, and happiness.

289
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,829
- Name the book,
section, and page number

290
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,831
in the seven scriptures
where I'd find that.

291
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,793
- It's in the book of History,
the section on the great plan

292
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,170
from the third line on
page 42, to the 12th line

293
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,172
on page 43.

294
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,008
- I see, very good,
now for you girl.

295
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,177
I want you to write down the
work that marked the beginning

296
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,846
of the brilliant career
of poet Mei Senshei.

297
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,015
- You can't be serious,
you want her to write all

298
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,141
of that long piece?

299
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,060
- Is there a problem with that?

300
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:16,231
- Well no, it's just she's not
feeling very well right now.

301
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,691
- Please give that to me.

302
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,902
(harp music)

303
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,956
(gasps)

304
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,375
- That will be enough, I
think it's safe to consider

305
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,753
them both the genuine article,
don't you lord Soujun?

306
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,963
- Oh, yes.

307
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,968
- The charm and the governor's
seal are all that remain now.

308
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,971
- Why not force these two
to give us the location?

309
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,640
- No, that's pointless,
they probably don't know.

310
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,058
It's likely that
they've been given

311
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,227
as little information
as possible.

312
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:59,024
Like, go to Kinka, or
something like that.

313
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,400
(gasps)

314
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,944
- As I thought, I never
expected the two of you

315
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,072
to be carrying such a
treasure in the first place.

316
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,240
That's why we've
taken the initiative

317
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,367
and already gained
control of Kinka.

318
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,871
As you know Kinka is the
merchant capital of Sa Province.

319
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,748
All material goods
entering Korin,

320
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,000
no matter how small,
go through there.

321
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,877
No doubt your plan
was to hide them in

322
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,379
with some other goods and
slip them in that way.

323
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,007
- That's Meisha for you,
that's why he's the new leader

324
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,508
of the murderous blades.

325
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,678
- Don't look so concerned,
even without the charm and seal

326
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,222
the two of you can still
be of great use to us.

327
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,891
Especially the girl.

328
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,142
(nervous gasping)

329
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,269
Lord Soujun, where is
your younger brother?

330
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,980
- You mean Sakujun,
he's still in Kinka.

331
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,273
He says he's scared
because the bandits

332
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,026
have apparently been
attacking the highway.

333
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,111
- In that case it would
probably be faster

334
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,905
to take these two
to him directly.

335
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,950
Young lady, please don't worry,
your future elder brother

336
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,912
will see to it that
you reach Kinka safely.

337
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,663
- What's that supposed to mean?

338
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,708
- Only the happiest of meanings,
my lady, the Sa main house

339
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,127
wishes for you to
become Sakujun's wife.

340
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,921
(shocked gasps)

341
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,090
- I will go on ahead
and return to Kinka

342
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,675
to get everything prepared.

343
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,885
As for you, lord Sojun,
you are to stay here

344
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,221
for the time being
until Ensei Ro escapes.

345
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,472
- Escapes?

346
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,891
- Oh he will, don't
you ever doubt that.

347
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,939
- What, you're going to
Kinka on your own, but--

348
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,358
- Yes, I know it's
probably very dangerous.

349
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,984
But that's why I was
thinking of going

350
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,861
through the merchant's guild
and having you introduce me

351
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,321
to a caravan for Kinka.

352
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,989
- Ah, I see.

353
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,992
- After all, the merchant's
guild can always be trusted.

354
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,494
- Not to mention,
there's little fear

355
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,246
of being attacked by bandits.

356
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,414
- Of course, because
then the guild

357
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,416
would be sure to retaliate.

358
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,085
- Exactly, it is only
natural to try and destroy

359
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,088
bands of thieves, and
we would also lay claim

360
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,382
to any valuables they
have hidden away.

361
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,426
- So unless they're an
exceptionally foolish

362
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,219
band of thieves, there's
no way they'd dare

363
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,389
attack a caravan belonging
to the merchant's guild.

364
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,932
- That's exactly right.

365
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,937
(indistinct chattering)

366
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,365
- [Trader] Young lady, you
have very discerning taste.

367
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,075
- Huh?

368
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,369
- That erhu is a
truly exceptional item
from Koku Province.

369
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,538
- Would you mind if I
tried it out for a bit?

370
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,956
- Of course, please do.

371
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,793
(gentle music)

372
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,400
(crowd applauding)

373
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,902
- That was amazing!

374
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,445
You're truly an accomplished
player young lady.

375
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,322
Out of respect for
your skill I have

376
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:55,408
to give you a special
discount, five silver pieces.

377
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,035
How about it?

378
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,080
- Sorry, I'm afraid I don't
have that much money on me.

379
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,915
However.
- However?

380
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,583
- I'll buy it for
one silver coin.

381
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,877
- Young lady, that's
way too cruel.

382
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,587
(chuckles)

383
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,463
- Huh?

384
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,800
(laughing)

385
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,262
(sweet music)

386
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,181
I beg your pardon
for interrupting.

387
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,435
You would like to have
that erhu, wouldn't you?

388
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,853
I'll make you an offer.

389
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,064
If you plan five tunes
that I request I'll pay

390
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,273
the five silver for you.

391
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,275
- And the titles of those tunes?

392
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,819
- They're Toshoki,
Ooten, Saiogu-shu,

393
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,531
Bewakei, and Soyokei.

394
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,118
- Those are all
difficult pieces to play.

395
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,411
- You can't play them?

396
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,496
- Nice try, I'll
accept your challenge.

397
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,002
(sweet music)

398
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,088
- That was truly wonderful.

399
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,464
- Why thank you.

400
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,633
- And I'm not only talking
about your performance.

401
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,093
You bargained the merchant down,

402
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,095
bought the erhu for
two silver coins,

403
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,097
and pocketed the
remaining three.

404
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,932
- You promised me
five silver pieces,

405
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,436
so I'm not giving
any back Mr. um?

406
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,023
- My name is Senya Rin, but
please, you can call me Senya.

407
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,989
- This is the Sakyo branch
of the merchant's guild.

408
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,158
- Now then, shall we go inside?

409
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,326
- Huh, you have
business here as well?

410
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,495
- I do, I finished
my work here in Sakyo

411
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,998
and I'm about to
return to Sa Province.

412
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,291
I thought I would have
the guild take care

413
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,876
of the preparations for that.

414
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,463
- So that means this
person is also a merchant,

415
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,048
and a member of the guild.

416
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,133
- Aren't you coming in?

417
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,385
- Oh, sorry, just a moment.

418
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:42,140
(indistinct chattering)

419
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,977
- Ah, Mr. Rin, you're most
welcome to our humble office.

420
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,522
Someone will show you the
way shortly. (hands clapping)

421
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,025
- If we do not meet
again, then do me a favor

422
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,652
and think of that erhu as
me, take good care of it.

423
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,071
- Uh, sure.

424
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,283
- Now then young lady,
what is your business here?

425
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,701
If you don't mind me asking.

426
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,412
- Right, I was hoping
I could join a caravan

427
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,289
on its way to Kinka.

428
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,917
- Hmm I beg your pardon,
but do you have a pass

429
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,043
you could show me?

430
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,088
- Oh yes, here it is.

431
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:19,052
- What, but this is,
my sincerest apologies.

432
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,304
I'll show you the
way immediately.

433
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,223
- Uh.
(gentle music)

434
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,225
- You'll be seeing the
Sakyo regional director

435
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,436
of the Shi provincial branch
of the merchant's guild.

436
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,605
- Huh, why such an
important person?

437
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:35,652
I received this pass from senior
secretary Ko before I left.

438
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:39,531
It has the Ko family emblem
of Mandarin ducks and flowers.

439
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,700
I was told it should let
me through most checkpoints

440
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,243
without being searched.

441
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,083
- Please, do come in and
make yourself at home.

442
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,294
I am Koku, regional director
of the Sakyo branch office.

443
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,011
I've heard your companions
were taken into custody.

444
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,053
- Huh?

445
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,304
- Please don't look surprised.

446
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,597
There's nothing that
happens in this city

447
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,393
that we aren't aware
of, now what favor is it

448
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,061
that you wish of the guild?

449
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,480
- I want to be added to a
caravan bound for Kinka.

450
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,648
Really that's all.

451
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,986
- Are you planning to leave
your companions behind?

452
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,490
- Right now the only
thing I'm able to do

453
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,367
for my friends is get to Kinka.

454
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,454
- I understand, say
no more my lady.

455
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,372
If that is what you wish,
then the merchant's guild

456
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,499
will see it done without fail.

457
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,625
- Huh?

458
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,627
- You look rather
confused about things.

459
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,629
The explanation
lies in your token.

460
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,300
- I don't understand,
I thought this was just

461
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,593
a standard travel pass?

462
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,303
- That's where you're mistaken.

463
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,013
The emblem on that travel token

464
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,182
has had a little
extra work done on it.

465
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,310
(doors clattering)

466
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,729
(gentle music)

467
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,314
- Oh this is--

468
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:57,150
- [Koku] It's called
luminous seven-colored paint.

469
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,319
It's a very special
commodity that only merchants

470
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,237
under the direct control
of the Hong clan know

471
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,697
how to manufacture successfully.

472
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,824
- The Hong clan?

473
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,618
- If a person carrying
a token bearing a

474
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,162
Ko family crest made with
this paint should come to us,

475
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,663
we were to help that
person regardless

476
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,415
of what we were
doing at the time.

477
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,168
That was a direct request from
the leader of the Hong clan,

478
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,379
as well as the
proxy clan leader.

479
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,422
(gasps)

480
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,550
- And in return for
our help, the Hong clan

481
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,594
will surrender the
manufacturing process to the

482
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,513
merchant's guild
as well the rights

483
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,473
to any derivative
works or products.

484
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,435
Despite refusing to budge during
many years of negotiations,

485
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,063
they've agreed to give
up those rights in return

486
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,564
for your guaranteed protection.

487
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,650
- Uncle Kuro.

488
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,320
- Now what would you like to do?

489
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,367
- Thank you, my wishes
are still unchanged.

490
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,537
Please find me a place in
a caravan headed for Kinka.

491
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,414
I don't care if
it's menial work.

492
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,417
- Very well my lady.

493
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,255
(people chattering)

494
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,344
- Huh?

495
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,178
(gentle music)

496
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,179
- Hmm?

497
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,639
- What are you doing here?

498
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,391
- I heard from the guild
that there's a girl

499
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,393
who wants to join
the group to Kinka.

500
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,853
So I replied that
I would be willing

501
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,564
to take her on as
my personal maid.

502
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,607
- Personal maid,
not menial work?

503
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:20,900
- They say through companionship

504
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,319
and travel we find
compassion in life.

505
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,405
I do trust that
we'll get along well.

506
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,616
- I understand,
your personal maid.

507
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,869
- Yes, but that reminds me,

508
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,454
I haven't even
asked your name yet.

509
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:37,500
- Huh, oh yeah, right,
my name is Kourin.

510
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,672
- I see, I'm pleased
to meet you, Kourin.

511
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,461
- [Kourin] In order to
get to Kinka I've become

512
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,381
the personal maid to a young
master of the Rin family.

513
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:09,009
But somehow this young
master reminds me of someone.

514
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,886
He's handsome, somewhat
removed from the norm,

515
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,722
and making advances towards me?
