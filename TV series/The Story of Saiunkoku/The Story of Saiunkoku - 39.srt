1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,055
(electronic sounds)

2
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,184
(opening tune plays)

3
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,441
- [Narrator] During
the palace celebration

4
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,360
Shuurei boldly presented
the plan to make

5
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,279
South Province a center
of academic research.

6
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,449
The news of her success had
reached Eigetsu and the others.

7
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,658
- [Ensei] Way to go Princess!

8
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,369
She's taken a great first step

9
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,496
towards making our
big plan a reality.

10
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,289
- I almost can't
believe they'd consider

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,541
such a large scale and
outrageous proposal.

12
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,460
- Utter nonsense.
This plan was yours

13
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,295
and Governor Hong's wasn't it?

14
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,255
- That's true but...

15
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,799
- It will be a
long journey ahead.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,635
But I too will be holding out
to the best of my abilities.

17
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,388
[Laughter]

18
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,722
- [Someone] All
right, let's do it.

19
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,682
- [Eigetsu] Yeah.

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,813
- [Narrator] However, the
person who received the biggest

21
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,523
shock from the plan was...

22
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,574
- Ah, it's finally over.
It's been nothing but

23
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,494
New Year's greetings for seven
days now over and over again

24
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,497
from dawn till dusk. I'm
absolutely exhausted.

25
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,749
- Your majesty,
we were thinking.

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,418
Perhaps we should
all take a break

27
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,336
and pay a visit to Lord
Shouka's residence tonight.

28
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,841
- Ah. Unfortunately, I'm
afraid I'll have to pass.

29
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,342
- Huh?

30
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,344
- [Ryuuren] I must look over
the New Year's greeting letters

31
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,513
and write replies to
those that require them.

32
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,354
- I'm surprised, I assumed
he would come and see Shouka

33
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,856
the moment he got
the opportunity.

34
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,358
- Well that's his
royal spirit for you.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,652
- Yes but all the same I was
secretly hoping for him to say

36
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,780
and do things somewhat
differently. You
think so too right?

37
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,494
- [Kouyuu] So she's not here?

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,621
- [Shouka] Afraid not, right
now she and Lord Yushun

39
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,499
are running around
doing errands I gather.

40
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,959
- Is that so?

41
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,878
- Well, it's not as if Shuurei's
reason for coming home is

42
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,296
just to visit, right?

43
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,466
- You're right, I suppose not.

44
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,885
We're both terribly sorry
for our thoughtlessness.

45
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,596
- We'll be sure to send her
a letter first next time.

46
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,598
- As a matter of fact,
Shuurei really wanted

47
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,892
to see the two of you. She
was saying that she'd like

48
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,643
to invite both of
you for dinner once

49
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,480
everything has settled
down and so on.

50
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,774
- Really? She's matured so much.

51
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,902
- She'd be glad to
hear you say so.

52
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,487
She said she didn't
want you to think

53
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,946
she'd just come
home to have fun.

54
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,699
- [ Shouka] And even
if you didn't think so,

55
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,368
she said you wouldn't
acknowledge her

56
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,578
unless she worked hard
enough for two people.

57
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,914
- Shuurei really
is an admirable,

58
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,916
hardworking young
lady isn't she?

59
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,919
Could you please give this
to her when she gets home?

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,921
- [Shouka] Oh. Thank you
very much for the gift.

61
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,591
- Goodbye.
- We'll drop by again.

62
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,301
- Great, I'll be expecting you.

63
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,806
- Oh. Speaking of which, has
His Majesty been in touch

64
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,599
with you since
Shuurei came home?

65
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,934
- [Shouka] No, not even once.

66
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,727
- Is that so?

67
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,771
- Huh? Something wrong?

68
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,940
- Not really, it's just that
His Majesty hasn't stopped

69
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,942
working lately. Even
though Shuurei's returned,

70
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,569
he hasn't even attempted
to meet with her yet.

71
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,533
- Lord Kouyuu, General Ran.

72
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,034
- Yes, what is it?

73
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,662
- Tell me, do you remember what
His Majesty's real name is?

74
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,998
- Uh, of course,
it's King Rikishi.

75
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,839
(calm music)

76
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,438
- [Voiceover] Since I've
back I've only seen Eiuki

77
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,357
face-to-face once,
at the celebration.

78
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,609
(gasps)
- Why don't we stop there

79
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,736
and call it a day,
Governor Hong?

80
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,738
- No, I want to
continue checking into

81
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,574
Royal Council Research
Institutions a bit more.

82
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,868
But you shouldn't leave Miss
Rin Sai alone any longer.

83
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,786
I don't want to keep
you from your Honeymoon.

84
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,622
- Don't worry, she has her
own business to take care of.

85
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,791
For starters, tonight she's
hosting a reception for

86
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,752
merchants from all
over the county.

87
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,463
- A reception? May I ask
where its being held?

88
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,758
- I think it's a place
called Kogaro or something.

89
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,010
(gasps)
- Why didn't you say so?

90
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:02,927
Let's go!

91
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,558
(crowd chatters)

92
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,688
- Please wait here for a moment.

93
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,525
- You might not believe
it, but before I became

94
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,861
a government official I
worked here from time to time.

95
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,780
Keeping accounts,
doing maid service

96
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,698
and lots of other little things.

97
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,617
- You worked here?
- That's right.

98
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,911
And the experience has
helped me a lot in life.

99
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,582
(dreamy music playing)

100
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,794
- Shuurei!
(screams)

101
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,753
- My darling.

102
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,799
Welcome back my dear Shuurei.

103
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,759
You've become such
an impressive woman.

104
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,762
- Ah, thank you miss Kochou.

105
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,684
(men talk)

106
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,770
- [Shuurei] Excuse us please.

107
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,524
My name is Shuurei Hong,

108
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,983
I'm the Governor of Sa Province.

109
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,986
And this gentlemen is Yuhsun
Tei, Lieutenant Governor.

110
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,742
- [Kochou] It's a
pleasure to have you here.

111
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,869
Please allow all of us
here at Kogaro to give you

112
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,831
a warm reception and
a pleasant evening.

113
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,626
(crowd murmurs then cheers)

114
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,755
- Ah, Governor Hong?

115
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,845
(cheerful music)

116
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,103
- [Kochou] I hope you
had a good time tonight.

117
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,813
- [Rin] Yes, I did.

118
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,858
- Oh, Miss Kochou, thank you
so very much for everything.

119
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,777
- Don't mention it. I'd do
anything for you Shuurei,

120
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,612
after all you're
our pride and joy.

121
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,740
Not to mention our
dream come true.

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,746
- [Kochou] Speaking of
which, I was quite surprised

123
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,622
to learn that the leader
of the Merchants Guild

124
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,042
for Sa province is a
beautiful woman like you.

125
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,836
- Yes, but now my term of
office is finally finished

126
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,046
- What? It's over?

127
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,006
- It's something that
cannot be helped.

128
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,009
But I have done everything
I could in the meantime.

129
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,136
When my brother and I
were little, the Sai Clan

130
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,680
was in the grip of
poverty and destitution.

131
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,018
As the Sa Clan became
stronger, so the Sai Clan

132
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,896
became weaker in proportion.
That's the reason why

133
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,607
Shou and I decided
to become merchants.

134
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,150
Within the meritocracy
of the Merchants Guild

135
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,778
we would not have to
bow to Sa Clan pressure.

136
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,864
And we would have the
opportunity to build
on our strengths,

137
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,991
also some of the doors
usually closed to women

138
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,659
were open in the Guild.

139
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,788
- It sounds a lot like the path

140
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,624
that my dear Shuurei
has been walking too.

141
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,042
- [Kochou] Not really, what
I've done doesn't compare

142
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,169
to what she's
accomplished. The sincerity

143
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,755
of the heartfelt feelings
you and Governor To have

144
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,049
has saved Sa
province from itself.

145
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,801
You've been able to
accomplish things

146
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,219
I could only dream of doing.

147
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,641
- From now on, Miss
Rin, will you be

148
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,184
concentrating on
raising a family?

149
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,687
- No, I'll devote myself
to being an inventor

150
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,063
- Huh? An inventor?

151
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,815
- I entered the Merchants
Guild in the first place

152
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,067
because I was praised
for my inventions.

153
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,902
I'm thinking that in
the future I would like

154
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,195
to invent things
that will benefit

155
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,698
the lives of people
who can't move freely.

156
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,118
After all if my dear
husband can maintain

157
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,662
the balance between his work
and his love for his wife

158
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,080
then I should be
able to do it too.

159
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,958
(clears throat)

160
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,754
- [Shuurei Voiceover] A
balance between work and love?

161
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,882
I'm home!
- [Shouka] Welcome back,

162
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,050
you're here in perfect time.

163
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,764
- I had just finished brewing
some tea when you got in.

164
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,768
- [Shuurei Voiceover] But
the tea father brews is...

165
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,982
So bitter!

166
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,692
Huh?

167
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,819
- Nothing. I'm glad that
the flavor hasn't changed.

168
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,904
- Well, I'm happy to hear that.

169
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,948
- Hey, by the way,
where's Sieran?

170
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,743
- He's gone out
- I see.

171
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,120
- Speaking of which, Lord
Kouyuu and General Ran

172
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,122
stopped by today.
They brought along

173
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,957
a lot of groceries for dinner.

174
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,130
- Father? Now that
I think about it

175
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,841
I haven't properly
said I'm home yet.

176
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,177
Not to those who
took care of me.

177
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,971
And not even to you,
father. I was only able

178
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,140
to get this far because
of everyone supporting me

179
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,851
along the way, yet I...

180
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,019
- It's quite all right.

181
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,940
- Maybe I can
invite everyone here

182
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,984
and cook dinner for
them like I used to.

183
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,781
But first,

184
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,785
I'm home father!

185
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,039
(chuckles)

186
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,040
- Welcome home.

187
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,670
(mysterious music)

188
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,309
- Its been a while big brother.

189
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,269
I'm glad to see that
you're doing well.

190
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,064
- I didn't think I
could bring myself

191
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,775
to see you face-to-face.
I intended to protect

192
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,276
her with my life but I failed.

193
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,906
- I don't understand, Shuurei's
come back safe and sound.

194
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,325
- [Seiran] But on
her own strength. I
wanted to protect her

195
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,828
but before I knew it
I was being protected.

196
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,956
I feel angry and ashamed
of my own worthlessness.

197
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,127
- Even still, I
envy you brother.

198
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,046
Because I don't
even get the chance

199
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,256
to feel that frustration.

200
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,054
(pensive music)

201
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,191
(birds tweeting)

202
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,199
- Seiran! Good morning.

203
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,368
- Good morning, my lady.

204
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,496
- Here, come and join me.
- My lady.

205
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,419
- Hello mother, I'm home.

206
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,340
Seiran?
- Yes?

207
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,302
- You know, this is still
our home town in the end.

208
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,137
It's the place we come back to.

209
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,182
So we mustn't forget
it, no matter where

210
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,185
our lives might lead us.
I used to think to myself

211
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,479
since I was going to become
a Governor of Sa province

212
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,398
I should try not to think
of my hometown that often.

213
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,941
But this is still
the place where

214
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,360
all of my dreams first started.

215
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,323
I know I said so
before but thank you

216
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,200
for supporting my
dream up until now.

217
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,243
And I hope you'll
keep on doing so!

218
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,331
All right! I'm going to
prepare a feast tonight,

219
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,292
the first time in a while.
Seiran, I'll need you to help.

220
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,007
(traditional music)

221
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,052
(sound of chopping)

222
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,477
(glass squeaking)

223
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,023
- Master?

224
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,359
(chuckles)

225
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,528
- You know, seeing you two
working around the house

226
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,989
like this again is really
making me quite misty eyed.

227
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,492
It's like it's so nice that
two have finally come home.

228
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,539
(traditional music)

229
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,961
- Master? I know it's kind of
late for me to be saying this,

230
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,921
but all the same, I'm home.

231
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,050
Right now I feel
emotional as well,

232
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,053
so much happiness in having
a place to come home to.

233
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,515
It reminds me that I'm not
alone in the world. But still...

234
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,404
- It says she'll be
preparing a big dinner

235
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,281
with the ingredients
we bought yesterday.

236
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,033
- But why is the
dinner party being held

237
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,202
at the Palace Archives
instead of at their residence?

238
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,122
(mysterious music)

239
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,505
(magical music)

240
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,471
- Honestly, why are
we having dinner

241
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,348
at the Archives and not at home?

242
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,476
Sometimes I really have to
wonder what father's thinking.

243
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,103
- Perhaps it's so we can
have Senior Secretary Kou,

244
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,105
Assistant Secretary Kei
and some other people

245
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,315
drop by for a bit.

246
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,609
- Yeah, I suppose you're right.

247
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,111
- [Seiran] My lady.
- What is it?

248
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,155
(gasps)

249
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,450
No wonder I was
beginning to feel cold.

250
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,370
- That's right.
- It's so beautiful.

251
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,372
- [Hakumei] Wow,
this looks delicious.

252
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,582
- [Shuurei] Hakumei?

253
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,126
- So you have a talent
for home cooking as well?

254
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,629
- Yes, please have as
much as you'd like.

255
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,131
- Thank you.
- Oh my.

256
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,093
This looks like a sumptuous
feast, doesn't it?

257
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,427
- Welcome everyone.

258
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,347
- Oh the meal looks delicious.

259
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,224
- Did you make all of
this yourself, Shuu?

260
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,476
- Uh-huh!
- Wow, you're amazing.

261
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,356
- Lord Kouyuu, General
Ran, I'm so sorry

262
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,483
I was out yesterday
and I missed you.

263
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,360
- Not at all, I'm the
one who feels sorry

264
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,653
for intruding the way we did.

265
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,655
- Kouyuu's been feeling
incredibly remorseful

266
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,532
for what happened last night.

267
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,283
- Really? But I was very happy.

268
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,661
When I heard that you
two came by to visit me

269
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,496
I got all nostalgic
for the old days,

270
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,290
and it also gave me a great
sense of encouragement.

271
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,252
(nervously laughs)

272
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,671
- Oh my, this bean cake.

273
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:43,133
- Advisor Shou and Advisor
Sou, when did you get here?

274
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,427
- Mind if a couple of
old men join the party?

275
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,512
- Not at all,
please. Now everyone,

276
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,180
let's eat before it gets cold.

277
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,432
- Yeah! Let's dig in.

278
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,352
(chatter)

279
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,447
- Everyone,

280
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,492
I wanted to say this sooner but,

281
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,205
I, Shuurei Hong am glad to be
home safe from Sa province.

282
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,708
(giggles)

283
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,251
(men chuckle)

284
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,379
- Welcome back home Shuu, you
really have come a long way.

285
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,298
- It feels like almost
a hundred years ago

286
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,467
that you were still an
initiate in training.

287
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,347
- It sure brings back memories.
To think the whole thing

288
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,682
started from a sweet
bean bun like this.

289
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,227
- Yes, it was thanks to
your strong recommendation

290
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,230
and quick thinking that Shuurei
first entered the Palace.

291
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,526
(serene music)

292
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,467
- [Shuurei] Now everyone,
please enjoy the food

293
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,678
before it gets cold. Hey Seiran,

294
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,806
you come over here too,
don't be a wallflower.

295
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,519
- Ugh. Everyone's
having such a good time.

296
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,772
- Why don't you enjoy
yourself too elder brother?

297
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,274
Now if you'll excuse
me I'm going to sample

298
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,484
a bit of Shuurei's cooking.

299
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,237
(grunts angrily)

300
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,697
- Big brother, you
going in there too?

301
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,200
- Well, I am the one who
manages the Archives after all.

302
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,786
- [Reishin] And just like
that you all desert me.

303
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,287
- [Shouka] No
one's stopping you,

304
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,289
why don't you go
in and join them?

305
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,582
- I guess I'll just
continue watching

306
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,792
over her from the shadows.

307
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,419
- Like I've always
been telling you,

308
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,714
you should just properly
introduce yourself as her uncle.

309
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,007
- I'm so lonely.

310
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,304
- There's someone even
lonelier than you.

311
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,811
He's a man who was
possessed by loneliness

312
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,272
from which he can never escape.

313
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,315
The more he behaves
like a true king,

314
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,443
the lonelier and more
isolated he becomes.

315
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,695
- [Reishin] But that's what it
means to be the King, right?

316
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:09,779
- Yes it is,

317
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,614
but still,

318
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,828
he has a dream that he was
never expected to have.

319
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,455
(laughter)

320
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,332
- [Reishin] You're saying
that dream is Shuurei?

321
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,834
- From now on as he
gains a reputation

322
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,670
as kingdom ruler there will
be fewer and fewer people

323
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,341
who see him just as Ryuuki.
- And your point is?

324
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,344
- That in the end, Shuurei
is and will always be

325
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,306
the only person who will still
call him by his real name.

326
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,767
You were lucky enough to
have Shuurei and Lord Kouyuu

327
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,561
as well as Senior
Secretary Kourin.

328
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,730
If Seiran had walked the
road to becoming King,

329
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,440
he wouldn't be
standing over there--

330
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,649
- Hey, what are you doing
over here by yourself

331
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,901
- He wouldn't have Ensei
- Come on Seiran,

332
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,444
- or anyone else
- let's get some food in him

333
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,863
- Right now Seiran is able to
grab everything he cherishes

334
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,699
and hold on to it as much
as his heart desires.

335
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,869
However, from now on, King
Ryuuki will never be able

336
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,498
to obtain anything for himself
for the rest of his life.

337
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,334
He's aware of that, and that's
why he can't bring himself

338
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,503
to let go of the one
dream he has left.

339
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,506
- This is troublesome,
why did Shuurei

340
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,634
and His Majesty ever have to
meet each other, I wonder.

341
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:16,388
- But still, Reishin. When it
comes to two people meeting,

342
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,265
fate is a mysterious
yet fascinating thing.

343
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,652
(dog barking in distance)

344
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,530
(men laughing)

345
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,614
- All right young man,
- Hey, what are you doing

346
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,615
to me?
- time for a little mid-winter

347
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,616
swim
- I don't like this,

348
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,619
put me down.
(water splashes)

349
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,912
- Shuurei?
- What?

350
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,872
- Yes? Oh, father.

351
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,417
- There's somewhere I'd like you

352
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,419
to deliver a few bean buns to.

353
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,636
(ominous music playing)

354
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,600
- I don't get it,
there's no one here.

355
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,731
(ominous music continues)

356
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,574
(wind whooshes)

357
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,973
- Why are you?
- I could ask you the same.

358
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,602
- I come here every
night, since...

359
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,522
I guess it's been ever since
you returned from Sa province.

360
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,861
- Um, you know, I was
able to accomplish

361
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,696
a little bit while
I was over there.

362
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,616
Oh, but you already know, of
course, cause you're the king.

363
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,785
I think I might've even
matured a little bit.

364
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:18,968
I'm back home,

365
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,887
Ryuuki.

366
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,020
(slaps face)

367
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,565
What, what's the matter?

368
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,078
- Shuurei

369
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,873
Shuurei,

370
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:49,916
Shuurei,

371
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:50,834
Shuurei.

372
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,547
You really did it. You kept
your promise after all.

373
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,757
- [ Ryuuki Voiceover]
I want you to see me

374
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,592
not as a king but as who I am.

375
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,889
- [Shuurei] To tell the truth,
I thought about you a lot,

376
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,059
in fact, I was afraid that the
longer I was away from you,

377
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,520
the more I'd see you as a good
king before anything else.

378
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,981
- [Ryuuki] It's all right,
it's not important now.

379
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,901
I confess, I couldn't
help but feel lonely

380
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,695
without you here with me.

381
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:22,991
I love you.

382
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,038
I love you Shuurei.

383
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,709
You

384
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:33,835
and only you,

385
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:35,754
forever.

386
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:45,013
(romantic music)

387
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:51,853
But, why?

388
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:57,817
- Don't you why me! Now,
sit down, right now.

389
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,945
- Right.
- I've had a lot of time

390
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,115
to think about life and romance
while I was in Sa province.

391
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,909
- Okay.
- And while I was thinking

392
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,119
I realized I still have a
lot of gaps in my defenses,

393
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,121
because of that I've
decided to make my heart

394
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,749
totally steadfast
against men from now on.

395
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,043
- What? Well, I
wouldn't mind if you

396
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,294
made an exception in my case.

397
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,962
- And, there's one more
thing I've decided.

398
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,839
If I learn that someone
has feelings for me,

399
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,883
I'll think about it carefully,
then give them my answer

400
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,843
as soon as possible.

401
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:24,803
And that's--

402
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,683
- You don't have to say it now.

403
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,520
I'm not in any hurry.

404
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,775
I'll be waiting for you, always.

405
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,736
No matter how far into
the future it may be,

406
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:45,782
or however far away you are,
I know that day will come.

407
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:46,825
My dream,

408
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,077
is here.

409
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,789
It has been ever
since the first time

410
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,708
we met each other
under these trees.

411
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,173
(end credits play)

412
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,365
You know... I'm
not going to change

413
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,201
Yeah I already knew

414
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,497
I want to keep
moving further ahead

415
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:19,209
So... things might never
change from how they are now

416
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,001
I know

417
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:21,711
Even so?

418
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:23,380
Even So

419
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,890
{\an8}Even so ...I'll wait forever
