{\an8}* (Woman singing in

5
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,313
- [Narrator] At last,
Shurei finally arrived

6
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,649
in the city of Kinka where
she promised she would

7
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,734
meet up with Seiran
and the others,

8
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,986
but Kinka had already
become a stronghold of the

9
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,488
Murderous Blades.

10
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,615
And if that were not
enough, Shurei learned that

11
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,575
the entire Rin family
had been killed by

12
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,743
the Murderous Blades

13
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,329
only a few days
prior to her arrival.

14
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,875
- Then, who is that man?

15
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,377
Who in the world is he?

16
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,425
(ominous music)

17
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,804
- I wonder if they
were able to find them.

18
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,935
Did they find the
governor's seal and charm?

19
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,523
(footsteps)

20
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,859
- (breathing heavily)

21
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,445
- The governor's seal and
charm should arrive in Kinka

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,780
at about the same
time as you do.

23
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,907
Even without any more
information, you'll know them

24
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,284
the instant you see them.

25
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,702
I will leave them
somewhere very safe

26
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,662
where there's no chance
that anyone will be able

27
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,955
to steal them.

28
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,957
- Yes, but where
on earth are they?

29
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,005
(flute playing)

30
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,758
- He's wearing
pears on his head?

31
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,718
(gasps) Ryuren!

32
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,720
- Why hello kindred
spirit number one.

33
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,432
(upbeat music)

34
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,017
- What are you doing here?

35
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,269
- I was following kindred
spirit number two.

36
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,314
- Wait, kindred
spirit number two?

37
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,440
You mean Eigetsu?

38
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,941
- Hmm.

39
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,402
- (gasps) Kinka castle.

40
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,821
That's where Eigetsu and
Korin have been taken?

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,740
Do you think you can save them?

42
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,409
- My guess is that Ensei
Ro and Seiran Si are also

43
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,620
making their way to
Kinka castle right now.

44
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,789
- (moans)

45
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,083
- I have some gifts for you.

46
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,836
- Huh? (gasps) The charm
and the governor's seal!

47
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,756
- I accepted them to bring to
the new governors as gifts.

48
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,301
- Oh, now I get it. Of course
no one is going to want to

49
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,719
deal with this eccentric,

50
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,889
so that's why it was impossible
for them to be stolen.

51
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,850
All right, please give those
gifts to Eigetsu and also

52
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,603
stop by the pawn broker on
your way to Kinka castle.

53
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,314
Something important should
have just been delivered there.

54
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,608
- You're not coming with me?

55
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,484
- Uh,

56
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,487
young master.

57
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,741
He said he'd wait for me at
the chrysanthemum residence.

58
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,035
I have to go there and
find out for myself.

59
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,414
Ryuren, you wouldn't
happen to know, would you?

60
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,624
Who is that man?

61
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,129
- He's a man who knows
about everything.

62
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,673
- Was he behind the
slaughter of the Rin family?

63
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,884
- I think you already
know the answer to that.

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,805
Will you go?

65
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,557
- I must.

66
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,894
- Then I'll have to salute
you for your bravery.

67
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,150
(ominous music)

68
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,484
- So, you were a fake.

69
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,361
How dare you deceive
me like that?

70
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,907
(Meisho laughing)

71
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,492
- What is it?

72
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,828
- Oh, I was just laughing
because it occurred to me

73
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,997
that there is someone even
less fortunate than these

74
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,665
pathetic children.

75
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,541
- Huh?

76
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,754
(Warriors laughing)

77
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,922
- Meisho, you...

78
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,966
What's the meaning
of this, you bastard?

79
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,178
- You said to compare
my future prospects

80
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,430
with my current ones
and work for you instead

81
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,516
Lord Sojun, but there can
be no comparison between

82
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,934
you and the person I serve.

83
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,020
- Who are you talking about?

84
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,690
- (laughs) I suppose you could
call him our true employer.

85
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,443
He's someone you
know extremely well.

86
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,903
- What?

87
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,696
- Apparently, the reason he
wants you dead is because

88
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,656
there's now something he wants.

89
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,617
- Something he wants?

90
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,452
- To be the head of the Sa clan.

91
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,955
- Then the person who
employed you must be...

92
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,083
Damnit, he won't
get away with this.

93
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,417
(warriors yelling)

94
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,087
- (yelling)

95
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,755
- Close your eyes.

96
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,966
(footsteps)

97
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,721
- Leaving Seiran Si's treasured
sword at a pawn broker

98
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,264
was a good idea.

99
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,141
The Sa clan probably wouldn't
think to check pawned goods

100
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,476
coming into Kinka.

101
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,894
Especially for
something like this.

102
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,441
(crickets chirping)

103
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,947
- Hmm. He was more
trouble than I expected.

104
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,449
(footsteps approaching)

105
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,158
- Meisho!

106
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,122
- Well well. You couldn't
have timed your appearance

107
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,707
any better.

108
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,960
- (gasps) Who are you
really working for?

109
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,462
There's no way that old man
Chusho would have ever wanted

110
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,214
his precious grandson
Sojun killed.

111
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,465
Now talk!

112
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,801
- How long do you intend
to lie on top of me?

113
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,469
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

114
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,096
- Honestly, you're so rude.

115
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,765
(swords scraping)

116
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,976
- So, little whirlwind
and little rascal king,

117
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,936
I'll ask you to drop
your weapons now.

118
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,275
(swords falling)

119
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,193
- Don't lay a finger
on the little whirlwind

120
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,863
for the time being, but
you can kill the other one.

121
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,782
- Mr. Ensei?

122
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,242
- Don't you worry about a thing.

123
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,494
I am your deputy
officer after all,

124
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,830
it is only natural
for me to save you.

125
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,790
You're not about to tell
me that it's all right not

126
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,000
to save you, are you?

127
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,627
- I won't say that.

128
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,172
- Full marks for that answer.

129
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,258
Just focus on doing a good
job protecting Ms. Korin.

130
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,927
- The little rascal king
expects to beat us without

131
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,179
the use of his staff?

132
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,181
Get him!

133
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,977
- This is the chrysanthemum
residence, but that crest

134
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,645
isn't the chrysanthemum.

135
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,272
It's been scratched
out with a new one

136
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,857
carved on top recently.

137
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,278
It's the profusion of
peacocks, the Sa clan crest.

138
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,866
Then that man is
just as I feared.

139
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,286
(grunting)

140
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,162
- What the?

141
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,663
- Oh, didn't you know?

142
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,999
Unarmed combat is his specialty.

143
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,210
(yelling)

144
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,212
- He only wields the staff
to refrain from injuring

145
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,214
his opponents too badly.

146
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,715
(grunting)

147
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,301
- To tell such an opponent
to drop his staff was suicide

148
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,135
on your part.

149
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,720
Right, Meisho?

150
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,181
- Hey now, thank you very
much for the compliment.

151
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,601
(grunts)

152
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,145
- That's as far as you
go, little rascal king.

153
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,563
If you don't want to
see the boy killed,

154
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,273
then you best not
move another step.

155
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,026
(laughs)

156
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,946
(grunts)

157
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,905
- Mr. Ryuren!

158
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,326
- I'm here to save you, my
kindred spirit number two.

159
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,787
- Thank you for
coming Mr. Ryuren.

160
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,039
(whoosh)

161
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,708
- What? Consho,

162
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,209
what are you doing with this?

163
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,878
- My other kindred spirit
asked me to do a favor for her.

164
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,380
Finish them off quickly.

165
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,258
Shurei is in danger at the
chrysanthemum residence.

166
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,592
(grunts)

167
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,802
- At least she might be.

168
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,890
(thud)

169
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,392
- Chrysanthemum residence?

170
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,060
But that's great uncles...

171
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,357
- Thank you very much- (gulps)

172
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,904
- (gasps) Hey, what do
you think you're doing?

173
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,740
- You mean inside kindred
spirit number two,

174
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,867
there's a kindred
spirit number 2.5?

175
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,910
- He only comes out
when he drinks alcohol.

176
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,912
- I bid you come out!

177
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,914
Come out kindred spirit 2.5!

178
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,792
- Huh?

179
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,920
(grunts)

180
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,921
(gasps)

181
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,257
- Move it, out of my way girl.

182
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,634
- Huh? (yells)

183
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,928
(ominous music)

184
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,180
(grunts)

185
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,266
(bodies crashing)

186
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,642
- Oh my.

187
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,062
So this is kindred
spirit number 2.5.

188
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,688
- (grunts) Who are you?

189
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,649
- Come on, get up Meisho.

190
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,737
(grunts)

191
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,281
- How foolish of you,
little whirlwind.

192
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,075
You think you can
win against me?

193
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,705
(laughs)

194
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,084
(upbeat music)

195
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,754
(grunts)

196
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,674
(swords clashing)

197
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,345
(grunts)

198
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,098
(upbeat music)

199
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,145
- This can't be.

200
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,106
- It is, believe it.

201
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,733
It was Seiran and I who
destroyed the Murderous Blades

202
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,693
14 years ago.

203
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,403
Just the two of us.

204
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,114
So, why in the world would
you think the likes of you

205
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,448
could beat someone like him?

206
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,159
- Is that a fact?

207
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,704
But you should know, the
two of you are merely being

208
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,455
manipulated as well.

209
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:26,251
You, me, the Murderous Blades,
we're nothing but tools used

210
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,712
for that man's entertainment.

211
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,130
- What's that?

212
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,507
- Until now, he's never had
an interest in obtaining

213
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,343
power for himself, so no one
ever realized what he was

214
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,345
truly up to behind the scenes.

215
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,848
But, he ordered me to
kill his older brother.

216
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,349
- What?

217
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:46,062
- (laughs) Soon, all of Sa
province will become his toy.

218
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,902
- An order to kill
his older brother?

219
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,112
- Huh?

220
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,489
(footsteps approaching)

221
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,117
- Was it Sojun's
youngest brother?

222
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,494
- No, it wouldn't be Kokujun.

223
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,288
- In that case...

224
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,999
- Hmm. I'll guide you to
the chrysanthemum residence.

225
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,335
- [Eigetsu] (grunts) Hey!

226
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,296
Hurry up and go.

227
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,259
- I think we can pretty well
handle things around here.

228
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,802
- Hmm.

229
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,012
- This way.

230
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,014
(footsteps receding)

231
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,309
(door creaking)

232
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,895
(slow music)

233
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,943
- My name is Senya Rin, but
please, you can call me Senya.

234
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,072
(oriental music)

235
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,324
- Rather than the young
master of the Rin family,

236
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,408
I want you to see me.

237
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,204
(footsteps)

238
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,169
(oriental music)

239
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,925
(sighs)

240
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,260
(doors open)

241
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,264
- Well, I'm glad
to see you've come.

242
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,477
(oriental music)

243
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,568
- I've come here to bid you
farewell as I've promised,

244
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,986
young master.

245
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,987
- A promise?

246
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,032
I seem to remember
asking you for a promise.

247
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,535
I wanted you to tell me your
real name once we finally made

248
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,161
it to Kinka.

249
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,663
- If I do decide to share
my real name with you,

250
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,541
will you return the favor
and share yours with me?

251
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,418
- But of course, I'd
be happy to tell you.

252
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,379
After all, it is the
name of your new fiance.

253
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,590
- My name is Shurei Hong.

254
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,676
- Oh, I knew it!

255
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,553
It's so much better than Korin.

256
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,014
It's beautiful and dignified.

257
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,390
It suits you very well.

258
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,434
Don't you agree?

259
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,894
- And your name is?

260
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,065
(footsteps)

261
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,031
- Sakujun. Sakujun Sa.

262
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,074
(gasps)

263
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,245
(raindrops falling)

264
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,001
- You know, I was quite
fond of the name Senya.

265
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,712
It means a thousand nights.

266
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,339
I thought it was the
perfect name for me,

267
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,674
seeing as I was born in the
darkness of the new moon

268
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,010
when the black moon
that has lost it's light

269
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,012
floats in the night sky.

270
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,555
(gasps)

271
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,599
You have a scary look on your
face even after I asked you

272
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,642
not to act so coldly.

273
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,935
- Right now, I'm feeling
rather embarrassed

274
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,146
at my own foolishness.

275
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,606
I never suspected
you for a minute,

276
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,068
and voluntarily fell right
into the grasp of the Sa clan.

277
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,237
(thunder rumbling)

278
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,573
And you, you must have
had everything planned

279
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,284
from the first moment we
met in Sakyou, didn't you?

280
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,621
- That's quite right, my dear.

281
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,209
You've been walking on an
extremely dangerous tightrope.

282
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,212
If you had made so much as a
single minor error in judgment,

283
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,339
you would never has
been able to reach Kinka

284
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,007
alive like this.

285
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,258
- Hmm.

286
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,677
- I talked to you about
this before, remember?

287
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,388
I said that once I find
that special person,

288
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,139
I will no longer hesitate.

289
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,602
For some reason,

290
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:17,440
you seem to have become that
special person despite that.

291
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,983
- Later on, I'm going
to make lots of this tea

292
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,528
for the people who
are important to me.

293
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,113
- I found that bothersome,

294
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,240
because if there is a
special person that I like,

295
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,158
I want to keep
them all to myself.

296
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,453
Isn't it natural
to feel that way?

297
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,664
In the end, that's why it
was necessary to arrange

298
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,458
for my brother Sojun
to be eliminated.

299
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,627
It was so I could become
head of the Sa clan

300
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,671
and properly welcome
you as my wife.

301
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,632
(gasps)

302
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,470
To the Hong clan, you are
their greatest treasure.

303
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,516
In order to face your
family's fury head on,

304
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,685
I would have to, at the
very least, become head of

305
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,271
the Sa clan and
use its full power.

306
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,315
(gasps)

307
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,525
Please don't worry.

308
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,152
I'll treat you with care.

309
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,196
I will be gentle, but tell me

310
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,657
if I treat you as precious,
will you think of me

311
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,742
as precious too?

312
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,037
Will you make ganlu
tea for me too?

313
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,539
Will you stay by my side?

314
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,417
I've never tried to
be liked by anyone,

315
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,378
so I really don't have any
idea how to go about it.

316
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,590
You'll have to tell me.

317
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,633
Should I be whispering
things like "I love you"

318
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,761
in your ear every
day and every night?

319
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,680
Please don't forget.

320
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,766
Don't forget that
I love you Shurei.

321
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,685
- (gasps) No, you're wrong.

322
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,480
You don't love me.

323
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,274
What you're saying isn't
really love at all.

324
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,193
- You're probably right.

325
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,819
I'm really not sure myself.

326
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,822
It's unusual for
me to like someone

327
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,199
and want them by my side,

328
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,368
but I will not hesitate.

329
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,244
If there are any
obstacles keeping you from

330
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,204
achieving something,

331
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,538
I'll eliminate them.

332
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,749
If there's something I
need, then I take it.

333
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,709
This is the first
time in my life that

334
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,545
I want to do something for
the sake of another person.

335
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,715
It doesn't really matter to
me what these feelings of mine

336
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,591
are called.

337
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,261
- But why do you
like me so much?

338
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,348
- It's a mystery to me,

339
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,184
but when I'm with
you I feel good.

340
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,521
If you'll give yourself
to me and become mine,

341
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,315
then I will become
totally yours.

342
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,276
I'll grant any wish
you could ever have.

343
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,195
I will devote my life to you.

344
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,532
- And if I ask you to find
a prison and lock yourself

345
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,741
away in it, would you do it?

346
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,493
Just for my sake?

347
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,496
- Of course, if you were
the prison I'd be locked in.

348
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,540
I'd happily be bound
to you in chains,

349
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,126
but my sole condition is
that you would bind yourself

350
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,462
to me in the same way
and entertain only me.

351
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,634
- And once you got bored of
me, you'd escape your prison,

352
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,678
you'd break out of your cell,

353
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,846
and then kill me.

354
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,808
Are people's lives
nothing more than toys

355
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,269
to amuse you whenever
you're bored?

356
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,729
- That's right.

357
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,690
I'm not interested in my own
mortality or path in life.

358
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,276
That's why I have no
choice but to amuse myself

359
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,318
with those of others.

360
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,364
However, humans seem to break
after only a little time

361
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,825
playing with me,
its most boring.

362
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,452
But you're strong.

363
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,579
I don't imagine you'll
ever break or choose death

364
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,789
under any circumstances.

365
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,167
That's why I can play
with you without having to

366
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,168
worry about it.

367
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,461
- Don't make fun of me.

368
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,172
I don't have any time to
spend playing with you.

369
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,175
(footsteps approaching)

370
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,384
- Well, well.

371
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,594
The person you're
waiting for has arrived.

372
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,929
- You knew he was coming
and yet you still-

373
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,389
- I already told you,

374
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,683
I will grant you any
wish that you have.

375
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,603
However, since you are
not mine yet I'm afraid

376
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,646
this will be everything for now.

377
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,232
But first, I'll give you
a little present in return

378
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,943
for you playing the
ehru for me every night.

379
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,196
(gasps)

380
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,949
(thunder rumbling)

381
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,371
(slow music playing)

382
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,377
(thud)

383
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,671
- So tell me, how
should I address you?

384
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,382
Little whirlwind
or your highness?

385
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,384
(grunts)

386
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,678
It seems you've become
rather short tempered.

387
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,764
You're fascinating as always.

388
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,684
While you're here, I
can finally tell you.

389
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,936
Know this, my little whirlwind.

390
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,271
On that day, 14 years ago,

391
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,899
the one who found you collapsed
and half dead in the snow

392
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,944
and took you to the base
of the Murderous Blades,

393
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:31,861
was me.

394
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,906
(grunts)

395
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,491
I believed you had
plenty of potential.

396
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,326
Was it not kind of me?

397
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,536
- Seiran, calm down.

398
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,663
You don't want to fall
into this guy's trap.

399
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,914
(grunts)

400
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,417
- No Seiran, you musn't.

401
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,293
Seiran! (grunts)

402
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,754
Officer Shi, I give
you my authorization.

403
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,339
Complete your objective here.

404
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,468
I'll make ganlu
tea for you after.

405
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:57,721
- My lady,

406
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,433
(gasps)

407
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:03,935
(sword scrapes)

408
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,729
Sakujun Sa,

409
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,691
by the power of Khan
Sho, bestowed by his
majesty Ryuki Shi,

410
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,693
and my superior's orders,

411
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,069
I'm arresting you for
your involvement with

412
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,946
the Murderous Blades.

413
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:18,324
(ominous music)

414
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,744
- Unfortunately, you have
nothing to charge me with.

415
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,287
- What do you mean?

416
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,913
- The crimes were committed
by my grandfather,

417
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,832
eldest brother, and
the Murderous Blades.

418
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,294
All I did was bring a girl
to Kinka by her request.

419
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,296
Not to mention, I brought
the girl in question

420
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,548
here safely and without
a single scratch.

421
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,383
(gasps)

422
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,428
- See, I haven't don't
anything wrong, have I?

423
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,847
- You bastard. I heard
it all from Kokujun.

424
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,974
I heard this residence used
to belong to old man Enjun

425
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,309
when he was still alive.

426
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,769
And yet, you polluted it.

427
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,563
Can't you tell the chrysanthemum
residence is weeping?

428
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,066
- My great uncle.

429
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,985
I had to endure some
tight restrictions
because of that man,

430
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,821
but in the end I was still
able to get my revenge

431
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,864
against him in a way.

432
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,032
- How could you?

433
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,079
(footsteps approaching)

434
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,955
- [Sakujun] Great uncle?

435
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,624
No. Kokujun.

436
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,669
- Then nine years ago, when
aunt and uncle were killed-

437
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,463
- Advisors saw his
son and his wife.

438
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,799
- So the one who killed
Shunki's parents...

439
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,051
- Hmm.

440
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,137
(thunder rumbles)

441
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,889
- It was you, big brother!

442
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,475
- I can't say that I like
you that much either.

443
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,477
In my eyes, you're a
nuisance because you resemble

444
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,647
great uncle Enjun the
most, useless fool.

445
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,566
Well then, I'll take this
opportunity to be on my way.

446
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,360
There's not much point
in sticking around

447
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,696
and it seems you won't
be able to arrest me.

448
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,197
(grunts)

449
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,659
And as for you, come to the
provincial capital of Korin.

450
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,536
I'll be waiting for you.

451
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,912
And please don't forget.

452
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,789
Don't forget that I do love you.

453
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,834
Even if you cannot
accept that love.

454
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,504
Please don't forget. Don't
forget that I love you Shurei.

455
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,965
Next time we meet, I
would ask that you please

456
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,800
call me by my real name.

457
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:02,554
I want to hear my name spoken
by a lovely voice like yours.

458
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,472
From now on, call
me by my real name.

459
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,517
- No,

460
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,602
it's not the same.

461
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,396
- I'll be waiting for you.

462
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,690
- No, I'm not going
go and see you!

463
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,150
- Oh, you'll come.

464
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,819
I know in my heart that you'll
definitely come to see me.

465
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:18,987
(laughs)

466
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,698
As long as I have
this flower hairpin.

467
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,742
(gasps)

468
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,536
To use the bud of a flower,

469
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,705
it seems the king is
a very clever man.

470
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,709
(grunts)

471
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,210
Oh, I almost forgot.

472
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,963
Grandfather Chusho is currently
having a new clan ring made

473
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,798
for the new head of the Sa clan.

474
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,092
- He's doing that without
conferring with the clan?

475
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,511
- You know it's meaningless
to hold such a consultation

476
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,555
at a time when everyone's
fighting amongst themselves

477
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,057
for the top seat.

478
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,434
However, it's unlikely that
anyone will acknowledge

479
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,062
a ring of a clan leader when
it's been arbitrarily made.

480
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,855
That's why grandfather
and I needed

481
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,982
the new governor so desperately.

482
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,068
The governor is the king's
representative here,

483
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,986
if they designate a
new leader of the clan,

484
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,822
the people will have no
choice but to accept.

485
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,908
That's why grandfather
Chusho was searching for

486
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,160
the governor's seal and
charm so thoroughly.

487
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,496
His hope was to appoint
a governor who would act

488
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,122
according to his will alone.

489
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,751
(gasps)

490
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,127
(chuckles)

491
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,004
(thunder rumbles)

492
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,131
(grunts)

493
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:28,139
(birds cawing)

494
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,605
- Crows on a moonless night?

495
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,732
- [Shin Sai] Governor
Hong, thank goodness.

496
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:38,650
Are you all right?

497
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,195
- Huh?

498
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,155
- Sai, my old friend.

499
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,073
- Huh?

500
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:49,160
- This is lord Shin
Sai, the mayor of Kinka.

501
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,914
- So then, the merchant's
guild acted on our behalf?

502
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,166
(shouting)

503
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,544
- On the orders of
the mayor of Kinka,

504
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,129
capture the Murderous Blades.

505
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,631
Don't let even a single
one of them escape.

506
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,174
- Ah, lord Shin Sai.

507
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,720
You are the mayor of
Kinka, are you not?

508
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,513
Kinka is an important
city for us.

509
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,724
I don't want to waste a single
moment before attempting

510
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,518
to settle and stabilize
the situation here in town.

511
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,979
I would greatly appreciate it
if you could kindly give me

512
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:16,855
some guidance.

513
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:19,858
- My lady!

514
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,825
(ominous music)

515
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,662
- Was that Shurei?

516
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,253
(raindrops falling)

517
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,923
(thunder rumbling)

518
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:52,349

519

{\an8}* (Woman singing in
foreign language) *

520
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,047
- Seiran, Ensei, Eigetsu, Korin
I'm so glad you're all safe.

521
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,341
It's so reassuring
to be together again.

522
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,884
No matter what lies ahead,

523
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:13,722
as long as we work together I
know we can overcome anything.
