1
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,599
(energetic, lighthearted music)

2
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,689
- [Narrator] Shuurei's group,
who had quietly entered

3
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,983
the blockade of cap ital
of Sa Province, Korin City,

4
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,695
found a letter from
Sakujun Sa already waiting

5
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,196
for them at their hideout.

6
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,784
It was an invitation to
the selection ceremony

7
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,412
for the new head of the Sa Clan.

8
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,622
Meanwhile, Kokujun
was determined to stop

9
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,459
his grandfather, Chuushou, and
his elder brother, Sakujun.

10
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,670
However, his desperate
pleas were in vain,

11
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,548
and he was thrown into
the Sa Clan's dungeon.

12
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,634
- Huh?

13
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,727
(gasps)

14
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,732
Is that you father?

15
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,492
(dog barking)

16
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,372
- So, you're going
after all, princess?

17
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,583
- Well, it is by
special invitation.

18
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,460
Besides, I have to
get my flower bud pin

19
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,586
back from that man.

20
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,590
That means I have to
go wherever he is.

21
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,383
- My lady, I don't like this.

22
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,428
- Neither do I, Shuurei,
it sounds too dangerous.

23
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,889
- Thank you both for
worrying about me,

24
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,515
but the thing is...

25
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,769
- Please don't forget, don't
forget that I do love you.

26
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,812
- Please don't
forget, don't forget

27
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,606
that I love you, Shuurei.

28
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,857
- This is something I must do.

29
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,650
I have to meet him face to face.

30
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,736
- Ah, my lady.

31
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,034
(wind blows)

32
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:21,951
- Huh?

33
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,871
- Hm!

34
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,375
(ominous music playing)

35
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,877
- I've come to collect you.

36
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,712
- Huh?

37
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,548
- When did he arrive?

38
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,968
- You realize you're
awfully early.

39
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,930
- So I guess this man
must be Mr. Sakujun.

40
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,474
He's very good
looking, isn't he?

41
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,975
- His looks are all
that's good about him.

42
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,727
You shouldn't follow
him, even if he says

43
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,312
he'll give you candy.

44
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,773
- Mr. Seirain, I'm not so much
of a child I'd fall for that.

45
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,733
- If I were able to
sell a portrait of him,

46
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,860
I could make a
very decent profit.

47
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,153
(laughing suspiciously)

48
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,406
- Would you cut it out,
Sho? Now is not the time

49
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,366
to be calculating. Do
you know what kind of

50
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,492
situation we're in?

51
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,664
(giggles)

52
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,915
- Huh, my lady?

53
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,336
- I'll go with you. Thank
you for your invitation.

54
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,006
- Good. I'm very
happy to hear that.

55
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,466
I suppose this means I
haven't grown tired of you

56
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,592
just yet, doesn't it?

57
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,595
(gasps)

58
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,936
(gasps)

59
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,690
That's rather dangerous
little whirlwind.

60
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,775
- Oh I'm sorry. There
was a fly over there that

61
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,360
was bothering me.

62
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,738
- I see your speech and
your skills have degraded.

63
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,989
I feel sorry for
you wasting your

64
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,782
time on meaningless hardship.

65
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,035
- At least I'm lucky enough
not to become like a certain

66
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,620
foolish lord I know who's
brains have rotted away from

67
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,497
too much fooling around.

68
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,583
(suspenseful music)

69
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,585
- Wow, you're pretty
scary Mr. Seirain,

70
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,003
but on the other
hand, Mr. Sakujun

71
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,005
isn't even shaking at all.

72
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,090
Both of them are
really incredible.

73
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,885
If I want to be that good,
I've got to try harder.

74
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,802
- At what?

75
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,723
- What are you doing? I
thought we were leaving.

76
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,017
Since he's been kind
enough to come for me,

77
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,810
I guess I'll be on my way.

78
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,104
- I'm sure I'll see you
later little whirlwind.

79
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,774
(angrily growls)

80
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,650
(melancholy music)

81
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,402
- You're going to have
to give back my flower

82
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,112
bud at some point you know.

83
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,030
- Hm.

84
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,785
(melancholy music continues)

85
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,042
- Ugh, just great.

86
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,627
Now that the diamonds
been taken out

87
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,796
of the rough, there's
nothing left behind but us

88
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,506
big rough men!

89
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,049
But that was impressive Seirain.

90
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,885
You held it in well. I think
you need a hug after that.

91
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,012
- Not a chance.

92
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,139
(laughter)

93
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,767
(dog barking)

94
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,977
- Okay, this is the residence

95
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,522
of an important man in Kinka.

96
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,898
(grunt)

97
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,650
(laughing)

98
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,152
Now, to take care of Mr.
Ensei's request of us.

99
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,904
I'm going to talk to
the big man in Kinka

100
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,030
on our way to Korin.

101
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,494
(quiet footsteps)

102
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,954
- Here's your tea.

103
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,540
- Thank you very much Korin.

104
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,916
- Here you are.

105
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,834
- Good evening!

106
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,880
Excuse me for intruding
so late at night.

107
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,593
I am the deputy leader of the
Bald Eagle of Sa Province.

108
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,680
Yoshu is my name and
I am at your service.

109
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,181
- Uh, official you...

110
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,892
- Yes, it seems our visitor
here to see me about something.

111
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,520
- Please sir, don't stand up.

112
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,688
Seeing as you have some trouble

113
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,940
walking, please,
stay in your seat.

114
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,943
- Now how do you know that I
have trouble walking young man?

115
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,611
- It's just that you
have the same look as

116
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,822
a wild deer with an injured leg.

117
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,032
(laughing)

118
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,742
- Yes, I heard about
you from Ensei Row.

119
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,577
He had goo things
to say about you.

120
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,245
It's a pleasure to meet
the famous deputy head

121
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,748
of the Bald Eagles of
Sa Province Mr. Yoshu.

122
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,126
- Huh, oh no! I'm only
the deputy leader.

123
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,003
I'm just in training.
I'm not famous.

124
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,713
Oh! But my big brother.

125
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,840
I mean Bashorein is
definitely famous.

126
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,759
He's our famous leader, yeah!

127
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,222
- Here you go.

128
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,974
- Huh? Oh, thank you very
much for the tea miss.

129
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,059
(slurping)

130
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,770
(deep swallow)

131
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,981
Wow, that was really nice.
At last, I'm beginning

132
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,858
to feel relaxed again.

133
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,238
Excuse me, would you be the
most important person here?

134
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,324
- Yes, for the time
being at least.

135
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,326
I've been appointed to fill
the highest ranked official

136
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,244
post in the city of Kinka.

137
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,747
- Whoa! That's amazing
for someone so young!

138
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,207
- I'm very honored
to receive such

139
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,876
a fine compliment from you,
but now, if you don't mind

140
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,171
me asking, where is you
leader and lady Shunki Sa?

141
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,923
- They've gone on ahead
of me and they're on their

142
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,591
way to Korin.

143
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,009
- But it was my
understanding that Korin

144
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,053
has been blockaded. It's
not going to be easy

145
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,805
for them to enter the city.

146
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,723
- Normally, that would've
been a problem but this

147
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,767
totally awesome guy
gave us a wooden token.

148
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,852
When he did, Ms. Shunki
said it'd be all right

149
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,313
and they'd be able
to enter no prob.

150
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,523
- Hm?

151
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,857
- The wooden token was
blue with a picture

152
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,943
of dragons and a
lotus flower on it.

153
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,861
You know, there sure
are some amazing young

154
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,238
men in the big city.

155
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,032
- Hm, just out of curiosity,
what was it about this

156
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,743
person that struck you
as particularly amazing.

157
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,161
- His outfit!

158
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,997
The feather, the color
coordination, even the shape!

159
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,042
They were all totally
unique and incredibly cool!

160
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,670
- Um, did that person
happen to carry

161
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,088
a flute with them by any chance?

162
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,298
- Yeah! He did! And he
made really wonderful

163
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,633
music with it!

164
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,801
(sad sign)

165
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,760
- Is it that guy
from the Ran Clan?

166
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,720
- Hm.

167
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,724
(Mysterious flute music)

168
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,684
- I live in the country
so I never knew that

169
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,811
refine city folk
could be so amazing!

170
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,021
- Is that so?

171
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,731
Well I wouldn't say
it has anything to do

172
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,691
with whether or not
he's from a big city.

173
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,860
In the case of that person,
it's his personality

174
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,611
and disposition that
makes him unique, even

175
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,071
in a very big capital.

176
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,072
- Huh?

177
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,198
(agreeing under breath)

178
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,825
- Uh

179
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,703
(wolves howling)

180
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,415
(somber music)

181
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,918
(indistinct chattering)

182
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,254
- You may pass.

183
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,422
- We made it to
Korin, Ms.Shunki.

184
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,341
We're in the capital
of Sa Province.

185
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,968
It's all thanks to that
awesome guys wooden token.

186
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,347
(suspicious music)

187
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,141
I'll see what I can get from
these horses hoof prints.

188
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,894
A few of them suddenly
picked up the pace.

189
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,313
Okay, looks like
they went this way.

190
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,648
(grunt)

191
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,650
I assume that it was Ensei
who caused the horses

192
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,277
to gallop so fast
through the city.

193
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,071
If we follow these
tracks, we should find

194
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,405
them in no time.

195
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,240
Hang in there just a
little longer Ms. Shunki.

196
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,034
We'll be there
before you know it.

197
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,871
(suspicious music fades)

198
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,122
- The stars...

199
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,792
So, Shunki is making her move.

200
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,878
Shunki, you should
know by now that

201
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,338
men are utterly foolish.

202
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,839
It's always the
women who have to

203
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,299
rescue them in the end.

204
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,301
On top of that, that
one in particular is so

205
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,345
useless and unreliable.

206
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,473
(soft melody)

207
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,769
- Shunki, I borrowed one of
great uncle Enjun's books.

208
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,896
Whou-, would you like
to read it together?

209
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,942
- Invite her for a
walk or something.

210
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,984
What a fool.

211
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,823
Hm, but for all his
little faults, that boy

212
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,825
had the same eyes as Enjun.

213
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,993
He's the man who
Shunki has chosen.

214
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,246
Perhaps in time we'll
discover that he's inherited

215
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,915
more from Enjun than
merely his eyes.

216
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,169
(soft brooding music)

217
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,338
- What. What should I do?

218
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,882
I was too late.

219
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,761
I couldn't stop any of them,
not grandfather Chuushou

220
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,221
or brother Sakujun.

221
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,016
It's all over.

222
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,184
The Sa Clan is finished.

223
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,813
Great uncle Enjun, what
would you have done?

224
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,815
You could've done
something, I know it.

225
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,862
Every since I was a child,
I have always admired you.

226
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,030
But there was just one thing

227
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,865
that I could never understand.

228
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,034
Why did you kill
all the airs in the

229
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,910
main branch of the Sa Family?

230
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,746
Why?

231
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,791
(crickets)

232
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,877
- Thank you very much for
getting in touch with me, Yoshu.

233
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,379
You have been extremely
helpful on this.

234
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,964
- No, no, it's nothing.

235
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,841
It's a chivalrous
thief's duty to finish

236
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,259
a job they've been asked to do.

237
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,261
Now that's done,
it's off to Korin!

238
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,888
(grunt)

239
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,389
- Wait a moment, where do
you intend to go in Korin?

240
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,975
- I'm gonna go to where Bos is.

241
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,852
- But Korin is under
blockade, remember?

242
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,062
You won't be able to enter.

243
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,897
Having said that,
I'm also planning to

244
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,398
travel to Korin very soon.

245
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,150
If it's all right
with you, could you be

246
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,027
my body guard on the way there?

247
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,238
That way, we can both make
our way into Korin together.

248
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,408
- Huh! Really? Would
that really be okay?

249
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,494
Oh wow! The outside
world is filled with

250
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,245
so many kind people!

251
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,247
(grunt)

252
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,582
- But this job I'm
asking you to do

253
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,875
is not without danger.

254
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,085
Is that okay?

255
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,544
- How dangerous are
we talking about?

256
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,505
Is it as dangerous as
being chases by five

257
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,423
giant, hungry man eating bears?

258
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,134
(crashing sound)

259
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,844
Or are you saying that
the risk in the big

260
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,055
city is even worse
than I've imagined!

261
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,516
Like maybe 10
bears or something!

262
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,892
- Mh, uh, no, I don't
believe that our jounrey

263
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,062
to Korin will be
quite that dangerous.

264
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,271
(grunt out of relief)

265
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,190
- Well that certainly
is a relief to hear.

266
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,529
- (sad sigh)

267
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,160
(lighthearted music)

268
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:30,333
(crickets and
flowing water sounds)

269
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,378
- Stop worrying,
it'll be all right.

270
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,880
Princess has a really good
head on her shoulders.

271
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,298
- You're right.

272
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,092
- Once everything is
over, than you can beat

273
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,094
him up as much as you like.

274
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,220
- It won't be enough.

275
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,388
- Huh?

276
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,597
- In that guys case,
just beating him

277
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,142
up won't be anywhere
near enough.

278
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,186
- Hey don't do anything
too distasteful, okay?

279
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,062
- Hm

280
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,022
(sword unsheathed)

281
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,523
(grunt)

282
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,607
(angrily grunting)

283
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,483
(yells)

284
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,359
- Cut it out, Seiran!

285
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,277
Hold on a sec!

286
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,322
- What do you think
you're doing you idiot!

287
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,034
Who starts swinging a sword
when there's young girl around?

288
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,285
- Huh?

289
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,328
- Wow. Guess the worlds
not such a bad place

290
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,913
when it comes to coincidences.

291
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,373
Just as we lose one
diamond, another one

292
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,542
flies right into our arms.

293
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,044
(happy piano must)

294
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,171
This here is lady Shunki Sa.

295
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,088
- Hm.

296
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,554
(graceful violin music)

297
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,306
- You said this
building's detached from

298
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,224
the main Sa Clan
residence, right?

299
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,476
- Yes

300
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,560
- Why is the layout
here so complicated?

301
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,270
It seems too easy to get lost.

302
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,397
- It's in case of emergencies.

303
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,690
- Huh?

304
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,067
- As it's laid out now,
it's not an easy place

305
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,735
to occupy and it's
difficult to discern where

306
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,611
people might be.

307
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,237
That sort of thing.

308
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,739
It is a place where the
history of rebellions and

309
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,408
betrayals from long
ago have after all.

310
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,494
- Rebellions and betrayals.
You mean like what

311
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,245
your grandfather is doing?

312
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,163
- Yes

313
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,039
(gasps)

314
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,040
- What? You're right.

315
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,583
He's the one who
wanted you here.

316
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,960
He ordered me to bring
you to the residence.

317
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,004
That way, no one
could interrupt us.

318
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,423
And I would then be
free to ravish you.

319
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,633
(confused gasp)

320
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:02,592
- Apparently, our
wedding ceremony will be

321
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,260
formally held after that.

322
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,179
At the same time as
the selection ceremony

323
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,597
for the leadership of the clan.

324
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,516
- So wait just a second,
are you saying you brought

325
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,267
me all the way here
with the intention of

326
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,144
violating me at some point?

327
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,188
- Well, in the end that
was the general idea.

328
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,565
- Ha, in that case you're
just wasting your time.

329
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,402
Even if that were to happen,
I would not become your wife.

330
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,278
- That doesn't particularly
bother me much.

331
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,489
I'm not necessarily
interested in the structure of

332
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,533
having a marriage or a wife.

333
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,118
(gasps)

334
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,494
(fearful gasp)

335
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,745
- As long as you bring
color to the daily monotony

336
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,373
and boredom I must
endure in my life.

337
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,417
I have no more to ask.

338
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,004
- Until you eventually become
tired of me, is that right?

339
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,381
- That's right. Until
I become tired of you.

340
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,008
- Don't be ridiculous.

341
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,301
You must take me for some
sort of fool or something.

342
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,179
I would've preferred it if you
had grown tired of me by now.

343
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,140
That way, all I'd need to
do is get you to hand over

344
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,434
my flower bud and then leave.

345
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,352
(violin music continues)

346
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,104
- I suppose that's true.

347
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,773
However, since you are
special to me, this might

348
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,650
drag on for a little while.

349
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,694
- Look, the reason I came
here was not so i could

350
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,320
relieve you of your boredom.

351
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,073
I only came so I could get
my flower bud back from you.

352
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,159
I though you said it didn't
matter to you whether or

353
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,702
not I became the governor.

354
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,038
- I did say that, but
I wasn't aware that you

355
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,165
were required to have the
flower hair pin in order

356
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,459
to take the position
of governor.

357
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,501
- Normally not.

358
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,505
But in my case, it's
necessary to have it.

359
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,757
(echoing voice)

360
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,050
- We look forward to the
day when the buds you've

361
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,384
both been given
bloom for all to see.

362
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,766
- I understand if
that's the case.

363
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,351
- Hm?

364
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,310
(gasps)

365
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,686
- Then I'll give it back to you.

366
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,229
Now let's see.

367
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,191
You can have it back on the
day of the selection ceremony.

368
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,609
- What did you say?

369
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,152
- Well if I gave it back
to you right now you'd have

370
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,737
no reason to stay here
and would probably

371
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,739
flee in the blink of an eye.

372
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:48,615
(grunt)

373
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,783
- No I won't run away!

374
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,077
Not until the clan
selection ceremony.

375
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,204
- Well then there's
no problem, is there?

376
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,373
You can trust me
to keep my promise.

377
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,791
- All right, very well.

378
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,627
- Come then, your
room is over here.

379
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,254
(mysterious music)

380
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,384
- May I ask you something?
Mr. Kokujun, he's returned

381
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,510
to his residence, right?

382
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,386
- Yes.

383
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,720
- What is he doing now?

384
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,555
(laughing)

385
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,682
- What is it?

386
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,225
- Oh nothing,
you're quite right.

387
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,686
He is definitely here,
but his status is an issue

388
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,229
within the Sa Clan.

389
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,481
That means it doesn't
really concern you, does it?

390
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,526
- Can't I be worried about him
as one individual to another?

391
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,237
- All right, then
he's perfectly well.

392
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,739
- Wait a minute, how do you
expect me to believe you!

393
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,742
You say that in such
a patronizing manner.

394
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,537
- Then why don't you try
searching for him yourself.

395
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,831
You're free to do anything
you like while you're here.

396
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,458
I don't mind what you
do or where you search.

397
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,419
And that includes not just
the separate residence but

398
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,254
the main building as well.

399
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,256
- In other words, you're
saying Mr. Kokujun is

400
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,675
hidden away in a place that
I'll never be able to find

401
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,261
by searching for him alone, huh?

402
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,472
(suspicious laughter)

403
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:02,147
- Um, but the compound for
he Sa Clan's residence.

404
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,606
That's very impressive.

405
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,484
To think she's able to
draw this accurately.

406
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,652
- Even though she's
live there for

407
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,862
most of her life,
it's still amazing how

408
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,905
much detail she's included.

409
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,782
- Lord KMyk would
get totally lost in

410
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,576
this place that's for sure.

411
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,493
- Mhm.

412
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,290
- I wonder if they've
returned to Kio by now?

413
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,416
(soft guitar music)

414
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,419
(wolf howling)

415
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,379
(dog barking)

416
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,466
(fire crackling)

417
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,718
(sigh)

418
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,179
- If only we'd been able
to meet her in Kinka.

419
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,767
Oh, Shuei...

420
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,811
(gasps)

421
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,647
- This will be your room
while you're our guest.

422
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,316
If there's anything
you'd like, I'll have it

423
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,734
prepared for you immediately.

424
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,363
But once night falls,
I'd like you to play

425
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,491
the arrow and make some
tea for me like old times.

426
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,367
Also.

427
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,494
(gasps)

428
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,537
I'd like you to wear
your hair like this.

429
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,875
I've told you many times, this
is the style that I prefer.

430
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,504
(sigh)

431
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,465
- So, is there anything
else you'd like to ask me?

432
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,300
- Am I allowed to send letter?

433
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,510
- I am afraid to
say that wouldn't be

434
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,345
part of my jurisdiction.

435
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:17,389
Even if you could, it would
be under the condition that

436
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,848
the letters would be checked.

437
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,642
- You would go that far?

438
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,977
- I know that my grandfather
would go that far.

439
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:24,979
- I understand.

440
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:27,857
- If there's nothing else
for the moment, why don't

441
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:28,900
we go to my room.

442
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:29,901
- Huh?

443
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,569
- It's just next door to yours.

444
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,697
You'll play the arrow
for me won't you?

445
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,948
I have one there.

446
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,536
(concerned sigh)

447
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,580
(calm mellow music)

448
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,545
- Oh before you start
playing, could you brew

449
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,338
some tea for me?

450
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,341
There are several different
kinds of tea leaves over there.

451
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,053
(sighs)

452
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,764
and of course I have some
garden tea as well so you

453
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,641
could make some of
that if you like.

454
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,686
(sighs)

455
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,273
(sound of flowing liquid)

456
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,567
(content sigh)

457
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,902
- Mm, it's delicious.

458
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,821
- Thank you for saying so.

459
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,575
- But, I would much
rather gano tea

460
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,035
specially made by you.

461
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,954
(sighs)

462
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,874
(music continues)

463
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,712
- There are walls and passages
in such strange places.

464
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,839
It's quite a complicated
compound, isn't it?

465
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,549
Anyone would get lost in here.

466
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,509
Not just Lord Koyu.

467
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,095
- The whole residence
is equipped with
dead ends and traps.

468
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,847
Jeez, what a place.

469
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,850
- But this map could
prove extremely helpful.

470
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,853
Shall we make a copy and
deliver it to our lady ship?

471
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,355
- Sounds like a good idea.

472
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,525
Shorin, as the second
generation leader of the

473
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,860
Bald Eagles of Sa Province.

474
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,904
I have another
assignment for you.

475
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,864
There's a young lady in
the Sa Clan's residence

476
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:58,865
that I need you find.

477
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,492
I want you to deliver a message.

478
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,119
- Now what! Look Ensei, I
know you've been watching

479
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,372
out for us but now you're
just being demanding!

480
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,956
- A chivalrous thief
doesn't ask for

481
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,416
anything in return.

482
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,794
Besides, it's Lord Shoka's
daughter that you need to find.

483
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,754
- Why didn't you say
that in the first place?

484
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,964
Mr. Shoka did favors
for my father so if

485
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,633
it's his daughter then
it's obvious I'll be

486
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,967
glad to search for her.

487
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,177
- That's what I'm talking about.

488
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,845
As for locating her,
just listen to for the

489
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,472
sound of an arub being
played and you'll

490
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:23,932
find her in no time.

491
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,850
You've got the skill that
would make wild children

492
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,894
call you a wild child.

493
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:28,978
(laughing under breath)

494
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,730
- Was that a compliment?

495
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,023
- Don't know.

496
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,900
But remember you got to
be quite and discrete.

497
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,486
You don't want anyone
else but her to see you.

498
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,154
- So this is a stealth job then.

499
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,491
Certainly a job fit for a
chivalrous thief like me.

500
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:42,909
I like it.

501
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,994
Just copy the map and wake
me up once it's ready.

502
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,955
I'm taking a nap to
store up some stamina

503
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,123
for this little venture.

504
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,795
(snoring)

505
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,049
- Amazing. He's
all ready asleep.

506
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,010
- Like I said,
he's a wild child.

507
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,470
- But even though he's
a wild child, will he

508
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,597
be able to track down
the sound of an arub

509
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,516
in such a big residence?

510
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,560
Do you think he'll be
able to find Shurei?

511
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,312
- Don't worry.

512
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,939
These animal instincts
of his can be trusted.

513
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,608
After all, this is the same
guy who was able to find

514
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,527
us by following the horses
hoof prints from the

515
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:18,820
gate checkpoint.

516
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:19,738
- I guess you're right.

517
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,989
He is quite something.

518
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,616
It's not as if there's
only one horse in the

519
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,577
whole Korin, right?

520
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,413
- But even so, when I
look at him and at you, it

521
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,583
still amazes me how different
you can be at the same age.

522
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,044
- The same age?

523
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,462
Wait what?

524
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,838
You can't be serious.

525
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,756
- Yes, I am.

526
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,550
- I can't believe it, wow.

527
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,135
I guess I'll have
to work even harder.

528
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,972
(solum music)

529
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,228
- This is a very well drawn map.

530
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,148
Well, let's start making a
copy for princess to use.

531
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,610
- When it comes down to
it, this young lady was

532
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,488
a lot more help to
us than Kokujun was.

533
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,198
- Hey, that's just
the way it works.

534
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,908
When the going get
tough, girl's tend to be

535
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,659
much braver and
stronger than guys.

536
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,496
(music continues)

537
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,000
(all speaking together)

538
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,877
- Yes, they are strong.

539
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,631
(snoring)

540
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:25,136
(suspenseful
orchestration music)

541
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,471
(laughing)

542
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,555
- It that right?

543
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,935
Now I see, so that's how
it was great uncle Enjun.

544
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,105
That the reason you killed
all the airs at the main

545
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,023
branch of the clan was
because it was already far

546
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,484
too late for you
to do otherwise.

547
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,778
There was no longer any
other way you could help

548
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,114
set things right again.

549
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,867
To that extent, this family,
the entire Sa Clan was

550
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,619
rotten to the very core.

551
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,665
So there was nothing
left for you to do

552
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,168
but start all over from scratch.

553
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,006
And now, all I can do

554
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,760
is to bring everything
to an end by my hand

555
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,761
just like him.

556
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,850
Just like great
uncle Enjun once did.

557
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,603
(music continues)

558
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,736
father.

559
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,583
(dreamy music)

560
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,129
- Honestly, Eru this, Eru that.

561
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,046
I'm surprised that man
never gets tired of it!

562
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,382
I can't afford to
waste time here.

563
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,009
I have to look for Mr.
Kokujun and lady Heki.

564
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,928
But hey, why is this
residence so huge!
