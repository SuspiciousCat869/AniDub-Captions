00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,550
(techno music)

00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,391
{\an8}(music playing in
foreign language)

3
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,230
- [Narrator] In the very
same moment as Kuro Hang,

4
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,316
Shoka's younger brother, came
to visit their humble home,

5
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,651
Shure found herself facing

6
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,861
a difficult and
unexpected situation.

7
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,656
- What's going on, Ms. Kocho?

8
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,950
- I hate to impose, dear Shure,

9
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,286
but I'd like you to
stay here for a while.

10
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,665
Consider it a request
from a friend of mine.

11
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,417
You don't have the
authority to refuse.

12
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,336
He's not someone who the
two of you can impose,

13
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,339
seeing as you both
lack rank and position.

14
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,216
Besides, you wouldn't want
anything bad to happen

15
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,302
to your dear, beloved
father, now would you?

16
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,931
- Very well, you win.

17
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,349
- But my lady?

18
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,356
- Mr. Sairon, his
majesty entrusted me

19
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,691
with this a few days ago.

20
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,234
It'll help, please use it.

21
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,363
- Huh. Hmm.

22
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,455
- And as for you, hurry
on home, will you?

23
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,499
Don't you look scary.

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,960
Not that you can do a
single thing about it.

25
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,712
Of course, things might
have been different

26
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,007
if you were an officer with
real authority like Lord Ron.

27
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,676
That's too bad.

28
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,971
As you are right now, you'll
never be able to protect

29
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,639
what's important to you.

30
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,268
(techno, mysterious music)

31
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,401
- (laughs) I see.

32
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,570
So everything's going
according to plan.

33
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,905
With this, it should be easy

34
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,948
to kick that little
girl out of the court.

35
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,284
- What do you want us to
do with that other kid?

36
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,620
- He's the one who threw
mud all over my face

37
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,081
after I was being
so kind to him.

38
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,291
I'll see to it that his
career as an official

39
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,710
is finished soon enough,
but in the meantime,

40
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,587
you guys can have
some fun with him.

41
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,005
- Right.

42
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,384
- But to think, that officious
idiot would volunteer

43
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,927
to be that girl's sponsor.

44
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,721
Ray Shin Hong is
surprising foolish.

45
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,015
At last, this is my
chance to get rid of him!

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,935
(laughing evilly)

47
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,981
(Techno music)

48
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,733
- I suppose by this,
I can assume you were

49
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,694
expecting my arrival.

50
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,903
- That's right.

51
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,863
Agatu was kind enough to
tell me ahead of time.

52
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,740
That was back when he
sent all his money home.

53
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,034
It left him penny-less
and without any resources.

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,411
You fed him and gave him a place

55
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,371
to stay for the
night, didn't you?

56
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,665
I understand that you
offered him your hospitality

57
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,500
in exchange for
some information,

58
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,627
answers to your
questions about Shure.

59
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,796
- So much for trusting
that kid and his big mouth.

60
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,965
- And you didn't simply
inquire about Shure.

61
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,633
From what I hear, you've
been pretty active

62
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,552
behind the scenes
for a lot of things.

63
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,970
- Do you have even
the faintest idea

64
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,097
of the true gravity of the
situation your daughter

65
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,557
is in at the moment?

66
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,850
Just think of how
much harassment

67
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,101
that girl would have had to face

68
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,978
if I had sat back
and done nothing.

69
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,064
You know I really
hate you, big brother.

70
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,733
I don't feel even
the slightest regret

71
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,110
for having thrown you out
of our ancestral home.

72
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,655
- That's good, because I
happen to feel the same way.

73
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,658
- But despite all that, you
are still our eldest brother,

74
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,618
the eldest child
of the Hong clan.

75
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,998
And that girl, the first
female official in the country,

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,043
is still a princess of the
direct line of the Hong family.

77
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,588
You should know my
plan is to have Shure

78
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,381
become Koi Yu Lee's wife.

79
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,720
It's for the sake of the next
generation of the Hong clan.

80
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,763
- [Man With Black
Cloak] Lord Kuro.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,848
- What's happened?

82
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,141
- It seems Lord
Ray Shin is being

83
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,851
confined at the royal palace.

84
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,436
- What for?

85
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,771
- [Man With Black Cloak]
On suspicion of impropriety

86
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,856
regarding Lady Shure
passing the National Exams.

87
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,150
- How foolish.

88
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,818
I assume Brother
Ray has purposefully

89
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,403
allowed himself to be taken.

90
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,031
- [Man With Black Cloak] Yes,
and also about Lady Shure ...

91
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,407
- (gasps) What is it?

92
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,495
- She and Egetsu are being
held prisoner at Kogaro.

93
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,163
On top of that,
there is likely to be

94
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,874
an inquiry held at the palace
tomorrow regarding Lady Shure.

95
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,709
- Isn't that interesting.

96
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,754
So she's being held prisoner
to prevent her from attending?

97
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,048
That's just fine.

98
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,758
We'll show them
exactly what happens

99
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,928
when someone makes an
enemy of the Hong clan.

100
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,557
- Your Majesty, a letter
bearing a purple crest

101
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,767
has arrived from Sairon.

102
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,061
- A purple crest?

103
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,981
But I originally gave that
to Egetsu to keep. (gasps)

104
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,526
- You look shocked.

105
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,694
What's the matter?

106
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,779
- It says Shure's
being held captive.

107
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,906
- Oh, so they got their
hands on Shure, too?

108
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,116
- Too?

109
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,201
- Ray Shin Hong's also
being held captive,

110
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,577
he's been arrested.

111
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,870
- (yells) How did this happen?

112
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,205
- I'd imagine it's
because that rumor

113
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,624
has become quite widespread.

114
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,875
- You mean the one about Shure

115
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,544
passing through illegal means?

116
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,045
- The rumor seems to
have come from the

117
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,673
Department of Protocol, which
is in charge of the exams.

118
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,217
That fact would make the
gossip seem quite credible.

119
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,720
No doubt that buffoon
thought his chance had come

120
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,806
and so he foolishly made his
move against Lord Ray Shin.

121
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,851
- (sighs) To act against Ray
Shin, of all the stupid things!

122
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,103
- By the way, I should
inform you of one

123
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,563
other thing the Ron information

124
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,106
that work has caught wind of.

125
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,691
- What is it?

126
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,985
- Lord Kuro Hong, the proxy
head of the Hong clan,

127
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,194
is currently in the capital.

128
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,779
- (moans)

129
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,989
- I understand
he's paying a visit

130
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,949
to Lord Shoka's
residence at the moment.

131
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,910
- (moans) Of all
the rotten timing.

132
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,579
- It certainly
complicates matters.

133
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,122
For one thing, it means
you'll have to act

134
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,124
in order to keep
damage to a minimum.

135
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,625
- If that guy got
just a little more

136
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
carried away with things,

137
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,712
we could deal with
him directly, but ...

138
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,214
- Don't worry, I did get
him to take things further.

139
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,217
- Koyu, what's
that in your hand?

140
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,136
- It's a petition
demanding Shure give up the

141
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,971
title of initiate and step down.

142
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,098
The guy's name is
clearly written on it.

143
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,268
It calls for an inquiry
to be held immediately.

144
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,144
- You've done it, Koyu!

145
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,771
Good work!

146
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,857
Very well, we can hold that
inquiry tomorrow at noon,

147
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,859
just as he would like us to.

148
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:27,906
But before that, I will go
personally to where Shure is.

149
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,033
- Things are going to get
pretty hectic here tonight,

150
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,659
so get back here soon.

151
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,787
- Yeah, sure, I get it.

152
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,291
- Well, well, so at
last you finally come.

153
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,751
I know that look on your face.

154
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,837
You've resolved yourself, then.

155
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,299
- Great General Haku, I
must ask something of you.

156
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,843
- Sure, I'll hear a
request if it's from you.

157
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,220
What is it that you want?

158
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,055
- A sword.

159
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,100
I want the position, rank
and authority to wear

160
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,061
a sword so I can fight for
what's important to me.

161
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,856
- I can't believe it.

162
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,694
Even Ms. Kocho hates me
now, and the townsfolk, too.

163
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,903
- I'm sure it'll be fine.

164
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,030
Everyone's just caught
off guard right now.

165
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,660
- Egetsu, I don't think
I've ever asked you

166
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,078
why you want to
become an official.

167
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,747
- Mostly because I'd be
able to get lots of money.

168
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,625
Actually, that
wasn't my first goal.

169
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,836
Originally I wanted
to become a doctor

170
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,963
and help treat the
sick and wounded.

171
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,133
but most doctors tend to
be pretty poor, don't they?

172
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,718
- Is that so?

173
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,887
- Yeah, at least the monk
who raised me certainly was.

174
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,223
He paid more for the raw
materials for his medicine

175
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,058
than he received
from his patients.

176
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,019
From the beginning, he
took almost no money

177
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,729
from the sick
people in his care,

178
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,814
but he still did
his best for them.

179
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,315
It didn't really matter to us

180
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,901
that we didn't have much to
eat or new clothes to wear.

181
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,237
But there were times when he
couldn't help those in need,

182
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,072
because we didn't
have enough money.

183
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,074
Whenever that happened,
I could tell his pain

184
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,076
by the look on his face.

185
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,037
Of course, I know that
money isn't everything,

186
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,373
but you can do much more for
other people if you have it.

187
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,250
I don't want to see
that look ever again,

188
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,085
on the monk or anyone else.

189
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,132
- Thank you very much, Egetsu.

190
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,384
You see, you just reminded me

191
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,387
about the reason I wanted
to become an official,

192
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,390
and the things I wanted
to do once I became one.

193
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,976
It doesn't matter what the
townspeople may think or say.

194
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,730
I'm going to do my best and
work hard for everyone's sake.

195
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,649
(friends chuckle)

196
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,986
- So, guess you would
be the little brat

197
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,030
who made a fool of
the master, huh?

198
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,281
- What do you mean?

199
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,075
- We've been given
orders to play around

200
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,659
with you for a little while.

201
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,828
- I heard that you
can't drink any alcohol.

202
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,246
- Well isn't that interesting?

203
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,414
Why don't we see what happens

204
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,291
once this kid puts
a few away, huh?

205
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,250
- What, wine?

206
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,126
You can't!

207
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:45,960
Please, you mustn't.

208
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,128
- Shut up, already.

209
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,129
You're coming with us.

210
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,005
(Egetsu whimpers)

211
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,131
- No, Egetsu!

212
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,175
- You know you
really were a fool.

213
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,802
You should have been smart

214
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,970
and agree to become the
son-in-law of our master.

215
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,097
(Egetsu whimpers)

216
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,890
Now then, why don't
we educate you

217
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,308
on the taste of alcohol.

218
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,686
(men laugh)

219
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,980
- Egetsu! (yelps)

220
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,901
- Aw, now, stay here and be
a good little girl, okay?

221
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,902
- (whimpers) Let go!

222
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,320
- If you'd rather not be alone,

223
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,155
I'm sure we can
keep you company.

224
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,157
After all, this is
that sort of place.

225
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,785
(men laugh)

226
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,036
(Shure shudders)

227
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,329
Now come on, you.

228
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,331
- [Egetsu] Shure! (grunts)

229
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,249
Shure!

230
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,919
(Shure sighs)

231
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,296
(man laughs)

232
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,061
(ethereal, string music)

233
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,897
- We'll likely arrive a
lot sooner than expected.

234
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,817
You've really been hanging
in there, Miss Corinne.

235
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,193
- It's not over yet.

236
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,154
We need to make every
effort to get there quickly

237
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,780
and meet with Lady Shure.

238
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,073
- Aren't you the
least bit afraid

239
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,325
about meeting the person
you tried to kill?

240
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
- Yes, I am afraid,

241
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,580
but I'm not going to run
away from it anymore.

242
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,248
Before I left, I made a promise

243
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,958
to myself and her great ladyship

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,128
to stop ignoring what I've done.

245
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,005
Considering what I
did to Lady Shure,

246
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,548
that has to come first.

247
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,801
- From what I hear, you
really like the princess.

248
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,471
- I have absolutely no right
to say anything like that.

249
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,473
I intend to spend
the rest of my life

250
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,475
trying to make up
for what I did.

251
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,810
- Well, yeah, of course.

252
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,270
Even if the princess
forgives you,

253
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,105
it's still the
right thing to do.

254
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,273
It doesn't matter in the end

255
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,025
whether the other person
forgives you or not.

256
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,194
The crime you committed
will stay with you

257
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,362
for the rest of your life.

258
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,322
- You're quite
merciless, aren't you?

259
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,367
But right now, I feel better
thinking about things that way.

260
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,454
- Break time's up.

261
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,122
Let's push on a
little more, shall we?

262
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:46,998
- Yes.

263
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,378
- (grunts) Stop it! (moans)

264
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,172
- Come on, give it up
already, little girl.

265
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,258
- (screams) No!

266
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,135
- Talk about being
a major handful.

267
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,014
(men grunt)

268
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,519
- Oh, you again.

269
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,605
You know, you really
are an idiotic girl.

270
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,067
Your gang's luck ran out once
you made me drink that wine.

271
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,236
- Why you! (moans)

272
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:20,990
Ow.

273
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,158
- You bastard.

274
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,494
- Hey girl, I'm not
the same as that

275
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,079
soft-hearted dope Egetsu.

276
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,915
Don't expect me to always
come to your rescue.

277
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,625
(Egetsu shouts)

278
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,919
But today's a special exception.

279
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,880
Even Egetsu seemed
angry for once.

280
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,048
- Damn you!

281
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,134
- What's with all the
commotion in here?

282
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,972
- Now what's Ms.
Kocho going to do?

283
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,181
- Just in time, Kocho.

284
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,434
Call in the guards here
and put them to work.

285
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,519
- Don't be ridiculous.

286
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:50,520
I will not.

287
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,521
- Huh?

288
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,647
- Giving me orders?

289
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,066
Just who do you think I am?

290
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,359
- Why you backstabbing-

291
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,403
(yells)

292
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,993
- Thank you, Egetsu.

293
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,911
- My name is Yogetsu.

294
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,038
- Oh right, of course.

295
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,289
Thank you Yogetsu.

296
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,375
- If you really want to
thank me for my help,

297
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,128
then you can do
it with your body.

298
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,046
What?

299
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,466
- Wait a sec.

300
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,927
- Damn, I've run out
of time. (snores)

301
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,686
- Kocho, you witch!

302
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,521
How dare you betray us

303
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,066
after the master showed
you so much favor.

304
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,195
- My loyalties have been with
his side since the beginning.

305
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,156
And what's this garbage
about him showing me favor?

306
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,367
Just who does that
man think he is?

307
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,286
(man yelps)

308
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,537
(foreboding music)

309
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,414
How dare a little
nothing like you

310
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,583
look down on Kocho of Kogaro.

311
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,293
And to make matters worse,

312
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,504
you even went after
my precious Shure.

313
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,422
- My precious Shure?

314
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,590
- Get him.

315
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,301
(man shouts)

316
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,303
You really hung
in there, my dear.

317
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,596
- It's you, Ms. Kocho.

318
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:10,100
You're the Ms. Kocho
I've always known.

319
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,434
- Don't be silly.

320
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,603
As if I'd harm the girl
I've been taking care of

321
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,146
for almost 10 years.

322
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,565
- I know, but still, I didn't
know what I was going to do

323
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:21,611
if you ended up hating me, just
like everybody else. (cries)

324
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,612
- I'm sorry.

325
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,030
I'm very sorry.

326
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,281
The only reason I
told you not to come

327
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,201
was so that no one
would see you here.

328
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,244
It wasn't for anything bad.

329
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,455
(Shure cries)

330
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,166
Come on, please don't cry now.

331
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,543
- It's not only that.

332
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,212
I guess I just feel so
relieved at it all suddenly,

333
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,214
even though I made it
this far without crying.

334
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,091
- Yes, you were wonderful.

335
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,219
Let me guess, you thought in
order to fight against men,

336
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,763
you couldn't let
yourself cry to any man,

337
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,724
not even Sairon, right?

338
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,475
I'm so proud of you.

339
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,477
My little girl's all grown up.

340
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,355
But I'm afraid you're going
to have to dry your tears now.

341
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,524
There's still many
things left to be done.

342
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,734
- Things to be done?

343
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,694
- For example, there's
Lord Ron's request.

344
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,738
I accepted it because
it was for your sake.

345
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,114
- Lord Ron?

346
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,366
You mean General
Ron's also involved?

347
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,118
I'm very confused
about all this.

348
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,495
- It seems the two
who can best explain

349
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,830
are arriving as we speak.

350
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,081
- Shure!

351
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,249
- My lady, are you all right?

352
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,044
- It's Sedeyuki and Sairon.

353
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,256
- Deliver that letter
to every member

354
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,175
of the Hong clan
living in the capital.

355
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,092
- Understood.

356
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,179
- You're actually going
through with this?

357
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,555
- You were expecting otherwise?

358
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,140
I'm angry.

359
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,683
- I suppose this
is a good example

360
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,687
of why it's better to let
sleeping dogs lie, as they say.

361
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,814
- [Shure] The head of
the Sa clan's ring?

362
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,774
- That's right.

363
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,275
Since the death of advisor Sa,

364
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,194
a certain man has been
trying to take advantage

365
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,447
of that missing ring to satisfy
his own selfish desires.

366
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,408
Using his position, he's
been engaging in a number

367
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,787
of illegal activities in
order to line his own pockets.

368
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,373
However, regardless of whom
we might be dealing with,

369
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,875
we cannot make an arrest
without real proof.

370
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,293
- So you've been using me

371
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,671
to gather evidence
against that man?

372
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,799
- I'm sorry you had to endure
such a terrifying experience.

373
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,466
- It's all right.

374
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,469
The part I don't understand is

375
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,137
what is this person
intending to accomplish

376
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,847
by keeping me trapped here?

377
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,349
- Tomorrow at noon
there's going to be

378
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,226
an inquiry regarding
your status.

379
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,811
- Are you serious?

380
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,271
- He doesn't like the idea of
having women become officials,

381
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,606
and so claiming you had passed

382
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,150
the National Examinations
by improper means,

383
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,318
he went ahead and took steps

384
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,320
to have an inquiry
held about you.

385
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,446
Then with you held here,

386
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,573
he would point out
your failure to appear,

387
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,783
and insist that you had fled,

388
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,327
from fear of having
the truth revealed.

389
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,453
- That's so cowardly of him!

390
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,205
I see how it is now.

391
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,915
So I need to appear
before that inquiry

392
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,418
and make them realize
just what I'm capable of.

393
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,711
All right, I'll do it.

394
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,506
- In any event, I suggest
that Sairon and Egetsu

395
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,591
stay here with you
in Kogero tonight.

396
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,219
- Kocho, your protection
is flawless, right?

397
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,220
- Of course it is.

398
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,888
Please, leave it to us.

399
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,473
- You'll undoubtedly
meet resistance

400
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,183
when you come to
the palace tomorrow,

401
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,601
but as part of
gathering evidence,

402
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,729
I'm not going to assign
you any major escort.

403
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,522
I want you to come
on your own strength.

404
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,481
- You sure?

405
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,899
Physically I'm not very strong.

406
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,193
- That's why I will be
having Sairon stick with you.

407
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,361
In his current position,

408
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,612
he doesn't have to hold
back against anyone.

409
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,614
- What do you mean?

410
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,324
- You'll understand soon enough.

411
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,911
(soft music)

412
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,581
- Well, all right.

413
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,790
Oh, by the way,
I should tell you

414
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,709
about something I've
noticed recently.

415
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:23,918
- You mean this, right?

416
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,212
- How did you-?

417
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,839
- It's a very
well-written report.

418
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,257
If you're able to complete it,

419
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,843
I imagine it will be compelling
evidence of corruption.

420
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,888
- But Yuki, I-

421
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,724
- Sairon has one of the
seals of the royal family.

422
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,934
Send it to the
palace using that.

423
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,645
Any letter bearing that seal
is called a purple crest letter

424
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,315
and will be given top
priority to reach me.

425
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,484
(Shure whimpers)

426
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,693
What's the matter?

427
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,695
- Don't worry, it's nothing.

428
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,946
I understand.

429
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,948
So by noon tomorrow, right?

430
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,326
- My lady, would it
be all right for me

431
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,411
to return to the residence
for a short while?

432
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,871
I'm worried about the master.

433
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:00,789
- Of course, you're right.

434
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,915
Please do.

435
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,667
- In that case, I
suppose it's a good time

436
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,835
to put this boy to bed.

437
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,587
- I'll get going
now as well, then.

438
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,469
- Hey, thank you, Yuki.

439
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,638
You've been so honest.

440
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,682
You, Lord Koyu, and General Ron

441
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,475
haven't been soft
on me about anything

442
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,644
since I came to
the royal palace.

443
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,270
When I asked you
what was going on,

444
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,523
you told me frankly that
somebody may be after me

445
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,525
and that you were using me.

446
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,610
It's not like things
were a year ago.

447
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,446
A year ago, nobody
told me anything

448
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,864
about what was happening.

449
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:38,284
All of you were trying to
protect me, weren't you?

450
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,995
Like I was some
sheltered princess.

451
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:41,996
- I'm sorry, Shure.

452
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,249
- But now things are different.

453
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,251
I'm happy about that.

454
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,752
Thank you for treating
me like an official

455
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,546
who can discuss
matters as an equal.

456
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,424
And I'm also very happy
you came to rescue me.

457
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,844
But just tell me one more thing,

458
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,389
I'll never ask again, so
please don't lie to me, okay?

459
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,976
Can I become an official
with complete pride?

460
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,478
Was there really nothing
improper going on?

461
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,396
- Nothing.

462
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,315
- (sighs) In that
case, I no longer

463
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,775
have anything to be afraid of.

464
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,319
- Shure, I'd be really happy

465
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,863
if you do something for me, too.

466
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,406
- What is it?

467
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,450
- It can wait until
your final assignment,

468
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,494
but if possible, I'd like you
to set some time aside for me.

469
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,914
(Shure sighs)

470
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,833
- What's wrong, Shure?

471
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,793
- If I can find the time.

472
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,755
- Pardon me for a
moment, Your Majesty.

473
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,381
- What is it?

474
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,425
- We received a message for you.

475
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,302
As of 15 minutes
ago, half the work

476
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,928
in the city is ground to a halt.

477
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,514
If you don't come back
immediately, I'll kill you.

478
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,474
From Koyu Lee.

479
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,975
That's what it says.

480
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,856
- (groans) Oh man, I don't
want to go back tonight.

481
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,068
Are these all petitions
for assistance?

482
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,611
- That's right.

483
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,072
- (groans) I didn't think the
situation would go this far.

484
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,074
- Members of the Hong
family have all abandoned

485
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,784
their work outside
the palace walls.

486
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,786
As a result, the
capital is in an uproar,

487
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,663
and requests for help
are coming in non-stop.

488
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,832
- This is all Kudo's
doing, isn't it?

489
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,876
- And he's still
going easy on you.

490
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,795
- After all, if he
were truly serious,

491
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,672
this country would
collapse quickly.

492
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,965
- So this is the real
power of the Hong clan?

493
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,635
- How's secretary Hong
doing at the moment?

494
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,804
- He's taken over one of the

495
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,347
distant residences for himself,

496
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,848
and is currently under
self-imposed house arrest.

497
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,100
- Self imposed?

498
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,685
- He's just doing
it to be difficult.

499
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,812
- This just adds
to our problems.

500
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,106
- It's strange how when
the pressure applied

501
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,941
is so direct and outrageous,

502
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,818
it ends up not feeling
like pressure anymore.

503
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,986
At least that's what I think.

504
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,363
- Shuwe, how long
will things hold

505
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,823
given the current situation?

506
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,866
- If you order it, I could
maintain things indefinitely

507
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,993
with the help of the
Ron clan's power,

508
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,954
but I expect things will
be resolved within a day,

509
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,997
regardless of my
family's involvement.

510
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,667
In other words, Lord Kuro
is surely expecting you

511
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,711
to resolve matters in one day.

512
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:53,920
- I see.

513
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,130
Then let's get this over
with already, right?

514
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,507
What was that guy thinking?

515
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,175
He must have realized
that going up against

516
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:02,512
Ray Shin himself was
basically suicidal.

517
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,055
- Could it be that he
doesn't actually know

518
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,808
the truth about Lord Ray Shin
being the head of Hong clan?

519
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,393
- What do you mean?

520
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,395
- Come to think of it, he
never has publicly revealed

521
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,522
the fact that he's the real
head of the Hong family.

522
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,024
- You didn't say.

523
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,191
That's quite the blind spot.

524
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,860
- Oh, right.

525
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,195
- We received word from
Ense earlier this evening.

526
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,531
He expects to arrive
tomorrow, by sunset.

527
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,866
- Send orders that
he's to arrive

528
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,784
by noon tomorrow at the latest.

529
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:29,831
- Well, I'm afraid that I've
already gone ahead and done so.

530
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,541
(distant chatter)

531
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,625
- You have no wine to sell?

532
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,835
But you're a wine merchant,

533
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,587
how is something like
that even possible?

534
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,796
- Now, how the
heck should I know?

535
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,049
All distribution of
alcohol in the capital

536
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,508
has ground to a halt.

537
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,926
- Just what in the
world is going on here?

538
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,553
- Oh dear, it
looks like we won't

539
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,013
be able to open up shop today.

540
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,557
The entire city's in
a state of confusion.

541
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,728
- (grunts) I'm sorry, I
slept for quite some time.

542
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,938
- Egetsu, good to see you
back to your old self.

543
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,607
- Yes.

544
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,108
I don't suppose I was any help?

545
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,196
- You did great.

546
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,823
- That strange pause
is kind of worrying.

547
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,116
- Nevermind that now.

548
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,788
It's become imperative that we
finish this by noon tomorrow.

549
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,665
- What? That's cutting
it a bit close, isn't it?

550
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,584
Let's get started right away.

551
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,086
- Hey Egetsu?

552
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,253
- Yes?

553
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,963
- When did you first
realize all this?

554
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,468
- I heard lots of rumors
while I was polishing shoes.

555
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,595
People would gossip
and I'd overhear.

556
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:26,721
Oh, and this, too.

557
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,931
I checked with
those who had passed

558
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,141
to the top ranks of the
National Examinations,

559
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,976
and had received their stipends.

560
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,647
- Excellent work, Egetsu.

561
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,817
All right, let's do this, okay?

562
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:39,734
- Okay.

563
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,823
- This is impossible!

564
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,200
How could Ray Shin
have this much power?

565
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,078
No, disaster hasn't
struck me yet.

566
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,329
I'll leave Shi Province.

567
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,581
I'll say it's an order
to recover my health.

568
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,793
As for the rest, I'll be fine
as long as I have this ring.

569
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,962
Everything is that
little girl's fault.

570
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,547
There's not way I'm
going to allow her

571
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,007
to show up before noon tomorrow.

572
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,554
- Hoju, here.

573
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,973
Shure and Egetsu's
project has arrived.

574
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,307
To think they were
able to pick out

575
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,892
every single one of those papers

576
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,520
you had me slip into their
work a little at a time.

577
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,982
- Yes, now get rid of Yuri.

578
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,817
We've got a fight today.

579
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:24,612
- Shuwe, Koyu, let's go.

580
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:25,530
- Right.

581
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,036
(foreboding, techno music)

582
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,846
{\an8}(peaceful music)

583
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,295
- [Shure] Ms. Kocho really
was my ally after all.

584
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,464
I'm sorry I doubted her
for even an instant.

585
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,800
Now come on, Sairon,
we've got to hurry

586
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,885
to the palace and
attend this inquiry.

587
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,221
This is not going to end
with us getting beaten.
