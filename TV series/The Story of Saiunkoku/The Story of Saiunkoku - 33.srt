1
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,051
(techno instrumental)

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,558
(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,689
(tense music)

4
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,816
- [Narrator] As she
confronted Tsushou Sa,

5
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,444
Shuurei flatly refused any
engagement with Sakujun.

6
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,322
However, her flower bud
hair pin still remained

7
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,908
in the hands of Sakujun
and she had no idea

8
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,868
as to the whereabouts
of Eiki Hyou.

9
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,291
Luckily, she did have a good
idea where Kokujun Sa might be.

10
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,627
(tense music)

11
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,846
(footsteps pattering)

12
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,684
- Hey boss, that's you isn't it?

13
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,310
- How did you guess?

14
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,687
- I kind of sensed it.

15
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,313
So what did you find out?

16
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,025
- It was just like
you suspected, there's
an unusual shrine

17
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,736
at the edge of the
residence courtyard.

18
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,987
- I thought as much.

19
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,281
- How'd you know, Miss Shuurei?

20
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,700
- In rich residences it's
customary to have a shrine

21
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,618
for the eight colored
enlightened ones.

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,329
Since having one of those
shrines is so common,

23
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,914
a lot of people
just ignore them.

24
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,710
- [Shourin] Oh, I get
it, I understand now.

25
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,711
- [Shuurei] That's
where the entrance

26
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,296
to the basement must be.

27
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,673
- The only thing is there are
a lot of guards in front of it

28
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,050
what do we do?

29
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,010
- They're holding the
selection ceremony tonight.

30
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,763
The guards will be busy with
the gate in main building.

31
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,349
If security's ever going to
be light, today's the day.

32
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,684
- Huh, but, uh...

33
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,895
Sorry, but tonight really
isn't a good time for me.

34
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,480
- Huh?

35
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,690
- I already accepted another
assignment for tonight.

36
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,275
So if you'll excuse me.

37
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,361
- Hey wait a second Shourin?

38
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,905
Oh great, well if
that's the case,

39
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,282
then I'm just going to
have to go there by myself.

40
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,832
(gentle music)

41
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,627
(drink pouring)

42
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,342
- Huh?

43
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,054
You need to be at the
selection ceremony soon.

44
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,555
Why are you sitting
here drinking

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,516
and not even getting ready?

46
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,935
- It's because I
don't feel like going.

47
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,605
- You really have no motivation
to do anything, do you?

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,399
- It's just that this
is the very last day

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,734
that I'll be able to
spend together with you.

50
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,528
To me, that's more important.

51
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,821
- Oh, honestly.

52
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,867
- Hey, would you do
my hair up for me?

53
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,953
- Look, I'm not your
personal maid, okay?

54
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,956
Why not ask somebody
else to do that for you?

55
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,708
- I only want you to do it.

56
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,460
- Huh?

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,881
- Could you do my hair and
make me some tea as well?

58
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,760
- All right, since
it's the last time.

59
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,022
You seem sort of quiet today,

60
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,106
have you had too much to drink?

61
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,816
Are you not feeling well?

62
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,609
- (laughs) No, that's not it.

63
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,738
I have a very strong stomach
when it comes to alcohol.

64
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,114
- Now that you mention it,

65
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,616
I don't believe I've ever
seen you drunk before.

66
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,534
- That's very true.

67
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,998
- All right, I'm done.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,833
If you're not going to
the selection ceremony,

69
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,835
then you should try to
get some more sleep.

70
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,129
Here, I'll pour a little
hot water for you.

71
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,507
- I'd really prefer Ganlu tea.

72
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,634
- Not happening.

73
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,594
- Why not?

74
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,511
- Because.

75
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,559
Wait a sec, the shelves
look a little different.

76
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,978
There's a lot more empty space.

77
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,858
Ah, Ganlu tea is the only
kind of tea leaf you have.

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,736
- It's only fair since you
rejected an engagement with me

79
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,154
so bluntly.

80
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,031
I don't think it's asking
too much to let me savor

81
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,866
a little sweet thought from you,

82
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,660
especially now since
you're leaving.

83
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,828
- He's got to be kidding.

84
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,164
He wants to drink
Ganlu tea that badly?

85
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,542
Here, have some hot water.

86
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,548
- (sighs) Are you
worried about me?

87
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,512
- Well, yes, you're acting
even more strangely than normal

88
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,013
so I am a bit concerned.

89
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,557
- (chuckles) You're very kind.

90
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,811
Then I'll drink it.

91
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,778
There, I've had some.

92
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,447
Now I'd like you to make
some Ganlu tea for me.

93
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,533
- No way.

94
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,784
- Huh?

95
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,911
- You've been drinking
wine, and a lot of it.

96
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,789
If that wine mixes weirdly
with Ganlu tea in your stomach,

97
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,582
you could end up
making yourself sick.

98
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,917
Just have the hot water today

99
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,919
and get some decent rest, okay?

100
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,464
- I don't care, I don't
mind if I get sick.

101
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,509
This is going to be
the very last day

102
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,594
I can have you make tea for me.

103
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,555
- (sighs) Now come on.

104
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,016
- If you don't brew
any Ganlu tea for me,

105
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,976
then I'm afraid
I'm going to die.

106
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,938
- (chuckles) That's
something a child would say.

107
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,734
Hmm, geez, guess
it can't be helped.

108
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,115
Say, do you remember
the promise you made?

109
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,744
- Of course, I'll return
your flower bud to you.

110
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,954
You seem awfully
busy at the moment,

111
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,790
so come back here after you
finished everything else.

112
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,668
- You know, I wouldn't mind
having it back right now.

113
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,714
In fact, I insist you
return it this minute.

114
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,507
- Don't spoil my dreams now.

115
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,138
Dreams, do I have one, hmm.

116
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,727
- Hey, what's the matter?

117
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,895
- No, it's nothing.

118
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:18,730
- Okay then.

119
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,191
(tea pouring)

120
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,822
(people chattering)

121
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:38,249
(crickets chirping)
(horse neighing)

122
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,752
- I still wonder,
will it be all right?

123
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,253
- Why not?

124
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,756
It was an official invitation
that the Sa clan gave us.

125
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,676
We can just hold our heads
high and go in the front gate.

126
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,551
- Okay.

127
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,097
- Anything could happen
during the selection ceremony.

128
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,973
You take care of
matters on that end.

129
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,183
- Got it.

130
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,018
As for you, make sure
that Shunki's safe.

131
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,229
The people from the Sa clan
will know what she looks like,

132
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,563
so you'll have to be careful.

133
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,314
- I know.

134
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:05,026
(crickets chirping)

135
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,153
Fortunately it's a
new moon tonight,

136
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,155
it's the perfect
night for sneaking in.

137
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,285
- Well then, shall we
join the celebration?

138
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,662
- [Man In Wagon] Yeah.

139
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,164
(horse neighing and trotting)

140
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,834
(gentle music)

141
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,772
- Huh?

142
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,067
Kanshou.

143
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,325
(item clatters)

144
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,162
- [Ryuuki] Bakuya?

145
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,388
- Ryuuki, you're a man so
that should keep Bakuya

146
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,140
a little quieter
when you use it.

147
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,896
That Bakuya and this
Kanshou are yin and yang,

148
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,647
the same sorts
put into two parts

149
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,107
by the members of the Hyou clan.

150
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,984
It's said that if they're
forcibly separated

151
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,278
from each other, they
put up resistance.

152
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,655
But they say the Bakuya
possesses a woman's nature

153
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,949
within itself and for that
reason it will go quiet

154
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,242
if it's wielded by a man.

155
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,416
(laughs) Of course, it may
still be difficult for you.

156
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,959
(tense music)

157
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,837
- If Bakuya's female,
then Kanshou must be male.

158
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,422
It's a reflection
on your great skill

159
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:53,134
that you're able to keep
Kanshou under control, brother.

160
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,845
The origin of the
twin swords is--

161
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,389
- Exorcism.
(crickets chirping)

162
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,099
If the swords that were
forged for the purpose

163
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,226
of obliterated demons
are now howling...

164
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,312
Lady Shunki, from here on
I fear I will be heading

165
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,148
in a different direction
than you are going.

166
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,067
This sword's gentle
towards women.

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,321
It will definitely protect
you, please take it.

168
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,786
I'll be fine, even without
this sword with me.

169
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,037
- [Guard] You,
identify yourself.

170
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,205
- Hmm?

171
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,915
- Come out of there.
- What's going on?

172
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,709
- Over here.
- Is that them?

173
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,128
- (grunts) What
is it Lady Shunki?

174
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,755
(tense music)

175
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,800
- Huh?

176
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,467
What are you doing?

177
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,385
I don't understand.

178
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,096
Huh?

179
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,767
(guards chattering)

180
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,186
- Hey, who is that?

181
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,397
- Wait, wait a second,
this girl is...

182
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,195
- Uh, uh...

183
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,125
(guards grunting)

184
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,428
Hmm.

185
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,101
(footsteps tapping)

186
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,397
Why, of course.

187
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,524
I completely forgot that
she was a blood relative

188
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,110
of the clan that created
you in the first place.

189
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,113
(laughs) Whether
it's her or my lady,

190
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,573
the embarrassing
fact still remains

191
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,117
that the women are
by far the stronger.

192
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,953
(crickets chirping)

193
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,080
Now.

194
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,374
(footsteps patting)

195
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,209
I will do what I have to do.

196
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,963
(tense music)

197
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,466
- Listen to me Shunki,
you must promise me

198
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,886
that you will only use that
power for the sake of one person

199
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,596
and one person alone.

200
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,599
Keep your power locked away
and use it for the sake

201
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,811
of that one special person
whom you'll meet one day.

202
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,441
Muster all your
effort and go forth

203
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,568
to save that fool whom you love.

204
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,156
Just as I once did in the past.

205
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,415
- Oh.

206
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,043
There it is.

207
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,591
Guards!

208
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,016
In that case...

209
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:01,865
(crickets chirping)
(footsteps patting)

210
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,285
(water trickling)

211
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,371
- But I have evidence.

212
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,415
You have to let me
through immediately.

213
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,917
- We can't do that, we've
been specifically ordered

214
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,420
by Lord Tsushou not
to let anyone through.

215
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,339
- There's someone in
there, isn't there?

216
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,008
- No, there is no
one inside here.

217
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,093
- If there's nobody in there,
then what's the problem?

218
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,261
Let me through.

219
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,472
- Oh, no, no way, the
divine punishment.

220
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,848
- Are you nuts or something?

221
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,516
Divine punishment
comes from the Gods,

222
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,018
not the eight colored
enlightened ones.

223
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,269
- What are you saying?

224
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,855
- Ah, she's being a
pain, just take her.

225
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:34,856
- Ha!

226
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:35,732
(tense music)

227
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,858
- Huh?

228
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,234
- What?

229
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,486
- Lady Shuurei Hong, please
keep your ears covered

230
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,738
with your hands until
I say it's all right.

231
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,869
- Ah, why are they moving?

232
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:48,787
I can't stop.

233
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,041
- You, rank in file
guards, lose consciousness

234
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,418
and remain asleep until
I command otherwise.

235
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,048
(guards grunting)

236
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,468
- Ah, what, what the
heck just happened here?

237
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,261
- Don't worry,
it's all right now.

238
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,056
- (gasps)

239
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,265
It is a great honor and pleasure

240
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,559
to finally meet you
at last, Lady Shuurei.

241
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,354
My name is Shunki Sa.

242
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,106
- Lady Shunki?

243
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,858
But I've been told that
you are unable to speak.

244
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,069
- No, it's not that
I couldn't speak,

245
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,154
I simply made the choice not to.

246
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,072
- Huh?

247
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,242
- It's the words that
come out of my mouth.

248
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,327
They contain the
power to force people

249
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,204
to do whatever I might say.

250
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,082
As you can imagine, it's
extremely dangerous,

251
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,918
and that's why in order to
hide this power from people

252
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,795
I kept my voice sealed away.

253
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,589
- Who would've guessed it
was something like that?

254
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,424
(footsteps echoing)

255
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,341
Huh?
- Huh?

256
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,932
- Well, I have no
idea what that is,

257
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,268
but I'm pretty
sure it isn't good.

258
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,978
(footsteps approaching)
Come on.

259
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,982
(tense music)

260
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,904
- Ah, ah, oh.
(breathing heavily)

261
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,286
- That man, it's
great uncle Tsushou.

262
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,334
- (sighs) I can't believe
someone like him could ever...

263
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,295
(breathing heavily)

264
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,840
I am not going to die
here, I've come this far.

265
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,050
Just a little further

266
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,385
and everything will
be within my grasp.

267
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,430
(breathing heavily)

268
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,142
(tense music)

269
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,435
- Lord Tsushou.

270
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,188
I've come to deliver the
item you were promised.

271
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,566
Here's the ring that
marks the bearer

272
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,360
as the head of the Sa clan.

273
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,486
- Huh?

274
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,403
- (gasps)

275
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,571
- Ah, ah, huh?

276
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,537
(breathing heavily)

277
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,331
What's the meaning of this?

278
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,333
- Normally, it is the
pride of a merchant

279
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,045
to meet any request from his
customer, no matter how big.

280
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,507
However, this is one
request I cannot meet.

281
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,009
As a member of a family that
has confronted generations

282
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,513
of Sa clan tyranny and a clan
of proud government officials

283
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,599
determined to uphold the law
without yielding to others,

284
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,351
as a member of the Sai clan,

285
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,352
this is my response
to your request.

286
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,604
- (grunts)

287
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,441
- All the mayors and
officials of Sa province

288
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,443
have already entered
Korin, bringing with them

289
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,197
the evidence to condemn
Sa clan once and for all.

290
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,573
- What?

291
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,201
- In particular, officials
Ensei Ro and Yushun Tei

292
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,412
have already begun
to make their move.

293
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,539
They have put a stop to
the anticipated riots

294
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,208
you instigated in Korin
before they even began.

295
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,544
The official military
officers of Sa province

296
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,587
have joined those of
the merchant's guild.

297
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,589
They will descend on the
gathered clan members

298
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,592
to formally arrest and
detain every one of them.

299
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,053
- (laughs)

300
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,352
So I suppose you're intending
to tie them up in ropes.

301
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,357
Go ahead and try binding
corpses and dragging them away.

302
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,692
- What did you say?
- Hmm?

303
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,527
- Oh.

304
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,239
- Hmm, hmm.

305
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,576
It's getting close to the time
of the selection ceremony.

306
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,453
All those fools who are obsessed

307
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,496
about how pure the
family line was

308
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,083
or how we'd be tainted by
blood from outside the clan,

309
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,501
they were all a nuisance.

310
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:27,255
I was planning to use the
ceremony to clean house.

311
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,675
Just like him, just like
my older brother Enjun did.

312
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,761
- You're not serious?

313
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,387
- (gasps)

314
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:39,434
- (laughs)
(footsteps pattering)

315
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,106
- Quick, we have to hurry,
we must notify Governor To

316
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,649
and Lieutenant Governor
Ro immediately.

317
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,693
- Wait a moment. (gasps)

318
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,323
- (breathing heavily)

319
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,161
(gasps and grunts)

320
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,586
- Lord Tsushou Sa once details
of your crimes are made clear

321
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,546
I'll decide what
will become of you.

322
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,549
If you have any pride as
a member of the Sa clan,

323
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,468
please wait right here.

324
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,428
I will finish what
I have to do first

325
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,472
before I have you arrested.

326
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,099
(gentle music)

327
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,685
I'll get a doctor,
you mustn't move.

328
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,313
- We can arrange for a doctor

329
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,440
but it may already be too late.

330
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,193
- Yes, I know that, but still.

331
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,279
- Thank you very
much, Lady Shuurei.

332
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,031
- Huh?
- Hmm?

333
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,158
- You've shown concern
for great uncle Tsushou,

334
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,536
even to what may be
his very last moment.

335
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,788
I want to thank you for your
kindness and compassion,

336
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,747
Governor Hong.

337
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:47,335
- Lady Shunki, Governor Hong.

338
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,839
- Hmm?

339
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,549
- I have to admit, you've
made a magnificent start

340
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,551
at being governor
of this province.

341
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,430
- (chuckles)

342
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,518
Mr. Shou Sai, will you please
attend the selection ceremony?

343
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,687
I'll be going along
with Lady Shunki.

344
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,188
- Very well.

345
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,399
Here, please take this.

346
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,112
Governor To had me
hold onto it for you.

347
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,655
With this seal
returned to your hands,

348
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,741
you'll be a governor of
Sa province once again

349
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,202
both in name and in
deed as you should be.

350
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,746
- Thank you very much
for bringing the seal

351
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,247
back to me, Mr. Sai,

352
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,668
and I owe you an apology
for suspecting you.

353
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,337
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,756
- It was only right,
you wouldn't be doing
your job properly

355
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,633
if you believed everyone
and anyone so easily.

356
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,845
You should be especially
cautious of greedy men like me.

357
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,722
Well then, good luck to you.

358
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:41,931
(footsteps pattering)

359
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,225
- We'll be sure to
catch up with you later.

360
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,686
Well, I guess that means you
and I should get going too.

361
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,604
Are you ready?

362
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,649
- This is what I came here to
do from the very beginning.

363
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,819
(footsteps pattering)

364
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,615
- Huh?

365
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,616
- What is it, Lady Shuurei?

366
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,285
(gentle music)

367
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,704
- I'm not sure.

368
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,252
(Tsushou gasping)

369
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:18,551
- Elder brother, Enjun,
if only I'd been blessed

370
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,346
with a little more luck
and talent like you.

371
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,141
- [Stranger] You fool.

372
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,559
- Huh?

373
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,604
- You think it was
only luck and talent?

374
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,607
Did you think Enjun climbed
that high on that alone?

375
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:33,483
- What?

376
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,026
Who the heck are you?

377
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,612
And how do you know anything
about my older brother, Enjun,

378
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,488
or me?

379
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,201
(grunts) Well, at this point
in time, I don't really care

380
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,244
who you might be.

381
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,289
- If Enjun had had as much
luck and talent as you thought,

382
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,291
then he would never have
had to struggle so hard

383
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,835
in his life.

384
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:56,673
Over thorns, on red hot
iron, or through frozen snow,

385
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,177
he was the type of man who
would willingly walk barefoot

386
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:01,845
through it.

387
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,182
I've never known any other
man as foolish as he.

388
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,894
If there was anything he
possessed in abundance,

389
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,188
it would be the true
kindness of his heart

390
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,649
and his unwavering perseverance.

391
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,484
Even if he were
covered in wounds,

392
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,528
he would never utter
a single complaint.

393
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,321
He wouldn't even
glance down at them,

394
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,533
but would proceed down the path
that he himself believed in.

395
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,913
- (grunts) Elder brother.

396
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,749
- The hour's grown too late.

397
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,501
Enjun no longer has time
left to spare for you.

398
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,503
That's why I've
come at his request,

399
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,756
to see your final
moments in this world.

400
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,634
- Oh. (grunts)

401
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,888
- On that dark day, you
saw everything, didn't you?

402
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,474
Are you really
unable to remember

403
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,391
what Eiki said to him then?

404
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:52,687
(Tsushou breathing heavily)

405
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,814
(gasping)

406
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,529
- This isn't your fault,
don't you understand?

407
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,323
None of this is your fault.

408
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,658
Why is it necessary
for you alone

409
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,911
to carry everything on
your shoulders, Enjun?

410
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,416
- (gasps)

411
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,544
- You were mistaken
from the very beginning.

412
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,632
There's no way that someone
like you, who never tried

413
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,718
to understand anything,
could ever surpass Enjun.

414
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,388
Even though that idiot
tried with all his heart

415
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,722
to protect everything.

416
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,601
- But, I... But I...

417
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,481
(whooshing sound)

418
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,825
Huh, Enjun, brother.

419
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,916
(Tsushou falling to ground)

420
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,961
(crickets chirping)

421
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,802
(air whooshing)

422
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,435
- There's no use in crying
over spilled milk, is there?

423
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,604
It's all too late now,
all because you insisted

424
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,816
in doing the unnecessary but
right thing to the very end,

425
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:21,818
Enjun.

426
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,571
(gentle upbeat music)

427
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,781
- [Narrator] The start
of the selection ceremony

428
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,617
for the head of the Sa
clan was drawing close.

429
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,954
As every person on
all sides run headlong

430
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,622
toward their respective goals,

431
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:38,418
Shuurei and Shunki began to
follow the dark path before them

432
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,045
in search of Kokujun Sa.

433
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,089
(footsteps echoing)

434
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,558
(singing in foreign language)

435
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,630
(upbeat music)

436
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,798
- We're in the courtyard
shrine of the Sa clan

437
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,258
where the eight colored
enlightened ones

438
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,592
are supposed to be worshiped.

439
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,678
Is Mr. Kokujun locked
up inside here?

440
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,472
I have a really bad
feeling about this.

441
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,433
But all right, I'm going in.
