1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:09,217
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,141
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,895
(gentle music)

4
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,689
- [Narrator] As the time
arrives when the breeze

5
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,692
begins to carry the first scent
of the summer's beginning,

6
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,444
Shurei's first ever
departure from Shi Province

7
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,238
is only two days away.

8
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,740
(birds chirping)

9
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,617
- Lord Kouyuu, here you go.

10
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,577
I made a couple of
steamed buns with egg yolk

11
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,579
kneaded into the
sweet bean paste.

12
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,540
Have them while
they're still warm.

13
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,916
- Okay, thanks very much.

14
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,629
Guess it's probably
gonna be a long time

15
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,840
before I can enjoy your
homemade steamed buns again.

16
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,676
- Would you like me to
teach you how to make them?

17
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,885
- Yeah.

18
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,762
Oh, by the way, there's
something important

19
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,639
I have to talk to you about.

20
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,224
- Huh?

21
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,727
(gentle music)

22
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,650
- [Kouyuu] It's about
what happened one year ago

23
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,985
when you were taken hostage.

24
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,531
- I was poisoned, held captive

25
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,366
at the Ministry of the
Enlightened One's cave,

26
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,369
then rescued by his majesty,

27
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,913
but that's all I remember
about the incident, really.

28
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,458
At the time, no one was willing
to tell me the whole truth

29
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,293
about what was
actually going on.

30
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,670
So I assumed the
subject was taboo,

31
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,630
and didn't ask any
questions about it.

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,258
- Well, now you're an official.

33
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,552
That means you'll no longer
need to be protected.

34
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,430
So I'll tell you the
truth, if you wish.

35
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,265
- Mhmm.

36
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,480
- That incident was all part
of a conspiracy by Enjun Sa,

37
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,273
the late Advisor Sa.

38
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,566
- Huh?

39
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,902
- He wanted to rise
above Advisor Sou.

40
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,279
In order to achieve that,
he attempted to eliminate

41
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,698
his majesty and put
in a different king,

42
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,575
but we were able to
find out about his plan

43
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,287
from an unexpected
source, from Karin.

44
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,747
(Shurei gasps)

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,999
Karin loved Enjun Sa
with all her heart.

46
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,586
After you entered
the royal palace,

47
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,546
his majesty changed
for the better,

48
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,839
so quite likely Advisor Sa

49
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,717
found your presence
bothersome to his plans.

50
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,804
That's why Karin, despite not
having been ordered to do so,

51
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:45,350
took it upon herself to
help him, by poisoning you.

52
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,312
Were you aware
that was the case?

53
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,730
- No.

54
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,899
- [Kouyuu] But she was
likely hesitating about it.

55
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,318
As a result, her actions
were very obvious.

56
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,027
- But I...

57
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,532
I was completely unaware
of what she was doing.

58
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,660
I never once suspected
Karin was behind this.

59
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,662
- She returned to Sa
Province soon after that,

60
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,497
and now Ensei's
brought her back here.

61
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,000
Apparently, she wants to
apologize to you in person.

62
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,336
Decide for yourself whether
or not you'll see her.

63
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,464
- Yes.

64
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,344
(people chattering)

65
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,681
- Hey Shurei, is
something bothering you?

66
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,974
- Oh no, I was just wondering

67
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,768
what sort of place
Sa Province might be.

68
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,728
- I see.

69
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,354
That's a good question.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,982
What I've heard is
that it's a territory

71
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,443
where the Sa Clan has
tried to seize true power.

72
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,069
The previous
governor, Mr. Ensei,

73
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,780
said that they sent a number
of assassins after him.

74
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,407
Even if we had multiple lives,

75
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,908
we still might not survive this.

76
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,661
- Geez, you say that
so casually, Eigetsu.

77
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,039
- But no matter how bad
it is, someone's gotta go,

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,999
and in this case, it
just happens to be us.

79
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,375
It's as simple as that.

80
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,461
Cheer up, Shurei.

81
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,879
Let's do our best together.

82
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,965
- I sometimes forget
how strong you are.

83
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,678
(shrill flute music)

84
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,096
- [Both] Ryuuren!

85
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,682
- The song I just played
was to celebrate my reunion

86
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,184
with my kindred spirits.

87
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,644
- Hey you, why did you skip
out on the initiation ceremony?

88
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,689
- The wind invited me
to go on a journey.

89
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,815
- A journey?

90
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,192
What were you thinking, Ryuuren?

91
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,610
- Now, now, Shurei.

92
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,779
I'm sure Mr. Ryuuren
had a very good reason

93
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,905
for going or something.

94
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,198
- No he didn't!

95
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,616
- But never mind that.

96
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,201
Let's go buy
groceries for tonight.

97
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,203
Will you join us
too, Mr. Ryuuren?

98
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,830
- Yes, I'll have sweetly
sour sweet and sour pork.

99
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,624
- [Shurei] You're actually
putting in an order?

100
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,833
- [Eigetsu] Mm, yeah.

101
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,919
I want some sweet and
sour pork too, please.

102
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,632
- Very nice.

103
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,676
Such a lovely,
sweetly sour scent.

104
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,888
- Honestly, who's that
peacock think he is?

105
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,889
- [Ensei] Hi.

106
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,224
- Oh, Mr. Ensei.

107
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,684
- Princess, I hate
to bother you,

108
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,976
seeing as you're so busy,

109
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,561
but I brought that
traveling companion

110
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,729
I told you about before.

111
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,439
Would you mind meeting her now?

112
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,235
- Sure, okay.

113
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,904
(gentle music)

114
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,701
Sorry to keep you waiting.

115
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,792
- It's been a long time
since we last saw each other.

116
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,586
- Yes, it's been a
while, hasn't it Karin?

117
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,797
- No, I can't have the
consort make tea for me!

118
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,881
Here, let me do it.

119
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,592
- [Ensei] Ah, that's hot!

120
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,553
- [Karin] Oh no, I'm
so sorry Lord Ensei.

121
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,013
- [Shurei] Are you all right?

122
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,888
(Ensei chuckles)

123
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,806
- I'm fine.

124
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,807
I'll just go chill it in water.

125
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,813
- I remember the last time
I made a blunder like that.

126
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,106
I think it was on the first day

127
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,108
I met and served
you, Consort Hong.

128
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,776
- You can call me Shurei.

129
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,820
- Oh yes, I beg your pardon.

130
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,950
Consort Hong, oh I
mean Lady Shurei?

131
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,120
I understand that you're to
become governor of Sa Province.

132
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:52,996
- Yes.

133
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,958
Oh, how are things
in Sa Province?

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,502
- Actually, they're quite
unsettled right now.

135
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,129
One of the reasons
I came to Kiyou City

136
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,131
was to bring some petitions.

137
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,632
- Petitions, what do you mean?

138
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,967
- Well, back home in Sa,

139
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,595
I was working as a maid
in waiting to Lady Eiki,

140
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,513
the wife of Lord Enjun Sa,

141
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,515
but at the moment, she's
under strict house arrest,

142
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,100
and her granddaughter
Lady Shunki

143
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,186
has been forced
to go into hiding.

144
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,065
- [Shurei] That's quite
a serious situation.

145
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,526
- Lady Shurei, are you really
planning to go to Sa Province?

146
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,070
- Huh, yes I am.

147
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,655
- But that's way too
much to ask of anybody!

148
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,574
Did his majesty
order this of you?

149
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,117
Is this his way of
getting back at you

150
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,869
for leaving the royal residence?

151
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:33,953
- You're wrong.

152
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,080
It's not like that at all.

153
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,539
He entrusted me with his hope

154
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,999
for the future of Sa Province,

155
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,959
along with Eigetsu,
the other new governor.

156
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,836
- But why deliberately
send you somewhere

157
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,546
he knows is gonna be dangerous?

158
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,882
- I'm sure he believes
this move is the best,

159
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,925
so I trust him.

160
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,426
But never mind that, Karin.

161
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,304
Wasn't there something else
you wanted to talk to me about?

162
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,599
- Well, I, I was...

163
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,686
I was hoping you would
allow me to accompany you

164
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,021
on your trip to Sa Province.

165
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,898
I'm sure there will
be many dangers,

166
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,983
some of which you
might not realize now,

167
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,694
so I wish to protect you,

168
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,821
even if it means my life.

169
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,199
Is it a bad idea?

170
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,575
- I wouldn't say no, but--

171
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,576
- Please think it over.

172
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,786
I promise to do my best,

173
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,788
and also there are many other

174
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,707
important things I
wanna talk to you about,

175
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,126
but I'll leave those
for another time.

176
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,043
- All right.

177
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,050
- In that case, I'll take my
leave for today then, my lady.

178
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,928
(birds chirping)

179
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,264
- Karin.

180
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,725
Did you say what you needed to?

181
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,978
- I couldn't bring
myself to tell her.

182
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,187
- I see.

183
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,397
You know, now that
I think about it,

184
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,232
this is the very spot
where I met Princess

185
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,608
for the very first time.

186
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,235
I had collapsed by
the side of the road,

187
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,778
and she took me in and fed me,

188
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,281
even though she had no
idea of who the heck I was.

189
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,074
- That's very much like her.

190
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,367
- I'll say this about Princess,

191
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,286
she's always open-minded.

192
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,038
Be frank with her,
and I'll bet she'll be

193
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,914
more understanding
than you expect.

194
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,292
- Yes.

195
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,884
- I'm so glad you're
all right, Mr. Ryuuren.

196
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,011
Even though you came in second,

197
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,055
you didn't come to the
initiation ceremony,

198
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,765
so I was worried about you.

199
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,433
Although Shurei said
there was absolutely

200
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,934
nothing to worry about.

201
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,103
- Kindred spirit.

202
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,231
- What is it?

203
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,358
- As always, your cooking

204
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,110
is so very delectable
on the palate.

205
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,111
- Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

206
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,946
- So I have a proposal for you.

207
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,448
- Yes?

208
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,367
- Won't you change your mind
and become my personal chef?

209
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,993
- No, not a chance.

210
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,287
- Ah, but it was
really something

211
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,081
during those final
exams, wasn't it?

212
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,957
You ended up creating
many new legends,

213
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,668
didn't you Mr. Ryuuren?

214
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,420
- You mean like the
cursed 13th building?

215
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,380
- Well, yeah.

216
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,839
- Wow, I never knew that.

217
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,175
So the preparatory dorm I
stayed in was actually cursed?

218
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,301
- Nope, wrong.

219
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,719
People started calling it that

220
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,805
because you were staying there.

221
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,974
One after another, the examinees
became mentally disturbed

222
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,393
thanks to the sound
of your flute.

223
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,103
Because of your
silly conversations,

224
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,231
seven officials in charge
of the exams resigned.

225
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,857
- And yet despite all of that,

226
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,694
he was still able
to pass his bogen.

227
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,237
- General Ran was
regretting the fact

228
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,364
that he didn't keep you
locked up in his own residence

229
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,241
until just before
the exams began.

230
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,034
- Silly brother number
four's residence

231
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,370
is pointlessly large, and
unnecessarily glittery.

232
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,330
It doesn't suit
my tastes one bit.

233
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,957
In contrast, this place,

234
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,459
given the obvious signs
of vain efforts of repair,

235
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,461
the nice degree of
sprouting weeds,

236
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,797
and last but not least,
the self-sufficient spirit

237
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,298
apparent in the backyard garden?

238
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,510
Everything gets a passing grade.

239
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,012
- No one asked for your opinion!

240
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,388
- Kindred spirit two.

241
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,806
- Yes?

242
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,224
- I wish you'd provide
dinner conversation

243
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,059
that is more enjoyable and
appropriate for a meal.

244
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,269
- Enjoyable?

245
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,271
Let me think, well
speaking of curses,

246
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,023
I've heard there's
a ghost that appears

247
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,858
near the Ministry of
Enlightened One's cave.

248
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,067
- What, a ghost?

249
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,068
- While it's still
not appropriate,

250
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,528
I'm interested in hearing more.

251
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,905
- Apparently a number
of people have seen it.

252
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,075
- I would very much
like to hunt it.

253
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,785
Let's do so tonight.

254
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,163
Let us assemble once
more after dark,

255
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,373
kindred spirit
number one and two.

256
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,876
At the ministry.

257
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,211
Well then, I shall see
you both later tonight.

258
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,838
- Hey, wait a minute!

259
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,341
(plucky music)

260
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,845
- [Eigetsu] We're ghost hunting

261
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,221
before we leave for our post?

262
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,224
(Shurei sighs)

263
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,853
{\an8}(plucky music)

264
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,277
- Honestly, nothing
good ever comes

265
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,945
from dealing with
that silly man.

266
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,448
- Maybe, but you seem to be
in much better spirits now.

267
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,908
- Huh?

268
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,077
- You were looking a
little bit down before.

269
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,162
- Wait a minute,
you're not suggesting

270
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,915
that Mr. Crazy Peacock said
we should go ghost hunting,

271
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,375
just so I would
cheer up, are you?

272
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,543
- It's certainly possible.

273
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,461
- Who goes there?

274
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,882
Oh, Official Hong
and Official To.

275
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,133
I didn't recognize you.

276
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,844
Do you mind telling us
what you're doing here

277
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,054
at this time of night?

278
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:01,846
- Well.

279
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,808
- [Ryuuki] We
asked them to come.

280
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,935
We have things to discuss
with them in private

281
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,269
regarding their assignment.

282
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,565
- Yes sir.
- Please excuse us.

283
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,983
- [Guard] Goodnight then.

284
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,487
(both sigh)

285
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,031
- [Ryuuki] Why are you
here at this time of night?

286
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:20,949
- Well, see--

287
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,117
- A tryst?

288
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,326
- No way!

289
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,620
- Do you have to deny
it so quickly, Shurei?

290
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,956
- What about you, what
are you doing around here?

291
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,542
- I couldn't sleep, so
I was taking a walk.

292
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,961
And you two?

293
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:33,837
- [Shurei] Oh, right.

294
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,963
Have you seen Ryuuren?

295
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,506
- You mean Ryuuren Ran?

296
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,383
No, I gather his whereabouts
have been unknown

297
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,218
since he missed the
initiation ceremony.

298
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,388
- Well, he was eating sweet and
sour pork today at my house.

299
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,389
- He was?

300
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,890
- He invited us out here.

301
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,851
He wanted to try
hunting a ghost.

302
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,102
- A ghost?

303
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,229
- In any case, we're
supposed to meet Ryuuren

304
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,523
in front of the Ministry of
the Enlightened One's cave.

305
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,192
We need to get there before
he causes a commotion.

306
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,865
Wait!

307
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,283
Don't you dare play that flute!

308
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,492
- You're pretty
late getting here,

309
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,202
kindred spirits
number one and two.

310
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,079
- Wait just a minute,
how did you manage

311
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,957
to get into the palace
without getting in trouble?

312
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,209
- When I showed them the
Ran Clan travel pass,

313
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,210
the guards let me through.

314
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,254
- Ryuuren Ran, I
haven't seen you

315
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,174
since the exams.

316
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,509
- I passed on your message
to my elder brothers.

317
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,011
- What does he mean?

318
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,013
- Two days after the
exams, I went to visit him.

319
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,306
I asked him to do me a favor

320
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,266
and convey a message
from me to his brothers,

321
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,893
the heads of the Ran Clan.

322
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,355
- The king himself went to
see an individual examinee?

323
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,190
- I've heard that while they
have a great deal of power,

324
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,068
the Ran Clan doesn't involve
itself with politics.

325
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,196
Perhaps his majesty was only
giving them his regards.

326
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,532
- While there was that, his
exam paper was very impressive,

327
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,201
so I wanted to meet him.

328
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,078
That aside, what
are you going to do

329
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,454
when you find this ghost?

330
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,706
- Naturally, we're
going to exorcize it.

331
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,333
- Yes, but how?

332
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,126
(shrill flute music)
(all groan)

333
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,046
- Look, I already told you,
stop playing that flute!

334
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,381
- [Ryuuki] It doesn't
seem like this ghost

335
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,049
is going to show up, does it?

336
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,550
- Rumor has it that it appears

337
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,386
around the Ministry of
Enlightened One's cave,

338
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,638
but it is only a rumor.

339
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,058
- They say that the wise
man does not court danger.

340
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,060
Why don't we give
up ghost hunting

341
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,228
and head back to my quarters?

342
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,230
I'll have a late
night snack prepared.

343
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,315
- Good idea, thank you
very much for offering.

344
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,192
Ryuuren, that okay with you?

345
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,360
- Well then, in that case,

346
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,153
we can tell ghost
stories instead.

347
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,656
(tender music)

348
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,292
- [Ryuuki] Yes, I've heard
those rumors about a ghost

349
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,545
appearing at the Ministry of
the Enlightened One's cave.

350
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,838
- It's quite mysterious.

351
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,090
I remember that I always
used to tell the kids

352
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,551
at the temple school
about how there were eight

353
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,720
Enlightened Ones in
our country long ago.

354
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,263
- The eight colored
Enlightened Ones?

355
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,597
- Yes, I've always
found that children

356
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,600
love those kinds of strange
and magical stories.

357
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,394
Let's see, blue, purple,

358
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,479
red, green, yellow,

359
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,106
white, black, and brown.

360
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,274
Those were their colors.

361
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,359
- When I was a child,
I used to pretend

362
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,403
I was one of the eight
colored Enlightened Ones.

363
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,071
- Oh, really?

364
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,614
- They say that even now, each
of the eight Enlightened Ones

365
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,450
is living in
someone else's body.

366
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,784
- Someone else's body?

367
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,203
Hey, wouldn't it be nice
if the Enlightened Ones

368
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,497
were doing that even now,
and helping our country?

369
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,082
- It would?

370
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,500
- Yes.

371
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,338
When I was a child, I spent
a lot of time being ill,

372
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,381
but after my mother died,
I became much better

373
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,300
and my health improved for good.

374
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,178
So from time to time,
I can't help but wonder

375
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,555
about whether Mother's
spirit might have entered me,

376
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,474
and that she's been helping me

377
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,768
and strengthening me
since that moment.

378
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,561
- I guess when you
think about it that way,

379
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,646
your mother is still
alive inside of you.

380
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,316
- It always gives me
strength to think that.

381
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,612
Hey, there's one inside you
too, isn't there Eigetsu?

382
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,198
A helpful Enlightened One.

383
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,699
You're so nice and kind natured,

384
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,701
maybe Yougetsu was
born to help you out.

385
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,620
- You mean inside
kindred spirit number two

386
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,081
there's a kindred
spirit number 2.5?

387
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,791
- He only comes out
when he drinks alcohol.

388
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,085
- Please don't talk
about that, Shurei.

389
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,712
(Shurei giggles)

390
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,631
- [Ryuuren] Well, I
often run into mysterious

391
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,092
or frightening things
while I'm traveling.

392
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,593
For example, this happened once

393
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,221
while I took a room at a
small inn for the night.

394
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,223
I was fast asleep, when
suddenly I felt like

395
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,767
I was being watched,
and woke up immediately.

396
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,188
I opened my eyes, and there
I saw hundreds of eyes,

397
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,439
floating on the ceiling!

398
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,235
- Well, I'm not gonna
be sleeping tonight.

399
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,403
- On yet another night,

400
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,364
for some unknown
reason, there was a girl

401
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,699
sitting in the
corner of my room,

402
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,159
and her face, it was
the most frightening--

403
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,494
- No, stop it!

404
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,662
I'm afraid of the dark as it is,

405
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,288
you're just making it worse.

406
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,832
- On that note,
seeing how late it is,

407
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,417
we really should get going.

408
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,793
- You're right.
- Not yet!

409
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,753
I still have many
stories to tell.

410
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,422
- [Shurei] You don't
need to tell anymore.

411
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,590
- [Ryuuki] You're leaving
me behind and going home?

412
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,593
- [Eigetsu] I wonder if his
majesty will be all right?

413
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,846
- [Shurei] So do I, but we
can't just stay overnight.

414
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,472
- [Ryuuren] Before we
leave, I'll play a melody

415
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,391
to disperse any
evil spirits around.

416
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,268
- Wait!
(shrill flute music)

417
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,146
(Shurei groaning)

418
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,149
- Please stop
playing that flute.

419
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,609
- Oh, we're sorry.

420
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,571
- You haven't changed
one bit, Ryuuren Ran.

421
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,241
- Huh?
(eerie music)

422
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,286
- And you must be
Eigetsu To, correct?

423
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,454
- Yes.

424
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,455
- [Man] Who could
have ever imagined

425
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,581
that you would've been chosen

426
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,416
to serve as Sa
Province's governor?

427
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,420
- [Shurei] I beg your
pardon sir, but you are?

428
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,880
- Those who love this country

429
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,383
have the protection of the
eight colored Enlightened Ones.

430
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,844
(all gasping)

431
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,731
- It, it really appeared.

432
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,316
- You're not kidding.

433
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,777
- Kindred spirits
number one and two.

434
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,612
We shall meet again.

435
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,365
- What do you mean, you're
not gonna exorcize it?

436
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,659
- The wise man does not
court danger, remember?

437
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,704
(footsteps tapping)

438
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,546
(shrill flute music)

439
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,009
While I had thought to
disperse evil spirits

440
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,260
by playing my flute,

441
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,637
it seems that when I play,

442
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,222
evil spirits appear.

443
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,891
- I have a favor to ask of you.

444
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,976
For the sake of the
new co-governors,

445
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,645
I want you to take
these as a gift,

446
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,689
and go visit them at some point.

447
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,525
I believe you're in the
best position to do so.

448
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,777
While I understand you won't
do anything for me personally,

449
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,863
I'm sure it will be a different
matter if it's for them.

450
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,699
If you feel up to it,
I would appreciate it

451
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,368
if you wrote to me regarding
the situation there.

452
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,245
- Without telling
my foolish brother?

453
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,707
Elder brother Shuuei
lacks trust, I see.

454
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,667
- On the contrary, I
trust him completely,

455
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,919
but unlike you, Shurei
can never fully escape

456
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,254
the yoke of the Ran Clan,

457
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,880
and I do not want them involved.

458
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,465
I want someone who has no ties

459
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,343
to the wishes of the
Seven Noble Clans.

460
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,345
- Your intentions are
transparent to the leaders

461
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,015
of the Ran Clan, my
three eldest brothers.

462
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,391
- That doesn't matter.

463
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,393
They say that after you
took the name Ryuuren,

464
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,729
your three elder brothers
took the clan leadership

465
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,689
and divided it
between themselves.

466
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,065
No doubt the reason
they did this

467
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,317
was so that you would not
have to take that role

468
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,902
before having the
chance to see the world,

469
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,446
and the people in it.

470
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,948
That's why it's important that
I'm asking this favor of you,

471
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,659
the man for whom the Ran
family cares so much.

472
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,414
- Those gifts alone
lack refinement

473
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,374
for the occasion of
visiting friends.

474
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,917
I'll see them in the
summer, or early autumn,

475
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,003
so I'll add a few pears.

476
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,798
- The court can manage,
even without the Ran Clan.

477
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,467
Of course, your
family is important,

478
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,885
but in this case,
it's not a problem

479
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,471
to have that particular
dragon remain asleep.

480
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,014
However, should
that dragon awaken

481
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,932
and lend us its
power once again,

482
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,977
I would be more than happy to
take that hand of friendship.

483
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,645
- I accept your request.

484
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,648
- [Sairen] Ryuuren
Ran, do you really

485
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,859
have no intention of
becoming an official?

486
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,110
- No.

487
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,779
- What about becoming
leader of the Ran Clan?

488
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,408
- In simple terms, it's my
belief that I must not wish

489
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,993
for that sort of
thing in my life.

490
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,040
(shrill flute music)

491
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,714
(water trickling)

492
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,011
- [Ryuuki] Big brother, you
didn't go home after all.

493
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,639
- I thought you would
probably come back,

494
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,641
but stop calling me big brother,

495
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,560
or else I'll start
being humble to you.

496
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,688
- All right, I'll
stop, I'll stop.

497
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,983
- So what sort of young
man is Ryuuren Ran?

498
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,653
Is he at all like General Ran?

499
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:37,987
- Yes he is.

500
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,615
But he's much
deeper than Shuuei.

501
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,409
I know he's said
to be eccentric,

502
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,744
but he seemed normal to me.

503
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,663
And I couldn't help
but get the feeling

504
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,998
that even that
isn't the real him.

505
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,793
- Ryuuren Ran,
truly a young lord

506
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,837
reflecting the very clan itself.

507
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,840
(water trickling)

508
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,800
Well then, I'll be going.

509
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,886
- Big brother, take
care of Shurei for me.

510
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,812
Wait, let me walk by your
side a little longer.

511
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,023
I won't be able to see
you again for a while.

512
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,070
(birds chirping)

513
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,113
(Shurei yawns)

514
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,531
- Welcome home, you two.

515
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,033
You're awfully late.

516
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,201
You left a note saying only
that you'd gone to the palace.

517
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,953
I was so worried,
I couldn't sleep.

518
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,705
- Oh, I'm so sorry Father.

519
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,915
- I'm sorry to have
caused such concern.

520
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,168
- Also, we had a guest
come late in the evening

521
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,462
who stayed up and
waited with me.

522
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,671
- Karin?

523
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,714
- No.

524
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,091
(eerie music)

525
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,719
This is Kuro, he's
my younger brother.

526
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,929
In other words, he's
your uncle, Shurei.

527
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,473
- While I'm late in doing so,

528
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,559
I give you my congratulations
on passing the exams as tanka.

529
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,728
- Thank you very much, sir.

530
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,855
- Until now, older brother
Shou would not permit

531
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:56,191
those of the main house to
have any involvement with you.

532
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,860
However, things will be
different from here on.

533
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,779
You will need the help of
the main house to protect you

534
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,073
from the various plots
that will fall upon you.

535
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:07,077
As proxy clan leader, I share
responsibility to protect you.

536
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,704
The Hong Clan will
protect the path you take

537
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,872
with all its power.

538
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,083
- Mhmm.

539
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,628
(Shurei giggles)

540
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,547
(birds chirping)

541
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,132
- I doubt a single
person suspects

542
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,468
you have the real
clan ring, Sou.

543
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,222
I imagine you made
that fake ring,

544
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,598
and arranged for it to fall

545
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,475
into senior secretary
Sai's possession

546
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,603
to make his corrupt
activities known.

547
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,480
- [Sou] Well of course.

548
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:39,109
- Honestly, everything
happens just as you plan.

549
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,778
(eerie music)

550
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,119
- It's good to see
you again, Sou.

551
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,205
- I see you're much
younger as a ghost, Enjun.

552
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,665
- It's only natural.

553
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:57,210
Using this ring was the
easiest way to retain his soul.

554
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,962
- After this country
becomes stable,

555
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,715
the Sa Clan will only
become a problem.

556
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,217
I created the perfect
opportunity to deal with them,

557
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,885
and what do you do?

558
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,804
- Wait, then you're saying you
plotted to kill his majesty,

559
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,140
and Shurei just so you
could create an opportunity

560
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,684
to bring about the
downfall of the Sa Clan?

561
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,022
- But, no doubt the
new co-governors

562
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,899
will find a different
way to save Sa Province.

563
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,196
- So next, is Sa Province.

564
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,034
(gentle music)

565
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:35,081
- [Shurei] Tomorrow we
leave for Sa Province.

566
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,001
Whatever happens, I
have to do my best.

567
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:50,680
(singing in foreign language)

568
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,044
The time has finally
come to leave

569
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,213
for Sa Province as its governor.

570
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,258
I won't lose to the Sa Clan
and their interference.

571
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,885
Whatever happens, I'm
gonna force my way through.

572
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,263
I'm not gonna be
stopped that easily.
