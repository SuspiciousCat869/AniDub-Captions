1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,725
(intimate music in
foreign language)

2
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,641
(intimate music in foreign
language concludes)

3
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,650
- [Narrator] The sky was
clear and blue, however, the

4
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,528
weather is something that
changes all the time.

5
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,280
Rain may start to fall in
the moment you notice clouds

6
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,868
gathering and every now and
again a typhoon will come

7
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,744
sweeping in.

8
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,388
- You look puzzled Consort
Hong is something the matter?

9
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,724
- Shuzwai, I don't suppose
you've seen the ink stone case

10
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,641
I keep here.

11
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,019
- No.

12
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,689
- Excuse me, please. I
brought your tea, my lady.

13
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,274
- Kodene, perhaps you know.

14
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,651
Have you seen Consort Hong's
ink stone case anywhere?

15
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,488
- No, ma'am.

16
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,990
- It seems like a few
of my things have been

17
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,285
disappearing lately. I can't
find my embroidery needle

18
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,328
or my incense pouch, either.

19
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,664
- (gasp) I'm sure there around.

20
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,627
- Well, anyway, I'll
keep looking for
them a little longer.

21
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,923
- Voiceover: 'Hmm. This
is really strange.'

22
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,722
- Suai, have you determined
the composition of the poison

23
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,599
on those items I
gave you yesterday?

24
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,561
- According to the report I
received from Koiu and Dr. Toau,

25
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,023
the poison they are using is
getting stronger: an embroidery

26
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,692
needle, an incense pouch,
and now a ink stone case.

27
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,736
Anything they can get
their hands on, I guess.

28
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,030
- It's more than that. It's
almost like their asking us

29
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,491
to notice all these
poisoning attempts.

30
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,035
- It only seems obvious
to you, Your Majesty.

31
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,371
- It's just that this kind
of thing used to be an almost

32
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,414
a daily affair in the
palace in the past.

33
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,584
- (gasps with surprise)
You're lucky to have such a

34
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,461
heightened awareness of
the dangers around you.

35
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,672
It's what's kept you
safe, thus far, right?

36
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,508
- (silently acknowledges)

37
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,968
- Now then. What do you
intend to do about Suai--

38
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,553
- No need to worry.

39
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,514
I've been secretly giving her
a specially prepared anecdote

40
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,765
every night.

41
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,309
And what about the
source of this poison?

42
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,936
- It's coming from
the same place.

43
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,022
Nevertheless, it
is very strange.

44
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,358
Of all of Suai's things
the culprit chooses items

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,901
that are easily traced back.

46
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,362
- Let's not jump to
conclusions, just yet, please

47
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,531
investigate other
suspects, as well.

48
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,657
(a figure approaches)
- I understand.

49
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,409
- I'm counting on you.

50
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,369
- No problem. After
all I did accept

51
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,787
(footsteps nearing)
that lovely purple

52
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,123
Irish from you, didn't I?
(treats thumping floor)

53
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,583
- (surprised) Oh, hello, Suai.

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,504
- Oh, I made some
fried Sesame Dumplings,

55
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,797
but...

56
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,965
Compared to dumplings

57
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,425
flowers aren't the thing, right?

58
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,718
So, Sorry to interrupt you.

59
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,012
- What was that all about?

60
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,388
{\an8}(upbeat orchestral music)

61
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,806
- I would wager
she's uncomfortable,

62
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,099
because she still thinks
you're interested in men,

63
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,017
Your Majesty.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,061
- I'm afraid that if
I tell Suai the truth,

65
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,646
she'll run away from me.

66
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,690
- Looks to me like she
ran away from you, anyway.

67
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,449
- What's with those two?

68
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,368
Are they close enough to be
giving flowers to each other?

69
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,837
- Voiceover: 'That
is quite the outfit!'

70
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,881
- Oh, good afternoon.

71
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,885
- What are those round
objects you have there?

72
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,475
- There Sesame Dumplings.
Would you like one?

73
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,063
(sampling a Sesame Dumpling)
- (pleased) Um.

74
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:13,980
- How is it?

75
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,942
- An exquisite combination
of grainy sesame seeds,

76
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,944
the softness of sticky
rice, and the sweetness

77
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,613
of the red bean paste.

78
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,407
A triple tier, triple cheer
surprise for the palette.

79
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,206
- You know, a simple thank you

80
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,874
would still be nice to hear.

81
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:45,220
(appreciative flute music)

82
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,722
- Do you mind if
I ask a question?

83
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,767
Are you playing the flute
as a way of saying, thanks?

84
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,187
- If that is what you think or
feel when you listen to this

85
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,981
music, then that must
be it's true meaning.

86
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,569
- Oh (laughing) pardon me.
What is you name?

87
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,737
- My name is--

88
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,781
- - [General Rahn] Ruidan!

89
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,116
- General Rahn?

90
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,910
- Long time no see, silly
brother number four.

91
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,161
- Silly brother what?

92
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,747
- That's what I call my
pathetic older brother.

93
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,583
- Surai, this is my younger
brother, Riu-Rin Rahn

94
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,585
{\an8}- Younger brother?

95
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,630
- Enlighten me. What are
you doing here in Kio City?

96
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,590
- A wanderer has no objective.

97
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,135
(Surai exclaims in disbelief)
- Oh, good Lord!

98
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,803
How on earth did you get
in here in the first place?

99
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,639
- What? You mean he bypassed
all the palace security?

100
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,807
- He's always had the ability

101
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,809
to sneak into anyplace he wants.

102
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,769
It's frustrating, I
can tell you that.

103
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:36,688
- What the?

104
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,814
He's gone!

105
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,732
- Damn it!

106
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,610
- I hear that Surai Rahn and
Koiu Lee have both accepted

107
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,486
flowers.

108
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,950
- You must be very proud of
yourself, Zhou, everything seems

109
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,828
to be progressing
as you anticipated.

110
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,830
- Yes. For the time being.

111
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,248
(startling flute music)

112
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,166
what's that?

113
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,630
- I just heard the sound
of the flute over there.

114
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,132
- We can't afford to
let him wonder around

115
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,718
unsupervised like this.
Come on, let's hurry.

116
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,846
- How the heck did I
get roped into joining

117
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,765
this little search
party of there's?

118
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,644
- Oh look? It seems
that I've won, again.

119
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,647
(groans of losers)

120
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,651
(nagging flute music)
- You bastard!

121
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,904
Let's have just one more round.

122
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,655
- Wait! There he is.

123
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,824
- Please excuse us, my lords.
- What is it?

124
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,659
- Oh hi, silly
brother number four.

125
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,708
- Just what have you been doing

126
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,168
with the three
elders of the court?

127
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,878
- I was concerned
that their old age

128
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,171
was keeping them
from having fun,

129
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,006
so I taught them
how to play cards.

130
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,174
(elders protesting)

131
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,676
- How did this
come about anyway?

132
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,303
- I was complaining about the
awful noise he was making,

133
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,014
and he said he would only
stop if we won a game of cards

134
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:53,932
against him.

135
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,812
- [General Rahn] Right!

136
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,732
We are sorry for my
younger brother's behavior,

137
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:03,900
please forgive us.

138
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,738
- Come on, we're going.
- Not so fast!

139
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,198
- One more game.

140
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,366
- Let's go.

141
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,826
- We can't handle
the losing note.

142
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,829
- We will excuse ourself now.

143
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,250
(elders yelling in protest)

144
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,587
- You shouldn't spoil
a game like that,

145
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,880
silly brother number four.

146
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,425
- To get a sigh
like that from you,

147
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,969
this younger brother of yours
must really be something.

148
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,929
- I'd ask him to go
away, but there's no way

149
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,056
he'll just up and
leave obediently.

150
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,933
- Well, since he's
here for now anyway,

151
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,977
why don't we show him
around the palace?

152
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,985
- This is a painting of the
eight-color enlightened ones.

153
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,611
- I can tell by looking at it.

154
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,990
- It's impossible to hold a
conversation with this guy.

155
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,367
- Why the peculiar
younger brother, huh?

156
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,119
I hear he's just
been mostly wandering

157
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,872
from place-to-place playing
cards like he was just now.

158
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,207
- Wow! Intrepid, isn't he?

159
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,002
- But that guy is Riu Rin Rahn.

160
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,087
Only a true genius of the
Rahn family is allowed

161
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,672
to carry that name.

162
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,258
I'm the fourth child and have
three elder brothers above me,

163
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,094
but the only one deemed worthy
to carry the name of Riu Rin

164
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,305
was him, the youngest son.

165
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,974
- Even over his
four elder brothers?

166
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,810
- My younger brother is
odd, but the Rahn Clan

167
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,354
expects great things.

168
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,814
Still, he's always wandering
and even if you can catch him

169
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,316
you can hardly talk to him.

170
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,734
- Interesting.

171
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,985
If he's really that
difficult to control,

172
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,738
I imagine he wouldn't
easily be manipulated.

173
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,239
- Be that as it may,

174
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,325
the Rahn clan considers my
younger brother indispensable.

175
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,209
- What do you
think you're doing?

176
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,337
- I've made up my mind, I'm
going to stay here tonight.

177
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,005
This is where I want to sleep.

178
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,175
- I'm not sure I want to
know the answer to this,

179
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,260
but where were you
staying last night?

180
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,138
- I was counting the
stars as I fell asleep.

181
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,973
- So you camped out, huh?

182
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,059
- Riu Rin, no matter what
your reasons this is no place

183
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,227
for you to sleep.

184
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,978
Why don't you stay with
your elder brother--

185
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,355
- There's no way I'm
going to spend the night

186
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,024
with a tasteless,
unrefined man like him.

187
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,401
- And then how about my place?

188
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,028
- And make Lord Showka
have to deal with this guy?

189
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,324
- Then that case, Koiu,
your place will do.

190
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,701
- What!

191
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,369
- That's a wonderful
idea. Please Lord Koiu?

192
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,374
- Oh, all right, if I must.

193
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,053
- There's nothing,
but books here.

194
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,014
There isn't a shred
of taste in this room.

195
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,140
- Shut up!

196
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,483
- Oh, Your Majesty?

197
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,944
- Advisor Sau.

198
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,320
- Would you happen
to be on your way

199
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,197
to Counsel Tong's
chambers, again, tonight?

200
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,866
- I am.

201
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,868
- It pleases me greatly to
see the two of you growing

202
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,038
so close to each other,
but give this some thought:

203
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,330
I have a granddaughter.

204
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,499
She's just as pretty
as Consort Hong and

205
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,918
has an equally
lovely personality.

206
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,964
- I'm satisfied with
Suai, thank you.

207
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,382
There is no need for any others.

208
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,927
- My. Consort Hong
certainly has you smitten.

209
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,179
- What do you mean by that?

210
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,348
- It means you've fallen
head over heels in love.

211
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,059
Well, fare enough. If you
happened to change your mind

212
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,353
on this subject, don't
hesitate to let me know.

213
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,868
- Suai, I'm coming in.

214
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,328
- Sure go ahead.

215
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,956
(door booms open)

216
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,001
(door bangs closed)

217
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,846
- [Suai] Liaukee?

218
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,056
- Ah, yes, what is it?

219
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,100
- I'm going to read for
a little while longer,

220
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,851
so go on to bed without me.

221
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,607
- You're more determined
to study than I am

222
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,483
and I'm the king.

223
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,984
- I'm no genius,

224
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,071
so I have to do this, but
they always say that a genius

225
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,490
can't better a
hard-working man. Right?

226
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,492
- That's very true.
If you were a man,

227
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,452
I'm sure you'd make
a wonderful official.

228
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,583
- When I was a child,
it was my dream to take

229
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,962
the National Civil Service exam
and become a court official,

230
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,464
but thanks to me
entering the royal harem,

231
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,883
I have all these
opportunities to study

232
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,927
and reflect on the
affairs of the country.

233
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,887
I feel like I'm allowed
to be a little closer

234
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,223
to that old dream. Anyway...

235
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,350
Don't mind me, Liaukee,
you go on to bed.

236
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,452
- Lord Koiu, are you all right?

237
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,413
- I didn't get a wink
of sleep last night

238
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,041
and it's all thanks to that guy!

239
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,500
What the hell is
with this idiot?

240
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,711
I don't get what's going
on inside his head.

241
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,588
First he lay down in the
courtyard so he can look

242
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,089
at the moon while
he fell asleep,

243
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,383
then out of nowhere he started
playing that damned flute

244
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,718
and on top of that, first
thing in the morning

245
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,428
he wanted to weed
the lawn, and I--

246
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,055
{\an8}Heaven help him!

247
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,557
- I see, well, helping
him out with weeding

248
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,434
was very considerate of you.

249
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,186
- It's not as if he
could do much else.

250
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,396
Really, you must do something
about your frighteningly

251
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,564
horrible sense of direction.

252
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,358
You even got lost
near your own house.

253
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,984
- Mind you own business!

254
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,529
- Do something, silly
brother number four!

255
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,198
- Look, I'd love
to stay and chat,

256
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,699
but I have to take care
of palace security.

257
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,951
- Oh, no. Don't
you try and escape!

258
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,413
- Riu Rin, you strike me as
someone who's above it all.

259
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,748
{\an8}- [Koiu] I knew there was
something about this guy--

260
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,083
(giggles)

261
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,501
{\an8}- [Silly Brother Number
Four] Let go of me!

262
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,211
but if you cause trouble
for someone who took you in,

263
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,546
the proper response
is to apologize.

264
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,466
{\an8}- [Koiu] Stop trying
to weasel out of this,

265
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,385
{\an8}Silly Brother Number Four!

266
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,302
Come on.

267
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,432
Now, the next step is
to say "I'm sorry".

268
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,729
- I am sorry, sir.

269
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,065
- Oh, it's fine.

270
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,653
- I'm sorry, too, for
acting so self-important.

271
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,114
Now, I'd hate to bother
Lord Koiu any further

272
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,449
seeing that he's been so
kind and patient already,

273
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,535
so why don't we go to my
chambers and have some tea,

274
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,037
and then tonight, I insist
that you come and spend

275
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,664
the night at my house.

276
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,052
- Please.

277
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,554
- Thank you, Kodene.

278
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,097
- Silverware, huh?

279
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,225
I see you're not without your
own difficulties here, Suai.

280
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,019
- What do you mean?

281
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,229
- Didn't you know?
Silverware will change color

282
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,314
if it come into
contact with poison.

283
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,524
- [Surai] What?

284
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,694
- Are you all right child?

285
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:04,529
- Yes, I'm sorry.

286
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,328
- I don't know what to say,
I had no idea that silverware

287
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,039
was used for that purpose.

288
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,585
Luakee saved me that time
at the banquet, but I need

289
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,087
to be more aware of
what's going on around me

290
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,630
and start looking
out for myself.

291
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,718
- I was wondering about
that woman, Shuzwe,

292
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,137
do you know about
her background?

293
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,805
- Just that she's
my lady and waiting.

294
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,058
- She appears to have
had considerable training

295
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,434
to move like that.

296
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,354
- You're right. Shuzwe
has a very elegant manner,

297
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,521
don't you think?

298
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,815
- You can be so
dim-witty, sometimes.

299
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,609
- Dim-witty?

300
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,820
- Suai and--

301
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,405
who's that?

302
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,741
- Hey, Suai, how would you
like to travel with me?

303
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,703
This life here in the palace
doesn't suit you at all.

304
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,621
(Suai giggles in embarrassment)

305
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,830
- [Luakee] Who are you?

306
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,749
Who dare to seduce
our royal consort?

307
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,335
- Your Majesty?

308
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,171
I'd like you to
meet, Riu-Rin Rahn.

309
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,756
He's General Rahn's
younger brother.

310
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,257
- From the Rahn Clan?

311
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,555
- Suai is not a
bird to be caged.

312
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,141
She's a bird that
should fly free.

313
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,811
Right? How 'bout we have
Chicken Eat Chicken Hot Pot

314
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:18,853
for dinner tonight?

315
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,148
Yesterday's dumplings
were delicious!

316
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,527
Tonight, I'll return the favor
and make something for you.

317
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,487
- Anyway, Liaukee, I'm
going home for the night.

318
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,446
{\an8}Okay?

319
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,364
Bye.

320
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,618
- I never intended to cage her.

321
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,453
- Your Majesty?

322
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,621
- Sairon?

323
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,832
- What are you doing
out here, Your Majesty?

324
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,877
- I was just talking with
Suai's younger brother.

325
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,671
- You mean the young
man from the Rahn Clan

326
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,756
whose been visiting
the palace recently?

327
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,341
- The same.

328
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,468
Apparently, he'll be staying
at Suai's house, tonight.

329
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,304
- I heard he's very
unusual kind of person.

330
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,349
- But he and Suai seem
to get along well.

331
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,476
Sairon, I have a
request to make of you.

332
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,312
Could you also go home
with Suai tonight?

333
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,898
- If you're worried I can
certainly send some guards over.

334
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,525
I'd like to stay
here and investigate

335
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,402
something a little further.

336
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,320
- If you're talking
about that, I asked Suai

337
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,780
to look into it as well.

338
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,323
Don't do anything reckless.

339
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:14,659
- Right.

340
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,835
- [Merchant] Here you go.

341
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,465
- Didn't you say we were
having Chicken Hot Pot?

342
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,507
- Yes, I did.

343
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,845
- Since when do you need soy
beans for Chicken Hot Pot?

344
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,599
- This tiny round thing,

345
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,435
for some reason I was
suddenly drawn to it

346
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,400
- You broke them.

347
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,319
- [Merchant] This
is a problem, sir.

348
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,613
- I apologize. Please
take these in payment

349
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,781
for the broken eggs.

350
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,699
- What's this?

351
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,952
This much?

352
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,872
Wait a minute, sir, at
least take these in return!

353
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,460
- Well, it's a little closer
to chicken, I suppose,

354
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,336
but still...

355
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,630
- Please.

356
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:10,757
I see.

357
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,510
- Excuse me, what's the matter?

358
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,221
- Nothing.

359
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,473
I just wanted to buy some eggs
for my sick husband to eat,

360
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,558
but I don't have enough money.

361
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,560
- In that case, I'll
exchange these eggs

362
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,646
for those green
onions you got there.

363
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:25,689
- Would you really?

364
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,273
Thank you very much!

365
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,527
- I guess this means we're
getting a little closer

366
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,695
to Hot Pot, but--

367
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,322
we're getting further
away from chicken.

368
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,492
Hey, Riu-Rin, why
don't you and I--

369
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,828
- If it's okay with you, I'd
like to make an exchange.

370
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,745
- Sure.

371
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,580
- Thank you.

372
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,548
- Just what kind of theory

373
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,550
are you basing these
trades on, anyway?

374
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,884
- There is no theory to it.

375
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,387
- And the Chicken
Eat Chicken Hot Pot?

376
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,556
- No more than an illusion.

377
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,516
- I don't think I can
stand much more of this.

378
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,643
He's driving me totally nuts!

379
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,354
(child crying)

380
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,649
- Don't cry, what's wrong?

381
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,735
- The wind blew away the
straw that I was getting used

382
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,736
to make a raincoat.

383
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,032
What am I gonna do?

384
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,499
(gasping in relief)

385
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,417
Thank you!

386
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,053
(Suai laughing)

387
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,430
- Tonight, we can pick
vegetables from our garden

388
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,766
and make Veggie-Veggie
Hot Pot, instead.

389
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,517
- You're not angry with me?

390
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,895
- It reminds me of
an old folk tale.

391
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,356
A man began with a piece
of straw and traded up

392
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,399
until he was rich,
but you ended up doing

393
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,443
the complete opposite, Riu-Rin.

394
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,821
You know, all the same,
I still had a lot of fun!

395
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,958
- Suai, do you know if those
guards outside our front gates

396
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,086
were sent here on
the king's orders?

397
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,671
- I think so.

398
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,005
It's probably because
I'm staying here tonight.

399
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,927
- Riu-Rin, another helping?

400
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:19,803
- Please relax.

401
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:20,970
Make yourself at home.

402
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,103
- There was a piece of
vegetable on your face.

403
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,985
- Well, Riu-Rin, that's a first.

404
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,570
- What is it?

405
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,781
- That must be the first
time I've seen you smile.

406
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:40,990
- No need to make a fuss,

407
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,659
it's nothing to be
surprised about.

408
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,080
- I guess not.

409
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,708
- Why don't we have some more
before the food get cold?

410
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,875
Let's eat!

411
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,627
Riu-Rin, you're spilling it.

412
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,799
- Well, take care
of yourself, okay?

413
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:58,675
- Right.

414
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,763
- [Suai] General Rahn?

415
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:04,973
- The thought that
my younger brother

416
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,392
may have caused you
trouble was worrying me.

417
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,560
- No, not at all.

418
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,061
He wasn't the least
bit of trouble.

419
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,689
- Thank you, General, but there
was no need to be concerned.

420
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,941
- Excuse me, Suai, but
I should get going.

421
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,694
- Good luck and stay safe, okay?

422
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:20,071
- Yeah, but one more
reminder before I go.

423
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,867
I hope you remember that
you're my kindred sp irit.

424
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,411
(Suai gasps)
- You are my kindred spirit,

425
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,787
and that'll be for life.

426
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,666
- Thank you, Riu-Rin.

427
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,089
- Now I'll take my leave.

428
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,637
(startling flute music)

429
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,515
- Next time we meet
will probably be at
the National Exams.

430
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:48,516
{\an8}- The Exams?

431
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,018
- That's right.

432
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,896
- He'll be taking the National
Civil Service Examination.

433
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,647
He had to make a promise
to the Rahn Family

434
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,941
that he will place in
the top three rankings.

435
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:58,818
- [Suai] Why is that?

436
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,196
- That's the condition
under which he's allowed

437
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,989
to wander around like this.

438
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:03,823
- I see.

439
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,201
The National Exams.

440
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,202
- Suai?

441
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,162
I really must thank you.

442
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,789
You are the first
person I've ever met

443
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,124
who didn't turn and run away
from my younger brother.

444
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,751
- That can't be true.

445
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,795
- He has always been very
eccentric and that a fact,

446
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,588
has isolated him from others.

447
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,881
- That's because he's a genius.

448
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,925
I'm sure he sees things
in a very different way

449
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,469
than the rest of us do,
but if you think about it,

450
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,554
that can also mean that
he's unable to see the world

451
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,223
in the same way as other people.

452
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,725
It must be terribly
lonely, enduring that kind

453
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,560
of mental isolation.

454
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,480
- But for the first time he
has a real friend to turn to.

455
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,067
- A kindred spirit.

456
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:39,984
For life.

457
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,493
(regal flute music)

458
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,001
- Liaukee?

459
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,795
- What is it?

460
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,630
- I've never been able to
do anything, unless I put

461
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,507
a lot of effort into it.

462
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,092
Like this Erhu.

463
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,594
I had to practice constantly,
before I was able to play it.

464
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,264
It's hard to have to put in
so much effort all the time,

465
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,516
but it must be hard
to be a genius, too.

466
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,980
- Yes. I'm going to
make an effort, too.

467
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,610
- Tada! Please accept these,
these all my gifts to you.

468
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,988
I'm making an effort and trying
my best to earn your love.

469
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,531
How am I doing, Suai?

470
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,283
It's hard work, but
I'm happy to do it.

471
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,535
For you, I would do
whatever it takes.

472
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,789
Suai? Suai--

473
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,125
- There is nothing I hate more

474
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,587
than someone who wastes money!

475
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,631
(Liaukee screaming)

476
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:51,264
(intimate music in
foreign language)

477
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:01,001
(intimate music in
foreign language fades)

478
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,712
- [Suai] Liaukee has
turned into a true king.

479
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,213
It won't be long now
before my work here

480
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,424
finally comes to an end (yawns).

481
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:10,135
This feeling of relief
is making me sleepy.

482
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:10,969
What?

483
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:11,928
Where am I?

484
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,847
Could I have been kid-knapped?
