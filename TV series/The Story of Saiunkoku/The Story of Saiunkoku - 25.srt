1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,758
(techno sound)

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:17,058
{\an8}("Hajimari no Kaze"
Japanese theme song plays)

3
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,480
(stringed instrument music)

4
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,815
- [Narrator] Shurei Hong,
who has been assigned

5
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,275
to the post of co-governor
of Sa Province,

6
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,195
is currently en route to
the place of her assignment.

7
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,406
But at the moment, she
is faced with a serious,

8
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,825
but familiar problem that
could have a profound

9
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,369
effect on her future
and her dreams.

10
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,418
- He said I'm marrying
a son of the Sa clan?

11
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,672
(Instrumental music)

12
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,009
- What's the matter, Korin?

13
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,344
Your music sounds distracted.

14
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,304
- You can tell?

15
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,891
- I feel like having
some fruit now.

16
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,268
- Okay, I'll bring some.

17
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,272
(Instrumental music)

18
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,485
- Are you worrying
about the governor's

19
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,529
marriage into the Sa clan?

20
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,823
- I was just thinking,

21
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,700
I'd heard she's around my age.

22
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,535
But it's political, right?

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,495
- Those happen quite often.

24
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,247
- That's true, but this
entire marriage business

25
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,875
seems far too rushed and
forceful for my taste.

26
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,752
Not only have they
not asked her,

27
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,671
they haven't even sought
her family's consent.

28
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,548
- That's because she's
the most cherished lady

29
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,799
of the Hong clan.

30
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,760
If approached directly,
the Hong clan would not

31
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,803
choose to deal with the Sa clan.

32
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,306
- [Shurei] She's
a cherished lady?

33
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,933
- [Sakujun] They think only
members of the royal family

34
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,269
of the Ran clan would
be a worthy match.

35
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,272
Given their extreme
pride, the Hong clan

36
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,441
wouldn't even consider
a Sa proposal.

37
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,942
Getting acceptance
after the fact

38
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,904
is the only way the Sa
clan would have a chance.

39
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,907
- The Hong family name
really does have value.

40
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,409
- [Sakujun] And of course,
even the Hong clan isn't likely

41
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,788
to demand her return after
she's done that with someone.

42
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,999
According to rumors, that
noble woman is very beautiful,

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,834
proud, and lady-like.

44
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,920
She's said to be, very
much, the high-born lady,

45
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,588
so if something like
that were to happen,

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,590
they would surely give in.

47
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,966
No one would take
her in marriage,

48
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,302
even if she did return.

49
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,971
- Wow, a high-born lady, huh?

50
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,014
True, in a way.

51
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,309
Korin is pretending
to be me right now,

52
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,604
and she's much more well-bred
and lady-like than I am.

53
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,524
- But I prefer you, much
more than some haughty

54
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,818
and high-born lady
of the Hong clan.

55
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,864
- Uh, thank you very
much, Young Master.

56
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,618
- May I ask you?

57
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,120
- [Shurei] Yes?

58
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,330
- What are your defending
yourself against so strongly?

59
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,748
- Um...

60
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,458
- [Sakujun] You always seem
very timid when it comes

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,793
to falling in love.

62
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,879
If I try to get closer
to you, you pretend

63
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,840
you don't notice, and
hide your heart away

64
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,633
behind strong armor.

65
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,635
That's why you insist
on continuing to call me

66
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,721
Young Master, isn't it?

67
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,557
Were you rejected by
some cruel man, perhaps?

68
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,516
- No, it's--

69
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,019
it's just...

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,770
- [Man] Please don't forget.

71
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,856
Don't forget that
I love you, Shurei.

72
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,484
- I'm just not prepared for it.

73
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,861
- Why do you say that?

74
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,779
- Right now, I have
too much going on

75
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,406
to devote my heart to love.

76
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,492
- [Sakujun] Are you
afraid of falling in love?

77
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,620
- To be honest, I am, a little.

78
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,040
- We are very similar
then, I am also afraid.

79
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,499
- You're what?

80
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,543
But Young Master, you go
around making advances

81
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,837
towards every beautiful
young woman you ever see.

82
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,675
- I can do it, because
it's just a game, but if

83
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,969
I should find that
someone special,

84
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,096
I will no longer be
able to hesitate.

85
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,061
Korin, will you play your
ehru for me again, please?

86
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,646
- Sure.

87
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,026
- [Man] The Little
Whirlwind, it's been such

88
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,944
a long time since we last met.

89
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,821
Back then, I really
liked how you could kill

90
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,908
so coldly and calmly with
that pretty face of yours.

91
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,576
Do you have any
idea how proud I was

92
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,078
to have you all to myself?

93
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,538
- Seems you haven't
changed a bit

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,040
over the years, old Meishou.

95
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,460
Now, quit being such
an idiot, and scram.

96
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,755
You're nothing but an
eyesore, one I might kill.

97
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,674
- Oh, how low the
son of a wealthy

98
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,592
merchant family has fallen.

99
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,094
Now, you're a common thug.

100
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,887
- Even though I was only a kid,

101
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,098
I never forgot the face of
the guy who came to our home,

102
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,641
claiming to be a famous painter.

103
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,018
It was your face, bastard!

104
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,896
(dramatic music)

105
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,778
(footsteps)

106
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,871
- [Meishou] Our old leader's
one and only mistake in life

107
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,790
was deciding, on a
whim, not to kill you,

108
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,792
when we broke in to your house.

109
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,752
And all because one
child was spared,

110
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,463
the Murderous Blades
were wiped out.

111
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,549
- You know my one
and only mistake?

112
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,592
It was that I didn't chase
you to the ends of the Earth,

113
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,969
and the depths of
Hell, and kill you

114
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,595
after you escaped.

115
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,222
Go ahead and state
your business here,

116
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,765
I wouldn't mind
getting that over with,

117
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,892
and finishing things
off, right now, you know.

118
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,603
- Oh, I just came to
see your faces today.

119
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,230
Listen, unlike
our previous boss,

120
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,816
I use what I have up here.

121
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,110
Why don't you come to
Kinka, and see for yourself?

122
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,112
You'll understand
what I mean then.

123
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,906
- Be sure to have a grave and
casket ready for yourself.

124
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,992
Unlike a certain
someone, I'm a nice guy,

125
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,037
but I'm not so kind and helpful
as to prepare those for you.

126
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,789
- I'll see that
they're prepared.

127
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,833
However, they'll be for you.

128
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,960
Because unlike a
certain someone,

129
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,045
I'm considerate.

130
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,926
- [Seiran] Geez. What a
rotten guy to run into.

131
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,512
Let's go.

132
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,848
I'll even treat you
to a cup of Ganlu tea.

133
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,852
- I'll let you treat me
to anything but Ganlu tea.

134
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:16,895
- Hey, why is the--

135
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,646
Oh, of course. I get it.

136
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,939
Ganlu tea is something
you'd rather have

137
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,524
Princess make for you.

138
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,651
- I would just prefer to
save the best for last.

139
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,903
That's all it is.

140
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,197
- Yeah, well, I don't
leave things for later.

141
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,074
I like to go right after it.

142
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,076
- I have no doubt.

143
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,871
(stringed instrument music)

144
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,836
- Korin, I have a question.

145
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,796
- Yes.

146
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,130
- We'll be reaching Kinka soon.

147
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,174
Once we get there, I was
wondering if you would

148
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,550
tell me your real name?

149
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,845
Don't look so surprised.

150
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,305
The name, Korin,
doesn't suit you.

151
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,099
It's too cute.

152
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,642
- Oh, well, jeeze.

153
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,144
I'm so sorry for, apparently,
not being cute enough.

154
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,647
- A more dignified name
would suit you better.

155
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,236
(light stringed music)

156
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,829
- Young Master!

157
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,374
- [Sakujun] Korin.

158
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,751
Good night and
sleep well, Korin.

159
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,978
- When I get to Kinka, I'll
be able to see everyone.

160
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,772
I just have to endure
this a little longer.

161
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,024
(wheels turning on ground)

162
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,734
- [Kokujun] We'll be in
Kinka soon, won't we?

163
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,777
I asked you to help me
with my studies en route,

164
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,362
but I seem to be struggling.

165
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,989
I'm so sorry.

166
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,241
If that wasn't bad enough,
I'm a lot older than you.

167
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,868
- Are you hoping to
become an official

168
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,369
some day, Mr. Kokojun?

169
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,912
- It's sort of been
a dream of mine

170
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,415
that I might pass the
national examinations one day,

171
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,375
and become like
great uncle Enjun.

172
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,085
I figured that if I
could have the boy

173
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,255
who passed his Jougen at age
13 assist me with my studies,

174
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,757
it might help me out a bit.

175
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,216
And give me an edge.

176
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,178
I'm sorry for asking such
a strange favor of you.

177
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,888
- Not at all, but, uh--

178
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,431
Great-uncle Enjun, you say?

179
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,308
Are you talking
about Advisor Sa,

180
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,768
who passed away recently?

181
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,019
- Yes, that's right.

182
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,812
Great-uncle was an
incredible person.

183
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,065
He's what you would
call a genius.

184
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,942
Great-uncle was the
pride of the Sa clan,

185
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,652
and I've always admired him.

186
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,196
- But you've already
studied quite a lot,

187
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,405
haven't you?

188
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,740
You seem to have a
good understanding

189
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,367
of all the important
fundamentals.

190
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,911
- Only because I've
been doing it for years.

191
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,289
But, I'm nothing in comparison
with your knowledge.

192
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,665
- [Eigetsu] You do have a point.

193
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,292
You're not a genius after all.

194
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,086
- Eigetsu, how could you!

195
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,922
- No, it's fine. He's
only telling the truth.

196
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,299
- But, the thing is,
I'm not a genius either.

197
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,802
- Nonsense, if anyone
is a genius, you are.

198
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,805
(carriage rattles)

199
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,436
- [Eigetsu] I studied
with all of my heart.

200
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,146
I didn't have any time or money,

201
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,315
so last winter's exam
was gonna be my first

202
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,359
and final attempt at passing it.

203
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,112
I sometimes had trouble
absorbing what I was studying.

204
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,321
So I took my time.

205
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,240
I memorized material
by transcribing it,

206
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,450
over and over, until
I was satisfied.

207
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,035
I didn't wanna waste
money on paper,

208
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,328
so in the wintertime,

209
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,497
I'd write in the temple
gardens with a stick.

210
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,707
During other seasons,

211
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,500
I'd write on the path
between rice fields

212
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,419
until I could write
everything from memory.

213
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,713
But I still lacked confidence.

214
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,256
I had to put in
that much work just

215
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,174
in order to pass.

216
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,176
So then, am I really a genius?

217
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,804
- I'm sorry.

218
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,389
I really am pathetic, aren't I?

219
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,183
And I'm almost 18 years old.

220
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,852
- [Eigetsu] Please
don't apologize.

221
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,229
I'm not saying you're
to blame or anything.

222
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,356
It may have sounded
impertinent before but,

223
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,941
I just wanted you
to realize that

224
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,359
even if you're not a genius,

225
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,069
there are ways to
make up for it.

226
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,742
- [Sojun] What?!
Kill the two kids?

227
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,411
- [Meishou] Yes. It's an order
from the person who hired us.

228
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,038
- Weren't we gonna make
that girl from the Hong clan

229
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,248
in to Sakujun's
wife or something?

230
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,751
- Apparently, that girl
is actually a fake.

231
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,502
- A fake?!

232
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,880
You're tryna tell me
that some ordinary girl

233
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,465
made a total fool out of me?!

234
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,885
I won't forgive them!

235
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,095
I'm gonna kill those brats
with my own two hands!

236
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,764
- Do whatever you
wish with them.

237
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,807
But I'm afraid it appears
you're going to have to

238
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,309
wait a bit before that.

239
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,353
First, we're going to
put them both to good use

240
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,812
before killing them.

241
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,772
- Good use?

242
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,190
- Nevermind that for now.

243
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,442
Something interesting has
come in to our possession.

244
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:36,780
- Huh?

245
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,240
- Turn that flat rock over
and take a close look.

246
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,787
- What! It's the
governor's seal!

247
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,580
- The other one's a
part of the charm.

248
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,375
I'm having my men search for
the rest of the pieces now.

249
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,336
The seal fragment was
found inside a steam bun.

250
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,421
The charm piece was stuck
to a gold chamber pot

251
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,090
as decoration.

252
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,466
- [Sojun] A chamber pot?

253
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,927
- I doubt they ever expected
us to break open every

254
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,970
single steam bun
that came to Kinka.

255
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,555
- Then as long as
we have these...

256
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,891
- [Meishou] We have no
need for the governors.

257
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,310
All we need to do now is sit
and wait for their arrival.

258
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,520
- Yeah.

259
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,105
But, in that case,

260
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,190
where did the real girl
from the Hong clan get to?

261
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,274
- Don't worry about her,

262
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,943
she'll come here on her own.

263
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,319
To recover the seal and charm,

264
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,487
if nothing else.

265
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,280
Now, all that remains
is the preparation

266
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,950
of a room for her wedding
night with Lord Sakujun.

267
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,536
- But where is that
idiot Sakujun anyway?

268
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,329
- [Meishou] He says
he's too afraid to stay

269
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,956
with the Murderous Blades.

270
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,958
So we've already arranged
for a separate residence

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,459
for him.

272
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,044
- Dammit, you'd never imagine
he was my younger brother,

273
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,504
he's such a coward!

274
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,880
But never mind.

275
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,298
You know something, Meishou?

276
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,301
Why don't you work for me,
instead of grandfather?

277
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,138
- Oh? Are you planning to
push Lord Chusho aside?

278
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,140
- [Sojun] How about it?

279
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,850
- I'll consider it,
and the prospects

280
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,059
it holds for the future.

281
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,319
- Go on, take a look.

282
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,030
We've reached the city of Kinka.

283
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,325
- So this is it.
We're finally here.

284
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,254
(crowd murmurs)

285
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,591
- [Sakujun] What's the matter?

286
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,468
- Isn't this supposed to
be the center for commerce

287
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,011
in Sa province?

288
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,095
- Yes, that's right.

289
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,141
- [Shurei] Something's
wrong here...

290
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,518
Why does this town
feel so lifeless?

291
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,438
- [Sakujun] What
will you do now?

292
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,190
We've reached Kinka as promised.

293
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,609
Would you like to come with
me to where I'll be staying?

294
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,236
- [Shurei] No, I have a
number of places I need to go.

295
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,488
When I'm finished
with my business,

296
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,281
I'll come to say my goodbyes.

297
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,408
What inn will you be staying at?

298
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,494
- Actually, I won't be
staying at any of the inns -

299
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,371
my family has a residence here.

300
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,956
Just ask anyone where the
Chrysanthemum Residence is,

301
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,249
and they'll direct you.

302
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,334
- Yes, very well.

303
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,251
- Korin.

304
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,297
- Yes, what is it?

305
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,507
- Oh nothing.

306
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,966
It's just that I'd
feel much better

307
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,760
if you wouldn't be
so cold toward me.

308
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,720
- Young Master! You haven't
even apologized to me.

309
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,222
- I won't apologize,

310
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,183
because frankly I don't believe
I've done anything wrong.

311
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,023
- I wonder why--

312
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,026
why does seeing this
man remind me of Ryuuki.

313
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,404
Is it an accidental resemblance?

314
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,447
No... They're not at all alike.

315
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,034
You said the Chrysanthemum
Residence, right?

316
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,328
I should be able to
come by within the day.

317
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,038
- I'll be waiting for you.

318
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,747
- Till then.

319
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,503
- I'll be waiting for you...

320
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,097
- They've got seriously ill
bred thugs on patrol here.

321
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,307
They're obviously not
protecting the town.

322
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,060
They're just making the
entire atmosphere worse.

323
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,813
On top of that, they're
out in such numbers.

324
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,732
It feels like we're
all being watched.

325
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,528
Ah, thank goodness.
I finally arrived.

326
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,447
They're not the Kinka
Merchant's Guild for nothing.

327
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,365
This place is huge!

328
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,661
Hm? On the other hand, it's
very quiet around here.

329
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,288
Something's not right.

330
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,708
I should gather some
information first.

331
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,210
Ah! Oh dear, I'm so sorry.

332
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,714
- Pardon me young lady,

333
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,716
might you be a
visitor to the town?

334
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,051
- Huh?

335
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,635
- Is this your
first time in Kinka?

336
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,305
Are you here looking for
work in the Merchant's Guild?

337
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,223
- Ah, well, I, um--

338
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,686
He's wearing some
pretty unusual items,

339
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,522
that the average person
would have trouble getting.

340
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,816
Are you associated with
the Merchant's Guild?

341
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,527
- My my, you're very
perceptive indeed.

342
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,365
Likewise, I noticed that you
carry a special token with you.

343
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,617
It bears the luminous
seven color paint.

344
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,286
- Who are you, and
how do you know that?

345
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,292
- The situation is grim.

346
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,503
The Murderous Blades have
taken complete control

347
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,296
of the Merchant's
capitol of Kinka.

348
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,631
- So is this man the Kinka

349
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,133
Special District Leader
of the Merchant's Guild?

350
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,851
- By the way, just so you know,

351
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,478
the Guild hall we
were at has been

352
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,271
a den of thieves for some time.

353
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,439
- What do you mean?

354
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,900
(men yelling)

355
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:24,818
- [Man] A few months ago,
the Murderous Blades suddenly

356
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,820
came to town en masse.

357
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,655
They were most ingenious.

358
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,490
Even though they forced
their way in to town,

359
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,535
they made a point not to
go looting and burning.

360
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,703
Meishou,

361
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,204
the man who called
himself their leader,

362
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,540
made a formal declaration
to the people:

363
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,749
if they would accept him openly,

364
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,127
then his men would do no harm.

365
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,670
- And the mayor of
Kinka was willing

366
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,672
to agree to those conditions?

367
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,425
- He made a decision to put
the peoples lives first.

368
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,552
- The Murderous Blades
have not been reckless

369
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,178
in their command.

370
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,472
However, they made certain
everyone was clear about

371
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,890
who was in control.

372
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,767
On top of that, they've
been increasingly putting

373
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,562
psychological pressure
on the townspeople.

374
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,813
- They've locked up the mayor

375
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,399
and have assigned their
men to patrol the town.

376
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,443
They've also hinted they
may have the backing of

377
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,360
the Sa clan.

378
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,611
- The Sa?

379
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,488
- Merchant's were drawn
in by the prospect of

380
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,282
being associated
with the Sa clan,

381
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,617
and one after another
began to support them.

382
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,662
On the surface, the
Merchant's Guild does as well.

383
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,708
- It's only natural;
we're merchants.

384
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,836
We never stop calculating and
weighing profits and losses.

385
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,504
Depending on the circumstances,

386
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,631
we'll become anyone's ally.

387
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,843
- This is it! The
moment of reckoning.

388
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,179
It's my first job as governor.

389
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,972
I have to get the Merchant's
Guild on our side,

390
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,557
no matter what.

391
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,017
If I can't do that,

392
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,769
we'll have no chance when
facing the Murderous Blades,

393
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,270
or the Sa clan!

394
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,897
Please state your
conditions for assisting me.

395
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,774
What will I need to do
in order to get you to

396
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,360
mobilize the mercenaries
of the Merchant's Guild?

397
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,905
- In that case,

398
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,531
please show us the cards
you have in your hand.

399
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,825
After taking in to
consideration both your cards,

400
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,243
and our conditions,

401
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,371
if we determine that
you have an 80% chance

402
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,874
of success, than you will
have the support of the guild.

403
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,001
However, you should first
know that according to

404
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,671
our sources, the Murderous
Blades have already managed to

405
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,632
obtain the seal and
charm of the governor.

406
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,175
As such,

407
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,678
those two things will be of
no use in these negotiations.

408
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,680
- What you're saying
is not possible.

409
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,555
They're fakes!

410
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,310
- What makes you say
they must be fakes?

411
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,853
- Truthfully?

412
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,772
- [Man] The governors seal
and charm should arrive in

413
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,525
Kinka at about the
same time as you do.

414
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,276
Even without more information,

415
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,820
you'll know them the
instant you see them.

416
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,571
I will leave them
somewhere very safe,

417
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,864
where there's no
chance that anyone will

418
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,033
be able to steal them.

419
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,536
- [Shurei] That's what his
majesty, the King said.

420
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,287
I think we can believe his word.

421
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,250
- So where exactly are
the seal and charm then?

422
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,793
- Well, uh...

423
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,378
I don't know yet.

424
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,546
- What?

425
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,340
- [Shurei] I'll find
them without fail.

426
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,800
- I don't know.

427
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,968
If it were solely up to us,

428
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,553
we would never
use such a foolish

429
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,430
and irresponsible
method ourselves.

430
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,017
- But how do you
intend to find them?

431
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,572
- So, this must be
the town of Kinka.

432
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,991
- Uh, show us your
pass token, sir.

433
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,410
- My pass token? Oh
right, of course.

434
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,870
Let's see, where did I put it?

435
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,755
- Hey! You're holding
up the line! Hurry up!

436
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,423
- This is a new
experience for me.

437
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,925
I've never been told to hurry
up before in my entire life.

438
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,427
(crowd gasps)

439
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,678
Now that you mention it,

440
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,889
it could be fun to have
to hurry up for once!

441
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,650
Ah-ha! So that's where it was.

442
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,779
- [Guard] Come on. Honestly,
causing so much trouble.

443
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,573
The twin dragons!?

444
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,451
My lord! Then you're a
member of the Ran clan?

445
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:14,339
- Now to play a melody to
celebrate my arrival in Kinka.

446
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,592
(off tune flute plays)

447
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,427
- Argh! That awful flute music!

448
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,012
- Only one man plays like this!

449
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,473
He must be Lord Ryuren Ran!

450
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,391
Ugh!

451
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,441
- I will find the
governor's seal and charm

452
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,026
before the end of the day.

453
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,779
Furthermore, Lt. Governor
Ensei Ro is coming.

454
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,364
He's traveling with Seiran Si,

455
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,658
the officer assigned
to the governors.

456
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,661
He wields a precious sword
given by his majesty himself,

457
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,162
and he has a higher
rank than even

458
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,665
the general of Sa province.

459
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,874
They're both on their way,

460
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,043
along with the other
governor, Eigetsu To.

461
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,380
All of them will be
arriving in Kinka shortly.

462
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,965
- Well now, that's
all very interesting,

463
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,050
but are those all the
cards you currently have

464
00:20:59,092 --> 00:20:59,884
up your sleeve?

465
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:00,552
- [Shurei] No.

466
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,888
I can't lose, no matter what.

467
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,516
If I lose here, we
don't stand a chance.

468
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,060
I'll do whatever it
takes to win this fight!

469
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,812
The last card I have...

470
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,397
Is my own life!

471
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,151
If it should come to that,

472
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,528
I'm willing to offer my own
life as a bargaining chip.

473
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,821
- Your meaning?

474
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,032
- Losing my life here
in Sa province would be

475
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,951
a grave insult to
the entire Hong clan.

476
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,953
The Sa clan can
not kill a lady of

477
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,872
the direct line
of the Hong clan.

478
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,498
The backlash would
be too severe,

479
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,417
they can't afford that.

480
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,419
And that's why my life...

481
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,420
Is valuable.

482
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,763
- There is no guaranteeing
your final card.

483
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,558
We won't really know how
the Hong clan will react

484
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,643
until that time actually comes.

485
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,519
- But sir!

486
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,982
- We will give you
our conditions now.

487
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,984
Get rid of the leader
of the Murderous Blades,

488
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,737
as well as taking care of
all his senior officers.

489
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,155
If you promise you can do that,

490
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,074
then I in turn will promise
to send our elite troops

491
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,950
to join you and assist you.

492
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,745
I can see the value in that
strong spirit of yours.

493
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,164
- Thank you, sir.

494
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,792
- Governor Hong.

495
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,001
- Yes?

496
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,461
- Can you promise that
you will not betray

497
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,713
the hopes of the
people of Sa province?

498
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:21,800
- Yes.

499
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,934
- At last! We finally
reached Kinka!

500
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,227
- I know.

501
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:36,106
(all in wagon yell)

502
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,148
Mr. Kokujun?

503
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,945
- [Man's Voice]
We've been waiting!

504
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,534
- Welcome to humble
Kinka city, Governor To.

505
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:51,162
And of course, welcome to the
young lady imposter as well.

506
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,050
- Shall we arrange a room for
you at the inn for the night?

507
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,136
- No, thank you. It's
all been taken care of.

508
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,762
I'll be staying at the
residence of the son

509
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,847
of the Rin family.

510
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,685
Huh? Um, is something wrong?

511
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,688
- A few days ago the entire
Rin family was slaughtered

512
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,815
by the Murderous Blades.

513
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,568
As far as we can tell,
there were no survivors.

514
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,279
- But how can that--

515
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,530
how can that be?

516
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,829
Then, who is that man?

517
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,002
Who in the world--

518
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,045
could he be?

519
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,848
{\an8}(Japanese ending theme)

520
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,003
- [Shurei] I finally
reached Kinka,

521
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,839
where I promised to meet
up with Reiran, Ensei,

522
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,465
Korin, and Eigetsu.

523
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,093
But what's worrying me most
is Senya Rin's identity.

524
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,137
Could it be that I was
traveling with someone

525
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,847
very dangerous?
