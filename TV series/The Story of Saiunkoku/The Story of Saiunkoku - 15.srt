1
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,425
{\an8}(bright music)

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:15,473
{\an8}(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,815
- [Narrator] A person
who is seen as the lowest

4
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,484
of the low is
assigned menial tasks

5
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,529
and given little opportunity
to prove their true worth.

6
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,824
- (sighs) Right, and
now I have to go clean

7
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,283
the other toilets over there.

8
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,537
(gentle oriental music)

9
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,792
- [Narrator] Despite
having passed

10
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,836
the National Civil
Service Examinations,

11
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,296
Shurei Hong and Eigetsu To

12
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,757
are currently experiencing
all the hardships

13
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,427
that come with being
the lowest of the low.

14
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,762
- Okay, sir, I've
finished your shoes.

15
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,680
(man snorts)
(Eigetsu sighs)

16
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,725
(upbeat flute music)

17
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,697
(Eigetsu sighs)

18
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,324
- That was such a
heart-wrenching sigh.

19
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,327
That expression on your
face is quite a turn on.

20
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,454
- Look, lay off the jokes!

21
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,581
I'm in a lousy mood
right now, okay?

22
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,959
- Shurei is still working
hard, I understand?

23
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,546
- But will she be
able to keep it up?

24
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,799
- If this continues, I'm sure
that man will make his move.

25
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,386
- He might have already done so.

26
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,596
- I suppose so.

27
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,680
What with his sweet
little niece receiving

28
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,474
this kind of mistreatment,

29
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,725
I'll bet he's gone to the king

30
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,560
to give him a piece of
his mind, or several.

31
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,898
- Your Majesty, I understand
that it was your decision

32
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,775
to keep this year's
Top 20 initiates

33
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,069
within the Imperial
Court for observation.

34
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,904
- Indeed, it was
our father's custom

35
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,572
to do this occasionally.

36
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,616
- Yes, such was the
case during my year

37
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,076
and Koyu's, as well.

38
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,495
It's usually done when there
is difficulty determining

39
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,413
how best to assign
those top tier recruits

40
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,916
who possess exceptional talents.

41
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,751
I'm sure it's only proper.

42
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,795
If both Shurei
Hong and Eigetsu To

43
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,506
were immediately assigned
to one of the ministries,

44
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,924
they'd be beaten down

45
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,385
before they had a chance
to prove their abilities.

46
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,928
That would be a great shame.

47
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,554
- But aren't you
the sort of person

48
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,056
who would despise
anyone who failed

49
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,600
to prove their abilities
and discard them quickly?

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,477
- Of course, I
would discard them.

51
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,521
Those incapable of
applying their talents

52
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,773
to the positions given
to them deserve no less.

53
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,608
More than anything,
I detest those people

54
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,403
who are weak, spoiled,
and utterly foolish.

55
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,780
That includes you
as you were before.

56
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,615
(king laughs)

57
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,660
However, this time the
conditions are far too extreme

58
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,954
it would be like rashly
tossing seedlings into water

59
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,539
and expecting them to grow.

60
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,082
There is an obligation
to rescue them

61
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,875
and place them on secure ground,

62
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,544
otherwise they will
only end up rotting

63
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,087
no matter how hard they try.

64
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,548
- There's no need to worry
we will protect your niece.

65
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,882
We give you our word.

66
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,094
- You were the one who
put forward the proposal

67
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,888
and opened the examination
to women, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,141
If you cannot properly
govern and manage a system

69
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,809
that you yourself established,

70
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,103
then I will not
hesitate to dessert you.

71
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,646
Excuse me.

72
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,816
- Senior Secretary Hong,
you have my personal thanks

73
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,360
for standing in as
Shurei's sponsor.

74
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,570
- Not at all.

75
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,864
I did not in any
way do it for you.

76
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,117
- I see.

77
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,578
Well despite that, I'm
actually very fond of you.

78
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,038
- [Reishin] If you
think you can get me

79
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,708
into you bed, Your
Majesty, think again.

80
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,503
(door slams shut)
(King chuckles)

81
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,380
I came here hoping
to comfort myself

82
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,923
by seeing my big brother.

83
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,842
- Unfortunately, Lord
Shoka is out-of-town

84
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,135
on official business.

85
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,595
- Damn it!

86
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,013
If I had my way, I
would go right now

87
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,515
and fire every single miscreant
who dares bully Shurei.

88
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,601
- That's not a joke coming
from the Senior Secretary

89
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,853
of Civil Affairs in
charge of personnel.

90
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,689
- (chuckles)If the king
still refuses to take action,

91
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,483
I really will dessert him.

92
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,110
- [Voiceover] As I suspected,
he did go and see the king.

93
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,487
- Lord Reishin, even though

94
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,863
you're her sponsor,
please consider.

95
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,448
If you interfere too much,

96
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,658
you'll end up causing
unneeded trouble for Shurei.

97
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,078
- That is precisely why I
haven't publicly announced

98
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,621
the fact that I'm her sponsor.

99
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,830
- Oh, Reishin!

100
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,083
Fancy seeing you here.

101
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,501
{\an8}- Oh, big brother--

102
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,586
- My, my, those peach
buns look delicious.

103
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,671
- [Reishin] I
brought them for you!

104
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,089
Please help yourself.

105
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,049
- Thank you. Then I'll help
myself to one right now.

106
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,634
- Of course.

107
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,177
- [Shoka] You know, I was
just starting to get hungry.

108
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,595
- [Reishin] Really?

109
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,931
- [Shoka] All right, let's
go ahead and enjoy them.

110
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,642
(gentle music)

111
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,068
- [Koyu Voiceover] It's clear
who the person most important

112
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,611
to Lord Reishin is.

113
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,115
- [Shurei] Lord Koyu?

114
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,743
I'm only a newly
conferred official,

115
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,995
and what with the difference
between us in rank,

116
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,540
I know I shouldn't be
talking with you so casually

117
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,624
like this, it's just that--

118
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,042
- What is it?

119
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,502
- [Shurei] Has something
happened to make you depressed?

120
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,879
(Koyu gasps)

121
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,091
In that case, there was
something else I wanted

122
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:23,967
to ask you about.

123
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,260
- Oh, what?

124
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,554
- I was wondering about
when you took the exam.

125
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,264
You became Jougen at 16, right?

126
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,140
- Yes, I did.

127
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,766
But what about it?

128
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,268
- I want to know what your
wishes were, Lord Koyu.

129
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,854
What was the strong
desire that supported you?

130
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,230
What was the wish
you depended on,

131
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,815
when you worked your way up?

132
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,945
- I only had one wish
and it was very simple.

133
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,031
I wanted to stay by the
side of a special person

134
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,699
and be useful to him.

135
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,492
That person has
given so much to me.

136
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,745
My only goal was to
somehow repay his kindness,

137
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,746
even just a little.

138
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,124
That's all there is to
it, not very pure motives

139
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,126
in comparison with yours.

140
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,753
- Were you able to fulfill it?

141
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,837
Your desire?

142
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,839
- Who knows?

143
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,674
It doesn't feel
like it sometimes.

144
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,259
To that man it probably
doesn't make any difference

145
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,094
whether I'm around him or not.

146
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,097
- Being supported by your
feelings for someone else,

147
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,223
I think it's wonderful.

148
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,141
- Huh?

149
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,727
- I'd better keep trying too.

150
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,107
- Go on, I'll bring you guys
some refreshments later.

151
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,984
- Thank you very much.

152
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,821
(footsteps stomping)

153
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,573
- Hello, Lord Koyu!

154
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,533
What's wrong you seem perturbed?

155
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,285
Is there a problem?

156
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,828
- Is there a problem?

157
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,830
Secretary Sai, you're
the one responsible

158
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,249
for instructing the newly
conferred officials, aren't you?

159
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,793
- Yes, is that an issue?

160
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,336
- Doesn't it bother you,
even a little, to see

161
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,922
what Shurei Hong and Eigatsu
To are going through?

162
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,590
- There's no point in asking me.

163
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,133
The one who assigned
them to toilet cleaning

164
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,968
and shoe polishing
was official Ro,

165
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,887
perhaps you should
speak with him.

166
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,180
More importantly, Lord Koyu.

167
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,306
- Huh?

168
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,600
- I want to talk
about your situation.

169
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,727
You're Secretary
Hong's adopted son,

170
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,689
but he has yet to grant
you the Hong family name.

171
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,191
Secretary Hong has no
children of his own

172
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,901
but it seems that
he has no intention

173
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,820
of bringing you into
the Hong family.

174
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,199
That man is so
capricious and cruel.

175
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,034
To be honest, it wouldn't
surprise me at all

176
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,286
if he threw you out
at the drop of a hat.

177
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,664
I however value your ability.

178
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,833
So let's let bygones be bygones.

179
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,793
Should you ever find
yourself on your own,

180
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,211
I'd be more than willing to--

181
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,671
- [Koyu] Excuse me.

182
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,173
(gentle music)

183
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,899
(horse neighs)

184
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,943
- Young boy, what is that
you're selling there?

185
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,861
- [Koyu] A lot sir?

186
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,279
- I see.

187
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,406
Is all that rubbish meant
as prizes for the lottery?

188
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,074
- If you gonna make
trouble, don't bother.

189
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,868
(laughing)

190
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,370
(gentle music)

191
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,294
Go ahead.

192
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,301
Your consolation prize.

193
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,137
- Plum blossoms.

194
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,222
I somehow doubt there
are many winning tokens

195
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,766
in that box to begin with.

196
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,642
It's a pretty good
business idea.

197
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,729
Tell me, was it your parents
that came up with this?

198
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,148
- No, I don't have any parents.

199
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,031
- [Reishin] Hmm very
well, you will soon.

200
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,700
- Huh?

201
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,665
- [Roku Voiceover] He took
me in, but only on a whim,

202
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,876
almost like bringing
home some stray dog.

203
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,170
- What are you doing
standing around out here?

204
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,757
- If I've told you once I've
told you a thousand times,

205
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,842
ask for directions
if you get lost.

206
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,303
- I was merely admiring
the plum blossoms.

207
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,138
Sir, may I ask
what's troubling you?

208
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,683
You seem to be in a fairly
bad mood these days.

209
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,436
- I would say that the
one who's truly troubled

210
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,771
is you, Koyu.

211
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,231
Am I wrong?

212
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,149
- It's nothing,
nothing at all, sir.

213
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,444
- Well, all right.

214
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,030
Someone's been sent from the
main branch of the Hong clan.

215
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,740
- The main Hong clan?

216
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,117
- Though I find it unlikely.

217
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,785
Should they attempt to
approach you at home,

218
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,286
kick them out immediately.

219
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,122
Nothing good would
bring them here.

220
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,211
What is it?

221
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,881
If I told you I wanted
to leave your side

222
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,425
and take a journey
around the country

223
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,720
and practice the art of making
dim sum, what would you do?

224
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,098
- You, Koyu, making dim sum?

225
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,767
- What the hell am I saying?

226
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,396
- You have no
sense of direction.

227
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,064
How will you get
anywhere on your journey?

228
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,399
- Just never mind that.

229
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,863
- If that's what you
wanna do, then go ahead.

230
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,284
It's your life after all,
you don't have to ask me.

231
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,079
(gentle music)

232
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:32,317
(groans) Guess I should
study how to make these.

233
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,446
Very strange.

234
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,323
I thought the archives
were this way.

235
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,499
- You're going to the archives?

236
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,000
How about I go with you?

237
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,466
Shurei, I've
brought you a snack.

238
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,842
- Thank you, Lord Koyu.

239
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,971
- I've got some dim
sum I made at home.

240
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,014
- At your home?

241
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:03,890
Wait a minute.

242
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,350
If I remember correctly,

243
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,018
you're staying at someone
else's estate, aren't you?

244
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,103
- Right?

245
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,521
Well, that is to say I mean,

246
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,065
I'm staying with the family
that's taken care of me

247
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,483
ever since I was a little boy.

248
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,568
Let's have these while
they're warm, okay?

249
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:21,991
Go on, try 'em.

250
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,247
- Wow, the shrimp
is really succulent.

251
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,290
- The crab dumplings
are fantastic.

252
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,418
They don't look great,
but they're quite tasty.

253
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,502
- Eigetsu!

254
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,586
- Oh jeez, sorry.

255
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,338
I'll try shrimp dumpling next.

256
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,091
(gentle music)

257
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,097
- That was really delicious.

258
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,306
Thank you again.

259
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,434
This gives us the energy
we need to keep going.

260
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,060
- Right.

261
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,562
But now that you mention it,
should we get back to work?

262
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,192
It's good to see you're both
really hanging in there,

263
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,153
even in the face of
so much hardship.

264
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,114
- I think the hardest
thing to deal with

265
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,908
is having to watch while those
people most important to us

266
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,660
endure sadness and suffering

267
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,537
and so we're
determined to work hard

268
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,539
and create a country
where that doesn't happen.

269
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,707
- That's the idea.

270
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,417
Of course, I'll be
the first to admit,

271
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,670
I have no idea if our efforts
will actually help Saiunkokhu.

272
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,089
(laughing)

273
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,434
(Koyu sighs)

274
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,064
- That looks like Lord
Koyu you over there.

275
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,940
Did he just come
from the archives?

276
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,400
- It would appear so.

277
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,694
I was under the impression
that Shurei Hong and Eigetsu To

278
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,446
are also in the archives.

279
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,989
- Yes, he was probably
visiting them.

280
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,283
Before Miss Hong took
the aptitude test,

281
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,202
Lord Koyu often
went to her estate

282
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,037
and assisted her in her studies.

283
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,498
You could say that the
king specifically created

284
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,292
the aptitude test system
for Miss Hong alone.

285
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,960
Originally, in
order to be eligible

286
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,212
to sit for the final part

287
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,713
of the national Civil
Service examinations,

288
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,674
one would have to
spend at least a year

289
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,259
passing the various
qualification tests.

290
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,220
However, in Shurei Hong's case,

291
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,013
she was permitted to
take the final exam

292
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,307
after only passing
the aptitude test.

293
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,518
But the examination
itself was quite difficult

294
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,603
to compensate for
such circumstances.

295
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,522
Still no matter
how you look at it,

296
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,982
Miss Hong has been
extremely fortunate.

297
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,442
- What are you getting at?

298
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,486
- In order to participate in
the National examinations,

299
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,780
a woman needs the support
of a high-ranking official

300
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,574
or grand noble and
apparently Lord Reishin Hong

301
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,784
is Miss Hong's sponsor.

302
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,660
- Huh?

303
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,540
(gentle music)

304
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,715
- My, that is unusual,
you drinking by yourself.

305
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,633
- Leave me alone.

306
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,677
- I'll join you if
you're feeling lonely.

307
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,345
- Look, I'm not lonely.

308
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,681
- Oh, hey there Seiran.

309
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,059
Why don't you come and join us?

310
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,227
- No, no, I'm fine.

311
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,645
- Yeah hey, come join us.

312
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,771
Now that I think about it,

313
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,064
it's your fault that
I'm sitting here

314
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,482
drinking all alone, anyway.

315
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,027
You owe me one, so get over
here and start boozing.

316
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,362
- You heard the man.

317
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,411
(laughing)

318
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,038
- Hey big brother.

319
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,456
- Your majesty.

320
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,125
- What was that disgusting
noise you just made?

321
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,335
- Nothing.

322
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,419
- You sit down, too.

323
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,261
- So would you mind
enlightening me

324
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,805
about why you said I'm the
blame for your drinking?

325
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:31,681
- Forget it.

326
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,515
It's not important.

327
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,683
- Oh, don't say that.

328
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,852
I for one would be
interested to hear it.

329
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,563
- Koyu, just give
up and tell us.

330
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,690
- Yeah, I'd like to hear
stories about brother,

331
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,566
I mean, Seiran.

332
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,235
- You want another story?

333
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,695
It goes all the way back to

334
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,073
when I was just a helpless
young boy fresh off the streets.

335
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,534
I was suddenly taken
in by Lord Reishin

336
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,787
and brought back to
live in his estate

337
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,331
and all without any explanation.

338
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,166
I couldn't help but
wonder, so I asked him.

339
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,417
Why are you adopting me?

340
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,171
- He recognized your
potential with one glance.

341
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,423
- You were as irresistible
as a little puppy.

342
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,425
- Wrong, I was a substitute.

343
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,718
- A substitute?

344
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,553
But for who?

345
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,721
You don't get it, do you?

346
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,848
I was adopted 13 years ago.

347
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,183
Think about what was happening

348
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,143
in Lord Shoku's
household at the time?

349
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,771
- Don't tell me.

350
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,481
I heard my beloved big brother

351
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,358
just took in a
young boy recently

352
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,569
in order to experience
the same hardships as him.

353
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,405
I've decided to
randomly choose a child

354
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,573
to adopt and raise as well.

355
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,158
- Those were his words

356
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,494
and it just so happened
that the one he saw was...

357
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,123
In that moment, it felt
like my life ended.

358
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,460
- You got Lord Shoka,
so it's fine for you,

359
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,629
but I ended up
with Lord Reishin.

360
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,632
But I suppose it's thanks to you

361
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,217
that I'm where I am now.

362
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,137
Anyway, drink up.

363
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,680
No, I'll do the drinking.

364
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,766
- We get the idea, come on,

365
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,726
I'll take you home.

366
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,270
- Nah, I don't wanna go home.

367
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,438
- Are you sure you'll
be all right with him?

368
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,313
- Yes, sure.

369
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,898
You can stay here.

370
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,775
Take this opportunity to have
a private chat with the King.

371
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,444
Come on, let's go.

372
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,571
- Stop it, I'm not
done drinking, yet.

373
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,780
- If you drink anymore,

374
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,615
you'll collapse before
you make it home.

375
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,783
- [Koyu] If that
happened, I wonder

376
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,618
if he'd still take me in.

377
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,287
No, maybe not.

378
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,580
It seems even Lord Koyu

379
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,790
can get outrageously
drunk on occasion.

380
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,791
Right, what do you--

381
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,752
- Big brother?

382
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,379
You ended up drunk to
didn't you, Your Majesty?

383
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,257
- I feel useless.

384
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,385
Shurei is suffering
so much hardship.

385
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,638
But all I could do is
watch from the shadows.

386
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,307
- Watching over her is enough.

387
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,642
You already created a
path for Lady Shurei.

388
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,187
Now you just have to
support her along it.

389
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,816
You know, I'm not even
able to do as much as you.

390
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,447
I should be heading
back as well.

391
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,782
I'll see you to your room.

392
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,331
- I drank way too much.

393
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,875
- My, my, you're certainly
in a miserable state.

394
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,587
Honestly, what's wrong with you?

395
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,673
I don't recall ever having
raised such a pathetic

396
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,007
and hopeless young man.

397
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,884
- Well in that case,
why don't you just go

398
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,844
and adopt another child
more to your liking

399
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,596
who won't disappoint
you so much?

400
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,856
Shurei he didn't
come home last night.

401
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,733
She must have been
staying in the archives.

402
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,984
- Yes.

403
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,277
She certainly has
been working hard.

404
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,864
- Delicious is always, Seiran.

405
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,784
You really have mastered
the art of making tea.

406
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,327
I remember a time when you used

407
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,954
to put the tea leaves
directly into the cup

408
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,581
and pour hot water over the top.

409
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,376
- Master, please
don't remind me.

410
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,877
- Seiran?

411
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,129
- Yes.

412
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,879
- Don't you think you
should live your life

413
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,755
the way you want to?

414
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,384
ever since the day my
wife and I took you in

415
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,885
and chose a new name for you,

416
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,722
I felt like you were one of
my own, the son I never had.

417
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,598
- Master Shoka.

418
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,393
- Parents should never be a
burden for their children.

419
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,646
That means there's no need
for you to worry about me.

420
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,024
There's still plenty of time
before Shurei's placement

421
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,275
will be decided.

422
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,776
Take time to think things over.

423
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,657
- Master Shoka,
pardon me for asking,

424
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,743
but would it be alright to
invite a troubled young man

425
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:20,952
to our home this evening?

426
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,957
- If you don't mind.

427
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,629
- Wow, this will
be the first time

428
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,048
I've polished a king's shoes.

429
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,300
- Finding this difficult?

430
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,468
- [Eigatsu] Not really.

431
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,594
You'd be surprised
at what you can learn

432
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,346
while doing this kind of thing.

433
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,555
- (chuckles) I'm
glad to hear it.

434
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,931
- Please don't
fret about me, sir.

435
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,099
I'm fine.

436
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,934
I think she worried
about Shurei.

437
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,562
Things have been
much harder for her.

438
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,438
- Eigetsu?

439
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,731
- [Eigetsu] Yes.

440
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:50,732
- Take this.

441
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,608
It's for you.

442
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,484
- What is it?

443
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,115
- [Koyu] It's the Seal of the
royal family for emergencies.

444
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,784
- But it would be
better for Mr. Seiran

445
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,410
to have something like this.

446
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,788
- No, with his current
ranks Seiran's not permitted

447
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,831
to be by Shurei's
side at all times.

448
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,085
- I understand, sir.

449
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,091
- I may be the only
person whose powerless

450
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,552
to do anything more than
worry, but at least.

451
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,807
- Lord Shoka, you say?

452
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,975
- Yes, he asked to
come this evening.

453
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,019
- Why does he wanna see me?

454
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,979
- I'm just passing
on the message.

455
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:30,855
Excuse me.

456
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,359
- What could this be about?

457
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:36,861
- Hello.

458
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,116
Oh, hello, Koyu.

459
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,493
I'm so glad you could
come right this way.

460
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,414
(gentle music)

461
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,464
- Forgive my rudeness,
but it's unusual

462
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,466
for you to invite me over.

463
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,677
- I suppose but not
any more unusual

464
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,929
than the expression on
your face right now.

465
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,891
Do you like that plum tree?

466
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,561
It was sent by Reishin
earlier this year.

467
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,979
He sent it almost immediately

468
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,064
after he heard the king
had given us a cherry tree.

469
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,482
- Is it because
the plum blossoms

470
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,860
come out earlier than
the cherry blossoms?

471
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,111
- No.

472
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,654
it's because out of all
the blossoms and fruits.

473
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,906
My brother has always
loved the plum best of all.

474
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,702
- [Koyu] But we don't even have
a single plum tree at home.

475
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,620
- Reishin has never been
the type to be frank

476
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:28,788
about his preferences.

477
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,793
He doesn't like the
Hong clan very much.

478
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,587
Nevertheless, he
couldn't escape his fate

479
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,797
of becoming head of
the entire Hong family.

480
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,009
I can't help but feel
he doesn't want you

481
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,802
to be bound to that.

482
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,637
Once he grants you
the Hong family name,

483
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,723
you'd also be drawn
into the ugly darkness

484
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,099
that swirls within the clan.

485
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,603
Reishin himself
couldn't escape it.

486
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,813
So how could he allow
someone so important to him

487
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,106
to suffer the same fate?

488
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,528
He wants you to be able to
choose your own path in life

489
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,239
to have the opportunity
and freedom he never had.

490
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,783
I believe that's why he gave you

491
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,826
the family name of Lee instead.

492
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,536
Lee means plum, right?

493
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:12,707
But koy in koyu means
crimson even deeper than red

494
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,919
and the U refers to the
way that water flows.

495
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,046
Your name reflects how
much pride he takes

496
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,214
in you as his son

497
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,007
as well as his hopes
that you can live a life

498
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,551
that is free as flowing water.

499
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,803
Even for my younger brother,

500
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,263
he did well to pick
such a fine name.

501
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,224
- I had no idea.

502
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,684
- There's an old saying.

503
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,977
"A child knows not of
his parents' feelings".

504
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:35,647
- Ko Shoka.

505
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:36,564
- Yes.

506
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,775
- Thank you very much.

507
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,153
- You should be thanking Seiran.

508
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,239
He was the one who asked me
to listen to your troubles

509
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,116
and set your mind at rest.

510
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:46,950
- I see.

511
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,535
And General Ron as well.

512
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,577
- Ah!

513
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,246
- He also mentioned it to me.

514
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,622
He said that since you prefer

515
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,124
not to talk about
private matters,

516
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,544
I would be the only one you
could open up to about Reishin.

517
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,505
You're certainly fortunate
to have such a great friend.

518
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,924
(Koyu groans)

519
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,095
Dammit Shue Ran, it was
none of your business.

520
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,097
- Why is it alright for
Seiran to say something

521
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:09,973
but not for me?

522
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,599
- Because--

523
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,976
- (laughs) It's
really something.

524
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,561
The Hong family's popularity

525
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,979
and ability to capture
people's hearts,

526
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,188
it's quite astonishing.

527
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,776
- [Koyu Voiceover] Lord
Shoka has Lord Reishin and I

528
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,111
in his grasp.

529
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,988
Shurei has the king
completely under her control

530
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,614
and they have someone
as outstanding

531
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,826
as Seiran working
for them. (chuckles)

532
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,662
If those three put
their minds to it,

533
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:33,872
they could probably take control

534
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,749
of this entire country tomorrow.

535
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,001
- Quite right.

536
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,712
(gentle music)

537
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,796
- Cleaning toilets, polishing
shoes, organizing paperwork.

538
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,006
Boy, it's been really busy.

539
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,841
It feels like it's
taking its toll.

540
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,300
No, pull yourself
together, Shurei.

541
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,344
{\an8}I'm not about to just
give up on a dream

542
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,054
{\an8}I worked so hard to grasp.
