1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,550
(digital tone)

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:16,391
{\an8}(peaceful music in
foreign language)

3
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,937
(chimes)

4
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,564
- [Narrator] Shkrei, having
passed the national exams,

5
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,317
is on her way to attend
the initiation ceremony

6
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,986
for those eligible to
become court officials.

7
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,322
It's the beginning
step for Saiunkoku's

8
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,783
first ever female official.

9
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,827
- It certainly is
a fine day today.

10
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,286
- [Shkrei] You're right!

11
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,746
Well, Father, Seiran,
I'll be on my way now.

12
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,499
- All right, be sure
to do your best.

13
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,875
- Okay.

14
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,713
(traditional Japanese music)

15
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,972
- [Shkei] Are you prepared for
the ceremony, Your Majesty?

16
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,725
- Yes, has everyone
been assembled?

17
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,852
- Yes, mostly.

18
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,688
Though I'm afraid there is one
person who hasn't shown up.

19
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,398
(laughs)

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,569
(traditional Japanese music)

21
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,529
- What a beautiful day.

22
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,447
- Quite.

23
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,577
- [Reishin] Ah, what a
lovely day it is, KMyk.

24
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,455
The sky has the exact
same color as that day.

25
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,042
The day you passed the exam in
first place at the age of 16.

26
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,793
You spent the rest
of the day running

27
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,712
from high-ranking
officials wanting you

28
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,255
to become their son-in-law.

29
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,257
Hm.

30
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,844
What're you looking at, KMyk?

31
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,387
- [KMyk] I was just
wondering, sir,

32
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,556
about you acting as
Shkrei's sponsor.

33
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,558
Are you still intending to
keep that a secret from her?

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,979
- Hm, I have to tell her
that I'm her uncle first.

35
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,357
- In other words, not
for quite a while.

36
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,401
- The best things in life should
always be saved for later.

37
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,612
- Hm.

38
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,491
- [Announcer] Lord Reishin
Hong, Senior Secretary

39
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,700
of the Department
of Civil Affairs,

40
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,453
and Lord KMyk Li,
Assistant Secretary

41
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,414
of the Department of Civil
Affairs have arrived.

42
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,750
(footsteps)

43
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,835
- [Kijin] There's
more of a commotion

44
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,504
today than there
was when KMyk Li

45
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,381
and Shkei Ran passed the exams.

46
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,840
- That was only to be expected.

47
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,551
After all, look at who the
top three ended up being.

48
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,472
- [Official] Eigetsu Tou.

49
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,684
He passed the exams and took
first place at the age of 13.

50
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,061
It smashed Lord KMyk's
record with ease.

51
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,771
- [Official] Second
place went to Rykren Ran,

52
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,940
the younger brother of
General Ran, isn't that right?

53
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,775
- [Official] Yes, but
skipping the initiation

54
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,443
ceremony is unheard of.

55
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,945
- [Official] This
is an odd year.

56
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,905
As soon as the national
civil service examination

57
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,784
system was open to women, one
came in and took third place.

58
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,327
- [Official] You
know, that girl looks

59
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,329
an awful lot like the princess
who entered the royal harem.

60
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,706
- [Official] Yes, now
that you mention it.

61
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,873
- Really?

62
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,625
I thought she looked
more like that young boy

63
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,711
who was working for
the department of
finance last summer.

64
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,671
Perhaps they're
siblings or relatives.

65
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,548
- Sounds like things will
get hectic around here.

66
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,383
- [Kijin] I'm sure
she's prepared for it.

67
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,343
She has to handle
things on her own.

68
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,803
All we can do is
wait for her to claw

69
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,638
her way up to where we sit.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,432
Don't you agree, Reishin?

71
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,892
- Yes, you're quite
right about that.

72
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,811
- [Announcer] The
king of Saiunkoku,

73
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,897
His Majesty Rykki
Shi, has arrived.

74
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,986
- Things are finally
getting underway.

75
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,905
- Why don't we sit back and
observe these youngsters

76
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,366
as they work together
to create a new era?

77
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,077
- [Announcer] When we
call your name, stand up.

78
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,164
This year, passing in first
place, Jougen Eigetsu Tou.

79
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,040
- Yes.

80
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,753
- And second place,
Bougen Rykren Ran.

81
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,508
(clears throat)

82
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,595
Third place Tanka Shkrei Hong.

83
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,637
- Yes.

84
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,390
(crowd murmurs)

85
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,606
- The aforementioned top
three are hereby acknowledged

86
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,775
for their outstanding
achievements.

87
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:18,651
- Hm.

88
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,910
(exclaims)

89
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,204
- [Shkrei] Miss KochM!

90
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,789
- Huh?

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,541
- Big news, today was the
initiation ceremony and huh?

92
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,045
- I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, Shkrei,

93
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,173
but it would be best if you
stopped coming here for a while.

94
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,091
(exclaims)

95
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,593
(sad music)

96
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,809
- Oh, right, I almost
forgot, we're out of salt.

97
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,894
Maybe I have a bag
of salt please?

98
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,104
- Sure thing.

99
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,021
Oh...

100
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:56,940
- Huh?

101
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,820
It must be getting late,
I'd better hurry on home.

102
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,781
Lord KMyk and General Ran
will be arriving soon.

103
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,199
Huh, ah!

104
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,743
Hello there, ma'am, is your
back feeling any better?

105
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,870
- Ah, yes, yes, thank you.

106
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,038
(fast footsteps)

107
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,914
- Huh?

108
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,207
(gasps)

109
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,125
Ah, hm.

110
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,840
- Excuse me, My Lord.

111
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,049
- [Angry Lord] This is absurd!

112
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,759
You're saying you lost the ring?

113
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,512
The ring signifies
leadership of the Sa clan!

114
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,722
We only just found it.

115
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,849
How could you let this
happen, you idiots?

116
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,268
I already reported
that it had been found.

117
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,061
If they realize I don't have it,

118
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,273
that reward money and chance
for promotion will be lost.

119
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,942
KochM, I'm sorry, but I won't
be staying here tonight.

120
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,236
- What a shame,
that's really too bad.

121
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,614
(bird calls)

122
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,490
(clatters)

123
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,158
- Hm?

124
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,160
(groans)

125
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,787
Let me guess, you got lost
on your way here again?

126
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,955
- Just shut up.

127
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,665
Besides, that's not important.

128
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,167
I'm more interested
in the recent rumors

129
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,502
about you going to
that brothel again.

130
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,171
- You shouldn't be
so jealous, KMyk.

131
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,715
I'm just a normal, healthy,
adult male after all.

132
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,841
- Forget the brothel!

133
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,925
What you need is
a doctor who will

134
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,510
fix that stupid head of yours.

135
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,263
- C'mon, at least I'm
doing my work sufficiently.

136
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,182
For example, I
received a report that

137
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,600
that ring has been found.

138
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,101
- What, really?

139
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,270
- Yes, but apparently it got
lost again soon afterwards.

140
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,688
- What's that supposed to mean?

141
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,148
Is this some kind of joke?

142
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,608
(chuckles)

143
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,068
- Forget it, why
don't we head on over

144
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,737
to Shkrei's house and enjoy
some of her home cooking?

145
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,739
Today's a day to celebrate.

146
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,576
(contemplative music)

147
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,869
- [Shkrei] I don't
get it, it's not like

148
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,788
I've changed at all.

149
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,040
(grunts)

150
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,333
- Ah, I'm so sorry.

151
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,211
- Eigetsu? (gasps)

152
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,755
Don't tell me you got
into another fight.

153
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,673
- I don't know.

154
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,716
It sure does look that way.

155
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,259
- (sighs) What a relief.

156
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,846
At least I didn't run into
your other personality.

157
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,181
- [Seiran] Lady Shkrei!

158
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,933
I've been looking
all over for you.

159
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,850
- Hello Seiran.

160
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,310
- Mr. Seiran.

161
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,896
- Oh, I didn't realize you
were with Eigetsu, My Lady.

162
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,106
- [Eigetsu] Yes.

163
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,899
- Still, I thought I
made it clear to you

164
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,317
that you shouldn't be
going out on your own.

165
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,653
It's too risky and dangerous.

166
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,697
The initiates have just
received their salaries,

167
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,615
meaning each of you has
a large sum of money.

168
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,701
That makes you prime
targets for thugs.

169
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,703
Hm, Eigetsu, you're all beat up.

170
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,788
Don't tell me you've already
been attacked by them.

171
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,289
- No, I haven't and
they couldn't have

172
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,916
gotten anything if they tried.

173
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,961
I sent all the 80 silver
coins back to my hometown.

174
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,088
- [Seiran] You sent all of it?

175
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,297
- Uh-huh.

176
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,341
- Then why did you end
up getting into a fight?

177
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,884
- Well, from what
I can remember,

178
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,220
I was in the estate of
some kind of nobleman.

179
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,681
He was forcing me to
drink wine with him.

180
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,891
And he kept asking me if I'd
like to marry his daughter.

181
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,269
- [Shkrei] You got into a
fight at a nobleman's house?

182
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,021
- No, I made a run
for it right after

183
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,689
he forced me to drink the wine

184
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,150
so I doubt I fought
anyone or made a scene.

185
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,152
- I think it'd probably
be in your best interests

186
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,071
to turn down all banquet
invitations from now on.

187
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,742
- You did pass the exam with
the title of Jougen after all.

188
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,619
Those who place in the top
tier enjoy many privileges

189
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,413
so naturally many people
who would like to become

190
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,331
a relative or an
in-law to a promising

191
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,667
future official will
approach you like that.

192
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,668
- Good point.

193
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,794
It makes a lot more sense when

194
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,087
you put it like
that, Mr. Seiran.

195
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,797
- You did write a
letter to the people

196
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,383
in your hometown to tell them
you passed the exam, right?

197
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,926
- No.

198
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,261
The Department of
Protocols said they would

199
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,138
send a messenger by
horse to notify everybody

200
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,432
so I just gave the money to
the messenger to deliver.

201
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,768
- (groans) Later I'll
give you some paper

202
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,062
and I want you to write a
letter by the end of the day.

203
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,188
- Huh, but why?

204
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,397
- No buts!

205
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,648
You have to tell
everyone back home

206
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,816
that you passed the exam.

207
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,109
It's really important.

208
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,070
Think about all the
people who are waiting

209
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,780
for word about your results.

210
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,324
They'll be much happier to
hear it from you directly.

211
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,285
- Thanks a lot Shkrei.

212
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,703
- [Shkrei] Besides,
you should write

213
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,289
in order to ensure the
safety of your money as well.

214
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,165
- What?

215
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,667
Ensure its safety?

216
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,709
It's not safe?

217
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,919
- Of course it's not safe.

218
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,754
Sending all 80
silver coins at once?

219
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,130
That's way too much.

220
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,799
Even if you go through the
Department of Protocol,

221
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,092
in the hands of the
wrong messenger,

222
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,010
it's only possible
that half of that money

223
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,679
will make it to its destination.

224
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,389
The money should've been
sent in lots of separate,

225
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,433
small amounts that
wouldn't be worth stealing.

226
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,393
- Really?

227
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,977
Wow, you're amazing, Shkrei.

228
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,021
You sure know how to
deal with money issues.

229
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:05,897
(gasps)

230
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,065
- [Seiran] It's true.

231
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,191
When it comes to money,
I don't think anyone

232
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,026
is as clever as Lady Shkrei.

233
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,736
- Hey, stop it, you two.

234
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,863
(laughs)

235
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,992
- [Father] By the
way, when will Shkrei

236
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,911
and the others in her
group receive notice

237
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,871
of their placements, Lord KMyk?

238
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,415
- From what I've heard,
I believe you should

239
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,251
be receiving some sort of
written notice about that soon.

240
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,378
- Oh, yes, of course, I see.

241
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,756
- So this year's national
exam was rather controversial.

242
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,174
- For starters, how about
your younger brother

243
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,385
skipping the
initiation ceremony?

244
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,220
- I have to admit
that one is beyond

245
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,180
even the limits of
my comprehension.

246
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,057
True, I did expect
him to run away

247
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,476
but I didn't expect it
would happen so quickly.

248
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,021
- A case of like older
brother, like younger brother.

249
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,940
Good lord, neither one of you
can take anything seriously.

250
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,401
- I have to say that he's quite

251
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,113
an amazing person in many
ways, both inside and out.

252
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,491
- That's one way of saying it.

253
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,368
To put it bluntly, if
he had passed the exam

254
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,995
in the first place,
I would've lost

255
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,247
all hope for fairness and
justice in this world.

256
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,249
While everybody else was
studying desperately,

257
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,459
he was always sleeping.

258
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,210
On the odd occasions
when he was awake,

259
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,212
he was tooting away
on that flute of his

260
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,214
and to top it all off,
after stuffing his face

261
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,924
full of a meal I made, he says,

262
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,885
"If you end up missing
out on finding a husband

263
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,386
"and raising a family,
I would be happy

264
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,889
"to hire you as
my personal chef."

265
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,849
And he said it with
a straight face.

266
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,060
I seriously wanted to
kick his brains out.

267
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,020
I only restrained
myself because he's

268
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,356
General Ran's younger brother.

269
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,900
- It's very generous of
you to restrain yourself.

270
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,236
- (gasps) Sorry, I didn't
mean to talk like that.

271
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,488
- Don't worry about it, Shkrei.

272
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,074
After all, you were
only telling the truth.

273
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,950
- So I bet you two
are looking forward

274
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,494
to your new job tomorrow.

275
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,453
- Yes.

276
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,830
Let's both do our best, Eigetsu.

277
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,082
- Yep, you bet.

278
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,421
I'm looking forward

279
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,215
to finding out where
we'll be assigned.

280
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,425
- Me too, I wonder where
the two of us will end up.

281
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,302
Although to be
completely honest,

282
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,804
I really hope I'm not assigned

283
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,931
anywhere near the
central palace.

284
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,852
What should I do?

285
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,105
Secretary Kou will
find out for sure.

286
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,940
But then again, he
probably already knows.

287
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,275
- [Eigetsu] Shkrei,
hang in there, okay?

288
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,487
Whatever happens, I'll be
right there by your side.

289
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,989
- Thanks for
reminding me, Eigetsu.

290
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,117
(jazzy music)

291
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,494
(foot steps)

292
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,418
- Secretary Kou.

293
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,461
(gasps)

294
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,965
(jazzy music)

295
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,052
(sighs)

296
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,515
- Senior Secretary,
about last summer.

297
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,308
- [Kijin] What are
you talking about?

298
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,476
- [Shkrei] You don't remember?

299
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,562
I was using the name Shu Hong.

300
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,188
- You must be mistaken.

301
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,025
The Shu Hong I know is a
fairly capable young man.

302
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,068
You would do well to
learn from his example.

303
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,944
- Ah!

304
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,155
Yes.

305
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,322
- By the way, are you
sure it's all right

306
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,949
for you two to be
casually idling

307
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,951
out here at this time of day?

308
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:05,660
- [Initiates] Huh?

309
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,661
- There you are.

310
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,954
What are you two
doing over here?

311
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,122
You're gonna be late.

312
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,123
- [Initiates] Late?

313
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,168
(gasp)

314
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,419
- [Shkrei] Ah, you
gotta be kidding me.

315
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,171
The meeting time stated
in the letter was wrong?

316
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,672
Gimme a break.

317
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,382
- [Eigetsu] We can't afford
to be late on the first day.

318
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,051
- [Rykki] I can only
imagine it's a prank pulled

319
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,385
by someone jealous of you.

320
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,429
- [Shkrei] We sure
seem to be hated a lot.

321
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,556
- It'll be faster if
we cut through here.

322
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,101
- Geez, I had high
hopes for my future

323
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,519
and then all of this happens.

324
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,896
- That's why I'm here.

325
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,439
For the time being,
most of my duties

326
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,317
as king have been handed over
to a more than capable man.

327
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,361
(groans)

328
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,528
- Huh?

329
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,156
- Starting today,
we, I mean, I will be

330
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,199
your personal guard.

331
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,368
- [Initiates] Huh?

332
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,411
(pants)

333
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,164
- Somehow.

334
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,957
- We were able to
make it in time.

335
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,961
- Hey you two, although it's
a little late to say so,

336
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,130
congratulations on
passing the exams.

337
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,966
- [Eigetsu] Aw, they've wilted.

338
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,094
- I put them in my
pocket right after

339
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,262
I picked them, so, forget it.

340
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,931
- [Shkrei] Oh.

341
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,307
Adonis amurensis.

342
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,976
Congratulatory
flowers, thank you.

343
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,436
Well, we should be going.

344
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,074
{\an8}(traditional Japanese music)

345
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,204
(crowd murmurs)

346
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,581
- [Fellow Initiate] So they
actually came because they

347
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,166
don't know what's good for them.

348
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,377
- [Fellow Initiate] Huh,
a woman taking the exams?

349
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,586
- [Fellow Initiate]
I bet they worried

350
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,796
they'd lose face
if no women passed

351
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,631
so they cut her some
slack and passed her.

352
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,383
- [Fellow Initiate] I was
really thrilled to have passed.

353
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,843
When I heard a woman
did it as well,

354
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,262
it wasn't so special anymore.

355
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,264
- [Fellow Initiate] And
taking the Jougen title at 13?

356
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,349
What trick did he
use to manage that?

357
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,268
- [Fellow Initiate] We've
got a woman and a kid.

358
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,145
This year's a total joke.

359
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,438
- [Initiates] Huh?

360
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,439
- Ah, hmph.

361
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,526
- [Announcer] Senior
Secretary Si and Official Ro

362
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,654
of the Department of
Protocol have arrived.

363
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,489
- I must congratulate you all on

364
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,658
passing the national
examinations.

365
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,162
This year, as per His
Majesty, the top 20 examinees

366
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,873
will be temporarily
assigned to the royal court.

367
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,708
Although it is only
for a short time,

368
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,419
I trust you will all make
the most of the opportunity

369
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,171
and learn as much as you can.

370
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,423
In two months, we will
review your performance

371
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,467
and your formal
placements will be decided

372
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,302
based on your abilities.

373
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,680
Until that time, Official Ro
of the Department of Protocol

374
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,766
will be your instructor.

375
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,642
I'm sure he'll
provide you with all

376
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,186
the guidance you'll need.

377
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,563
(dramatic music)

378
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,857
Just a reminder, they
have yet to be appointed

379
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,567
an official title and rank.

380
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,486
Try not to be too harsh on them.

381
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,321
- Yes, of course, I understand.

382
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,238
- Hmm.

383
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,410
- [Ro] You have managed
to place in the top 20

384
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,871
and are the first new officials
of the present king's reign.

385
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,539
As such, you're
in a good position

386
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,665
to be considered for important

387
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,459
government roles in the future.

388
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,461
Over the next two months,
you will be assigned

389
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,214
various practical jobs
in and around the palace.

390
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,757
After one and a half
months, while you're

391
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,300
still working on
your assignments,

392
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,593
you are to put your
thoughts together

393
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,345
and submit a formal report.

394
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,598
You do not have to submit
this report to me personally.

395
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,768
The content and format
is entirely up to you.

396
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,395
Hm.

397
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,772
Initiate Hong, Initiate Tou,
what is the meaning of this?

398
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,899
Your uniforms are
absolutely filthy.

399
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:23,942
- Sir, this is--

400
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,610
- Do not talk back, Initiate.

401
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,487
Your appearance is a disgrace.

402
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,905
Were you under the
impression this place

403
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,699
is some chicken coop?

404
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,867
- [Initiates] We're
very sorry, Official Ro.

405
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,786
- It seems you're
lacking self-awareness.

406
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,538
Very well, I'll see
to it that you're

407
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,164
assigned appropriate work.

408
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,252
I will now issue your
designated assignment areas.

409
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,920
For further details
of your duties,

410
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,923
please inquire within
the departments where
you're assigned.

411
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,762
- [Shkrei] (groans) Bring it on!

412
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,639
If they think this is
gonna discourage me,

413
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,890
they're in for a shock.

414
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,309
I've cleaned lots of
toilets in my old jobs.

415
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,645
(sighs) But it really
stinks all the same.

416
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,647
I guess the stuff that
comes outta great officials

417
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,566
is no different
from the rest of us.

418
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,528
Well, at least with
this, the toilets

419
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,530
now look a little nicer.

420
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,990
- [Official] Oh,
it really stinks.

421
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,325
- [Official] It smells
like there's a pig in here.

422
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,869
- This may be only
a toilet but it's

423
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,329
still horrible having
one of those roam around

424
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,873
the holy royal court.

425
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,502
- Hmph, speaking of which, have
you heard about that report?

426
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,837
(frustrated groan)

427
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,505
- Yes, it seems like
quite a large amount.

428
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,842
- [Shkrei] I am not going
to let this get me down.

429
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,886
- I feel terrible
having an honored Jougen

430
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,638
such as yourself do stuff
like polish my shoes.

431
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,516
- Don't worry, this is
part of my job, after all.

432
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,310
- But I guess with
the meager lifestyle

433
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,978
of someone from way
out in Koku province,

434
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,563
you'd be used to
this sort of work.

435
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,482
- Of course, you're
absolutely right.

436
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,567
Although I must admit,
I've never polished

437
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,277
such fine shoes before.

438
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,403
All right, I'm done!

439
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,279
Ugh!

440
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,364
- Oops, oh, clumsy me.

441
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,740
I lost my balance for a second.

442
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,909
(groans)

443
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,661
- Huh?

444
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,330
- We don't have a
lot of time to waste

445
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,456
so I'll need you to
take care of both of us

446
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,375
at the same time.

447
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,710
- Oh yes, with pleasure, sir.

448
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,878
(gasp)

449
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,004
(chuckle)

450
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,714
- By the way, Official
Waha, what about

451
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,882
that rumor going around?

452
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:11,800
- [Waha] Yes, I heard there was

453
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,968
a ridiculous amount of money.

454
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,763
(comedic music)

455
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,558
(splashes)

456
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,559
(gasps)

457
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,645
(laughs)

458
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,438
(groans)

459
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,357
- Oh, sorry about that.

460
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,567
- That's all right, sir.

461
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,903
- I leave organizing
these documents up to you.

462
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,365
(gasp)

463
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,575
(determined exhale)

464
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,619
(pants)

465
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,623
- Shu is still cleaning
the palace toilets?

466
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,792
Poor thing, it's been
half a month already.

467
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,717
And despite being a
top-ranking Jougen,

468
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,386
Initiate Tou is still out
there polishing shoes.

469
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,013
- [Kijin] Their
instructor is Official Ro.

470
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,514
It can't be helped.

471
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,600
Those capable of clawing their
way to the top will do so.

472
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,602
Don't concern yourself with it.

473
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,480
That aside, Ykri,
take these documents.

474
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,773
Toilet cleaning
and shoe polishing

475
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,316
duties are in the morning.

476
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,776
I believe they
spend the afternoon

477
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,362
organizing documents
in the archives.

478
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,780
Add these to their pile of work

479
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,575
before either Shkrei
or Recruit Tou arrive.

480
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,451
(gasps)

481
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,660
- How could you?

482
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,746
I'm disappointed in
you, Senior Secretary.

483
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,581
People are already making
things more difficult

484
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,417
for them by giving them
additional work out of spite.

485
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,335
- [Kijin] So?

486
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,044
What of it?

487
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,921
In the meantime, why
don't you come up

488
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,424
with your objections while
you read over these documents?

489
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,884
- Hm?

490
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:36,760
(gasps)

491
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,053
Then, these are...

492
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,429
- [Kijin] Go.

493
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,430
I've heard enough
of your complaints.

494
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,264
- Yes sir.

495
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:45,977
- [Shkrei] They say
part of learning

496
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,771
is three years on a rock.

497
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,647
I just have to keep
believing that one day

498
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,358
all of this is gonna pay off.

499
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,987
All right, at last
I'm finished here.

500
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,113
Huh?

501
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,157
Oh hello, you're Hakumei
Heki, aren't you?

502
00:19:59,199 --> 00:19:59,991
(bell chimes)

503
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,785
- Hmph.

504
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,995
- Hey, what's wrong, do
you have a stomachache?

505
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,163
- It's not that.

506
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,790
Aren't you even
annoyed by all this?

507
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,166
I mean, come on, you've
been doing nothing

508
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,960
but cleaning these toilets
for half a month now.

509
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:11,628
- Well...

510
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,005
- [Hakumei] Hm, guess it's true.

511
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,715
Maybe women really
are better suited

512
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,175
for this kind of work.

513
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,512
You're a woman, so why did
you take the national exams?

514
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,680
- [Shkrei] Well, I--

515
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,390
- It's because of
you taking the exam

516
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,766
that I only ranked fourth.

517
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,727
Me, the one hailed by
everyone as a child prodigy.

518
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,813
It's a total embarrassment
to have placed below

519
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,482
someone who is now in
charge of cleaning toilets.

520
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,609
(exhales)

521
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,527
- Hmph.

522
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,489
- [Shkrei] Pardon me, I have
to work in the archives next.

523
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,657
I should probably get going.

524
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:41,533
- Hm?

525
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,493
Hmph.

526
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,995
(string music)

527
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,084
(curious vocalization)

528
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,633
- Huh?

529
00:20:58,675 --> 00:20:59,884
Mm.

530
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,761
- It must be boring
cleaning the toilets.

531
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,179
That's why I've
agreed to specially

532
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,889
allow you to assist
with my work.

533
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,642
You ought to be grateful
for my generosity.

534
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,186
Make sure everything's done
by tomorrow morning, hm?

535
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:12,856
- Yes sir.

536
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,190
I'll be sure to have it done.

537
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,446
(sighs)

538
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,907
- You're a woman, so why did
you take the national exams?

539
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,826
(troubled sigh)

540
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,911
- Oh well, I guess I should
try and get some of this

541
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,830
done before Eigetsu gets here.

542
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:29,831
- Hello, Shkrei.

543
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,166
- Huh?

544
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,167
- Ah, Lord KMyk.

545
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,252
- I was looking for Lord ShMka

546
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,504
but it seems he's not
here at the moment.

547
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,132
Have you finished cleaning
the toilets already?

548
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,050
- Yes.

549
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,595
- Is this part of your work?

550
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,554
- No, it's not.

551
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,097
Mm, yes, it is.

552
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,683
Eigetsu and I agreed
to take on this work.

553
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:50,643
- I see.

554
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:52,228
Mm.

555
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:00,779
Fight your way up.

556
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,946
(gasps)

557
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,907
From here on in, you're
on your own, Shkrei.

558
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,993
Don't expect any more
help from Shkei or myself.

559
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,828
But even so, you
gotta claw your way up

560
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,830
until you reach your goal.

561
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,874
Passing as Tanka as
your age had nothing

562
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,085
to do with my assistance
or Lord ShMka's.

563
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,128
It happened because
you had a strong desire

564
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,505
within your heart.

565
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,215
Otherwise, you never
could've become Tanka

566
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,008
at the age of 17.

567
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,803
There is a place you
wanna get to, isn't there?

568
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,180
(harp music)

569
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,100
- Yes, there is.

570
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,604
- Mm, from now on,
it's that dream

571
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,731
of yours that's gonna support
you and keep you going.

572
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,066
Keep fighting your
way to the top

573
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,151
as if your life depended on it.

574
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,611
We'll be waiting.

575
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:42,821
(gasps)

576
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,822
- Thank you Lord KMyk.

577
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,865
Thank you for reminding me.

578
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:48,576
(gasps)

579
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,244
Lord KMyk!

580
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,704
- Ah?

581
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,080
What is it?

582
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,040
It's almost time for lunch
so I'm on my way out.

583
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,752
- Well, you see the
exit, isn't over there.

584
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:01,715
- (grunts) This mountain of
books is so disorienting!

585
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,967
Why do they insist on having
so many books in here?

586
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,136
Just because it's the archives.

587
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:09,889
(traditional Japanese music)

588
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,017
- Ah!

589
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:12,892
Hm.

590
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,897
(snores)

591
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,824
- [KMyk] From now on,
it's that dreams of yours

592
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,826
that's gonna support
you and keep you going.

593
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,161
Keep fighting your
way to the top

594
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,580
as if your life depended on it.

595
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,331
- The one thing that
will always support me

596
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,834
is that dream of mine.

597
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:41,713
(traditional Japanese music)

598
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:51,139
{\an8}(peaceful music in
foreign language)

599
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,211
- [Shkrei] Whether
it's toilet cleaning

600
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,839
or shoe polishing, I'll
do whatever I have to.

601
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,217
There's no way I'm gonna give
into harassment like this.

602
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,176
Huh?

603
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,012
Lord KMyk, are you all right?

604
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,888
You look a little
under the weather.
