00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,525
[SOSUKE]
Trust me.

2
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:22,358
When he puts his mind to it,
Uta's lyrics are great.

3
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:23,983
So! Think about it!

4
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:26,817
If a song were composed
just for you by yours truly,

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,358
and Uta here wrote the
perfect lyrics to go with it,

6
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:30,692
would you sing it?

7
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,150
I bet we could make
something special together.

8
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,108
[SAKU]
Uh--

9
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,608
Enough music talk, I want food!

10
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:39,400
And when I'm hungry,
I start to waste away.

11
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:42,025
This stiff wind will
carry me off like a leaf.

12
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,692
Oh no, there I go.

13
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,317
Don't be so dramatic!

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,983
Anyway, we'll take
two Volcano curries.

15
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:50,400
Order up! Two Volcano curries!

16
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:24,567
{\an8}Volcano! Volcano!
Volcano! Volcano!

17
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,192
{\an8}I heard you the first time!

18
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,192
[UTA]
Volcano!

19
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:30,775
Oh, wow!

20
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:33,733
This is the greatest curry
I've ever had in my life!

21
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,692
You're over-exaggerating, right?

22
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:40,108
Have you forgotten?
At my house yesterday,

23
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:43,858
you literally cried tears of
joy over my homemade curry.

24
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,108
I can't get over the
flavor of this roux.

25
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,608
Saku! That's what
people call you, right?

26
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,483
You're Kai's new classmate?

27
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,733
I am.

28
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,942
This curry's awesome,
so I gotta get seconds.

29
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,108
[KAI grunts]
So, you're just gonna abandon me

30
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:00,192
the moment Saku's
curry comes along?

31
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:01,942
Mine's not good enough, huh?

32
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:05,233
Well, when something's
that good, I kinda...

33
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:06,525
[KAI groans]

34
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:09,983
[SAKU] They do know
I'm just a waiter, right?

35
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,067
[KAI]
I don't accept this.

36
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,900
What're you doing, Kai?

37
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:17,400
Saku. It's nothing personal.

38
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,608
I'm sorry, but my
pride is on the line

39
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:22,442
and I have to do whatever
I can to defend it.

40
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,900
I challenge you to a
culinary cook-off of curry!

41
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:26,733
[SAKU]
Mm?

42
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:27,942
[KAI]
And if you accept,

43
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,733
then it will happen
next weekend.

44
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:32,442
The Archaeology Club is
going out to the first ward.

45
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,483
We'll be going there with Mr.
Usuki to observe the white wall.

46
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,900
And it would be
the perfect stage

47
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,817
to host our culinary showdown.

48
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,942
[SAKU gasps]
The white wall.

49
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:43,275
[NOZOMI]
There are beings in this world

50
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,775
called "white shadows."

51
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,983
They hide in the nooks and
crannies of pale-washed walls,

52
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,400
trees, plants,
and in the twisting alleys

53
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:52,233
around every corner.

54
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:56,358
These entities watch over
and protect us all.

55
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,233
Wow...

56
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,650
They can even heal
injuries and sickness,

57
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,483
if we need them to
and we ask nicely.

58
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,900
[KAI]
There's a beach out there.

59
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,483
That's prob'ly where we'll camp.

60
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:08,733
And when you go out camping,

61
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:10,650
there's only one way
you're allowed to cook.

62
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,650
There's no other option!
We're cooking outdoors!

63
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,692
And you know what
cooking outdoors means.

64
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,817
We have to make curry! Right?

65
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,400
That's a bit of a stretch.

66
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:22,108
Anyway, once Saku and
I have our cook-off,

67
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,108
we can have everyone on
the trip taste our dishes

68
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:25,567
and decide which is best!

69
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,733
An unbiased panel of judges!

70
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,400
And they'll decide the victor!

71
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:31,900
It's curry! Served
with a side of justice.

72
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:34,650
You're overreacting,
don't you think?

73
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,317
I think this seems
appropriate, so, no.

74
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,358
[MIKE sighs]
Sorry, guys.

75
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:41,900
He gets like this sometimes,
so just ignore him.

76
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:43,483
Pretend this never happened.

77
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:44,317
Sure?

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,817
[KAI]
Don't you dare!

79
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,900
We'll have our battle.
There's no way outta this!

80
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:51,233
Okay...?

81
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:55,317
All right! The two of us are
now bona fide curry rivals!

82
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,942
Let's have an honorable duel!

--Uh...
--Free food sounds fun!

Okay! Count me in!
I want some curry!

00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:03,942
[SOSUKE]
You're eating curry right now.

86
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,358
You guys can come, too!

87
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:07,442
I'd like for more people
to come taste my curry.

88
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:08,692
Yeah? Then we'll be there!

89
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,775
And we'll be sure
to come hungry!

00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,942
[sighs] Whatever.

91
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,108
We've got a batch of
this instant curry

92
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:22,442
that's gonna expire soon.
We can't sell it anymore,

93
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,483
but it's still
perfectly fine to eat.

94
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,442
You wanna take any?

95
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:30,650
Sure. I guess...
I'll take one, then.

96
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,108
Heh...

97
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,233
[yawns]

98
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,650
We really can't wait
much longer, y'know.

99
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,067
[KAI gasps]

100
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,317
Please just give him a couple
more minutes, Mr. Usuki!

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,025
I'm positive that he'll make it!

102
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:54,067
Your curry is
perfectly tasty already,

103
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,275
so I'm fine if you're
the only one making any.

104
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,733
I appreciate the
compliment, Chiguman!

105
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,567
But this contest is necessary.

106
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,233
I have to see whose is
better once and for all!

107
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:06,692
What's Saku doing?
Do you think he ditched us?

108
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,858
Don't tell me we have to
go all by ourselves.

109
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:10,608
Nah, I wouldn't worry about it.

110
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:12,317
You just gotta believe!

111
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,483
He'll be here any minute.

112
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,483
Like right now. See, look,
he's right over there.

Wait, what?

00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:25,192
[KAI]
Well! Look who showed up.

115
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:26,358
Lemme guess, you're late because

116
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,733
you were practicing
your recipe, right?

117
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:32,317
Uh, yeah. Right.

118
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,983
This curry cook-off
is gonna be so good!

119
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,817
Hey there, I'm the head
of the Archaeology Club,

It's nice to meet you!

Same here.

00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,358
By the way,

123
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,942
I never meant for you to
get roped into all of this.

124
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:48,400

proportion when he gets upset.

Gotcha.

00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:58,358
Yeah. For sure.

129
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:00,650
[USUKI]
Okay, let's get out of here.

[ALL]
'Kay!

131
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,983
All right.

132
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,067
The goal of our field work out
here is to survey the white wall

133
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,942
that stands just along the
drop-off out in the water.

134

Each Archaeology Club member,
and, uh, all of you other guys,

135
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:35,358
should make close observations
and form broad opinions

136
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,358
about the wall and
its potential meaning.

[UTA] Yay! I love the sea
and the sea loves me!

you're stripping!

Wait for me!

Hey, let's go.

146
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:01,192
We have a curry contest
to attend to, don't we?

147
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:03,067
Now, follow me!

There they all go.

Research is a solitary
endeavor after all.

[CHIGUMA]
Aren't you going the wrong way

152
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,692
to study the white wall?

153
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:18,817
--[SOSUKE, UTA laughing]
--[MIKE] Will you stop?

154
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Of course. But instead of going
straight into the water,

155
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:24,525
what's wrong with
investigating the source?

156
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:27,025
Right. That makes sense.

157
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:30,108
The wall first emerged where
the 9th ward meets the 1st ward,

158
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:31,692
before spreading
outward from there

159
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:34,150
until it became the

So, in order to be effective,

162
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,733
any research we do on the wall
must include the 9th ward.

And for some reason,

164
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,400
there are ruins of the 9th
ward here in this forest.

165
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,775

Oh, c'mon!

of the white wall
