00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,983
Yeah.

162
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:33,067
What now?

163
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,650
[KAORU]
Fighting leads to nothing good.

164
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,025
It increases aggravation,
which makes both parties

165
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,650
unable to process their
thoughts rationally.

166
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,442
Sugar can help ease
tensions at times like these.

167
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,025
Allow me to treat the
both of you to some sweets.

168
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,275
Oh, hey, Kaoru!

169
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:48,233
What do sweets have
to do with this?

170
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:49,942
[KAORU] Pleased to
make your acquaintance.

171
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,442
I'm Kaoru Narugo
from the Culture Club.

172
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,150
Now, come with me.

173
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:03,108
[KAORU]
Here you are, gentleman.

174
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:06,192
I brought some cannoli for you.
They're imported from Sicily.

175
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,692
Typically, they're served
with cappuccinos or espresso,

176
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,150
but matcha pairs
surprisingly well.

177
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,442
Now, then.
Please help yourselves.

178
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:18,150
Oh, wow! Don't mind if I do!

179
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:22,192
Whoa! Tasty!

180
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,192
Yeah!

181
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,692
Make sure you take
a sip of the matcha.

182
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:32,650
--That's great!
--[SAKU] Mm.

183
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,733
Heh.

184
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,275
So? What's the plan?

185
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:43,317
Do you just want those
two to make up, or what?

186
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,567
Well yeah.

187
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,150
Sosuke and Uta have both
helped me out so much

188
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,942
ever since I came
to this school.

189
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,275
Visiting my sister.

190
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:55,442
Pushing me to work
on songs. Everything.

191
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:57,900
We just became friends
but they're there for me.

192
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,608
--[HINATA] Right.
--[KAORU] Mm.

193
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,525
So then this time,

194
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:04,858
I want to help them.
By ending this fight.

195
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:06,858
[KAORU]
Hmm.

196
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:10,400
Do you believe that this
will resolve itself on its own?

197
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:13,067
I talked to them and
heard both of their sides.

198
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:18,317
[SAKU] Neither one of them are
necessarily in the wrong.

199
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,358
They're both right
in different ways.

200
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:25,108
It's hard. I don't see
how they'll reconcile.

201
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,442
That's how it can be
when they're that close.

202
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,567
You can't force them to make up.

203
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,192
Let them work it
out on their own.

204
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:35,233
[HINATA] Hm. Yeah, that's
a pretty good point.

205
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:40,150
I just don't like seeing
them fight. It's sad.

206
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,650
I'd like it...

207
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,358
...if they got along again,
even if it's selfish.

208
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,608
[USHIO]
Excellent!

209
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:46,858
[ALL gasp]

210
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:48,858
[USHIO] A passionate
friendship between men,

211
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:52,108
a bond found in its perfect
state only here in Japan!

212
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:55,483
And you, trying to do everything
you can to conserve this legacy!

213
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:56,733
Good sir!

214
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,483
You're the epitome of
the Japanese gentleman!

215
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,108
Oh, hello, Ushio.

216
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,358
Perfect.

217
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:04,983
Kaoru, you could learn
a thing or two from him!

218
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,525
How dare you pair these western
pastries with Japanese matcha!

219
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,608
Since ancient times,
it has been established that

220
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:13,942
matcha should be served with
Japanese confections only!

221
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:14,983
Have you never heard of

222
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,317
experimental flavor
profiles before?

223
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,233
No, I haven't.
That sounds gross.

224
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:22,983
All of your nonsensical
talk has made me hungry.

225
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:26,358
Good grief. You tend to be
far too old fashioned.

226
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,733
There's no shame in trying new
things from around the world.

227
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:33,192
Oh, please. I'm simply
more refined.

228
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,900
Ah. Japanese tea is the best.

229
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:39,358
Oh, yes.

230
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,983
But what you just drank is
black tea. It's from China.

231
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,192
Huh?

232
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,233
[USHIO]
How dare you deceive me!

233
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,233
It wasn't on purpose, I swear.

234
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,775
You need to question
your ordinary,

235
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:54,733
and broaden your
horizons, that's all!

236
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,025
You fool! Seems
your mind has been

237
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,275
poisoned by
inferior confections!

238
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,567
Should we stop them?

239
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,608
[HINATA] Nah, this happens
all the time. Don't worry.

240
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,233
If you're sure.

241
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,525
You need to question

What is the meaning of this?

00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:49,358
You didn't tell me he'd be here.

254

[SAKU]
Hold on!

255
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:54,025
Both of you have good points,
but you need to work this out.

256
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,275
Come on.

257
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:58,900
Look, man. I understand
how you feel, all right?

258
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:02,150
But growth is important to me,
I'm not gonna budge on this one.

259
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,067
Stubborn even
when you're wrong.

260
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,942
I'm right!

No, guys, listen.

262
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:08,525
I think I know a way to
prove one of you is right.

263
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:09,900
[UTA, SOSUKE]
Hm?

264
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,775
[SAKU] Uta, you think we
should make original songs,

265
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:13,900
and we shouldn't borrow
ideas from others.

266
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,150
And Sosuke, you think
our music will get stale

267
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,983
if we don't study other
bands' styles, right?

268
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,983
Well, let's test those theories!

269
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,775
[BOTH]
But how?

270
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,067
Normally, when the two
of you work on a song,

271
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,650
Sosuke, you usually
compose first.

272
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:31,942
And Uta adds lyrics second.

273
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:33,942
That's how it's always been.

274
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:36,400
But what if you
did it backwards?

275
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:37,650
[BOTH]
By why?

276
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,150
Uta writes the lyrics
without music, from scratch.

277
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:43,650
Yeah?

278
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,275
[SAKU] And Sosuke has to compose
based on what Uta writes.

279
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:48,275
You'll have to match
his style this time.

280
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:49,275
Sure?

281
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,358
[SAKU]
You said it yourself that

282
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:52,025
you want to be a
professional musician,

283
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,442
and that being
versatile enough to

284
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,275
work off someone else's style
is part of that, right?

285
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:58,442
Uh. I guess so?

286
00:14:58,525 --> 00:14:59,858
[SAKU]
Then I'll serve as the judge,

287
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,900
and listen to what
you come up with.

288
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:04,150
I'll figure out if
one of you is right.

289
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,733
Or if you're both right!

290
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:09,442
Or even if you guys
are both totally wrong.

291
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,942
It's worth a try. Isn't it?

00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:14,567
Yeah, I'm fine
with that. Careful.

We've never worked
in this order before

can't "Handel" it.
