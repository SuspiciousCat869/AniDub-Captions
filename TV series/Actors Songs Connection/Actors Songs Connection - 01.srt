called "white shadows."

nothing to sneeze at either!

00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:26,733
[ODAWARA] Do you mind
taking these with you and

160
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:29,275
distributing them for my
class later this afternoon?

161
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,442
I'd greatly appreciate it.

162
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,608
[MIKE] Yes, sir,
that's no problem at all.

163
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,775
Consider it done, Mr. Odawara.

164
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:36,650
[KAI]
Hey, Mikey!

165
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:37,483
[MIKE gasps]

166
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,525
Wassup? Bring it in, buddy!

167
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,233
Kai? Wassup yourself.

168
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,150
Get offa me!

169
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,692
How nice.

170
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,067
Well, you boys have fun.

171
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,942
[MIKE]
Uh, yes, sir.

172
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,067
We will! Right, Mikey?

173
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,858
Shut up, you idiot! And get off!

174
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,275
Anyway,

175
00:08:57,358 --> 00:08:58,692
have you seen that new
transfer student around here?

176
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,942
Huh? What transfer student?

177
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,608
You know. Saku?

178
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,400
Mr. Chono asked me
to look after him,

179
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:05,650
show him around campus,

180
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,567
and tell him about
club activities and stuff.

181
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,233
But as soon as lunch
started, he ran off,

182
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,525
and I haven't seen him since!

183
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,275
How would I know where he went?

184
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:14,692
Oh, Mikey.

185
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,108
Also! Quit it!

186
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,775
My name isn't pronounced
"Mikey," It's Mike! You got it?

187
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,942
So, make sure you get it right.

188
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:24,483
If you say so, Mikey!

189
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,900
Screw you. Now you're
doing it on purpose.

190
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,858
[KAI]
Huh?

191
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:32,442
Fine, go ahead and play dumb.

192
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,942
At least make yourself
useful and carry these.

193
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,567
[KAI] Hang on, Mikey,
I don't have time right now!

194
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,400
I'm supposed to be looking
for the transfer student.

195
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,233
[MIKE] I told you not to
call me that at school!

196
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:44,608
[KAI chuckles]

197
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:47,775
[SOSUKE] Hey, Uta.
Where are you right now?

198
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,108
What?

199
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:51,275
What do you mean you're
already back at the dorm?

200
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,733
Don't you remember?

201
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:56,025
We were supposed to
work on our new song today.

202
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:59,775
And after I went out of my way
to get you lunch and everything.

203
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:00,817
Huh?

204
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,108
[SAKU]
Hm?

205
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:05,817
[SATSUMA] The song is nice,
but we can't do anything with it

206
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,983
if we don't have the original
creator's permission.

207
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,317
[RYO]
That's true.

208
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,733
Do you have a plan for how
you'll get the go-ahead?

209
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:14,233
I actually follow the
composer on social media.

210
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:17,233
So I'll reach out. That might
be the easiest way to do it.

211
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,692
Uh-huh. Yeah. Fine.

212
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:22,692
'Kay, then, I'll call you later.

213
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:27,275
So, you must be
Saku, the new kid.

214
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:30,733
And you're eating up
here all by yourself?

215
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,317
Y'know Kai's lookin' for you.

216
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,650
Uh?

217
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,067
Just relax. I get it,
you're probably wondering

218
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,400
who the hell I am, right?

219
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:39,692
[SAKU]
Mm.

220
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,983
We're in the same class,
if you didn't know.

221
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:44,858
The name's Sosuke Kagura.

222
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:46,067
Okay?

223
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,608
Yeah. Pleasure's mine.

224
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,483
Uh, likewise.

225
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,692
Hold on. Is that really
all you have to eat?

226
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:53,817
You want one of these?

227
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,692
Uh, sure, I guess.
If you're offering.

228
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,233
It's no problem.

229
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,983
I actually brought it for a
friend of mine, but he bailed.

230
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:05,275
[SAKU]
I just took it without thinking,

231
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:07,150
but maybe I shouldn't have.

232
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,442
[phone buzzes]

233
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,567
[SOSUKE]
What the?

234
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:23,942
[USUKI]
Mitsuki. Do you have a minute?

235
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:27,233
[gasps] Mr. Usuki.

236
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:29,067
Sure. I've got time.

237
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,400
[USUKI] Great.
Then I'll cut to the chase.

238
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,775
I'm wondering. Have you
made any progress so far?

239
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:37,275
[MITSUKI] Are you referring
to the "white wall"?

240
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:38,608
[USUKI]
I am.

241
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:42,442
Apologies. Nothing to
report yet, unfortunately.

242
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:45,567
That said, I did find the
"conduit" you were looking for,

243
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,483
if that's any consolation.

244
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,067
Conduit?

245
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,817
You mean the one
to the 9th ward?

246
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,192
That's right.

247
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:54,817
Mr. Odawara assisted
me in tracking it down.

248
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,483
The information
is quite limited,

249
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:59,067
but I do have access to
enough for a good lead.

250
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,983
Well, that's incredible news.

251
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:03,817
But, sir, I know you're
aware that the 9th ward

252
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,150
rarely shares any
information at all.

253
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,733
So if there's a leak, the source
will be easily identified

254
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:10,817
and then quickly cut off.

255
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,317
[MITSUKI] That's why
we don't hear much about

256
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,692
their internal affairs,
which makes things difficult.

257
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:19,983
That makes sense. Such a strict

258
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,317
information management
system was to be expected,

259
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,192
so I suppose that's no surprise.

260
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:28,900
I understand. Please continue
on with your research.

261
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,817
Absolutely, sir.

262
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,733
[HINATA]
Get a loada this!

263
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,733
That song's composer
goes to our school!

264
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:40,108
Wow! In that case, it should be
easy to talk to him in person.

265
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,775
Yeah! I'll message
him and see if he'll

266
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,650
meet up after class.

267
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,192
Have a good one Mr. Usuki!

268
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,067
Thanks! You two get home safe!

[JUDO STUDENT 1A groans]

Huh?

271
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,900
[SOSUKE]
Uh, hi?

00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:24,233
Hey! Are you that "Utasuke" guy?

Yeah. I am.

So then... I assume
one of you is "S-U-N."

Oh! "SUN." That's me.

276
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:35,692
But my IRL name's Hinata.
Nice to meet you!

277
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,192
Sure. Same.

278
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,525
So, you guys wanted to sing
one of my songs. That right?

279
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:41,775
But which one?

280
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,025
[HINATA]
Uh-huh!

281
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,150
We all listened to
"Cloudy Day" and loved it!

282
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,108
The next singing
competition's soon,

283
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,400
and we were hoping that
we could sing your song!

284
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:52,775
So your club wants to
do a cover? For real?

285
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,150
[HINATA]
Yeah.

286
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,442
I'm not sure.

287
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:59,067
Is that... a "no"?

288
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,525
It's not a "no," but... I just
don't think it's possible.

289
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:04,858
Nothing personal, guys.

290
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,733
[SATSUMA] Are you worried
that none of our singers

291
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,442
have the range?

And have you ever heard our
Singing Club in action before?

298
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:23,400
Can't say that I
have. But still,

299
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:25,900
that song was made for
VOCALOIDs with unlimited range,

300
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:28,858
and wasn't exactly written
with the human voice in mind.

301
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,942
Like I said before, it's nothing
personal, I'm just saying.

302
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:34,150
Yes. That's true.

of singing, Sosuke?
