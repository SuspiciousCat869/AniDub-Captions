161
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:44,025
[SAKU] I should start
heading over to the hospital.

162
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,275
I'm coming with!

163
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:47,067
Yeah, we need a breather.

164
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:53,483
Don't interfere, Keishi.

165
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:57,692
Stop this! Please reconsider!

166
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,567
I was so close to getting
the players to come back!

167
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,108
If you'd just give me
a little more time,

168
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,858
we can save Thrive Central!

169
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:05,608
As I have explained
to you before,

170
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,900
there is nothing in
Thrive Central worth saving.

171
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,067
You've deluded yourself
into seeing the inhabitants

172
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,317
of that world as people,
but they're just templates

173
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,983
that can be copied
and mass produced--

174
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,275
No!

175
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:17,650
You haven't been observing
them the way I have.

176
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,817
They're all individuals,
with hopes and dreams

177
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,692
and aspirations!

178
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,817
They're no different
than either of us!

179
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,358
[BOSS]
Mr. Harumoto.

180
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,400
Do you fancy yourself
a hero who's going to

181
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:29,150
save them all from the void?

182
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,442
Your nonsense has
gone on far enough.

183
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:33,483
Just think of what
we stand to gain.

184
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,483
The Actors will be
far more useful to us

185
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,233
once we convert them into data.

186
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:42,025
[KEISHI]
Please, I'm begging you!

187
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:50,608
Saku! Thank goodness
you've arrived.

188
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,650
You sister's condition
has suddenly taken a turn

189
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,733
for the worse.

190
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:57,275
We have her on an IV
and she's stable for now,

191
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,858
but we have to keep a
round-the-clock watch on her.

192
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,900
But why? This is so sudden.

193
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,692
She was doing fine
when we came to see her

194
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,358
the other day,
so what happened between

195
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:06,483
then and now?

196
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:10,942
Come and see her right away.

197
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,192
Please follow me.

198
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,650
You guys can head back.

199
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:14,692
Saku!

200
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:15,942
Do as he says!

201
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,567
We have to give
them their space.

202
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,775
[UTA]
Okay.

203
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,775
I'm sorry, Saku.

204
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,483
I really thought
I was getting better.

205
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,983
I only have one regret.

206
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,525
I wish I could watch
you boys sing.

207
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,900
Nozomi. You can!

208
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:54,067
Just focus on that and
you can still pull through!

209
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,442
I don't have that kind of
optimism in me anymore.

210
00:11:57,525 --> 00:11:58,608
Stop it!

211
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:00,400
Please don't talk like
it's over already!

212
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,775
Just listen.

213
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,817
Being with Sosuke and Uta
taught me something.

214
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,525
That words, or lyrics,
have immeasurable power.

215
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,317
Enough to affect the world.

216
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,900
So I need you to say that
you're going to be healed!

217
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:17,650
If you say it,
and you believe it,

218
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,983
you can speak that
truth into reality!

219
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:23,733
Saku.
You've grown up so much.

220
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:28,108
I'm so proud of how
strong you've become.

221
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:29,983
Uh... Do you really think so?

222
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:35,233
If that's true, it's probably
all thanks to them.

223
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,942
I almost gave up so many times.

224
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,942
But they taught
me to keep trying.

225
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,108
And then,

226
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,442
we found more than
I ever expected.

227
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:50,650
Nozomi.

228
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,650
You have to keep
hanging on, too.

229
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,275
Please don't give
up on yourself.

230
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,483
You wanted to come see
us perform, didn't you?

231
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,358
You're not allowed
to leave us yet.

232
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:02,858
Not when you have so
much you still have to do!

233
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,442
I believed all of that
when I said it, but...

234
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,858
What am I supposed to do now?

235
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:18,525
Been a while.
I hope Saku's okay.

236
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:20,192
And his sister too.

237
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:23,067
What can we even do for
them at a time like this?

238
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,233
A song, maybe?

239
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:29,483
[MITSUKI] You can't keep
us in the dark like this!

240
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:30,942
We want answers, now!

Look here! We've compiled
a list of requests for you!

242

Please!

243
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,567
Surely you at least have
the decency to read them!

244
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,900
Are you listening?!

245
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:40,567
You thugs have some nerve!

246
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,483
[KAORU] Mr. Chono,
you have to calm down!

247
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,983
[USUKI]
All of you! Silence!

248
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,108
Mr. Usuki?

249
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,608
Washiho! We've been
looking all over for you!

250
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:53,900
Wait, hold on,
how did you get inside?

251
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:01,192
Because I'm the one in
charge of this operation.

252
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,733
It's time; ready the broadcast.

government-issued warning.

You're gonna give
yourself a conniption.

Is it just me, or does
something seem off

with Mr. Usuki?

Just what are you?

00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,192
Are you some god?

00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,442
Or a spirit?

324
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:56,317
I asked for you
to save my sister!

325
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,942
But it didn't help.
And she's about to die!

But you can save
yourself, and her.

In order to preserve

do as I say.

332
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,983
You need to take the
fact that you're alive

333
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,775
and imbue it into a song!

You have to show them
it's not just a simulation.

[UTA]
Saku!

349
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,400
Uta and I were just talking.
We figured something out.

350
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:18,650
Yeah!

351
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,525
No matter what happens,
we still have our music!

You guys're right.

That's what the
white shadow meant.

You saw one here?

We have to go find Mitsuki!

357
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:42,025
The white shadow spoke,
and it claimed it was Keishi?

358
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,067
Yes.

359
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,858
And he told me
something else too.

360
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:46,358
He said that the
world is in danger

361
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:48,608
and we need to sing
a song to save it!

362
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,108
That must be why
the singing competition

363
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:51,317
was so important.

364

I think I understand now.

365
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,817
I knew music was the answer!

366
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,317
Sure is a lucky coincidence!

Wait, we have a major problem.

cracking down on singing,

don't quite understand yet.

What's this "outside world"?
