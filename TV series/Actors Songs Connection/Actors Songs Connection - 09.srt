before we could do
much to help them.

77
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,108
My theory is this:

78
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:51,567
he was attempting to catch
the cat and it scratched him.

79
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,983
And then he fell down the
stairs in the back alley.

80
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,733
Which is what caused
all of the ruckus.

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,567
But nothing severe
enough that we'd have to

84
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,233
track it down and bring it
to a vet, I think.

We couldn't get a
good look at his face.

But he was wearing
a gray hoodie.

89

And he had a medium build.

90
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,942
If he ran off immediately
after falling down the stairs,

91
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,192
then he must be someone
quite athletic, as well.

inevitably strike again.

Instead of aimlessly searching,

00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,483
