1
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:21,025
[gasps]

2
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:23,067
Whoa, more cats.

3
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,525
[SAKU gasps]

4
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,358
G'mornin'!

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,275
Uh. Yeah. Morning, Hinata.

6
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,983
{\an8}[SAKU]
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:03,525
{\an8}[HINATA]
Hm? About what?

8
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:06,900
{\an8}My place is so out of the way,
but you still pick me up.

9
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:08,900
Isn't it a pain to
get up that early?

10
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:10,358
Nah, don't worry about it.

11
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:13,650
Honestly? I'm up at
the crack of dawn anyway.

12
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,442
Well, thanks then.

13
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,692
[HINATA] Soo, have you decided
on which club you're gonna join?

14
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:21,317
Uh, no. I mean, not yet?

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,858
Then you should
come check ours out!

16
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,442
Who knows, you might like it!

17
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:26,692
Remind me which club
are you're in again?

18
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:27,983
It's the Singing Club!

19
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,650
[SAKU]
Oh, that's right.

20
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,900
Think about it.

21
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:33,275
You know that you're an
awesome singer, right?

22
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:36,525
Just drop by after
school today and see!

23
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:40,275
It's okay. I'm not that
interested in clubs, honestly.

24
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:42,525
Really? Well, if you're sure.

25
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:44,275
Yeah, I'm sure.

26
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:47,525
[HINATA]
Just sayin'.

27
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:49,150
Joining a club can be a
great way to make friends

28
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,733
after you're done with classes.

29
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:52,067
[SAKU]
I have to work.

30
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,775
[HINATA]
Oh, okay.

31
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,108
[MIKE]
Hinata.

32
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:59,233
Oh, hey there, Mike!
Good to see ya, man!

33
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:00,692
Check it.

34
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:02,317
Check what?

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,817
Is that the rare Mendako
March merch? No way!

36
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,442
[MIKE chuckles]

37
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,942
You're so lucky!
They're hard to get!

38
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,317
[MIKE chuckles]

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,817
That being said...

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,108
What the hell?
How'd you get two of 'em?

41
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:17,692
I'm lucky, too.

42
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:19,567
Hey. Good Morning, Saku.

43
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,067
Uh, thank you so
much for yesterday.

44
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,067
Why are you thanking me?
You cooked.

45
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,483
Still.

46
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,567
[HINATA] Wait, what? You guys
know each other already?

47
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,567
Yeah. He kinda did
me a flavor favor.

48
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,692
[HINATA]
Hey, Chiguma!

49
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:36,442
Oh, hey, g'morning.

50
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:38,567
Didya just get back
from aikido practice?

51
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,567
Yeah.

52
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,567
Um, good morning, Chiguma.

53
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,608
Hey, dude. Wondering
'bout the outfit?

54
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,192
I'm in both the Aikido Club
and the Archaeology Club, too.

55
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:50,525
[SAKU]
I didn't know that.

56
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,525
[HINATA]
Huh? Wait! This again?

57
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,358
Have they already
met before, too?

58
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,650
[SAKU] Oh! Thanks for
having me the other day.

59
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:00,400
Sure! You're welcome
to hang with us anytime.

60
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:01,608
'Kay.

61
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,358
[SAKU]
If you're curious,

62
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:06,192
I went along on one of
their outings this weekend.

63
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,525
[HINATA]
I get it.

64
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,733
So you were checking out
the Archaeology Club then?

65
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,650
[SAKU] Well, uh,
it kinda just happened.

66
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:13,858
[HINATA]
In that case, it's only fair

67
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:15,650
if you come by my club, too!

68
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,150
We go do fun weekend
events just like they do!

69
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,650
[SAKU chuckles]

70
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:42,108
[USUKI gasps]

71
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:45,983
[gasps]

72
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,025
[MITSUKI] Is everything
all right, Mr. Usuki?

73
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:54,650
Mitsuki. I have a
hypothetical for you.

74
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:55,817
If you go through a door,

75
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,108
and then it vanishes
when you look back,

76
00:04:58,192 --> 00:04:59,650
is it possible that
you never went through

77
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,150
said door to begin with?

78
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,692
Uh...

79
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,650
Archaeology is the
study of history,

80
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,233
which we deduce by
examining its ruins.

81
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:10,775
But then, what if we
never discover them?

82
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,358
Can we say they ever
actually existed at all?

83
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:17,608
Well, Mitsuki? What's your
opinion on all of thi--

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,733
And if you don't listen,
was I actually speaking to you?

85
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:24,983
Or did I say nothing at all?

86
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:32,608
[SAKU]
Morning.

87
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,692
Hey!

88
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:36,067
Hi, Saku!

89
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,817
Hey, Kai. Um, thanks
again for yesterday.

90
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,150
[KAI chuckles]

91
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,733
[SAKU]
Huh? Uhh...

92
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,817
[KAI] Our culinary cook-off
of curry was truly inspiring!

93
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
[SAKU]
Thanks?

94
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,942
[KAI]
Let's do it again! Sound good?

95
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:49,483
[SAKU]
Again?

96
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,192
[SOSUKE] You should go ahead
and join the Singing Club.

97
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:56,067
[SAKU]
Why?

98
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,525
[SOSUKE]
I told you already.

99
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,650
They want to use my songs
in the upcoming competition.

100
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,108
If you're the one singing them,

101
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,275
then I'll feel a
whole lot better

102
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:04,525
about giving them permission.

103
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:05,358
[SAKU]
Huh.

104
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:06,983
I'll be honest with you.

105
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,317
I like your voice better
than the VOCALOID version.

106
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,817
Hinata wants to do
this VOCALOID song.

107
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,150
But the issue is no
one has this range.

108
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,608
It'd be a bit of a stretch,
even with all of us.

109
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,150
If that's the case,

110
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,692
what about that one friend you
mentioned earlier--is he in?

111
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:27,817
Well, I'm not super sure if
he's gonna bite, actually.

112
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,567
Oh? Is he thinking of
joining another club?

113
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,233
[HINATA] No, he says that
he's too busy with work.

114
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:36,108
Too bad. Sorta sounds
like he's a lost cause.

115
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:38,192
Who knows? He did
just go on an outing

116
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:40,942
with the Archaeology Club,
so it's kinda hard to say.

117
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,358
[MITSUKI]
It certainly is.

118
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:45,275
Whatever! Just be assertive
and see if he shows up.

119
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:47,150
I already told him
to come check us out,

120
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:48,525
but he didn't seem into it.

121
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,067
Well, if he does stop by,

122
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,150
we'll just casually let him
know that our club's the best,

123
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,442
and then he'll stay.

124
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:56,150
This is precisely why
you're such a loser.

125
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,025
'Scuse me? And what's
wrong with giving him

126
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,525
a friendly nudge in
our direction? Well?

127
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:02,525
We have to be on the offensive!

128
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:03,608
That makes no sense!

129
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:05,275
This ain't one of
your judo matches!

130
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,650
At least I can fight.

131
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,067
What's that mean?

132
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,942
[SATSUMA] If we're ever going
to recruit more members,

133
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:11,317
we need to be aggressive.

134
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
[RYO] Okay, four-eyes,
I don't need you telling me

135
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:14,525
how to run a club!

136
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,442
Satsuma does raise a good point.

137
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:19,025
If we sit on our hands,
he'll join a different club.

138
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,025
Again, I asked, and he said no.

139
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,317
We have to push harder!

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,317
Strategic and swift,
like the winds of conflict

141
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,608
blowing over a
war-torn battlefield!

142
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:29,817
Sounds good to me.
I'll leave it in your hands.

143
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,858
Right. I'll do my best, Mitsuki.
You can count on me.

144
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:36,817
[KAI]
You're wondering where Saku is?

145
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,567
Hmm. Y'know, I could have
sworn that he was just here.

146
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,608
Sorry, but you guys
barely missed him.

147
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:44,192
He just left school
to go to work.

148
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:46,067
Right! He's at the curry shop!

149
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,692
You mean Volcano?

150
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,275
I'm always in the
mood for curry!

151
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:52,650
Especially when I'm hungry,
and I'm hungry all the time!

152
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,275
He's actually working
somewhere different today.

153
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:58,775
[SAKU]
Excuse me.

154
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,442
I have your order of an
iced coffee and an oolong tea?

155
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,650
[gasps]

156
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,442
Hey, Saku!

157
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,692
[SAKU] Wait. What are all
of you guys doing here?

158
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,317
We're surprising you!
Floppy hand wave!

No, actually, I--

315
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,525
Don't argue with me!

316
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:26,567
[SAKU]
Uh...

317
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,942
You need to eat people food.

318
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,817
Oh, I do. This cat
food's for a cat.

319
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,692
[RYO]
You do? Cat?

320
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,858
[SAKU]
Uh, yes? I'm sorry?

321
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:36,150
[RYO]
So you own a cat then?

322
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,400
I... suppose you could say that?

323
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:41,525
Okay! I get it now! [giggles]

324
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,567
That's great. You're a good guy.

325
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,942
See ya.

326
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,733
What just happened?

327
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,733
[SOSUKE] So, you're not gonna
join the singing club then?

328
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,317
[SAKU]
Mm...

329
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,192
[SOSUKE] Is it 'cause you don't
like singin' in front of people?

330
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,567
No, that's not
exactly the reason.

331
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,025
Well then, if you're not gonna
be joining the Singing Club,

332
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:06,317
how about the three
of us form a band?

333
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,442
Seriously?

334
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:10,317
Come on! With you? It'll rock.

335
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,192
I'm not so sure.

336
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,150
I'll be in charge of
composing the music,

337
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,775
Uta will write
the lyrics for it,

338
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,567
and then you'll do the singing.

339
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,067
With those combined,
the songs'll sell.

340
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,275
We'd be selling these?

341
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,608
I mean they'll make a splash.

342
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,650
You can sing as well
as a VOCALOID can.

343
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:28,567
So you're something special.

344
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,775
Oh. Yeah.

345
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:35,192
[SAKU]
In the first four days,

346
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:37,525
I had two different clubs
ask me to join them,

347
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:41,025
and someone even wanted to
form a band with me. Uh--

348
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,817
[SAKU]
What is it?

349
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,483
[NOZOMI] Oh, it's nothing.
I've just never seen you

350
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:51,067
get so excited when talking
about school before. It's new.

351
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,317
Yeah? I guess I didn't notice.

352
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,692
Things'll be fine.

353
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,692
Huh?

354
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,858
It's nice to be included, right?

355
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:03,150
There're people who need you.
You're never alone.

356
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,817
That's wonderful.
I'm happy for you.

357
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,317
[SAKU chuckles]
I have to go now,

358
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,483
but you rest and
get better, okay?

359
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:20,025
That bag. Make sure
to take that with you.

360
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,317
[SAKU]
What is it?

361
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,275
I put something
important in there.

362
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:26,358
Look through it carefully
when you get back home, okay?

363
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,817
[door opens]

364
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,233
[SAKU]
I'm back.

365
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:48,358
Kinda nice to come home
to someone. Right, cat?

366
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:53,442
[SAKU humming]

367
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,692
[NOZOMI] It's nice to
be included, right?

368
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:02,442
There're people who need you.
You're never alone.

369
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:05,150
And feel free to drop by
whenever you want, 'kay?

370
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:06,608
I mean they'll make a splash.

371
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,650
You can sing as well
as a VOCALOID can.

372
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,400
So you're something special.

373
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:12,525
[SATSUMA] However,
if you join the Singing Club,

374
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,067
I can promise you
will be able to

375
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,608
look back on your youth fondly

376
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,400
and remember more than just
the toils of school and work!

377
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,400
So I can either join the
Singing Club or form a band.

378
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,775
[ALL laughing]

379
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:24,817
This is awesome!

380
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,650
I love our lil group!

381
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:29,025
We wrote a new song,
you wanna check it out, buddy?

382
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,150
Sure do!

383
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:35,483
[ALL laughing]

384
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,692
No way. That'd be crazy.

385
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,067
[gasps]

386
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:06,317
[HINATA]
Wow, Saku! You actually came!

387
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,858
What wonderful news!
I see our passion moved you.

388
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,483
Now then, we'll welcome you
with open arms and we can--

389
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,442
[SAKU]
I can't!

390
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:14,400
[SATSUMA, HINATA gasp]

391
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,775
[SAKU]
I came here to decline.

392
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,358
I apologize.

393
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,775
[SATSUMA]
Are you sure?

394
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:22,608
[HINATA]
Don't worry about it.

395
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,317
[SOSUKE] I see. You decided
not to go with the club, huh?

396
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,442
Then we should
start up the band!

397
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:33,275
[SAKU]
Sorry. I can't do that either.

398
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:37,275
But why not? You like singing,
so what's the problem?

399
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,233
I just can't.

400
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:50,900
[SAKU]
Have a good night.

401
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,525
Huh?

402
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,525
[SAKU]
What are you...?

403
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:05,108
[HINATA] There's a song in here
that we did in the Singing Club.

404
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,483
I told you. I can't.

405
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:10,233
It's okay. Just listen to it.

406
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:15,608
[HINATA] Promise that you'll
talk to me again after you do.

407
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:25,275
I came up with these
while watching Saku.

408
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,358
What do you think?

409
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,150
[SOSUKE]
Hm?

410
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:31,983
Uta. Those are way too macabre.

411
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:39,233
[NOZOMI] Saku. Things
aren't looking good for me,

412
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,983
so we don't have much
time left together.

413
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:45,442
But I'm sure you must
be aware of that by now.

414
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,483
That's why I'm giving you these.

415
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,650
So that you can continue
living your life without me,

416
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,400
the way I want you to.

417
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:56,692
[SAKU]
Then... it's true.

418
00:20:56,775 --> 00:21:00,108
Three to six months. At best.

419
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:06,692
[NOZOMI] I already spoke
to the Mitsutsukas.

420
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:09,275
They agreed to take care
of you after I'm gone.

421
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:11,108
If you ever need anything,

422
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,567
don't be afraid to
reach out to them.

423
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:18,983
[MITSUKI]
How long are you planning on

424
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,692
being an absentee member?

425
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:23,525
Will you just come
back to us already?

426
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:26,317
[KEISHI]
Why should I bother?

427
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,900
The Singing Club appears to be
doing just fine without me.

428
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:34,942
[MITSUKI] I suppose,
but aren't you bored by now?

429
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:36,942
Not at all.

430
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,650
[MITSUKI] So, you're
still observing, then?

431
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,692
[KEISHI]
Yeah. Basically.

432
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,900
I'm so sorry, guys.
I wish I could join you.

433
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:35,442
[ASHIHARA]
Koya Ashihara on the scene!

434
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:38,150
And we're bringing you a special
breaking news program today!

435
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,650
[SOSUKE] We're here because Uta
saw those white shadowy things

436
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,108
a bunch of times in this room.

437
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:43,525
[UTA]
Yup, it's true!

438
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:45,733
Sometimes they peek inside
through the windows,

439
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:48,275
or suddenly teleport behind you!
