Hey, isn't that Sakutasuke?

[PEDESTRIAN 10B]
You're right!

4
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:14,942
They're super popular
online right now!

5
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,692
They hold performances
around here sometimes.

Hey, 'scuse me folks,
my boy's a fantastic singer

00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,275
but a little socially awkward,
so I'll be taking over

My name's Sosuke.

12
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:44,442
I compose and do
all the step recording

on top of all
these performances,

Really, now?

You're saying the words
fall from the sky?

[UTA] That's right!
Just like the rain!

Raindrop words!

And once they do,
you use them to write lyrics?

Yup! There are some above
your head, actually.

Aw! That's not nice!

It was a humorous jest!

I'm quite surprised.

Yes, it is.

Though it does make me wonder
what exactly changed here.

this anymore, after all.

a new song for our next show,

[KEISHI] "The closure of the

for a new world vision?

Recent technical issues
have caused sharp decline

in players.

83
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,025
We take such matters,
such as connectivity problems,

very seriously.

85
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:33,942
Therefore, we have decided
to shut down the 7th ward.

86
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,317
We believe fixing the
old world won't work.

87
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,275
And isn't worth
investing resources.

from scratch and building

holding a meeting tomorrow
after school at 3 PM sharp.

Yeah. Think about it.

Seems like just yesterday
that everyone was freaking out

about all the strays on campus.

pretty much disappeared lately?

Uh, what do you mean?

But I still see them
around here sometimes.

where'd you spot 'em?

It's open.

00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:35,733
[MITSUKI]
Is something the matter?

114
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:39,900
I'm surprised. It's rare
for you to contact me first.

115
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,150
The government.

116
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,108
They might be cracking
down on the 7th ward

117
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:45,900
sometime soon.

118
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,192
Which means the entire
Tensho school will be stripped

119
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,150
of its autonomy.

120
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,567
[MITSUKI] What exactly
do you mean by that?

121
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,692
It'll end up being
like the 9th ward.

122
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,525
Do you get it now?
Does that make sense?

123
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:58,692
But sir...

124
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,275
I know you're aware
that the 9th ward

125
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:02,317
rarely shares any
information at all.

126
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,942
So if there's a leak, the source
will be easily identified

127
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,692
and then quickly cut off.

128
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,108
[MITSUKI] That's why we don't
hear much about their internal

129
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:13,858
affairs, which makes
things difficult.

130
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,650
That does makes sense.

131
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,567
Such a strict information
management system

132
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,108
was to be expected,
so I suppose that's no surprise.

133
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,067
So then...

134
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,192
Within Tensho and the 7th ward,

135
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,608
everybody will lose
their autonomy.

136
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,983
That's what you're telling me?

137
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,400
[KEISHI]
Yes.

138
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,567
[MITSUKI]
Is that it?

139
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,150
[KEISHI]
What do you mean?

140
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:37,275
Keishi. Be honest.

141
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:38,775
How much do you know?

142
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:45,400
Tell me. Who are you?

143
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:49,317
I'm not anyone important.

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,817
Right.

145
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,733
Is there any way we can
protect the school from this?

146
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,358
We need some kind of plan.

147
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,442
The school needs
to do something big.

148
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,942
They'll have to appeal
to prove their worth.

149
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,317
An appeal...

150
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,442
Well...

151
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,733
And it has to be
something that's unique.

152
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,192
Unique enough, at least.

153
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:07,983
The whole world has to see it.

154
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,483
That's the only way out.

155
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:13,442
Wait a minute, that's it!

156
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,608
The competition's
next month, isn't it?

157
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:17,858
That's going to be
the key to all this.

158
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,692
[MITSUKI]
Yeah? How so?

159
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:20,858
Listen to me.

160
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:23,317
You have to make
the competition a success.

161
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,983
[MITSUKI] Of course, but the
singing competition has always--

162
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,692
[KEISHI]

[BOSS] No need. We've already

[KEISHI] Stripping them of

201

So that means,

202
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,942
basically the 7th ward
will cease to exist.

We're going to use

It's true there have
been problems.

And the 7th ward hasn't exactly
been in the most stable state.

for this year's competition.

So what do you have in mind?

Let's break the routine.

Our event has sadly
stagnated over the years.

00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,525
Doing things as we have
done simply won't be enough.

232
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:17,900
We need a new hook.

233
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:21,358
Otherwise, interest
in the event will wane.

234

point of it to compete

235

for club points?

236
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,025
Um, that's all that ever
motivated most students

00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:30,275
to participate in pretty
much any event on campus.

238
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:32,483
Wouldn't the songs
be enough by themselves?

239
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,483
They should capture
sufficient attention.

240

Perhaps.

241
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,358
But we should think bigger
and attract the eyes

of not just the school,
but the world.

That could really benefit
the school. Huh.

[STUDENT 10B] Maybe we should
invite some pro musicians

00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:29,817
We want it to be the spotlight
of this year's event.

321
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,483
Oh, no. Sosuke's got
the frowny face.

322
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,442
Do you have any thoughts?

323
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:40,192
Honestly, our group
is finally taking off.

324
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:43,858
And writing music for Saku
to sing is our highest priority.

325
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:46,358
Doing a side project could
disrupt the momentum

326
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,942
we're starting to gain.

327
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:49,983
We're only asking for one song.

328
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,692
Yeah, I know.
But that takes up a lot of time.

329
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,775
And I'm so used to
writing songs for Saku.

330
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:56,442
I wouldn't know where to start.

331
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,317
It's true if you wrote
a song for his range,

332
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,733
we might struggle with it.

333
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:02,400
We still have over a month until
the competition happens.

334
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:04,567
That means we can use
that time to practice.

335
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,775
Well, sure.

336
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:07,567
But that also means that
you guys want a song

337
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,733
as quickly as possible,
doesn't it?

338
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,900
I suppose so.

339
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:14,442
Aww, that's rough, buddy.

340
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:16,358
I know this situation
is hard to explain,

341
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:18,817
but I hope you can
at least think it over.

342
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,358
The entire school
would be in your debt.

343
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,358
You're really serious.

344
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,275
Hey, Sosuke.

345
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,067
I think we should give it a try.

346
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:31,983
You sure?

347
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,608
[SAKU]
Yeah.

348
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:36,317
Look. I know you two are
the ones who actually have

349
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,567
to compose the songs.

350
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,400
But remember what I said
just the other day?

351
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,025
You guys create music from
your feelings for one another.

352
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:50,275
And then I sing those songs.
To spread those feelings.

353
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:53,525
But the only reason I'm
able to do that at all

354
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,150
is because I came
to this school.

355
00:15:56,233 --> 00:16:00,108
I met you, Sosuke, and Uta too.

356
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,567
Everybody here.
You've all helped me so much.

357
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,983
I mean it.

358
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,942
Everyone has helped me in ways
I can't put into words!

359
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,983
I know it's selfish of
me to ask.

360
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,900
But I want this, too.

361
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,358
To thank everyone who helped me.

362
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:16,525
Helped me find the happiness
I feel when I'm singing

363
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,775
the songs you two have written.

364
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,317
And this song could be the one.

365
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,858
With all of us
singing it together,

366
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,400
I can thank them.

367
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,775
I couldn't ask
for anything more.

368
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:31,150
Everyone's song.
I wanna hear it.

369
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,525
Yeah, same.

370
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:34,942
Man, are you serious?

371
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,608
Uh... I guess?

372
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,067
Yeah, I get you.

373
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,900
But all that sentimental
talk feels awkward.

374
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,900
I didn't mean to.

375
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:44,233
If everyone's gonna sing it,

376
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,483
then I guess I'll just
have to limit the range.

377
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,358
Then you'll help us?

378
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,317
Oh, wow! Look at that!

379
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,025
Sosuke is super-duper
trooper motivated now!

380
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:57,983
Yeah, whatever, ya weirdo.

381
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,567
Having the whole school sing?

382
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,025
I like that plan.

383
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,233
It's gonna be a
Tensho original, huh?

384
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:10,817
Would be sweet if we could
make it our school anthem.

385
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,942
It's settled!
The plan will go forward.

386
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,400
[STUDENT 10E]
How do we decide how many points

387
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,150
each club gets?

388
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,692
[STUDENT 10A] If all the
students are going to sing,

389
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,733
we should probably increase
the total payout of points,

390
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,858
and figure out a system
to properly split them up.

391
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,567
[STUDENT 10F] Don't you think we
should all get equal points?

392
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,108
Please, we'll sort
that out later.

393
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:29,025
We can discuss logistics
once the song is completed.

394
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,692
But the most important thing
to remember is this:

395
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:33,775
If we sing a song by Sakutasuke,

396
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:36,192
it will certainly draw
more spectators.

397
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,817
[STUDENT 10A]
That's true. We can discuss

398
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,483
the point distribution
in finer detail later.

399
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,858
[SAKU] Wait, you're saying
Sosuke's struggling with

400
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,233
the song?

401
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:52,608
Yeah, he is. It's hard.
Writing a song for everyone.

402
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:55,817
I think it's more difficult
than he expected.

403
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,650
[PLAYER 10D] They're doing the
same old singing contest again.

404
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,233
[PLAYER 10B]
They need something new.

405
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:02,775
[PLAYER 10E] I'll at least go to
see the boys I like on stage,

406
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,025
but...

407
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:06,942
I'm sorry. Progress is slow.

408
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:10,483
A few students seem to be on
our side and agreed to assist.

409
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,608
However, I wasn't able to
convince everyone else.

410
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,858
[KEISHI]
No. I should be saying sorry.

411
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,983
But you...

412
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,692
[KEISHI] I haven't been able
to do anything to help.

413
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,942
[MITSUKI] I wanted you all to
at least be exposed to the demo.

414
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:29,692
So... I brought Sakutasuke
to present the song.

415
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,483
Thank you, Mitsuki.
Here's what we have so far.

416
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,317
It's still a rough concept,
so sorry in advance.

417
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,442
Now listen closely.

418
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,608
Please give them
your honest thoughts.

419
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,608
[SOSUKE] I'll keep your feedback
and opinions in mind.

420
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:41,983
[song playing]

421
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,858
[STUDENT 10G]
Isn't the key too high?

422
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,067
It could be.

423
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,025
I was thinking of
maybe lowering it.

424
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:49,442
[STUDENT 10C] So are we going
to split the verses evenly

425
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,108
per club, and then split up
the points the same way?

426
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:53,858
Or do you have another idea?

427
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:57,900
[STUDENT 10D] Then them lowering
the key isn't a question,

428
00:18:57,983 --> 00:18:59,775
it's basically required.

429
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:01,275
[STUDENT 10H] Otherwise the
Singing Club has a huge

430
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:02,650
advantage.

431
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,108
Let's split it up four bars
each to keep it fair.

432
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:06,817
[STUDENT 10A] But what if one
club ends up with a more

433
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,817
difficult part of
the song to sing?

434
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,525
Maybe we should determine
who gets more points

435
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,442
based on who takes on
harder parts of the song.

436
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:13,817
--What should we do?
--I'm done.

437
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,108
That's enough, everyone.

438
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:19,567
All of you are simply
thinking about yourselves!

439
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,108
They have worked so hard
to write this song for us.

440
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:26,108
How can you all be so rude
and argue about points?

441
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:28,817
[STUDENT 10A] Listen, this
competition only comes around

442
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,942
once a year.
We can't take this lightly!

443
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:32,692
[arguing]

444
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,567
[MITSUKI]
This is exactly the problem!

445
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,233
This damned point system.

446
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:39,733
It's turned all of you into
self-serving neanderthals!

447
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:41,567
We're supposed
to lift each other.

448
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,567
This competition is a chance
for everyone to shine!

449
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,775
You tell 'em.

450
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:49,025
[MITSUKI]
Apologize to them right now.

451
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,400
These three...

452
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:53,608
They're the reason
Tensho still has hope.

453
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,317
The school needs your support!

454
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,192
[REI] As the president of
the Beautification Club,

455
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,067
I renounce our points this year.

456
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,150
Will that suffice?

457
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,192
We will assist you
behind the scenes.

458
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,733
You can take our points.

459
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:08,817
Please use them as you see fit.

460
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,150
Sounds good.

461
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:12,775
The Archaeology Club will
follow suit accordingly.

462
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:15,858
Of course, we'll still be
competing as you know.

463
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:17,150
The Swimming Club's in.

464
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:20,608
[STUDENT 10E]
Er, well...

465
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,108
If everyone's just
gonna volunteer...

466
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:23,733
[STUDENT 10A] We're not
heartless, of course we'll still

467
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:24,900
be a part of it.

468
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:27,483
[STUDENT 10B]
We can just forget about points

469
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:28,817
when the whole school sings.

470
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,400
That works, yeah?

471
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:32,358
Okay, then. How's that sound?

472
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:33,608
Is that acceptable?

473
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,858
And we're sorry.

474
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,108
Will you please accept
our humblest apologies?

475
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,317
