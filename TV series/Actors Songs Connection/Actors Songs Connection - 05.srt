here because

our local catnip junky
keeps on feeding them.

pretty cute! Huh?

No, that can't
be right. Hang on.

"If you bypass the
character creator,

26

you can play the

purchasing an avatar.

When playing the

you are able to utilize the

with the other
players around you.

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,025
However, because the Actors
in the game space cannot see

32
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:19,733
those of you playing
with the free version,

33
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,567
you'll be unable to
interact with them.

If you're enjoying
playing in this world,

please consider purchasing
a cute cat avatar,

[SASA] Also, try using the arrow
keys while you're in the air.

105
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:27,067
That way, you can get
a better look at things

tell Kai this info

the next time he's
looking for him.

have to do to turn his

Good question.

If he could make a
buncha money, I guess...

127
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:18,692
Then he'd be able to come on the
school trip with us for sure.

128
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,233
Yeah...

129

130
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,150
[YUFUMIN]
Who knows...

131
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,442
If he doesn't make enough money,
he'll won't be able to go.

132
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:29,775
[CHIGUMA] Hey, um...
what are you doing up there?

133
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:30,858

00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,775
Oh, we're stans!
Of these boys over here!

135
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,900
[CHIGUMA]
What's a "stan"?

136
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,608
These guys are really good
singers, if you didn't know!

137
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,150
They just come up with great
new songs out of nowhere.

138
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,067
So we always have to
keep an eye on them!

139
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,317
I know, right! They even
announced a new song just the

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,233
other day. Pretty sure it was
right over by the spawn point!

141
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,317

I guess that makes sense.

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,400

I know! You, and then... ta-da!

143
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,233
Yeah! Good idea!

144
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,900
I'll compose a new song and
Uta will write the lyrics.

145
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:01,025
You can sing it.

146
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:03,025
And then we'll sell it online!

With ad revenue
and sales galore!

148
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,608
You think? Would that work?

149
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,942
[SOSUKE] We haven't sold any of
our VOCALOID songs yet,

150
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,275
but they're pretty popular.

151
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,067
And if we have your vocals...

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,192
We'll get super rich
super quick!

00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:18,275
Okay...

That's not okay!

311
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:18,858
I can't let you go
do a lewd thing that!

312
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,650
Huh? But why, though?

313
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,358
I am a cat, so it's fine.

314
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:24,108
[CHIGUMA] I mean, just because
you're a cat in the game

315
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,942
doesn't mean you can run around
like a real life cat

316
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,317
with no boundaries!

317
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,442
Yeah, I guess you're right.

318
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:30,858
[CHIGUMA]
You mean it?

319
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:33,525
It'll be fine, Chiguma.
I'd only do something like this

320
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:37,025
in a game, not real life,
so try to chill out!

321
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:39,942
[CHIGUMA]
Oh, right. It's just in a game.

322
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,317
[CHIGUMA]
Wait.

323
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,192
[COACH 5A]
Go!

324
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:48,733
[CHIGUMA]
What's the matter, Minori?

325
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:51,817
You don't seem as peppy as
you did before. Are you okay?

326
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,067
Of course not.
The girls are all gone.

327
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,108
They're all done
changing already.

328
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:59,400
And the club room
was locked up, too.

329
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:01,400
[FUBUKIINU]
Oh my gosh, Itto's so hot!

330
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:04,608
Even when he's doing laps, he
looks like he's in a photoshoot!

331
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:07,275
Well, I'm totally
a Hozumi stan myself.

332
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:08,317
[RIEKOMACHI]
Yeah, me, too!

333
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,108
He can breaststroke
for me any time!

334
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:15,442
Aw! But I wanted to
swim a little bit longer!

335
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:18,150
No way! We agreed to swim
for an hour straight,

336
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,358
and then you said we
could take a breather.

337
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,650
I still have tons
of energy to burn.

338
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,858
Make sure you dry off
when you get out.

339
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,692
Wouldn't want you
to catch a cold.

340
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,108
Fine!

341
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:32,942
Wait... I think I left
my towel in the club room.

342
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,067
[HOZUMI]
You've gotta be kidding.

343
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,067
Lemme get it!

344
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,275
Wait! Stop!

345
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:39,067
You're gonna drip water
all over the place!

346
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,775
Hey, Itto!

347
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,567
He's gone... What am I
gonna do with him?

348
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,567
Aww...! So cute.

349
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,525
Don't give up on him!
You got this.

350
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:52,733
Let's check out their club room!

351
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:55,192
[NONOMIN]
Okay, let's go!

352
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,108
[CHIGUMA]
Hey, so... I'm a bit worried

353
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:59,317
about them following
Hozumi and Itto like that.

354
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,608
I think I should go, too.

355
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:02,942
[MINORI] Go ahead.
I'm going to sit right here

356
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:05,567
until it's time for the girls'
team to go and change.

357
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,525
Don't mind me!

358
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,817
[CHIGUMA] Wow, you're really
dedicated to this, aren't you?

359
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,858
--[door opens]
--[ITTO] I'm back!

360
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:15,567
Hey. Uh--wait!

361
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,900
Itto! You're still
wet and half naked!

362
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:21,483
Why did you come back
with your swimsuit still on?

363
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,317
What? I showered, so it's fine.

364
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,733
[TAKATO] You still don't
understand the issue, do you?

365
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,942
Hold it! Not another step!

366
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:32,067
[TAKATO] Hey, Ryunosuke,
could you get a towel for me?

367
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,358
[RYUNOSUKE]
Sure.

368
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,817
Will this one suffice?

369
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,442
But this one's mine!

370
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,567
Come on. It's fine, whatever.

371
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,442
[ITTO giggles]
Takato! That tickles!

372
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:47,275
[TAKATO]
Yeah, I know. Stay still.

373
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,775
Hey, you're gonna
mess up my hair!

374
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:52,608
So? Your hair's already messy
all the time anyway!

375
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:54,150
[ITTO]
But it really tickles!

376
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,192
[TAKATO]
Just deal with it!

377
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,858
Okay, there, you
can come in now.

378
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:00,567
[ITTO]
Yay!

379
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,442
[HOZUMI]
Hey, guys.

380
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:03,775
There you are!

381
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:06,483
I told you to look after Itto,
didn't I, Hozumi?

382
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,233
Why'd he come back here
all on his own soaking wet?

383
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:12,567
Sorry. But I did everything
that I could. I guess...

384
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,567
...he left his change of clothes
in here or something, so...

385
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,317
I can't believe this.

386
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,108
C'mon! Didn't I tell you
to bring your clothes

387
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,692
to the changing
room at the pool?

388
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:23,067
Yeah, but I don't like
changing alone.

389
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,233
Who cares? That's where you're
supposed to change. Got it?

390
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:27,275
Don't be a baby.

391
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:28,400
[RYUNOSUKE]
On the contrary,

392
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,192
he's rather intelligent
for his age.

393
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,817
Uh-- Seriously?

394
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,108
You're trying to tell me
that Itto is smart?

395
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,608
I'm just telling the truth.

396
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:38,442
He actually had better grades
than I did as a sophomore!

397
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,025
Yeah?! Prove it then.

398
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:43,317
What's your ranking? Overall?
From those tests the other day?

399
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,108
Overall? Hmm. Oh, that's right!
I think I got eighth!

400
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,025
There's no way!

401
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:52,525
It's the truth!

402
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:55,025
Okay. That doesn't make sense.

403
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:58,400
I'm not sure if he's a stupid
genius or a really smart idiot.

404
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:00,692
[RYUNOSUKE chuckles]
It's a mystery.

405
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,400
[TAKATO] You can say that again.
I'm completely stumped.

406
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:05,775
I don't get it. Did somebody
cut down your tree?

407
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:08,650
No, that's not exactly what I
meant with that expression.

408
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,067
I'm just saying, uh.

409
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,108
you're kinda like one of
those bizarre beings

410
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,400
that everyone's
been talking about.

411
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:15,733
Oh, yeah, I've seen one
of those things before!

412
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:16,817
[TAKATO]
Wait, you have?!

413
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,233
And you're only
telling us this now?!

414
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:19,817
--[RYUNOSUKE] Itto.
--Huh?

415
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,483
Do you happen to remember
where and when you saw it?

416
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,025
[ITTO]
Yeah. Of course I do!

417
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:25,983
[TAKATO]
Hang on a sec, Ryunosuke!

418
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,525
You aren't seriously
saying that you believe

419
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:28,608
in those weird things!

420
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,733
Are you scared?
You seem tense.

421
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,150
[TAKATO]
What?! Me?! Scared?!

422
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,358
Yeah, no way!
Why would I be scared?!

423
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,817
I dunno! It is
starting to get late.

424
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,567
Who knows what
comes out at night?

425
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,192
[TAKATO] Stop it!
You're doing that on purpose!

426
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:41,733
[RYUNOSUKE]
I wonder.

427
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,692
Could you describe what these
mysterious beings look like?

428
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:45,067
Please don't.

429
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,442
Well, lemme think.

430
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:48,650
They sorta look
like people, but...

431
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,442
Do you remember
what color they were?

432
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:53,400
[ITTO] Hmm. They were,
like, gray, maybe?

433
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,650
Notable features?

434
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,192
[ITTO]
Can't really say.

435
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,775
It looked like they
were smooth all over.

436
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,733
And they had these beady eyes.

437
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:01,317
[TAKATO]
That's enough outta you!

438
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,692
[CHIGUMA] Well, Minori,
are you feeling better now?

439
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:08,942
What? Is it that
obvious? [laughs]

440
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,567
[CHIGUMA] That is the
creepiest laugh I've ever heard.

441
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,608
Can I just say it was
totally worth the wait?

442
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:15,400
The boobies festival
was definitely worth

443
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:16,858
every single second! [laughs]

444
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:19,983
[KEISHI] Hey, I don't think
I've seen you two before.

445
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,400
[CHIGUMA] Oh, today is
our very first day of

446
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:24,983
logging in to the game.

447
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,942
Yeah? And are you two
having fun so far?

448
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,233
[CHIGUMA]
Yeah.

449
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:30,983
I'm amazed at how
realistic everything looks,

450
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:32,775
other than us, I guess.

451
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,400
Seriously! Not to mention,

452
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,942
I can see all the boobies
I could ever want in this game!

453
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:40,525
[KEISHI] To think that people
from Thrive Central are

454
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:45,108
accessing this system and
using their own world as a game.

455
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,900
[MIKE]
Hey! Wassup!

456
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,608
What's the matter?
You don't look so good.

457
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:08,608
Have you been slacking on
your self-care, Chiguman?

458
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,858
I had a hard time
waking up this morning.

459
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,358
My head hurts.

460
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:14,692
[MIKE] Lemme guess. You probably
played your video games

461
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,025
for too long.

462
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,858
Weren't you and Minori
gaming all day yesterday?

463
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:21,442
Yeah, come to think of it,
I thought we were playing

464
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:24,692
a really fun, new game,
but now I'm not sure.

465
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,442
What was it again?

466
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:30,525
I felt like I was almost
to the next mission,

467
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:32,525
but now it's kinda hazy.

468
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:38,692
[RYO]
Oh! Aren't you a cutie!

469
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:41,775
Are ya hungry, buddy?

470
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:43,942
[REI] Ryo Saotome.
Are you the one who's been

471
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:46,817
sneaking food to all
the strays on campus?

472
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,775
As the president of
the Beautification Club,

473
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:53,233
I cannot allow this to continue!
I demand you cease and desist!

474
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:55,817
Yeah? And how's
this your problem?

475
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,525
I'm just feeding some cats.

476
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,400
[REI] But you never
clean up after them!

477
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,233
Do you realize how
irresponsible it is

478
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:02,608
just to leave the food out?

479
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:04,400
I ought to get you arrested...

480
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:37,067
[SAKU] I can't keep
holding everyone back.

481
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,067
[SOSUKE] Hang on! It's true
we started this because of you,

482
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,983
but it's more than that now.

483
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:45,733
We're proud of this song, and we
want the world to hear it, too!

484
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:47,567
Don't you feel the same?
