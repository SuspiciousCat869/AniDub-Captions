[STUDENTS chattering]

2
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:16,942
[KAI] Here's an
infor-meow-tive cat fact!

3
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,067
Did you know the majority of
calico cats are actually female?

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,233
Believe it or not,

5
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:24,483
only one in every
30,000 calicos are male!

6
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,233
That's claw-fully rare!

7
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,650
So? Why should I care?

8
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,483
'Cause you're Mike,
and a calico cat

9
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:33,275
can be called a <i>mike neko</i> !

10
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:36,900
It's a cute name, but "Mikey
neko" would be even cuter!

11
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:40,233
Apparently, <i>mike neko</i> are
popular all over the world!

12
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:43,817
Makes sense, they sure
are purr-tty girls!

13
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:47,692
[CHIGUMA sighs]
Come on, Kai.

14
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:50,067
Can't you read the room
before you run your mouth?

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,567
Calling his name "cute"
is bad enough,

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,358
but when you throw in the
implied emasculation.

17
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:58,442
[CHIGUMA]
Oh, great.

18
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,400
He's really gonna get it now.

19
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:03,567
Oh! "Calico" is also the
name of a fabric, isn't it?

20
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,483
Do you think the cat was
named after the fabric,

21
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:06,983
or was it the other way around?

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,150
Maybe there's "Mike" fabric--?

23
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:11,317
Will you shut up already?
Nobody cares.

24
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:15,942
[KAI]
Okay, then.

25
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:17,983
[sighs]

26
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:22,358
What are those?
They smell like curry.

27
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:26,442
Aren't Mendako March biscuits
usually filled with chocolate?

28
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:30,067
[MIKE] It's the limited-edition
curry flavor. Want some?

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,358
Sure.

30
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:36,317
[KAI gasping]

31
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:38,692
What is this?

32
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,525
No cayenne pepper, no coriander,

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,150
no cumin, no cinnamon, no
nutmeg, no turmeric, no nothing!

34
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,483
So?

35
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,233
So this is a box of lies!
Only a sham chef would

36
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,442
dare to call these
trash nuggets "curry"!

37
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,275
You're really this
mad right now?

38
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:55,358
I dunno what to tell you, man,
it's only a biscuit flavor.

39
00:01:55,442 --> 00:01:58,400
No self-respecting curry-lover
would ever eat this filth!

40
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:01,025
Making a vaguely spicy
biscuit and calling it curry

41
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:03,358
is an insult to curry
cooks everywhere!

42
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:05,650
And? Get off of your high horse.

43
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:08,275
You just made "vaguely spicy"
curry yesterday!

44

[KAI grunts]

45

[CHIGUMA]
Careful, Mike.

46
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:15,233
You're treading on very
dangerous ground right now!

47

[KAI, MIKE growling]

48
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:24,192
Huh? [sighs]

49
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:27,108
[KAI]
Ooh, it's gold! Is that rare?

50
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:29,358
Common. Of course.

51
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,358
Oh. Shame.
What about in this one?

52
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:34,525
Wait! Don't open that!

53
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:36,400
[KAI]
Hey look, mine's different.

A mustache? Oh,
and a turban, too!

56
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,233
A rare.

57
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:45,317
You got a rare
on your first try!

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,525
How 'bout that.
Here's your thingie, Mikey!

59
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:51,067
This is ridiculous.
Inconceivable!

60
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,317
[MIKE]
I pulled this Tea Whisk rare

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,525
from a limited-edition
matcha flavored box!

62
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:03,067
After that, I spent forever
getting this <i>shichimi</i> one

63
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,108
with the different colored legs!

64
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:06,775
Then this Anpanman one!

65
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,983
And after buying all those
red bean flavored boxes,

66
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,608
I practically lived
on the pork ones

67
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,983
trying to get this
little bastard!

68
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,150
[CHIGUMA] He spent so much
money on those things.

69
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,150
It can take dozens of
boxes to get a rare,

70
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,692
don't you understand that?

71
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:22,067
Do you even realize
what you've done?

72
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,858
All I did was open it, though.

73
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,692
You can still have the toy.

74
00:03:25,775 --> 00:03:28,150
That's not the point!
You just ruined it!

75
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:30,983
It doesn't count unless I open
the box with my own hands!

76
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,483
But you got the thing!
Why're you mad?

77
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,942
'Cause I said not to!

78
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,983
But even after I told you
not to open the damn thing,

79
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,358
you did it anyway!

80
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:40,233
Whatever, your luck is terrible!

81
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:43,483
So, you should be thanking me
for pulling a rare for you!

82

'Scuse me, I bought the boxes!

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,233
The rare was inside
of it regardless!

84
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:50,442
Okay. That's quite enough
of this conversation.

85
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,858

86
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,192
You heard the bell.

[MIKE]
Hmph.

00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,817
Here's an update for you.

91
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,192
I tried reaching out to the 9th
ward direct information channel.

92
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:48,608
The one I mentioned last time.

93
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,525
[MITSUKI] Per my request,
they have apparently made

94
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,067
some adjustments on their end

95
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,317
so that you can visit under
the guise of a club field trip.

96
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,650
[USUKI]
That's perfect.

97
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,817
If I could take a look at
the artifacts out there,

98
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,483
I might find a clue to
the mystery of the wall.

99
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,025
They'll be expecting
a party of four

100
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:07,525
from the school's Archaeology
Club to be in attendance.

101
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,025
Good luck to you.

102

[USUKI]
For our meeting tomorrow,

103
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,358
we'll be going to the folk
museum in the 9th ward

104
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:18,942
for some field work.

105
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,900
Why the 9th ward, though?

106
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:24,192
Well, it's a great museum,
with plenty of exhibits

107
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:26,942
concerning Thrive Central,
so why not?

108
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:32,525
Okay. What's up?
You two fighting?

109
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,192
--We're fine.
--[KAI] It's nothing.

110
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,525
[ANNOUNCER 7A] Mr. Usuki, please
report to the faculty room.

111
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,692
All right, meet at the
school gates at 7:30 sharp.

112
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:43,233
[CHIGUMA]
We'll be there.

113
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,150
Oh wow, I've never
been to the 9th ward before!

114
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,567
It's exciting! Right?

115
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,775
--Yeah, sure.
--I guess.

116
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:57,525
Try not to get too
excited, guys. [chuckles]

117
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,900
Whoa! That's one of the new,
limited-edition rares, right?

118
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,025
You managed to get
one of these already?

119
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,525
That's right, do you want it?

120
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:12,358
Seriously? Are you sure?

121
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:15,733
So you're saying you want it
despite not pulling it yourself?

122
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,233
Yeah? I mean,

123
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:19,483
a rare is a rare,
so whatever, right?

124
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:22,817
That is a really lovely
perspective you have, Hinata.

125
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:27,775
Uh... Y'know what.
Maybe I'll pass.

126
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:30,150
I should head back before
Satsuma gets too mad.

127
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,900
See you guys later!

128
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,025
Yeah, bye.

129
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:43,150
[CHIGUMA] Make sure you're
not late tomorrow! Mike?

130
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:56,483
You're confirmed, sir. Go on in.

131
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,108
[USUKI]
Thank you very much.

132
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,650
Wow, security seems
really tight in this place.

133
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,192
It feels like we're infiltrating
a secret base, doesn't it?

134
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,358
[MIKE]
Another miss.

135
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:29,025
[CHIGUMA] This is really right
smack in the middle of nowhere.

136
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,442
It's not technically
for the public.

137
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:34,942
Four members from

138
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,192
the Tensho School's
Archaeology Club, yes?

139
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,983
We've been
expecting you. Welcome.

140
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,942
[USUKI]
Thank you so much, miss.

141
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,317
I wonder if I could
ask before we go in.

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,067
Is there any possible
way I'd be able to

143
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,983
thank the director personally
for having us in today?

144
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,775
The director's out right now.

145
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:54,025
Then could I perhaps have
their contact information?

146
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:57,233
My apologies.
I can't do that, sir.

147
00:08:57,317 --> 00:09:00,233
[USUKI] I see.
I'm sorry for bothering you.

148
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,983
I guess we'll just have to
take a look around on our own.

149
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,108
Yes, well.

150
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,317
At least they can't
say I didn't try.

151
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,483
[KAI] This place feels
kinda sparse, all in all.

152
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,817
I thought that there'd
be more stuff to see.

153
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,567
[USUKI] All of these
plain-looking exhibits

154
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,817
are likely to be a cover.

155
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,567
Is it just me, or is
this place super boring?

156
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,358
It's just you.

157
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,442

00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:48,108
Aren't you waiting for the
young master to come back?

317
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:51,025
Young Master. Please hurry.

318
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,442
His blood pressure's dropping!

319
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,275
[KAI]
Mike, no!

320
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,150
[CHIGUMA]
Come on.

321
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,400
You have to pull through!

322
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:56,442
Wake up!

323
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:57,608
--Don't give up!
--Hang in there!

324
00:19:57,692 --> 00:19:59,192
You can't leave me
alone like this!

325
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:02,275
I need you, Mike,
please don't you dare die!

326
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:05,192
I never even got to apologize.

327
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:07,567
[YOUNG MASTER]
Please, open your eyes.

328
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,483
You have to wake up, Mitsuse!

329
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:12,192
The young master's here!
Please, look!

330
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:23,858
Master. You've returned.
I've been waiting for so long.

331
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:25,775
How I've missed you.

332
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:31,733
[MITSUSE panting]

333
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,358
[KAI]
Mike! I'm sorry!

334
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,483
Wait, you're--?

335
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,400
Young Master.

336
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:50,108
I thought I would
never see you again!

337
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:52,942
You're okay! Thank goodness!

338
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:55,233
Yes. I love you, Master.

339
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:58,233
I'll never let you go
again! I swear to you!

340
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:00,692
Thank you for coming
back for me, darling!

341
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,650
Uh... Hey, Mike?

342
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,317
Not that I mind, but our
friends are right there.

343
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,775
[gasps]

344
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:13,442
Unhand me, mongrel!

345
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:14,442
What?!

346
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,817
Guess he's fine.

347
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,733
Well, that's good,
at least. I'm glad.

348
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:25,817
[MIKE] What am I supposed
to do with all these?

349
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,692
Just take them home.
They're for you!

350
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:30,233
And you already opened
them all, you jerk.

351
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:31,275
Not quite!

352
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,900
This one's still sealed tight.

353
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,775
Open it, Mikey.

354
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,983
I'll do it when I
get home, thanks.

355
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:43,108
What? Excuse me.
I bought that for you, y'know!

356
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:44,650
Yeah, but you're bad luck.

357
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,650
I won't get a rare
in front of you.

358
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:49,400
Then give it back to me!
I wanna try it.

359
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:50,650
Nope, it's mine.

360
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:55,483
[gasps] Hey, wait up! Mikey!

361
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:01,025
[sighs]

362
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:35,900
[SOSUKE] I'm trying to
become a professional!

363
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:38,983
What's wrong with bettering my
craft by studying other music?

364
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:39,900
[UTA]
I don't like it!

365
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,108
[SOSUKE]
You're crazy!

366
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:42,442
[BOSS]
We've been running into a lot of

367
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:45,650
unexpected trouble
with the Actors lately.

368
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:48,358
What do you propose we
do about it, Keishi?
