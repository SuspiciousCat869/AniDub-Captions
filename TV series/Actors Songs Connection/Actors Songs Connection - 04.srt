1
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:13,483
[USUKI chuckles] And then
I went through the door,

2
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:15,192
and it was crazy!

3
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:16,733
[ODAWARA] You are aware
that you're not supposed to

4
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,025
drink in the lab, right?

5
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:18,942
[USUKI]
Oh, don't worry 'bout it.

6
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:19,983
[MITSUKI]
'Scuse me!

7
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:20,900
[ODAWARA, USUKI]
Hm?

8
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:23,108
Follow me. This is urgent.

9
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:24,817
It's right over here.

10
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,900
[gasps] What? This is a...

11
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:13,817
[CAT chewing]

12
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,817
Uh?

13
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,108
[CAT purrs]

14
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:21,650
Must be nice to be a cat.

15
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,483
You don't have a
care in the world.

16
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:28,108
Hey! Stop it, that
tickles! [giggles]

17
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,400
[UTA]
Hello-suke, Sosuke!

18
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,608
[SOSUKE gasps] You're
actually showing up on time

19
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,067
for morning classes?!

20
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,692
Yes I am! I was up all night
listening to music, so...

21
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:47,192
Instead of sleeping,
I started the day over!

22
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,608
'Das wah happen.

23
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,025
Attending class really
isn't that high of a priority

24
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:51,525
for you, is it?

25
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:54,275
Also, you're pretty lively
despite pulling an all-nighter.

26
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:55,817
Don't tell me you
stayed up that long

27
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,442
because you had writer's block.

28
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,108
Yeah. You got me.

29
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:01,317
I'm a sham...

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,233
I soared through the
wonderland of my mind

31
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,983
into the early morning light,
but came up with nothing.

32
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,650
But you didn't come
across any issues

33
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,192
when you wrote "Cloudy Day."

34
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,108
Why's this one
giving you problems?

35
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:14,358
But as hard as I try,
I just can't fly.

36
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:18,150
Flightless dreams can't reach
imagination's wings. [gasps]

37
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,775
Maybe if I fly for real,

38
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:22,150
I'll find the
inspiration I need!

39
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,650
All right! Up, up, and away!

40
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,733
[SOSUKE]
Would you get down from there?!

41
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:31,525
[SOSUKE] You're worried
about Saku too, aren't you?

42
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:33,650
And here I thought we were

43
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:36,108
starting to become a
bit closer with him,

44
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:38,733
but then he drops us outta
nowhere for some reason.

45
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:42,733
But why not? You like
singing, what's the problem?

46
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,567
I just can't.

47
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:49,900
It seemed like something was
bothering him more than usual.

48
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:52,358
I wonder if there's more going
on with him than we know.

49
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,400
Well... It's not gonna
help if the two of us

50
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:55,942
act all weird about it.

51
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:59,775
Uta. I know it's hard for you,
but try to act normal, 'kay?

52
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:02,192
Be cool... Just casually
say 'good morning' to him

53
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,275
like there's nothing's wrong.

54
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:04,733
[SAKU]
Good morning.

55
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:06,900
[SOSUKE] Uh, same!
How long have you been there?

56
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,525
[UTA]
A causal good morning to you!

57
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:11,233
[SAKU] You're both here
on time? That's rare.

58
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,733
Hey, wait up!

59
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:15,942
He might be doin' just fine.

60
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,150
[UWAJIMA]
This is awesome!

61
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,567
[SOSUKE] Oh yeah? What are
you guys freaking out about?

62
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,608
Hey! What, you guys
haven't seen it yet?

63
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:27,775
[SAKU]
What's this?

64
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:28,942
[UWAJIMA]
They found this in the forest

65
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,608
by the university
section this morning!

66
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,150
Koya Ashihara, on the scene!

67
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,483
And we're bringing you a special
breaking news program today!

68
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:38,733
Take a look behind me...

69
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,400
There was nothing
here yesterday,

70
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:43,567
but now, there's this
circle of gigantic stones!

71
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,025
With us is Mitsuki Akika,

72
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,400
who first discovered this
alongside the teachers.

73
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,858
What are your thoughts?

74
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:50,858
It appears to
resemble Stonehenge,

75
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,942
and its origin is unknown.

76
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,858
I'm not sure what
to make of this.

77
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,108
[ODAWARA]
How curious.

78
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:58,025
Seems like we have
quite the mystery.

79
00:04:58,108 --> 00:04:59,608
I can't wait to see
what we find.

80
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,108
This could give the
school's Seven Wonders

81
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:02,358
a run for their money.

82
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:04,233
I intend to give it a
thorough examination

83
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,733
from a purely
archaeological standpoint.

84
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,608
The Archaeology Club
wants to see it,

85
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,858
and we're heading there
after school today.

86
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:13,067
Are you two interested
in joining us?

87
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,608
Think I'll have to pass.

88
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:17,817
Don't really care for stuff like
the school's Seven Wonders.

89
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,025
[SOSUKE] I already do enough
wondering seven days a week

90
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,900
with that one.

91
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,192
Sorry, but I'm actually busy.

92
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,108
[KAI]
Aw, boo.

93
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:30,067
So bad news. About Saku.

94
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,900
He told me that he couldn't join
the Singing Club after all.

95
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,483
Aww, man!

96
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,400
Did you even make an effort to
tell him how cool the club is?

97
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:39,733
Well, we tried our best! Like,
Satsuma was super convincing,

98
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,567
but I guess Saku just didn't buy
it for some personal reason.

99
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,692
Knowing how pushy Satsuma is,
he prob'ly freaked him out.

100
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:48,442
Well, at least I'm making
an effort to help our cause.

101
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,900
You only complain and
take no action of your own.

102
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,817
I'd love to hear
what ideas you have.

103
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,692
Yeah, I've got plenty of ideas,
and they're great! I think?

104
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:59,567
Really?! Don't be
shy, Ryo! Tell us!

105
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:05,317
Hm?

106
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:10,233
That's weird. Guess he
doesn't have work today.

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,733
[SOSUKE]
The hospital?

108
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,567
[SAKU]
Hey, Nozomi. I'm here.

109
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:32,233
[SAKU] She has even
more medications now.

110
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,442
[NOZOMI]
It's nice to be included, right?

111
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:37,775
There're people who need you.
You're never alone.

112
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,567
[SAKU]
I know that... But still...

113
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,358
[DOCTOR 1A]
Oh, Saku. Back again I see.

114
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:44,983
Uh, Doctor.

115
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:50,817
It seems like every time I come
visit lately, she's asleep.

116
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,942
[DOCTOR 1A] It's a side
effect of her medication.

117
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,192
On the plus side,

118
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,275
her complexion seems to
be getting much better.

119
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,192
Hopefully,
her remission continues

120
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:00,900
going the way it has been.

121
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:02,858
Thanks for all your help.

122
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,650
[SOSUKE]
Hey, fancy meeting you here.

123
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:14,483
[SOSUKE] So that's why
you were at the hospital.

124
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:16,983
[SAKU]
Yeah.

125
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,525
[SOSUKE] Then you must have a
lot to take care of at home.

126
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:22,358
Guess that explains why you
don't have time for clubs.

127
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,233
[SAKU]
You could say that.

128
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:27,567
When do you think she'll
be able to be discharged?

129
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,983
[SAKU] That's the thing.
I don't know if she ever will.

130
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:39,275
So then... You're saying
there's no chance?

131
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:43,525
Not unless some white shadows
appeared and agreed to heal her.

132
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:44,608
Then maybe...

133
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,900
Some white shadows? [gasps]

134
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:53,108
I have to ask them...
For her... I need to.

135
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:57,317
Can you... tell me about them?

136
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,317
When I was little,
I heard a story...

137
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,525
They can even heal
injury and sickness.

138
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,650
If we need them to
and we ask nicely.

139
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,567
Sorry. Just forget it.
I know it's hard to believe.

140
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,567
I got it.

141
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,067
What do ya say we go looking
for shadows together?

142
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,608
[SAKU] Wait. But I
thought you said that

143
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:20,942
you didn't care for
weird stuff like this.

144
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:24,733
This is something you
believe in. So of course I care.

145
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,817
[SOSUKE]
Well, you know what they say,

146
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,442
two is better than one, right?
And three is better still.

147
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,442
I'll get Uta to help.
We'll meet up with you tomorrow!

148
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:41,942
[SOSUKE] Hmm. Looks like
a bunch of people

149
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,192
have seen these
white shadow things.

150
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,442
And yet, no one seems
to have any ideas

151
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,858
about they actually are. Huh.

152
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:53,858
[phone ringing]

153
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:55,942
[UTA]
Sosuke? What's up?

154
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:59,650
[SOSUKE] Hi. Listen, I met
up with Saku today, and...

155
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:03,608
Well, seems like he's got
a lot going on after all.

156
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:07,483
Thought so. The poor guy.
He's got it pretty rough.

157
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,650
[SOSUKE] Yeah... I've been
thinking about if there's

158
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,192
anything I can do
to help him out.

159
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:15,025
And I'm gonna need your
help with this one, Uta.

160
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,067
Do you know anything
about the white shadows?

161
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,900
THe white shadows?

162
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:25,025
This is something you
believe in. So of course I care.

163
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,608
I wonder if we can
find them together.

164
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:35,567
[SOSUKE] And we're here.
This is Uta's apartment.

165
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,275
[SAKU] Huh? Did you tell
him what we're doing yet?

166
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:41,858
Hewwo and welcome!

167
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:48,233
Thw two of you have
officially entered Uta Land!

168
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:49,900
[SAKU]
This sure is something...

169
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:51,942
[SOSUKE] We're here because
Uta's seen those white shadow

170
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,567
things a bunch of times
in this very room.

171
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,650
[SAKU]
Really?

172
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,400
Yup, it's true!

173
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,692
Sometimes they peek inside
through the windows,

174
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,942
or suddenly teleport behind you!

175
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,567
Wow... So how do you meet them?!

176
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,358
[UTA] They always show up
when I'm writing lyrics!

177
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,192
Great! Let's start
this investigation off

178
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,692
with writing some lyrics!

179
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,483
Roger that!

180
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:24,400
[UTA]
I'm getting performance anxiety.

181
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:26,233
Could you not look at me during?

182
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,900
[SAKU]
Oh, sure! Sorry!

183
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,108
'Kay, all done!

184
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,442
[SOSUKE, SAKU gasp]

185
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:39,608
[SOSUKE]
Nope! This method's not worth it

186
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:41,275
if the lyrics are
gonna be that bad!

187
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:45,733
[UTA cries]

188
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:49,608
Right here. The last time I saw
them was around this area.

189
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,025
'Kay. Let's split up and
try to search for clues!

190
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:55,567
[UTA]
Yeah!

191
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:08,858
[SOSUKE gasps]
Saku! Over here!

192
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,608
[gasps]

193
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,025
[meows]

194
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:14,275
Hey, how'd you get out?!

195
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:15,900
And what are you doing
all the way over here?!

196
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:17,650
Aw man, it's just a cat.

197
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:18,900
[SAKU sighs]

198
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,775
Is he your kitty cat, Saku?

199
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:24,233
[SAKU] Mm-hmm. Be careful
on your way back home!

200
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,442
[CAT meows]

201
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:31,525
They won't show when you
want them to, I guess.

202
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,775
Well... Guess we
can call it a day.

203
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:37,192
What? I'm not giving
up on you that easily.

204
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,108
But why? It's fine.

205
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:41,108
They're probably just
an urban legend.

206
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,900
And I really don't wanna keep
wasting your time like this.

207
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:46,858
Wasting our time?
Don't worry about it.

208
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:48,525
We're friends. We wanna help.

209
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,775
Yeah, friends! We'll
always be there for you!

210
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:55,275
Thank you, guys.

211
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,775
'Kay! New plan of attack!

212
00:11:57,858 --> 00:12:00,317
We follow any potential
leads we can find online!

213
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,858
To the internet!

214
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:10,983
[UTA]
Still nothing...

215
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,567
[SOSUKE]
They were all dead ends...

216
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,775
[SAKU gasps] Oh, no.
I have to get to work soon!

217
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:19,817
That's fine! Just leave
the searching to us!

218
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,067
[SAKU]
But I...

219
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,733
Treat me to some curry
later and we'll be even.

220
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:28,400
[UTA]
Have fun!

221
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,275
All right. Now what do we do?

222
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:33,775
How to find white
shadows... [gasps]

223
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:36,983
I know! There's one
place we've gotta try!

224
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,983
[SOSUKE]
Is this really okay?

225
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:41,358
[UTA]
Gotta be in here somewhere,

226
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,275
just have to keep looking.

227
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:46,775
[UTA gasps]
Bingo!

228
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:52,358
[SOSUKE] I don't even know
what she looks like.

229
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:54,650
Hey, wait, what are you--?!

230
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,067
Who here uses red miso

231
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,942
as the secret
ingredient in her curry?

232
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,025
Raise your hand up high!

233
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:01,275
The heck?!

234
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:02,650
[NOZOMI giggles]

235
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:07,275
[NOZOMI] I see! So you're
the friends Saku mentioned.

236
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:10,025
Yes! I'm Sosuke Kagura.

237
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:12,067
And I'm Uta!

238
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,192
I'm glad. You two seem
like good friends.

239
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,483
Saku's always been a bit shy

240
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,108
and he's not open
about his feelings,

241
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:21,025
so I'm sure he's
been hard to read.

242
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,442
--Yeah!
--[SOSUKE gasps]

243
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,775
Sorry, he didn't mean that!

244
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:27,483
It's fine! His friendly side
is just playing a game

245
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,650
of hide-and-seek
with us right now!

246
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:33,275
It's like the sun peeking out
on a mostly cloudy day!

247
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:37,192
[laughs] Exactly. See, look.

248
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:41,025
If you leave a sunflower alone,
it'll grow towards the light.

249
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:45,025
But whenever I wake up, it's
always turned back towards me.

250
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:47,483
And I know Saku's
the one doing it.

251
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:51,233
He wants to make sure I can see
the flower's face at all times.

252
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:53,692
That's the just kind
of brother he is.

253
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:57,192
Oh, wow. I'm getting
the fuzzies!

254
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,650
So, um...

255
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,817
We're actually here to ask
you about the white shadows.

256
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,817
Do you know how
we can find them?

257
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,317
You two believe in them?

258
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,858
Well, recently, I've seen
some outside my window.

259
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:10,858
None right now.

260
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:13,442
[NOZOMI] Do you boys have
a wish you want granted?

261
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:16,858
Yeah, we do. We wanna wish for
whatever Saku wants to wish for.

262
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,442
Indeed!

263
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,775
Saku has wonderful friends.

264
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:26,900
I can't help but notice

265
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,233
that things are mellower
than usual today.

266
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:30,608
You think?

267
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:33,275
Oh! That must be because of
the added coconut milk!

268
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,358
It can make the spice
level pretty mild.

269
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,567
[MIKE] You dumbass.
I meant Saku, not the curry.

270
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,358
[KAI]
Really? What about him?

271
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:43,108
He's always pretty quiet,
but for some reason,

272
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,358
he just doesn't seem
as broody right now.

273
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:46,817
Yeah, I guess.

274
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,733
Hey, Saku. You seem different.
Did something happen?

275
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:53,233
Really? No, not particularly.

276
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:56,025
[SAKU] I mean, I haven't
found the white shadows.

277
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:59,608
And I keep being a bother
to Sosuke and Uta, but...

278
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:04,942
[KAI]
Hm?

279
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:07,692
[MIKE sighs]
Okay, I'm full now.

280
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,192
Ready to get back
to investigating

281
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,192
that stone circle with me?

282
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,817
Here we are, back at
the scene of the stones!

283
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,317
There have been
reported sightings

284
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,608
of the fabled "white shadows"
near the mysterious henge.

285
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,358
They've currently begun
an intensive investigation..

286
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,858
Where is that happening?!

287
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:27,108
It's... uh... out in the back
woods on campus, remember?

288
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,442
[SAKU]
Sir, I'm really sorry!

289
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,442
But something came up and
I have to leave early!

290
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:33,775
Uh--Saku? Where are you going?!

291
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,192
How's this?!

292
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,358
It's like a purrfect little
kitty heaven now, right?!

293
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:46,858
[HINATA]
Yeah, but...

294
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,858
What exactly do a buncha
cats have to do with us

295
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:51,233
trying to get Saku to
join the Singing Club?

296
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,025
While you guys were taking
a more direct approach,

297
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:54,983
I did some digging of my own.

298
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,108
It's cats! He loves cats!

299
00:15:57,192 --> 00:16:00,150
So if we had more cats,
then he'll join fur sure!

300
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:05,775
Well, I knew your idea would be
dumb, but this is a-paw-ling...

301
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:08,108
I won't have any part of this.

302
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,567
[SATSUMA]
Huh? He's here!

303
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,567
See! I told you cats would work!

304
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,567
Wow! He actually showed up!

305
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,442
How long I've waited for you!

306
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:21,275
The Singing Club is ready
for you to join our ranks!

307
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:23,567
We welcome you with open arms!

308
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,817
Aww yeah!

309
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:33,983
Nice... Saku really
blew me away.

310
