Ah! Saichi Sugimoto!

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center

Easy! She's with me!

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
She's just up ahead,
over that way.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
With Kiroranke and Ogata.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.863 position:50% align:center
This is amazing.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.532 position:50% align:center
Ogata said he confirmed you were
dead up-close at the prison.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50% align:center
That's what he told
Asirpa afterwards.

'Cause he's the bastard
who shot me.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.874 position:50% align:center
Along with her father,
right next to me.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
It was Ogata and Kiroranke.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center

Are you kidding me?

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50% align:center

[SHIRAISHI]
Hold on, is that Ryu?

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
How?

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.103 position:50% align:center
How could I have forgotten
something so important?

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:47.565 position:50% align:center
Aca was so insistent
that I should remember it.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.068 position:50% align:center
If it had something
to do with wolves,

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.488 position:50% align:center
I should've remembered
when I was with Retar.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:58.993 position:50% align:center
Just after he told me
that name, Aca left.

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50% align:center
And Retar did, too.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.793 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA] I was trying my
best not to think about it.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.379 position:50% align:center
So I pushed it out of my mind.

[OGATA] No, it's nothing.
We do need to hurry, though.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
The wind is picking up.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it is.
Let's make shelter over there.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
We can build up the
ice to block the wind.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA] There's driftwood.
We'll use it to make a fire.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
[OGATA]
Asirpa.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
Come with me,
let's look for more firewood.

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:17.799 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
Okay.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ogata,
there's some right here.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
[OGATA]
Asirpa, listen.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.861 position:50% align:center
You've just remembered
something that's very important

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
to the search, haven't you?

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
So... Was it the key
to solving the tattoo code?

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
Are you really gonna
hold back on me?

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
I'd just like some kind of
reward for all the fighting

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
and risking my life
I've done up to now.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
Just like Shiraishi
and Sugimoto.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
I don't need enough money to
found a country or anything.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
All I want is to live a life
of luxury all by myself.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
I have no desire to wind up
at the center of a new war.

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
If you just tell me how to
decipher the code right now,

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
then you can be free from
the danger and the killing.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
You can go back to your kotan
and let your grandma

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center

mountains you love.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.371 position:50% align:center

What would his purpose
be for doing that?

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
All he was waiting for was
for you to confirm that

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
Nopperabo was your father,

Why didn't you
tell me this until today?

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
Because unless I'm wrong,
you've just remembered something

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
that will help crack the code.

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
I had come to the conclusion
that I'd need Kiroranke's help

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
to handle that part of it,
so I just watched

as long as I get that gold,

with Kiroranke any longer.
