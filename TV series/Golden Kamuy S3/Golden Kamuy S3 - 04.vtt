[ASIRPA]
What is that?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
Never seen one.

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
It's a musk deer. Karafuto
Ainu call it an "opokay."

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.920 position:50% align:center
Those fangs mean it's a male.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
Are these supposed to be tasty?

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.222 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
Nope! The meat's not very good,

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
and their pelts aren't
worth much, either.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
But the males have something
called a "musk gland"

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.189 position:50% align:center
between their navel and their
genitals that secretes a liquid.

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:06.566 position:50% align:center
Take a sniff.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.109 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:12.030 position:50% align:center
Nasty! It's like pee
and Aca's armpits!

Ugh!

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:19.204 position:50% align:center
But once it's been dried out,
it becomes a medicine

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
called "musk." And if you
water it down a bit,

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
then, it's supposed to
attract the opposite sex.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
Not that I've ever needed
extra help when it comes

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center
to getting women,
you know what I mean?

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:33.968 position:50% align:center
Wow! Naturally musky!

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.262 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] They don't keep
to a particular territory,

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center
so in Karafuto, they call
seasonal workers "muskies."

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.353 position:50% align:center
Wilk and I did a lot of
wandering when we were younger,

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.438 position:50% align:center
so they called us that, too.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
Really?

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.025 position:50% align:center
Now that I think of it,
he once mentioned to me that

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.444 position:50% align:center
his first hunt was a musk deer.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:54.447 position:50% align:center
He cut his hohchiri
off after it was over.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.032 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
What's a hohchiri?

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.160 position:50% align:center
Oh, they're little triangular
ornaments made of glass beads.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:02.580 position:50% align:center
The Karafuto Ainu boys
attach them to their bangs.

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:05.542 position:50% align:center
When they make their first kill
on their own, they cut them off.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:06.835 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:10.505 position:50% align:center
Asirpa. I used to wear
this when I was young.

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.299 position:50% align:center
When you get a little
older, we'll go hunt.

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:18.096 position:50% align:center
Until then, keep it tied
to your hair, here.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.639 position:50% align:center
That was a hohchiri.

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:22.100 position:50% align:center
I didn't know it was
meant for boys.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the musk deer, now
I've remembered something

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
new about Aca!

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.733 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

[NARRATOR 1A] Toyohara. Known
today as Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
It was the political, economic,
and cultural center of Karafuto.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
I know Enonoka gave you
that and you like it...

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
We need the bag or else we
lose the copied tattoo, right?

but the bad habits

won't seem to go away!

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
'Kay?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Magnificent!

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50% align:center
Not just the talent.
He even looks like a star!

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
Everyone in Karafuto's going
to be talking about him!

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
It defeats the point!

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
We don't want them
talking about you!

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Are you jealous, Sugimoto?

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
No, you dumbass!

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
We're doing this so they'll
put Sugimoto in the show.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
It's hard to be picked on,
but suck it up.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
Just think, if this
helps us find Asirpa,

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
then it'll be worth it.

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
But I...

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
I'm just... extra baggage!

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
It sucks! The girls!
I can't let them down!

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
I'll show you how
the trick works.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
First, you cut a sheet of paper
to prove to the audience

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
that the sword is real.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
And it really did cut it! Wow!

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
Isn't a real sword
dangerous, though?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
Nah, it's safe!
Just part of the gimmick.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
And now, we pray.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
Ohhhhh...

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
Do I have to?

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] Next, we splash a bit
of water, for purification.

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO] Is that necessary?
It's a trick, right?

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
Absolutely crucial.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
Now... I'll make the cut.

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
[CIKAPASI] Ahh! That makes
my balls shrivel right up!

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
How come, Sugimoto Nispa?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
Don't know...

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
And after splashing a bit on
the leg, you cut that, too.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] At this point, the
crowd will be pale as a sheet

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
and howling in terror.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Those are some huge nipples!

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Finally...

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.736 position:50% align:center
[CIKAPASI whimpers]

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.613 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA]
Seppuku!

00:10:55.697 --> 00:11:01.870 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
[CIKAPASI whimpering]

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
That's about it.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
Then someone comes in to cover
me with a sheet and drag me

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
behind the scenes, and the
harakiri show is complete.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.177 position:50% align:center
--Oh! Ho-ho!
--Ohh!

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] The explanation
for the trick is simple.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
There's a groove running
down the edge of the blade,

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
and it's chock full of red dye.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
I get it...

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
Add the water,
and it looks like blood.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
So, are you ready to practice?

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:30.231 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Mm-hmm.

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS squealing]

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
[CIRCUS GIRL 28A]
He's amazing!

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.365 position:50% align:center
[CIRCUS GIRL 28C]
How incredible!

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
Try throwing a kiss toward the
audience while you're up there!

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
How do you throw a kiss?

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
Mwah! Like that, it's easy!

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
Foreign audiences love it!

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
[KOITO]
Ahh...

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
That's enough!

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
Listen, Koito!

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
We don't need you
in the Karafuto show!

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
[KOITO] You should be focusing
on your own performance.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
Honestly, at this point, the
chances of anyone around here

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
remembering your name
are slim to none.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO growls]

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
The harakiri trick gets a lot
of attention, too, y'know.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
The foreign audiences
were so sure I was dead...

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
...they even wrote about it
in the local news.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
Yeah, all right.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Better practice.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
Genjiro!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
Look at you,
falling behind again!

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
That ass too heavy
to step lively?!

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
Sorry, ma'am.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
[CIRCUS GIRL 28D]
Aw, don't cry, Genjiro!

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
[CIRCUS GIRL 28E]
We know you can do it.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
[BENIKO] Come on, girls,
you need to get back.

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
Hurry, before Fumie gets mad.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
[CIRCUS GIRLS]
Okay!

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[CIRCUS GIRL 28F]
See you later, Genjiro!

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
[TANIGAKI whimpering]

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
[BENIKO]
Y'know what? This show?

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.021 position:50% align:center
It's going to be my last one.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
Ah? Beniko...

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
The dancing girls
are all orphans.

00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:01.031 position:50% align:center
The Yamada Circus looks
after us while we're young.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
But once we're old enough,
we get left behind

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
when the circus moves on
to the next town.

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
That's just the way it works,
and now it's my turn.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
You're serious?

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
You know... I'm really happy
I get to dance with you,

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
in the end.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
Let's make sure the Karafuto
show is a big success!

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
[TANIGAKI sobs]

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center

All right, folks!

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
We've got a full house!

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
It's great!

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
So let's look our
best out there!

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
Bring up the curtain!
It's showtime!

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] Honored guests, may I
have your attention, please!

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the
great Yamada Circus.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
A show unlike
any you've ever seen!

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
It defeated the whole purpose
of what we were doing.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
I thought about it and
decided some sabotage

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
would solve the problem.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
[KOITO] I replaced that
katana's blade with my own.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center

Huh?!

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.322 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
It's a real sword?!

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
Now what?
Should I cut the act short?

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center

No! I can't!

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
It seems their actual
target was the ringmaster.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.546 position:50% align:center
They were supposed to get
the man doing the harakiri show.

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
I'd say he got lucky.

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they came the one time it
just happened to be Sugimoto.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.762 position:50% align:center
Who sent 'em?

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Someone from the
Russian government, they said.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Why would the Russians

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
be after the ringmaster?

Yes, I am now.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
I was an officer with
the Imperial Army.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
Embedded in Russia for a while.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
I was there for years
before the war broke out.

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
I was one of our
intelligence operatives.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
But it's safe to say, the
Russians uncovered my identity.

Well, you're one shitty spy.

You need to bury all three
of them under the tent.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
Then, in the morning, we'll pull
out of here, as planned.

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center

...two sentences.

I can't do that.

But why not?!

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
Because Lieutenant Tsurumi
wouldn't approve of it.

[YAMADA whimpers]

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
We're looking for some people
who may have passed by here.

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
The first has close ties to an
ethnic minority partisan group

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.698 position:50% align:center
from near the Amur.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
We believe he's now headed north
to rendezvous with his comrades.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
Know anything that might help?

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:29.956 position:50% align:center
Partisans, huh?

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.418 position:50% align:center
Well, actually, one thing
does come to mind.

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center
[YAMADA] About 530 kilometers
north of Toyohara,

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center

town, there sits

I remember hearing that a large
group of eastern minorities

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
was moved there as
punishment for plotting

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center
some kind of resistance
a while back.

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
That could be it.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a place
Kiroranke would make for.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.112 position:50% align:center
Well, the performance
might not have helped.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:04.324 position:50% align:center
but that intel from Ringmaster
Yamada could prove useful

00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center
No, it did help.

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:10.705 position:50% align:center
It might only be misspelled, and
short, but if Asirpa sees this,

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.832 position:50% align:center
I know she'll understand.

00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
I just have to hope those
blue eyes catch a glimpse

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:17.921 position:50% align:center
of this proof that
I'm still alive

00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:22.258 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shiraishi.
Look at this.

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:23.468 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI]
Huh?

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.804 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA] It's poop!
And it's still steaming!

00:22:25.887 --> 00:22:28.264 position:50% align:center
There must be some
big game in the area!

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:31.601 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI] Sorry, that's my
poop from a few minutes ago.

Elsewhere, Asirpa found what

00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:35.897 position:50% align:center
she thought was a lead.
