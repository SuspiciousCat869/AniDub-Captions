Yes. I know.
You had your eyes closed.

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Just curious.

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
What exactly was
your plan, anyway?

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
--Uh... I dunno.
--Uh?!

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
[GANSOKU]
Shall we continue, then?

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
I assume you still want to
walk away with my skin.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
Look, I don't want to kill you.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
But somebody will
come after the tattoos.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
You may be a great brawler,
but you can't win against a gun.

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
--[GANSOKU] Hmm...
--So let us make a copy.

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
We'll use it to track down
the gold ourselves.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
Then there won't be a reason for
anyone else to come after you.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
Leave Karafuto.
Go as far west as you can.

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
They won't follow you to
the other end of the continent.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
Pursue stenka in
its birthplace, Russia.

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:14.756 position:50% align:center
All right. I guess I'll have
to find someone stronger.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME grunts]
Are you kidding?!

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
Stop with the steam,
this is ridiculous!

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
By the way, that name I heard
Sugimoto saying earlier.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
What'd I say?

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.685 position:50% align:center
--[GANSOKU] Asir...
--[gasps]

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
Wait, do you know Asirpa?

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
That's it. Yes, Asirpa.

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
A little Ainu girl, right?

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
I remember that name because
the man she was traveling with

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
was another tattooed prisoner.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Shiraishi!

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
[GANSOKU] They went into a
tavern, and I decided to follow.

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
I was curious what
could have brought him

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:48.498 position:50% align:center
all the way up to Karafuto.

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
Could you hear?
What'd she talk about?

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
Hard to say.
But I'd guess it was about you.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI] I thought
I couldn't imagine him dying.

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
I know I even said
as much before, but...

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
What?

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
I mean, if he didn't follow us
up here, then maybe...

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
But who knows, right?

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
What are you saying, Shiraishi?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
Never doubt Immortal Sugimoto.

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.628 position:50% align:center
It's headed your way, Asirpa!

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA yells]

00:23:15.437 --> 00:23:17.772 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] Sea lions go
north of Karafuto to breed

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:20.400 position:50% align:center
in the summer, then they
head south to Hokkaido for

00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:22.569 position:50% align:center
the winter this time of year.

00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:25.196 position:50% align:center
This one might've
been doing just that.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.658 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA] We call them etaspe.
They're good.

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:31.202 position:50% align:center
Their fatty meat is
considered a delicacy.

00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:32.203 position:50% align:center
Try some.

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:33.788 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI]
Ahh...

00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:38.835 position:50% align:center
[OGATA whimpers]

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.253 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
You can't chew through it?

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:42.172 position:50% align:center
Maybe it was too thick.

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:43.381 position:50% align:center
Hinna, yeah?

00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI]
I don't know, it's very stinky.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.678 position:50% align:center
I hit this thing right
between the eyes,

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.847 position:50% align:center
but it still didn't go down.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.642 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA] It's like a bear.
The bone on the head is strong.

00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:56.811 position:50% align:center
So keep in mind, if you're
fighting a tough one,

00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:59.439 position:50% align:center
don't ever aim for the head.
[groans]

00:23:59.522 --> 00:24:02.275 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI] Sounds like
somebody too much fat.

00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:04.319 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:24:04.402 --> 00:24:05.904 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
Hmph.

00:24:07.572 --> 00:24:10.283 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Next Time: "Igogusa"!
