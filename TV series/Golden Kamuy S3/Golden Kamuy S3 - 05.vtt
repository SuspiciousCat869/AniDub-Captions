This is as far as our deal with
those Karafuto Ainu

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.747 position:50% align:center
will take us.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.332 position:50% align:center
Their sleds helped us
cover serious ground.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.252 position:50% align:center
But now we're broke.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Sugimoto's idea
that Asirpa was in the vicinity

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
of Toyohara was very wrong.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
Her group had already
made it to Shizuka,

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
a town near the Russian border.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI] If we did some
more hunting and sold the pelts,

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.268 position:50% align:center
that could help with
our money problem, right?

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
Sables, maybe?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.189 position:50% align:center
With all the streams
around here frozen over,

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:05.690 position:50% align:center
catching hoinu
would be too difficult

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.317 position:50% align:center
to be worth the effort.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.612 position:50% align:center
They can just run across the
ice, avoiding any traps we set.

The heck's that?

It's a coffin.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.057 position:50% align:center
The Uilta people practice what's
known as sky burial.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
The Uilta?

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.393 position:50% align:center
Karafuto is home
to three different groups

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
of indigenous peoples,
spread across the island.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
The Karafuto Ainu.
The Uilta.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
And the Nivkh.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
The Karafuto Ainu don't live
anywhere past Shizuka.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
We've crossed into the territory
of the Uilta and Nivkh.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.952 position:50% align:center
It's the Uilta who lay
their dead to rest

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
among the trees like this.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's pretty interesting.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
It is. The custom's
disappearing, though.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
A lot of the Uilta have been
converted and are now

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.799 position:50% align:center
buried in the earth.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center

Ogata, what did you shoot?

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
An Ezo deer.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
There are no
Ezo deer in Karafuto.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA] I've never seen
one of these before.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
It does look like a yuk.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
That's a reindeer.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
It's got something on its neck.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] It's tied there
and positioned to collide with

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.913 position:50% align:center
the beast's legs as it walks
to prevent it from running off.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.457 position:50% align:center
They call it an ulaa changaini.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA] Let's see if
it works on Shiraishi.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
Good idea.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
Line it up with his dick, so he
doesn't run off to any brothels.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
It's a dick changaini!

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
If the reindeer's
got a collar on,

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
you think that means it
belongs to someone?

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there must be
some of the Uilta nearby.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
They let their reindeer roam
and graze at night,

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
then gather them up
again in the morning.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
[UILTA 29A]
Toh! Toh!

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
There's one of them now.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
Calling the reindeer.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy. You're screwed.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
They're not gonna be very happy.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
Just tell them you're sorry.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
Maybe offer up
some tobacco, too.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.
I'll be right there with you.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
You'll be fine.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
They live nomadically, migrating
alongside their reindeer herds

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
and using tents for shelter.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center
Oh. So they don't have
permanent settlements.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
help us hunt a

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI] Why do they
need to hunt more when

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
they've already got so many?

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] The herds
they keep as livestock are

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
their only material wealth,
so they're too precious to be

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
used for food.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
They only kill the
wild mountain reindeer.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
Wilk once made
the same mistake as Ogata.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
He shot a reindeer without
knowing it belonged

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
to an Uilta herd.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
Really?

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Remember--he grew up
in southern Karafuto.

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
They didn't have reindeer there,
so he was unaware

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
of the grazing custom.

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
He apologized and went hunting
with them to make up for

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
the one he killed.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center
I've never heard that story
before, I don't think.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
I'll do it, then. You, too?

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
I'm in. Maybe it'll help
with my memories.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] The Uilta call the
reindeer they domesticate "ulaa"

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
and the mountain ones "sire."
That's a herd of sire.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI]
Why're they digging in the snow?

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] They're grazing
on the reindeer lichen

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
that's underneath it.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
They seem focused on eating,
but there's always one

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
on lookout duty.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
If you take out that one first,
then the herd will be

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50% align:center
too spooked to run.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
Makes the rest of them
much easier to pick off.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.403 position:50% align:center
That doesn't sound much
different than killing people.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.489 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] To keep the guard
from spotting them and alerting

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
the rest of the herd,
the hunters tie long ropes

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
to their own reindeer and
creep along behind them.

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
That way, they're able
to get in close.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center

How did you know that?

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50% align:center
It's a reindeer you use as
camouflage when you're hunting.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
I just remembered
Aca talking about it!

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
Heh.

Ow!

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
Jeez. That looked like it hurt.

'Cause it did!

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
If stupid Ogata hadn't shot
that stupid reindeer,

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't be out here
doing this crap.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
We should've just run for it
instead of apologizing

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
like a buncha saps.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center

Besides, this was
actually part of the plan.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
We need the Uilta's help
to get further north,

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center

[speaking Uilta]

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] He says
the lookout's on the far right.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
Mountain reindeer
are easily spooked,

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
so hunting them is difficult.

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center

Quick. Give me yours.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
[OGATA]
A Berdan M1870, huh?

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center

[SHIRAISHI]
Wow!

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's stop
staring and get to work.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
Skinning them will be tough,
and we'll need several trips

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
for all the meat.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
They say that, for some reason,

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
the wild mountain reindeer taste
better than the ones they tend.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
Mm!

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
Reindeer don't just
look like yuk.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.112 position:50% align:center
They taste the same.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
Mm. Light flavor that
doesn't linger.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
So, do brains taste the same
no matter what they come from?

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
What's she up to there?

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
She's using that stick
to churn reindeer milk

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
into something called ari.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
[slurps] This is basically
like reindeer butter, then.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
It's pretty tasty.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] They spread
ari on this baked bread

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
called lipeeska.
It's a delicious combination.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
Hinna! Hinna!

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
named Kiroranke.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
Some would consider him
a hero, but to others,

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
he's a criminal guilty of

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
killing Russia's

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
I'm the sniper.
I decide when my prey dies.

[RUSSIAN SOLDIER 29A groaning]

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
[OGATA]
No.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't show himself
to go help those men.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
He could listen to their
screams all night long

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center
without flinching.

00:20:57.048 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center

[ILYA speaks Russian]

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.
What's he saying?

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
[speaks Russian]

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:45.722 position:50% align:center
[VASILI]
I found you.

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:56.524 position:50% align:center
[VASILI] Firing just once will
be enough to tell him were I am.

00:21:56.608 --> 00:22:01.237 position:50% align:center
So this first shot
needs to be fatal.

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
Because if he lives,

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center
I'll be the next target.

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:28.932 position:50% align:center
[VASILI]
Strange.

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:32.727 position:50% align:center
He should have moved
at least slightly.

Next Time: "Bad Sign."
