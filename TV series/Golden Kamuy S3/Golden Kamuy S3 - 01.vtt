a very real chance Nopperabo

Did we have to do all this
just to get some gold?

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
[HIJIKATA] It's not
the gold we want, though,

[NARRATOR] There are three
major Ainu groups found

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
in this region:
the Chishima Ainu,

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
the Hokkaido Ainu,
and the Karafuto Ainu.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
At the time, the Karafuto
Ainu lived along the rivers

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
and the southern coast.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
These Ainu made their
living mostly by fishing.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
This is our place.
In summertime, we live here.

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.269 position:50% align:center
Henke and me. Is good.

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center

to winter home, over there.

Yes, for heat and cold!

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Karafuto is situated
further north than Hokkaido.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
In order to survive,
the Ainu here had to adapt to

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
the region's brutally
cold temperatures.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
To do so, they developed their
own unique way of life.

God, it stinks!
What are you putting on me?

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
Because... once I ate a bunch
of hurep and barfed it up!

nothing else you did

Yes. They told us
they were going north.

She wasn't.
She seemed very sad.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center
She didn't say a word.

eat up the salted hurep.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
She smiled more.

those prisoners went?

Tell him in Russian that
if he doesn't give it back,

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
I'll slice his balding
head off and filet it,

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.604 position:50% align:center
just like a fish.

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
Tell him that.

I'm afraid that's a little

The man we're looking for,
and he means Kiroranke,

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
was searching for tattooed men
who'd come from Hokkaido.

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
And that's the reason
he came here?

[BARTENDER 1A speaking Russian]

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:13.385 position:50% align:center
The man with tattoos
might come to the stenka.

The escaped prisoners.

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
That means they
made it this far north.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] This building's
where the stenka is held.

[NARRATOR] Its official name
is Stenka na Stenku!

Wall versus Wall!

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
A traditional Russian sport
where several large,

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
half- naked men face off
against each other

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.927 position:50% align:center
in a ring and fight!

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
The origin of the
name is simple:

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
it comes from the wall
of muscled men!

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
That is the stenka!

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] The stenka
got its start as part of

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
a typical festival competition
held between villages.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
But then.

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
One day, a man showed up
and began to place bets on it.

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
Get this. He was Japanese,

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
and he had
a strange tattoo.

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
There seem to be
a lot of Japanese here.

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Rich people come from
Odomari and Toyohara to bet.

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
So that prisoner here?

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
Is he comin' out?

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
He only fights the
strongest of the strong.

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
Some days, he doesn't enter, if
there's no one to entertain him.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
Okay, then I have to win.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
If I wanna drag him out, I just
gotta fight those guys first.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
If he gets out there, we can see
if he's got the tattoos.

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.812 position:50% align:center
What do you think,
did Kiroranke's group give up

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
and move on?

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:53.234 position:50% align:center
Well, are they looking for their
people and then coming back?

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
That prisoner...

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
He's the type to flee to
Karafuto and still pick fights.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
It must be someone like Nihei
Tetsuzou or Henmi Kazuo.

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
Someone not interested
in the gold.

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
Guys like that are real
trouble if they get away.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
Anyway, tell him
we'll win the stenka,

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
so if he doesn't give back
the dog, I'll rip out

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
what little hair he has left.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center

I'm with him.
Can't you enter by yourself?

fault for hitting the guy.
