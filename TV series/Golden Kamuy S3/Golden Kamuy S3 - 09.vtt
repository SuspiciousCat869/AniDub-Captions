So, what you're saying is,

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
if we can get this woman,
Sofia, who knows so much

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
about Asirpa's dad out of jail,
we might learn something

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
that'll help figure out
the code for the gold.

Do I have that right?

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna say
it's impossible,

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
but it feels like... the risk
isn't worth the reward.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
Dozens of Sofia's men are locked
away in Ako Prison right now.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
All of them are allies who
once fought alongside her

for the independence of
the far east minorities.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center
Oh, now I see.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
So, the plan is to get 'em
on our side, right?

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
But if we find
the gold with their help

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
instead of independently, will
that really benefit the Ainu?

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
It'll benefit not just the Ainu,

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
but the Nivkh and
the Uilta, too.

[KIRORANKE] Hasegawa
initially moved to Russia

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
back in his teens because his
father's job took them there.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:41.961 position:50% align:center
An acquaintance ended up giving
him that photography studio,

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
and he began to work as
a photographer in Vladivostok.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
Then, he married a local woman.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
He must have been happy
to get a chance to speak

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
his native language again,
because he agreed to teach us.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
He's the only reason any
of us learned Japanese.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] We sheltered
at a local farmhouse

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
We'd already spent ten years on
the run for killing the emperor.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
This was a brief
respite from that life.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
And Sofia immediately treated
me like a little brother.

that's the same wolf I saw

the day you came here.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
Wolves are perfect,
beautiful creatures.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
They lead strong lives,
with nothing wasted.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
That's what makes
them beautiful.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
Beauty and strength
are one and the same.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
Although, if a wolf is alone,
then you should beware.

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
Because that would mean
there's something wrong with it.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
It couldn't get along
with its comrades, so it left.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
Or it was kicked out.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
[KOUICHI] You certainly do know
a lot about the mountains.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
It's hard knowing
how to factor that in,

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:31.506 position:50% align:center
since you won't say a word about
where you really came from.

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
It seems obvious enough that
you're not from the nobility,

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
the way Zoya is.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
She may be dressed
like a peasant,

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
but she can read
and write in Russian.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
And occasionally, she's also
been known to speak French.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
[KOUICHI]
Here.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
Merci.

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center
Members of Russia's
upper classes often prefer

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
to speak French rather
than their native Russian.

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
I think Hasegawa
knew who she was.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.120 position:50% align:center
She was careful,
but that gave her away.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
In those days, some of the
Russian nobles and intellectuals

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
developed a trend
of dressing as peasants

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
and living amongst
them by choice.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
It was their way of attempting
to modernize the state

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
and overthrow the emperor
and the old ways.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center

always knew exactly who we were.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] In the history
of the Russian Empire,

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
they have always had
what are called "serfs."

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
They're halfway between
farmers and slaves.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
And they have no rights at all.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
Sofia and other revolutionaries
tried to get them to rise up.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
But they refused.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
The revolutionaries
decided it was because of

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
their religious beliefs.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50% align:center
The faith so deeply ingrained
in the serfs was tied directly

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
to the worship of their emperor,
a bond not so easily broken.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] There was no choice
but to prove that the emperor

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
was a mere mortal,
and not a representative of God.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
That's the line of thought
that led to his assassination.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
To the ethnic minorities,

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
Russian expansion
is a serious threat.

Our kamuy are being replaced
by their god and his ways.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
Someday, if we aren't careful,
we'll wake up pious believers

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
who never complain.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
So Wilk and I decided

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
that joining the revolutionaries
would help our cause.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
We would fight alongside Sofia
and those who shared her ideals,

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
working toward a common goal.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
[KOUICHI] Toshimichi Ookubo
is considered a cruel man

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
because he was willing
to do whatever it took

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
to achieve his goals,
but he was also a man of bold,

of the Meiji Restoration
that ended the shogunate.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
Thanks to their efforts,
Japan was the one nation in Asia

She's still uncertain, though.

So, convince her.

Sofia blamed herself.

I told her that the bullet
that killed the baby

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
might've been mine,
but it didn't help.

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
If there are warrants
reaching out this far,

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
then no port will be safe.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
That makes getting
into Japan tricky.

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
We'll go further north.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
And after that? Then what?

We'll see. I have an idea.

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
What we've been waiting for
has finally arrived.

The appearance of the ice floes.

[KIRORANKE]
The Strait of Tartary will

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
soon be covered in ice.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.881 position:50% align:center
Which will provide us
with a path to the mainland.

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
[WILK] We can simply
walk across the ice.

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.597 position:50% align:center
It won't take long.
We can get there in a day.

from the Russian government.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
So now we have a plan.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center

the ice to the mainland.
