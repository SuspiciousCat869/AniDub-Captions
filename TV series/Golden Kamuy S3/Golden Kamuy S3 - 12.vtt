It was Ogata that shot me
back at Abashiri Prison.

Wilk, too.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
Kiroranke was the one
who gave him the signal.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.396 position:50% align:center

did confront him about it.

Why he killed Wilk.

something about how

Wilk had changed.

supposedly planning to tell

their old comrades about
the location of the gold.

the ice will melt and he'll rest
in the water of his homeland.

roll it up and smash it.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
And then they mix
in lingonberries

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
and black crowberries,
and flavor it with seal fat.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
They leave it outside
to cool, then it's done.

You can only eat it
in the winter.
