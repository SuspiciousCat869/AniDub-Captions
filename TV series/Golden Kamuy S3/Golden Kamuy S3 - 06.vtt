Is this Kiroranke Nispa?

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.751 position:50% align:center
So, these Russian border
guards were after Kiro.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.545 position:50% align:center
Guess he has a way
of pissing people off.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
But why is he on
a wanted poster?

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
When I was 15,

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:56.473 position:50% align:center
I became involved with a group

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.475 position:50% align:center

[KIRORANKE] Asirpa's father
was there, as well.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.691 position:50% align:center
We killed a man that day.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.943 position:50% align:center
The Emperor of Russia.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:31.169 position:50% align:center
[VASILI] Well... I've been
watching him for an hour now.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
Not only hasn't he moved, but I
can't even see him breathing.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
[VASILI]
Actually, looking closer,

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
that's a careless hiding place.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
[VASILI] You can see his gun and
that covering even from below.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
A man capable
of firing that shot

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
wouldn't make that
kind of mistake.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
[VASILI] Just one shot,
but it clearly came from

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
an experienced sniper.

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
[VASILI] I'll keep my eye
on him as I move.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI]
Ogata's late.

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
What do you think,
should we go help him out?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
No need. He told us
he wanted to go alone.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't get between them.
It wouldn't be safe.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.638 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
We need to trust his skills.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
Give him a chance to end this.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
[VASILI] I didn't notice
without the sunlight.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
Did he cover his
tracks in the snow?

That's why he's not moving!

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
It's a decoy!

You look terrible.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
It's a fever.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
You should probably drink
as much as you can.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
Hurry, though.
We're getting out of here.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
Aren't you cold
back there? Brother?

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you
inviting me along.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.549 position:50% align:center
At the barracks, it feels like
people are avoiding me.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
how about if you join me

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
at another bar, then?

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50% align:center
Of course. I'd be honored.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
There was an old myth that
virgin girls couldn't be hit

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
by bullets, so people carried
locks of their pubic hair

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
for good luck.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
Actually, male virgins were
treated the same way.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
You're a perfect face for the
regiment because you've got

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
principles and good looks.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
A flag-bearer carries
that responsibility.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.457 position:50% align:center
I've heard that part of the
reason you were chosen is that

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
you've never known a woman.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
[OGATA] The flag-bearer is the
first to breach enemy ranks,

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
so they have the highest death
rate of any job in the army.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
Trust me, the women who work at
this brothel are very discreet.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
So have fun.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
All that matters is that
the regiment believes

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
you're still a virgin.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
Seriously, you should
try to relax.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center

trouble together.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center

it's his cousin's home.

It's a branch whose
name means "bitter bush."

It seems that
the cousin is a "sama."

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
They believe the sama are those
who are capable of mediating

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
between man and the gods.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
So, when people fall sick,
a sama will offer up prayers.

[rhythmic thumping]

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] You see, the Uilta
believe that when people

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
get sick, they're actually
possessed by demons called amba.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.659 position:50% align:center
They communicate with
the gods through both singing

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
and drumming to drive
the demons away.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
They believe,
the louder the noise,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
the faster the gods will come.

[KIRORANKE]
Music is a very spiritual thing.

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center
It has a strong effect
on the subconscious.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
It makes clear the connection
between the patient

Your brother's every bit

I will give him that.

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
I believe he simply got
scared and lost his nerve.

Yes, let's hope so.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to win him over.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure about that.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
A strong sense of justice
will make it hard

to win him to our side.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
After all, he has very noble
blood running through his veins.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
[OGATA] There's no such
thing as noble blood.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
That means, somehow,
you have to know what it is.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
So, maybe... Kiro brought
you here for a reason:

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
to try and force
you to remember.

Get it? That's why I haven't
said anything so far!

we're in Russia!

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
I mean, he was hiding some
important things from us!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
I believe that he and Wilk
were both trying to steal

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
the Ainu gold in order to use it
in the fight against Russia!

Let's leave our stuff.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center

[KIRORANKE]
My old name was Yulbars.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
I was born as a Tatar,
but with Karafuto Ainu blood.

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
My great-grandmother was a
Karafuto Ainu who was sold off.

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
Sold like goods to pay off
a debt and taken to the Amur.

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
Wilk's father was also
a Karafuto Ainu.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
The emperor that
Wilk and I killed?

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
He was the Czar who'd
signed the unjust
