[TSURUMI] Breaking codes
attracts a certain type.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
The history of codebreaking
has also been the history

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
of codebreakers being committed.

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
They're driven by an obsession
which makes them unable

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
to function in daily life.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
So, I decided that until we had
acquired a certain number skins,

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.469 position:50% align:center
it would be best if we
didn't even attempt it.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
But now we have this many.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
Shall we kidnap
somebody from the army?

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
No. I have a hard time
believing he'd use

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
the kind of complex code
that would actually require

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.107 position:50% align:center
a professional cryptographer.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.527 position:50% align:center
He's made it something that his
daughter Asirpa can decrypt.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
Of that, I have no doubt.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.491 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
Hmm? Hey, Sugimoto.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
How do you read this?

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.243 position:50% align:center
That's "u."

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
You know, as in "ukai."

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
To go around.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.542 position:50% align:center
You know, Aca did tell me
to go to school and study.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.088 position:50% align:center
We have no written language.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.715 position:50% align:center
But I've never missed it.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.134 position:50% align:center
We can get by fine
without letters.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.220 position:50% align:center
You agree with me, right?

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:36.971 position:50% align:center

What're you staring at?

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:42.227 position:50% align:center
The tracing of Gansoku's tattoo?

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.770 position:50% align:center
Did you notice something?

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
There's no way Sugimoto
could crack the code.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
He's a moron.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there was
something I noticed.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.322 position:50% align:center
But I damn sure won't
be telling you.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.587 position:50% align:center
Oh, my!

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
I can carry even more!

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're so strong!

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
[USHIYAMA] Hell, if you
come a little closer,

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
I'll carry you, too!

[HIJIKATA]
Pardon me, ladies,

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
but I wonder if either of you
can tell me what this is?

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:48.645 position:50% align:center
Huh? I have no idea.
Do you know?

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 32C]
Hmm... Maybe some kind of claw?

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
Or part of a plant?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
[HIJIKATA] I found this in the
hidden room at Abashiri Prison.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.742 position:50% align:center
[HIJIKATA] According
to Inudou's information,

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
one of the tattooed prisoners,
Shinzo Doi,

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.623 position:50% align:center
had it on him when he was there.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:11.167 position:50% align:center
Eight years ago,
on the coast of Kushiro.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
Shinzo Doi was captured
and subsequently imprisoned.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
I was hoping whatever this is
might help lead us to him.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
Seems worth a try.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
[USHIYAMA]
Pardon me, yanshuu.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
[KIRAUSHI]
Hmm?

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
Can you help?

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
We're looking for
a place to stay tonight.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.893 position:50% align:center
Any suggestions?

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
Follow me.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.940 position:50% align:center
[KIRAUSHI]
Do you eat shishamo smelt?

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
They swarm the coasts
of Kushiro this time of year.

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
We Kushiro Ainu don't usually
fish for them in normal times,

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
but my kotan is starving now.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50% align:center
[USHIYAMA]
Hmm.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
It's good!

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
Indeed. By the way...

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to know
what this little piece is?

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
[KIRAUSHI]
It's from an etupirka.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
From a what, now?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
A seabird found in the North
Pacific whose name means

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
"beautiful beak" in Ainu.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
This is actually
part of its beak.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
It's a marker to attract
the opposite sex.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
After their breeding season
ends, it falls off.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
[NAGAKURA] How do you know
so much about it?

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
[KIRAUSHI] The Japanese
don't hunt them, but we do.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
Shishamo can only be caught on
the Pacific side of Hokkaido.

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
In that same way, etupirka can
only be found east of Kushiro,

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
around Nemuro.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center
Nemuro, huh?

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
It's possible we're finally
getting closer to him.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
[NAGAKURA]
Your name is Kiraushi, right?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
Kiraushi, are you willing to
take us to the Nemuro Ainu?

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
You'll be well paid.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to!

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.676 position:50% align:center
The pay here isn't worth
the work they ask of you.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
[NAGAKURA]
Hmm. You need to make sure

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
you're ready for this, Ushiyama.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
Why? He's old.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
I think he's even older
than you, isn't that right?

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
Which means that he should
be barely able to walk,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
so I think I'm fine.

[FISHERMAN 32A] It makes me
sick, looking at that guy.

Why is he wearing
Ainu clothes, anyway?

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
He wears them because
Ainu atsushi dry fast.

I'm not the only guard who
was ordered to find him.

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center

the man named Shinzo Doi well.

Apparently, he lived
here in the kotan.

We were right--Yoichiro
the Manslayer did come here

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
to Nemuro.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
[KIRAUSHI] It seems
he drifted to this kotan

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
around 30 years ago.

He lived in the village
in peace for a long time.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
But eight years ago, a Japanese
man with a grudge against him

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
showed up here and
took his wife hostage.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
He killed the man to get
his wife back and for that,

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
he was sent to Abashiri Prison.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.153 position:50% align:center
But when he found out
his wife was sick,

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
and had little
time left to live,

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
that's when he made his escape.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
After he saw her breathe
her last, he left the Ainu,

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
and now he works
at a fishery nearby.

doing here, anyway?

Aw, leave him alone.
He wet his bed this morning.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
Which means he doesn't
have much time left.

what Yoichiro the

may have been correct.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
After the Meiji Restoration,

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center

in order to better resist

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center

both China and Russia.

But winning the Russo-Japanese
War didn't do anything

to stop Russia's
sweep to the south.

Japan was no longer able
to continue the war.

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
So, they were given
no reparations,

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
and instead settled Karafuto.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center

the limits of its usefulness.

any chance to protect the north.

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
We must welcome immigrants
from overseas to make

So, that's what I did.

I don't begrudge my fate, that I
failed to die at Hakodate.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:41.973 position:50% align:center
I lived on because
I have a job to do.

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
I-I didn't imagine it, did I?

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
So, what're you thinkin'?

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:30.749 position:50% align:center
About how long do you figure
we'll stay here, in Ako?

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
A little while longer.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
What else are we
planning on doing here?

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
We're not just gonna
interview this prisoner, right?

00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:41.593 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] If we manage
to help Sofia escape,

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
the guards will
undoubtedly follow.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
Definitely.

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] So, instead,
we're going to help

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
all 250 prisoners escape.

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:55.440 position:50% align:center
If they all run, the guards
won't be able to focus on Sofia.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:59.235 position:50% align:center
How exactly are we gonna get
that many people out of there?

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:02.322 position:50% align:center
By starting explosions along
the walls outside the prison,

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:03.823 position:50% align:center
at multiple points.

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:05.909 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAISHI] Where are we going
to get the bombs for that?

00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center
If we do it here,
they'll be able to track us.

00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
--Right there.
--[GROUP] Hmm?

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.503 position:50% align:center
You mean that building?

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:18.171 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
It's a lighthouse.

00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:20.548 position:50% align:center
And it's been well-supplied
with explosives in the event

00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:22.842 position:50% align:center
of another Japanese attack.

00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:27.055 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
So, now, we wait.

00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:31.559 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] When they come,
we'll have everything we need.

00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:09.532 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Next time: "Revolutionary."
