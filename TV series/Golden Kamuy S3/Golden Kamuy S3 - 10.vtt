00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center

It doesn't look like
I can get there this way.

I think I'll have
better luck heading back!

I'll hurry and catch up,
so wait for me!

Hmm?

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.188 position:50% align:center
It's a wolf pack.

I doubt it.

Wolves are perfect,

They lead strong lives,

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
That's what makes
them beautiful.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center

[SOFIA] One night, we were being
chased by the secret police

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
and fled into the forest.

One of us was badly wounded.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
He couldn't move at all.

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] He ended up
passing out from the pain,

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
which meant we had to stop.

[BOTH gasp]

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] The truth was,
he wouldn't have survived

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.184 position:50% align:center
either way.

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
And as it turned out,
we only just evaded capture.

[SOFIA]
If it had been me,

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
I probably would have hesitated,
fretted and wasted time

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
before finally reaching
the same conclusion.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA]
But Wilk...

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
He was someone who could reach
that answer in a single leap.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.419 position:50% align:center
I trusted that man with
my whole heart and soul.

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
Unconditionally.

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
And I loved him.

We're shooting the baby, too?

We can't take it to the kotan?

00:16:57.308 --> 00:17:00.186 position:50% align:center
[WILK] It's already too big
for us to raise.

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
[WILK] Why? Do you think
it's cruel, Asirpa?

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
Parent and child will
become blood and meat,

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
and together,
they'll sustain our lives.

Baby bears are a source of food.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
If we hesitate
because it's cruel,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
then our people would starve.

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
When you misplace pity and
kindness, it can be a weakness.

No, I don't think
I've ever heard that story.

Do you know? Asirpa?

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure, but I think he
might've told me about it once.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
What did he say?

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] There was an incident
in his early life that shaped

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
who he would become later on.

[WILK panting]

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:05.502 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] When he was
very young, before his name

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
was changed to Wilk,
he found a weakened wolf

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
lying in the woods,
near the kotan.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
He came to see it faithfully,
every day, without fail.

[howls]

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] Eventually, it began
to howl, calling to its kind.

[howling]

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA]
And other howls answered it.

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] Wilk could see that
it wanted to rejoin its pack,

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
but even as a child, he realized
the wolf had been driven off

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
because of some illness,
or defect.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
Then, one day,
the pack returned.

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
[WILK gasps]

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] But as Wilk watched,
they killed the lone wolf.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
They had decided it no longer
had a place in the pack.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
Because in a pack, a single
weak link is a threat to all.

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA]
Wolves are logical and rational.

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
Any kindness they might've had
has been scraped away to ensure

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
the survival of their species.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
A functional beauty,
with nothing wasted.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
That's what Wilk saw
in the way the wolves lived.

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA] He wanted to be
that kind of creature.

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
So, he stripped
the carcass of its pelt

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.634 position:50% align:center
and ran around wearing it.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
His Polish father was
struck by the sight of his son.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:43.600 position:50% align:center
That day,
he decided on his name.

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:48.063 position:50% align:center
"You're Wilk."

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
Wilk means "wolf"
in Polish. Right.

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
So, that's where it came from.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center

Will you tell me about Mommy?

[WILK]
Again?

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
She was a very
beautiful woman, just like you.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
[WILK]
We met in Otaru.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
She taught me all the things
I needed to know and didn't.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
[WILK] Gave me the language
of the Hokkaido Ainu

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
and their beliefs.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
Now, listen closely
and never forget

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
what I'm about to tell you.

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:35.819 position:50% align:center
I once told your mother about
the origin of my name.

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
How I came by it and why.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
And after she had heard that,
she gave me a brand-new name,

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
but in Ainu.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
Horkew Oskoni.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
Horkew Oskoni?

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
[WILK] It means
"catching up to the wolf."

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
[WILK]
Because I wanted to be a wolf.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
The only ones who know this
name are myself, and of course,

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
your mother, who gave it to me.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
You must never
tell it to anyone.
