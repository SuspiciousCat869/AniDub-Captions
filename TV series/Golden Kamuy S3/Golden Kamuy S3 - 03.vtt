00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] I heard there
was a place around here

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
that'd buy sea lion meat.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
The foxes will eat anything.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.584 position:50% align:center
They can't get a balanced
diet with only fish...

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
...so we mix a bit of beef
and whale into their feed.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
Sea lion meat
would be a great help.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.760 position:50% align:center
[ASIRPA]
They're all black.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
So these are
mostly situnpekamuy.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.223 position:50% align:center
The ones you see there with
the black fur and white stripes

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
are called silver foxes.
Their pelts are very valuable.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.313 position:50% align:center
So you make a
lotta money, then.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.148 position:50% align:center
Well done!

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.484 position:50% align:center
There was s'posed to be
a Karafuto Ainu village

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.985 position:50% align:center
in this area.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.986 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.780 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this is the place.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:15.700 position:50% align:center
Some 20 or 30 years ago, there
was an Ainu village 'round here.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
But by the time we built the
farm, it was already abandoned.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.122 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
Hmm.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.833 position:50% align:center
Did you know somebody
who lived here?

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.212 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
As a matter of fact, I did.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
Your father was born
and raised in that village.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:37.639 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE] Wilk, his mother,
and her mother, too.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.810 position:50% align:center
So, then, where did they all go?

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.730 position:50% align:center
Russia and Japan.
It's as if they disappeared.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.817 position:50% align:center
Crushed between
the two warring nations.

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.279 position:50% align:center
[KIRORANKE]
In the past,

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:57.158 position:50% align:center
Karafuto was independent and
belonged to neither country.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.787 position:50% align:center
Then, about 30 years ago,
in exchange for Japan

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.915 position:50% align:center
gaining Chishima, the Japanese
signed a treaty giving

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:07.085 position:50% align:center
all of Karafuto over
to the Russians.

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:09.462 position:50% align:center
At that point, most of
the Japanese who lived here

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.631 position:50% align:center
left the area.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:14.092 position:50% align:center
The majority of the Ainu
in Wilk's village ended up

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:18.638 position:50% align:center
making their way over to
Hokkaido in the Japanese ships.

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:22.225 position:50% align:center
But... Since his mother
was a Karafuto Ainu

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
and his father was Polish,

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
Wilk wasn't allowed on the boat.

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
So he and his parents
stayed in Karafuto.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:35.071 position:50% align:center
Tragically, many of the Ainu who
went to Hokkaido were struck by

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:39.909 position:50% align:center
a terrible plague.
Almost half of them died.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50% align:center
After that, the surviving
Ainu left Japan

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.040 position:50% align:center
and returned to Karafuto.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
But I remember Wilk telling me
that, of those who came back,

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.129 position:50% align:center
not one returned to his village.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
Neither Russia nor Japan
gave a damn about them.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
And this was the result.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
The Hokkaido Ainu
will suffer the same fate.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
But I think there's still hope.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
And I believe that Wilk saw that
hope, and that light, in you.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.065 position:50% align:center
Oh? Then why did he
betray and kill Ainu?

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50% align:center
Why did he steal that gold
and try to entrust it to me?

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
Have some patience.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
You'll find any answers
you seek here in Karafuto.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
All you need to do is follow
in your father's footsteps.

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.708 position:50% align:center
Then you'll know.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
[OGATA] We've already confirmed
that Nopperabo is Wilk.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
So, look.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
Wilk left a code behind that
only his daughter could solve.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
And that means, the key to
the code is in Asirpa's head.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
Which makes her sort
of a key herself.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
Correct?

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
Think about that.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Even with all the tattooed
skins out there,

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
as long as we've got her, no one
else will have a real shot

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.621 position:50% align:center
at finding the gold.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
And think. If we
can find a way to learn

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
the key from her, ourselves...
Well, even better.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, she doesn't
seem to know just yet.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.843 position:50% align:center
Maybe she can't remember.
Who knows?

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
Or, it could be
that she's lying to us.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
It's not a good idea
to try and force it.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
If we hope to get good
information from her,

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
she'll have to trust us first.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
And if taking this trip to
Karafuto matures her at all...

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
...then it won't be an issue
any longer because she'll

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
give it to us of
her own free will.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI] I heard you haven't
been taking any meals at all.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.785 position:50% align:center
Nikaidou... That's not good.

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
[USAMI] Sir. I'm afraid
ever since you told him

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
that Sugimoto was dead...

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
...he's been an empty shell.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
He refuses to
get out of his bed.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
Hmm...

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
Come on out!

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
Look what I've got
for you, Nikaidou!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
If you eat a little something,
Lieutenant Tsurumi will give you

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
some morphine as a reward.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.474 position:50% align:center
--[KOUHEI] Hmm...?
--[USAMI] He showed his face!

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
Great! Come out and eat.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
Go on, pick up those chopsticks!

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.688 position:50% align:center
--[KOUHEI whimpers]
--I'm sorry, sir,

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
but Nikaidou lost
his right hand.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
Mm-hmm...

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
[KOUHEI whimpers]

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
Look! I brought you
a fork, Nikaidou.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
Eat up like a good boy
and then you can have

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
some yummy morphine.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
[KOUHEI whimpers softly]

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
He's looking at us, sir!

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
Oh, now he's coming out!

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
--[ARISAKA] Tsurumi!
--[KOUHEI squeals]

[sighs]

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.968 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
Lieutenant General Arisaka!

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
[ARISAKA] I've come by because
I've got a special present

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
for Nikaidou!

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
A brand-new hand!

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
Ooh! Come look at it, Nikaidou!

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
Ooh, this hand is marvelous!

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
Look, he's watching!

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
So, Lieutenant General.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
I could be wrong, but this is
no ordinary prosthetic, is it?

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50% align:center
'Course not!
It's got this neat trick!

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
[KOUHEI grunting]

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
[USAMI]
He's staring at us!

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
Just open the middle finger
at the joint, like so...

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
[KOUHEI]
Hmm...?

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
[ARISAKA] And there's a place
to put your chopsticks!

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
[KOUHEI grunts]

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center

[HAJIME speaking Russian]

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
Your Russian is good!
I'm very impressed.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
Now, what did you say?

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.069 position:50% align:center
I said that if you ever show
your face back in Japan,

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
I will blow your brains out.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
Don't come home
for a long while.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
Go off and study Russian
like your life depends on it.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
[GANSOKU]
Heh!

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
[KOITO] Was it right
to let him go without

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
talking to Lieutenant Tsurumi?

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
I've been given full authority.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
That authority extends
to you as well, Sugimoto.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
If you go berserk again,
you won't be so lucky.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.528 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I'll kill you next time.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
If you can't learn
to control yourself...

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.371 position:50% align:center
...then, someday
you'll live to regret it.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
You ever heard of igoneri?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
A traditional Niigata dish made
from a seaweed called igogusa.

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Egogusa.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
In Sado, it's "Igo," not "Ego."

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
I know it's different
on the mainland.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Igogusa.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
Her hair was wavy.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
So, the island
nicknamed her "igogusa."

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] But I liked her hair,
and I told her so.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
She was the only one who
would call me by my given name.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
Hajime.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
"Monster." "Thug." "Brat."

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
That's what the islanders saw,
so that's what they called me.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:42.063 position:50% align:center
The son of a murderer.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
My father was something
of an outcast.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
There were a lot
of rumors about him.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
Right after I joined the
Second Division in Shibata,

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
the war with China began.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] There's no place
for me on this island...

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
...but once the war ends,

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
I promise to come back for you.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.338 position:50% align:center
We'll elope and be together.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
Around the time the war ended,
without any notice at all,

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
the letters stopped coming.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
I had a terrible premonition.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
When I came home, the villagers
looked at me as if I was

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:23.063 position:50% align:center
some kind of ghost.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center
"We heard you died in the war,"
they said.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
Turns out, my premonition
was correct.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Around ten days
before I returned home,

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
she went missing.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
Her sandals were
found on the coast.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
I searched for her every day.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
Thinking that perhaps she
was somewhere on the rocks.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] Each time I saw
igogusa on the beach...

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
...I shivered.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
And in a moment of clarity...

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
...I wondered where the lie
that I was dead had come from.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Then I knew.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
It was my father.

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
Years of pent-up rage exploded.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I knew from
personal experience that he was

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50% align:center
the scum of the earth.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] But how far
would he actually go

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.127 position:50% align:center
just to ruin my life?

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
The next thing I knew,

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
my father was choking
in a pool of his own blood.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] The damage I had done
to his brain was fatal.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME] I killed him before
I could discover why he lied

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
about my death.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
That doesn't really
matter, though.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
I was sentenced to
death for patricide.

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
But who cares?

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
Because I managed to kill my
shithead father and avenge her.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
That's enough.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
Hmm.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
Well, as it turns out,
Egogusa didn't kill herself.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI] From what I could
gather, Mitsubishi purchased

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
the Sado mines outright,
earlier this year.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
One of their officers
came to the island, liked her,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
and asked her to marry his son.

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
But it seems the girl only
cared about her dear Hajime.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
Her parents saw it as
a choice between a thug

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
or a life of luxury.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.584 position:50% align:center
They were desperate,

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
so they got the whole island
to go in on the lie.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
They paid your father
handsomely, so he'd agree

00:11:56.383 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
to tell everyone that
you had been killed.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
Then, they faked their
own daughter's suicide

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
so the awful thug from her
past wouldn't try to come

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.559 position:50% align:center
get her back.

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
They bundled her off
to Tokyo in secret.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
She was told nothing about their
plot, only that she was to go.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
Soon after,
her parents followed her,

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
so there would never be
a reason for her to return

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
to the village.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
I got to speak with her folks.

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
She wasn't there, so they felt
free to tell me the whole story.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
But later on...

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
...she gave me this.

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
As I've been explaining,

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
she has no idea
that you're alive.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
But, when I informed her that
I was your commanding officer

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
in the army,
she asked me for a favor.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
She said if I knew
where you were buried,

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
I should bury it alongside you.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
Since you had always said
you loved her hair.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
Did I do right?

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
Should I have told her?

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
You did.

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
It's not like there's anything
I could do for her now.

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
Tsukishima.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
You actually speak Russian
quite well, isn't that right?

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
Uh. No, sir.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
I don't. Not even a little bit.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
Japan's just on the verge of
starting a war with Russia.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
But we have a dire lack
of Russian interpreters.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
At this grave moment in
our history, a man like you

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
who's fluent in Russian
would be in high demand.

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
The very nation is
in danger, after all.

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
I'm transferring to
the Seventh Division--

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
to the special organization
in Tsukisappu.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
I'm going to Russia as
an information officer.

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
You're a trusted
Russian interpreter

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
and former subordinate,
so you're coming with me.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center
Wait! I don't speak
a word of Russian!

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
I'm a death row prisoner!

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center

[WOUNDED SOLDIERS groaning]

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
[WOUNDED SOLDIER 27B] S'cuse me,
but are you Hajime Tsukishima?

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
I was born back in Sado.

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:31.579 position:50% align:center
Everybody from there in my
generation knows all about you.

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME]
Hmm.

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
[WOUNDED SOLDIER 27B] I heard
you were sentenced to death.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
What're you doing here?

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:39.254 position:50% align:center
Who can say?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
[WOUNDED SOLDIER 27B] You spent
several days looking for her

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
on the coast, right?

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME gasps]

arrested, they found her.

Did you know?

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
They found her?

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME groans]
I'm not sure, sir.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 27E]
There's a field hospital on

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.142 position:50% align:center
the other side of the river!

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 27F] Our combat
engineers shoulda made us sleds!

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 27G]
Where are they?

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 27F]
Over there!

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 27I]
There's one more!

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:31.820 position:50% align:center
Only one...
Put Lieutenant Tsurumi on!

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
[SUGIMOTO]
Use this one.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:36.783 position:50% align:center
[YOUHEI]
Huh? You're sure?

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
"Prioritize the lives
that can be saved."

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center
That's what he said.

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS] All right,
let's go! Come on, men!

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI] Didn't you ever
wonder why your father

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
would have killed Egogusa?

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
The story didn't seem
a little hard to swallow?

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI] It was effective,
though, in the end.

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
There wasn't quite
enough there to make your father

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
out to be an unforgivable
monster, so I dug up bones

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
from beneath your house
in front of the whole village.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
It was the best way that
I could think of to get you

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
out of prison without
the necessity of a trial.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
A monster of a father.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
An abusive man with
a known history of murder,

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
kills his son's fiancée
while he's off at war.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
He makes it look like a
suicide, but his enraged son,

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.894 position:50% align:center
out of his mind with grief,

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
beats him when
he learns the truth.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
Never intending to kill him.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
That's the story I managed
to make the brass believe.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
The villagers never forgot the
lies I told them nine years ago.

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
They circulated and
eventually became legend.

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI] And now, nine years
later, completely by chance...

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
...a man from Sado
repeated those lies to you

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
here in Mukden.

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
Your father may have destroyed
whatever honor he had,

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
but in the end, he was
of great use to you.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI] I never submitted
a report of her death.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
Her family register
remains untouched.

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
None of this will disturb
her new life in Tokyo.

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
[IGOGUSA]
Hajime...

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
Now, I see.

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI] The war will
be winding down soon.

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
And when it does, we'll begin
implementing our plan!

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
Y'mean... the Ainu?

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center
I can only use men
of firm resolve,

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
unafraid of what lies ahead!

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
Men with the kind
of resolve to do

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
the most revolting
things imaginable!

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
Because, make no mistake, we'll
be charging full speed ahead

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
into the lowest levels of Hell!

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
You're the only one
I can trust, Tsukishima!

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
Even after you thought
I had lied to you,

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
you didn't hesitate
to risk your life for me.

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
Regardless of anything else,
you've saved my life.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
I intend to use
the rest in your service.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center
I'll fight, for you,
and for those who died.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
Well. I hope you know, hearing
those words from you now

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:38.798 position:50% align:center
means everything.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:23.134 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI] I had it made
of porcelain enamel.

00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:28.098 position:50% align:center
[TSURUMI]
So... How's it look?

00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:07.322 position:50% align:center
