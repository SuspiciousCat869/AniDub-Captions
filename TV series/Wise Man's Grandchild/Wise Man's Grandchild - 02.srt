1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,833
[MARIA] That was a close call.
Thanks for helping!

2
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,958
Anyway, my name's Maria.
And this is...

3
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,583
Call me Sizilien.

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,000
Heh. Nice to meet you,
my name's Shin.

5
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,458
Dirty scumbags like those guys
are just one more reason

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,500
I need to learn
some attack spells.

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:29,166
[SHIN] Spells? Are you a
student at the Magic Academy?

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,541
I will be if I pass the
entrance exam next month.

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,333
Sizilien's taking it too.

10
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,541
Gotcha, maybe I'll
see you two there.

11
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:36,333
[MARIA]
Huh?

12
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,958
I'm taking it as well.

13
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,041
Wait. What? As good
as you are at fighting,

14
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,666
you're training
to be a magician?

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,833
Both of us assumed that you must
be studying to become a knight.

16
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,958
[SHIN] Nope, I'm on
the same path as you.

17
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,041
Let's all do our best.

18
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,375
Dunno about you, but I'm
plannin' to take the top score,

19
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,791
so don't be a sore loser.

20
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,708
Best of luck. I guess I'm just
gonna take things slow.

21
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,208
Yeah, you don't seem like
the competitive type.

22
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,250
[SIZILIEN gasps]
Oh, uh. Your hand.

23
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,708
[SHIN]
Am I being too familiar?

24
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,583
I guess... I should shake it.

25
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,166
You seem a little
stressed out, Sizilien.

26
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,583
Nuh-uh. I don't know
what you mean.

27
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,291
Ahem. Um, let's do our best.

28
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,666
Yeah. Sure.

29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,875
[MARIA] So what middle school
did you go to, Shin?

30
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,083
[SHIN] Nowhere you'd know.
I just moved to the capital.

31
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,041
Yeah? That reminds me!

32
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,791
Rumor has it that the Wise Man
Merlin and the Guru Melida

33
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,333
have come to stay
in the capital.

34
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,250
Oh yeah, I think I
might've heard something

35
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,666
about that as well.

36
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,833
What's with the tone,
don't you think they're cool?

37
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,333
Of course you do,
how could you not!

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,333
They're national heroes,
everyone loves them!

39
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,333
I get shivers when I
think of Merlin the Wise

40
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,708
using his great magic to
strike down the demonoid!

41
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,916
And Melida the Guru
is every girl's hero...

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,125
[SHIN] This is gonna
be the death of me.

43
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,625
Um. Are you all right, Shin?

44
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,458
[SHIN]
Yeah, I'm fine. Anyway, Maria.

45
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,625
You sure like Gran--

46
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,625
uh, the Wise Man and
the Guru, don't you?

47
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,166
Like is too weak a word!

48
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,041
I'm completely obsessed
with them actually.

49
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,875
Oh, and I hear their grandson's
taking the entrance exam, too!

50
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,208
[SHIN whimpers]

51
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,416
[MARIA sighs] I bet he's
as amazing as his grandpa!

52
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,791
And I'm so glad that
we're the same age!

53
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,541
[SHIN]
Well, I should get going.

54
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,916
[MARIA gasps]
You don't need to do that,

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,416
we can pay for ourselves.

56
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,666
[SHIN]
Nah, that's okay.

57
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,125
I'd be grateful if you
let me have this one.

58
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,625
[MARIA] I have to admit,
that guy's kinda cool.

59
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,875
[SIZILIEN]
Yeah.

60
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,708
He's good in a fight,
supposedly a magician,

61
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,666
and pretty unassuming to boot.

62
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,708
Yeah.

63
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,041
It's fine if I kiss him, right?

64
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,250
Yeah.

65
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,083
Oh good. Guess I'll take
him as my own, then.

66
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,625
Huh? Wait, no!
You can't do that!

67
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,458
[MARIA laughs]

68
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,125
[SIZILIEN gasps]
Maria!

69
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't think I've ever seen you
act like this before, Sizilien.

70
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,125
[SIZILIEN groans]

71
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,458
What is it about him?

72
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,666
Don't give me that damsel
in distress nonsense.

73
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,250
"He saved me, it was
love at first sight!"

74
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,125
I wouldn't quite call it love
at first sight, but, I guess...

75
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,208
...I feel nervous,
which I normally hate.

76
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,500
My heart's pounding,
but I don't mind right now.

77
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,375
Also, my body feels really warm.

78
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:01,125
[MARIA] Good grief.
It's even worse than I thought.

79
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,583
[SHIN] Are they all here to
take the exam? I hope I pass.

80
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,791
It might mean getting to see
that girl Sizilien again.

81
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,333
Sweet! I'm gonna give
this all I've got!

82
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,458
[KURT] You're in
my way. Step aside.

83
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,458
[SHIN] Which room do I
report to? Ah, there it is.

84
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,500
I told you to step aside, twerp!
Out of my way!

85
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,541
[SHIN grunts]

86
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,375
Wh-What do you
think you're doing?

87
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,041
Release me at once, or else!

88
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,250
You're kidding me, right?

89
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,166
First, you grab my shoulder
without warning.

90
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,125
And then, you ask what
I think I'm doing?

91
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,375
Insolent fool!

92
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,750
I'll have you know that
I'm Kurt von Reitsburg!

93
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,750
Huh. I just go by Shin.

94

[STUDENTS laugh]

95
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,583
My point is that I
am the son and heir

96
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,625
of Count Rietsburg himself!

97
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,250
Good for you, I guess?

98
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,666
If you think you can defy me and
get away with it, you're wrong!

99

[AUGUST]
That's quite enough.

100
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,958
Your noble status is of
no value at this academy.

101
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,333
Should you attempt to leverage
it here, you will be punished.

102
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,625
That's not a school rule,
it's a royal decree.

103
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,833
Right. I know,
but this commoner...

[SHIN]
Who's this guy?

105
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,333
If you knew of this law
and ignored it,

106
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,583
you've defied the
royal family itself.

and prepare for the test.

as unworldly as I'd heard.

August von Earlsheid,
to be more precise.

118

But all my friends
call me "Aug."

119
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,208
So your last name is Earlsheid?

120
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,416
Wait a sec! Ya mean
you're Uncle Dis's son?

"Uncle Dis's son," huh?

That's something I've
never been called before.

124
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,875
When people realize
that I'm the prince,

125
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,250
They usually start trying
to ingratiate themselves

126
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,500
in a hurry.

127
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,958
I don't care that you're
a prince, but if you're

128
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,666
Uncle's son, then in a way,
that makes us cousins.

[AUGUST laughs]

130
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,125
Know what? You're right,
let's call ourselves cousins.

I'm kinda confused,

00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,500
but I'm glad something
about that made you happy.

each other's backs in there.

Is it just me,

00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,541
or is Shin acting awfully
casual with Prince August?

137

I'm starting to wonder
who he really is.

Forget about Shin. It's Kurt
that I'm concerned with.

00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,375
as our parents, guardians,
and friends look on with pride.

313
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,875
I'd also like to
thank the teachers

314
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,250
and current students
of this academy...

315
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,833
[ALFRED]
You made it. Well done.

316
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:33,166
I'm the S-Class's homeroom
teacher, Alfred Marcus.

317
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,416
I used to be a magician with
the court magic division.

318
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,375
Which means I'll also be
your Practical Arts teacher.

319
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,208
As for today, I'll lay out
the upcoming schedule,

320
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,958
and we'll call it good.

321
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,083
Hey. Do you have a minute, Shin?

322
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,833
[SHIN]
Hm? Uh?

323
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,375
[SIZILIEN whimpers]

324
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,541
[SHIN] Wait, some dude's
hounding you, Sizilien?

325
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,416
You're kidding me!

326
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,416
Shut up! You're being too loud!

327
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,791
Sizilien kept trying to
let him down nicely,

328
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,458
but now he's taking advantage
of his family's influence

329
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,791
to threaten her.

330
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,208
The guy sounds disgusting.
So who is he, anyway?

331
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,500
[MARIA]
He's a student at this school.

332
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,041
Seriously?

333
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,416
Sorry to spring this on you.
Thanks a lot for hearing me out.

334
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,041
Well yeah. Of course. And don't
be sorry. I'm glad you told me.

335
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,541
--[SIZILIEN exhales]
--[footsteps]

336
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,375
[SHIN]
Huh?

337
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,916
[KURT]
Hey, Sizilien!

338
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,250
How dare you talk with
another man in public!

339
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,458
Turn around at once,

340
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,375
you will look at me when
I'm speaking to you!

341
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,250
Wait, Kurt?

342
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,333
He's the guy.

343
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,666
[KURT]
Get over here!

344
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,208
[gasps] What do you
think you're doing?

345
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,791
I'll ask you the same question.

346
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,750
Sizilien is my betrothed, fool!
Stay away!

347
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,666
[SIZILIEN gasps]

348
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,166
He's lying, right?

349
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,916
Um. Well, he, uh...

350
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You'll be okay.

351
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,791
Whatever happens,
I'll protect you.

352
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,375
[SIZILIEN]
Shin...

353
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,625
I have declined your proposal
multiple times now!

354
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,958
But you won't accept that!

355
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,791
You keep harassing me and
claiming we're engaged!

356
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,291
What? How dare you
talk to me like that?

357
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,166
If you don't like how I talk,
talk to someone else!

358
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,416
[growls, chuckles]
So it's gonna be like that.

359
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,083
If memory serves,
then your father's

360
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,041
a manager at the finance bureau.

361
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,958
Well, my father's the
undersecretary above him.

362
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,833
Maybe daddy and I
should have a word.

363
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,208
[KURT giggles]

364
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,458
[SHIN]
What a creep!

365
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,291
I've heard enough from you.

366
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,541
[KURT gasps]
Oh, Prince August!

367
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,375
[AUGUST] It seems you have
a terribly short memory.

368
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,708
[KURT]
Well, uh...

369
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,041
Frankly, That kind of threat
would be inexcusable

370
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,750
even if you weren't warned.

371
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,291
This is an affront
to the royal family.

372
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,041
Perhaps I should speak with
the finance bureau chief.

373
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,000
No... You wouldn't.

374
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,375
[AUGUST]
Walk away.

375
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,291
[KURT grunts]
All right, fine.

376
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,541
Thanks so much for helping,
Your Highness.

377
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,916
I was about to lose
my cool on that guy.

378
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,541
Yes. It sounded like things
were heading down an ugly path.

379
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,708
I would've cut in sooner,

380
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,416
but I just had to see
what you would do.

381
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,958
I'm glad you enjoyed the show.

382
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,375
"Whatever happens,
I will protect you."

383
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,791
[SHIN gasps]

384
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,666
Heroic is a good look for you.
Don't you think, Klode?

385
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,458
Oh, uh, if I had to answer,
then yes, he did look good.

386
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,791
Well there ya have it.

387
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,625
[SHIN] Damn. She is
still so friggin' cute!

388
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,125
[MARIA] So, do you think
Kurt'll leave her alone now?

389
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,291
[SHIN] Hm. Judging from
the look in his eyes,

390
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,125
I'd say you still
need to be careful.

391
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,041
[SIZILIEN exhales]

392
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,458
I know. You guys
wanna come over?

393
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,833
You mean to the home of
the Wise Man and the Guru?

394
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,291
I understand if
you're busy to--

395
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,041
[MARIA] No, no, no!
I'd love to come!

396
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,625
I have nothing going on tonight!

397
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,791
Just gimme some time to let my
parents know. Okay, Sizilien?

398
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,791
Yeah. Sure.

399
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,250
[SHIN, SIZILIEN chuckle]

400
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,541
I'll come as well. Think my
father's there right now.

401
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,916
[AUGUST grons]

402
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,625
It's nice to meet you.
We're his Highness' escorts.

403
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,875
[MERLIN]
You're running awfully late.

404
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,125
[MELIDA]
What have you been up to?

405
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,625
[SHIN] Sorry. There was
a bit of a situation.

406
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,333
Oh! Let me introduce
my new classmates.

407
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,833
As you might know, this is Aug,
Maria and Sizilien.

408
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,791
Those two are Thor and Julius.

409
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,791
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

410
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,666
Yup, I am very pleased to
meet you both! I'm Maria!

411
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,000
[SIZILIEN]
Um. Hello, I'm Sizilien.

412
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,416
--[MELIDA] Huh?
--[THOR] I'm Thor.

413
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,458
[JULIUS]
And my name's Julius.

414
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,333
[MERLIN]
Goodness. That's quite the tale.

415
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,083
[SHIN] So anyway, Granny.
For the sake of her safety,

416
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,625
I'd like to overwrite
the enchantment

417
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,875
on Sizilien's uniform.

418
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:16,708
[SIZILIEN gasps]

419
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,958
You wanna do what?

420
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,375
I'm confused.

421
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,916
Welcome to the club. You said
your name was Sizilien?

422
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,250
[SIZILIEN]
Uh, yes ma'am!

423
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,083
The enchantment Shin
wishes to give you

424
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,458
is exceptionally powerful.

425
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,791
It seems my grandson is quite
intent on keeping you safe.

426
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,125
Do you think yourself
worthy of his protection?

427
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,500
I hadn't really
considered that.

428
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,791
[SHIN] I think you're
making too much of this.

429
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,500
You be quiet.

430
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,625
Do you have any clue what's
become of your uniform, Shin?

431
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,666
Care to guess what
it's worth now?

432
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,250
I know that I improved it.

433
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,625
I would class it as national
treasure grade protective gear.

434
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,791
[ALL]
National treasure grade?!

435
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,291
[MELIDA] I can't even guess what
kind of price protective gear

436
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,708
of such enormous
power would fetch.

437
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,208
And Shin is offering to provide
you with your own free set.

438
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,916
So tell me, what makes you
worthy to receive such a gift?

439
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,083
I'm sorry. I'm kind of
nervous about responding.

440
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,875
But, I don't think I am worthy.

441
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,333
Huh?

442
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,041
I've taken advantage of
Shin's kindness. I see that now.

443
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,041
I told him about this because
I knew he'd try to help.

444
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,416
I preyed on his sympathy.

445
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
[ALL sigh]

446
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,833
[MELIDA]
Considering how strong he is,

447
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,500
I can understand why you'd
think to turn to him.

448
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,250
This doesn't involve Shin, but
he was still willing to help.

449
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,291
He said he would protect me.

450
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:33,541
I shouldn't have dragged him
into this, but it made me happy.

451
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,041
That's not fair! I was the
one who put you up to it--

452
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,083
I'm sorry for
the trouble, Shin!

453
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,666
I'll find a way to take
care of this myself.

454
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,125
I apologize to you
as well, Lady Melida.

455
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,875
--[MARIA] Sizilien!
--[MELIDA] Hold on.

456
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,250
Had you eagerly accepted the
gift without a second thought...

457
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,416
...mm, I think I would've
thrown you out of here.

458
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,000
[gasps]

459
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,166
[MELIDA] But you were honest.
With yourself, and with us.

460
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,541
Renouncing the chance to obtain
your very own national treasure.

461
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,125
That isn't something most
people could walk away from.

462
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:05,541
But, I tried to manipulate Shin!

463
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,458
[MELIDA] Oh honey.
You did more than try.

464
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,916
I think it's quite cute,
the way you turned to him.

465
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,250
And as for Shin's part, he
doesn't know what you've done.

466
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,583
Just look at him.

467
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,875
You've got the boy all
worked up on your behalf.

468
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,833
[SHIN gasps]
Yeah! I am worked up.

469
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,000
Sizilien, I don't feel like
you played me at all.

470
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,625
I offered to help you
of my own initiative.

471
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,416
[SHIN] So don't doubt
my intentions, okay?

472
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,583
You're welcome to use me
just as often as you want.

473
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,875
Do you mean that?

474
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,791
[MELIDA] I'm sorry for putting
you through that test,

475
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,166
but it was necessary.

476
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,583
I had to be completely sure
of your good intentions.

477
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:47,625
[SIZILIEN gasps, sobs]

478
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,250
[door clatters]

479
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,666
[MERLIN]
So, Shin.

480
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,833
[SHIN]
Yeah?

481
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,208
I just want it on
record that personally,

482
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,291
I had no idea the young
lady was trying to use you.

483
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,833
[SHIN]
Neither did I.

484
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,041
[MERLIN] But Melida saw right
through her. Good thing too.

485
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,583
If you'd gone ahead and
enchanted her uniform,

486
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,750
the poor girl's heart might've
been crushed by guilt.

487
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,208
I still don't feel
like my enchantments

488
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,458
are that big a deal.

489
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,416
They could change
the world, in my opinion.

490
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,708
But never mind that.

491
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,166
[SHIN]
Hm?

492
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,875
Seems like your grandma carries
the weight around here.

493
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,041
It's like I was
thin air just now.

494
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,291
Just try to stay strong, okay?

495
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:28,208
[MELIDA] I have to say. I really
am impressed by your honesty.

496
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,166
I don't think I was nearly
that honest at your age.

497
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,333
[SIZILIEN] When Shin stepped in
to save me, I was really happy.

498
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,625
But, even then, I felt guilty.

499
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,791
I don't wanna be
someone's burden.

500
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,125
[MELIDA] Shin doesn't have
a chance against this girl.

501
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,583
The letters are disappearing!

502
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,250
He's deleting them somehow?

503
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,125
It makes my head spin,
no matter how often I see it.

504
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,166
Yes, our Shin has
certainly grown, hasn't he?

505
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,583
[SHIN]
All done.

506
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,500
Is there anything
that you can't do?

507
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,041
This magic gear isn't
all that impressive.

508
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,166
First off, it needs at least
some magic input to activate.

509
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,916
Which means it can't protect
anyone against sneak attacks.

510
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,958
And the enchantment's
protection doesn't extend

511
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,750
past the uniform,
so your arms,

512
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,166
legs and head will
still be vulnerable.

513
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,666
[AUGUST]
Father. This is--

514
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,583
Yes, I'm well aware, son.
Forgive me, Shin, but listen.

515
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,333
This magic gear is outstanding.
No, it's far more than that.

516
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,000
If the world were to
find out about it,

517
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,375
there'd be hell to pay.

518
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,500
I ask that you tell no
one else about this.

519
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,791
[SHIN]
It matters that much?

520
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,083
If the military were to
find out it existed,

521
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,666
there could be those who
would wish to declare war.

522
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,666
You think this
could cause a war?

523
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,208
Yeah, I guess you're right.

524
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,500
It was reckless of me
to make these things.

525
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,958
[MERLIN gasps]

526
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,500
Wow! This is the first time
that Shin's had a regret!

527
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,916
That's true!

528
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,458
I just wanted you to
know what's at stake.

529
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,375
I was planning to perform
the same enchantments

530
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,791
on Aug's uniform.
But I should just stop.

531
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,708
I'm sorry, Aug.

532
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,083
[AUGUST]
Mm.

533
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,041
[DISEUM gasps] Well, hold on,
let's not be hasty.

534
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,250
A few more won't hurt, as long
as no one misuses them.

535
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,291
[SHIN]
I've enchanted everyone else's.

536
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,916
Are you sure you don't want one?

537
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,500
Yeah, the idea of wearing
a big mass of state secrets

538
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,833
kinda weirds me out.

539
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,833
[SIZILIEN] Thanks a lot, Shin.
When I wear this,

540
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,583
it almost feels as though
you're protecting me in person.

541
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,708
That thought makes me happy.

542
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,375
Y'know, that gives me an idea.

543
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,208
Starting tomorrow, how about I
take you home from school?

544
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,041
No. I wouldn't want to
trouble you more than I have.

545
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,833
[SHIN] It's all right.
We'll use a gate.

546
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,083
What's a gate?

547
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,416
[SHIN]
It's a little spell of mine.

548
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,291
[ALL gasp]

549
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,833
Step through and see.

550
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,541
[MARIA]
Where are we?

551
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,833
[SHIN] This is the house where
me and Grandpa used to live.

552
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,416
You're kidding.

553
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,458
I thought you told us that you
used to live deep in the forest.

554
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,083
Yeah, and that's where we are.

555
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,208
So we teleported?

556
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,541
I wouldn't exactly
call it teleportation.

557
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,041
I just bent space to
connect these two places.

558
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,458
I have no idea what
you're getting at.

559
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,583
[SHIN] I can only make gates
to places I've been before,

560
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,125
so we'd need to take a carriage
to your home at least once.

561
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,000
[SIZILIEN]
Oh. Okay.

562
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,333
All this craziness is starting
to give me a headache!

563
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,791
I'd heard you were
out of the loop,

564
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,625
but your nonchalance about
these things is boggling.

565
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,000
Maybe think before you
show us these spells.

566
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,250
Seems our top scorer flunks
when it comes to common sense.

567
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,416
Come on, is it really that bad?

568
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,791
[ALL]
Yes!

569
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,250
[SHIN]
Oh.

570
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,958
[SHIN chuckles]
I see.
