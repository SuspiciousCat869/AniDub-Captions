[SHIN] My name's Shin Wolford.
And I just learned to hunt.

00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,430
I live in this forest
along with my grandpa.

[SHIN pants]

[SHIN]
But I remember my last life.

36
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,022
I have memories of growing up
on a planet called Earth,

37
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,691
in a country called Japan.

38
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,320
I'm pretty sure I died there,
but I can't quite remember how.

39
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,449
[SHIN]
I'm home!

40
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,951
[MERLIN] Ah. So you are.
How was your hunt.

41
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,620
I'm eager to see the spoils.

42
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,164
[SHIN] This old man is
named Merlin Wolford.

43
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,667
Years ago, he found me in a
wrecked carriage in the woods

44
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,294
that had been
attacked by a demon.

45
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,630
I was just a baby,
and no one else survived,

46
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,631
so he took me in.

47
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,009
[MERLIN]
Ah! Three chickens and a boar.

48
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,929
[SHIN] Could'a got more but
you said not to overhunt.

49
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,555
[MERLIN]
Wind blade slashes.

50
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,557
That's an excellent
choice, my boy.

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,477
I feel like they're what's
best suited for hunting.

52
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,938
[SHIN] The biggest difference
between this world and Earth,

53
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,440
is that in this world,
magic's real.

54
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,318
My Grandpa's extremely
well‐versed in magic.

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,945
He's taught me a lot.

56
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,447
Good, now let's see how
your flames are coming.

57
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,282
Shin. Set that wood alight.

58
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,325
[SHIN]
Sure!

59
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,286
[SHIN] The magic in this world
works without any chanting,

60
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,289
you just have to visualize
what you want to create.

61
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,917
Whoa!

62
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,169
[SHIN] And honestly,
I'm pretty relieved about that.

63
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,338
From what I remember
of my past life,

64
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,133
chanting incantations and
calling out spell names

65
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,343
would have been a
little embarrassing.

66
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,888
[SHIN gasps] Granny Melida's
coming, and Michel's with her!

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,975
They're here for you.
My magic is a good start,

68
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,560
but you should study
swordsmanship

69
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,145
and magical gear, too.

70
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,479
Right!

71
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,400
[MELIDA]
You're hunting boar now?

72
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,403
Merlin! That's far
too dangerous, even for him!

73
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,946
[SHIN]
This is Melida Bowen.

74
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,239
She's a friend of Grandpa's,

75
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,575
and she comes to visit
us pretty often.

76
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,120
It's not really that dangerous.
Especially since I still have

77
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,664
the magic gear we made together.

78
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,541
There shouldn't be an
eight‐year old in this world

79
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,710
that can hunt down
a wild boar by itself.

80
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,419
But there is.

81
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,754
Oh, shut up!

82
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,882
Shin's exceptionally skilled
with magic, you know that.

83
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,510
Not to mention this forest has
practically been his backyard.

84
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,180
Sounds like your magic's gettin'
ahead of your combat skills.

85
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,056
That means it's time I
took off the kid gloves

86
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,224
for your training.

87
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,768
Uh, you don't have to do that!

88
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,021
[MERLIN, MELIDA, MICHEL laugh]

89
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,402
We're hunting a demon?

90
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,945
Well, I plan to do the fighting,

91
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,947
but now that you're ten I
think you should at least

92
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,282
see what they're like.

93
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,242
What are they like?

94
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,578
[MERLIN] Magic permeates
this whole world,

95
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,247
and all living creatures
can reap its benefits,

96
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,249
But some are unable
to keep the magic

97
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,793
they would use under control.

98
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,878
The powerful and
wildly violent being

99
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,088
this creates is
known as a demon.

100
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,382
Even a human being
can become one.

101
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,760
[SHIN] A person turned into
a demon a long time ago

102
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,095
and almost destroyed a
whole country, right?

103
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,264
Didn't you have to go
and save them, Grandpa?

104
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,391
So you're a big
hero there, even now.

105
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,896
[laughs] That was a
long time back, but yes.

106
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,190
Now let's start by
finding the demon.

107
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,150
How do we do that?

108
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,487
If you thinly spread your
magic power around yourself,

109
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,531
you can sense when
it comes into contact

110
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,324
with anything else's magic.

111
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,451
And since all living
creatures have magic,

112
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,537
you'll know what is
where right away.

113
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,249
This is known as search magic.
It's quite useful too.

114
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,959
Although, I should mention...

115
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,294
...t requires more finesse
than most of the spells

116
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,587
I've shown you.

Wow, I can feel the magic

120
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,890
in all the creatures
of the forest.

121
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,561
I can even sense Granny
Melida back in her house!

122
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,896
[MERLIN] Hm. I knew
he could work it out,

123
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,565
but on his first try?

124
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,192
[SHIN gasps]
That sinister feeling.

125
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,653
What's it coming from?

126
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,946
Ah. Must be the demon.

127
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,657
You're sensing the magic
power that corrupted it.

128
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,367
We need to destroy it right now!

129
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,161
Won't something bad happen
if we just let it roam around?

130
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,707
Yes, but this is dangerous,
so I want you to be careful.

That was a sight to behold.

I couldn't have
done better myself.

Exactly what kind of enchantment

did you put on your

Uh. Just the usual stuff.
You know...

155

[MICHEL] Shin took down
a demonized red grizzly?

156
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,198
Yes. He moved so fast
that I couldn't even help.

157
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,576
Shin's a prodigy. I've never
seen someone learn so fast.

158
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,329
He's already better with
magic than most adults.

He's keeping up with

160
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,167
And he's memorized
countless enchantments

161
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,711
in the original tongue.
It's not inconceivable

162
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,255
that the boy really did
come from another world.

163
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,716
Shin's origins couldn't
mean less to me.

164
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,844
All that matters is that when he
looks up and calls me "Grandpa,"

165
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,888
I can't help but adore him.

166
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,391
Blood or no, he is
still my grandson.

167
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,102
I can't believe I'm hearing
this from the man once known as

168
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,436
the Lord of Destruction.

169
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,063
[MERLIN]
Why must you dredge up the past?

170
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,065
Is my embarrassment
that amusing?

171
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,817
Let's just say the
title of wise man

172
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,485
seems to suit you better.

173
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,613
[MELIDA] I adore that boy every
bit as much as you do, Merlin.

174
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,657
I'm not able to visit
as much as I'd like,

175
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,618
but I think of him as if
he were my grandson too.

176
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,412
[MERLIN gasps]

177
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,706
[swords clanging]

178
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,916
[MICHEL]
That's enough for today.

179
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,751
How's your training
coming along?

180
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,005
[SHIN] Michel's been going
really hard on me lately.

181
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,882
[MERLIN] Yet it looks to me
like you're keeping up with him.

182
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,092
Anyway, Shin.

183
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:29,843
[SHIN]
Huh?

184
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,554
I have something
I need to tell you.

185
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,768
Wait a sec, you're saying
I'm not really your Grandson?

186
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,729
[MERLIN]
Hm. My apologies, Shin.

187
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,398
I should've told
you much sooner.

188
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,484
[SHIN] Thing is,
I already know that.

189
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,906
This must've been
the work of a demon.

190
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,243
There's no saving them, but I
can give them a decent burial.

191
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,286
‐‐[SHIN cries]
‐‐[MERLIN gasps]

192
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,830
What is that, a crying infant?

193
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,002
[MERLIN]
How'd you survive?

194
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:16,056
[MERLIN gasps] Could this
be providence at work?

195
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,851
Your temperature had
dropped from the rain,

196
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,644
maybe that's why the
demon missed you.

197
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,898
But frankly, I wonder
if it wasn't the same‐‐

198
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,899
No.

199
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,276
[SHIN] Could it have
been that red grizzly?

200
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,611
Shin.

201
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,030
I was just thinking
it's possible, ya know?

202
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,490
If it was...

203
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,033
...well, it's nice
to think that maybe

204
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,993
I got to avenge my parents.

205
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,162
There's a chance
you did just that.

206
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,290
So uh, do you have any
idea who my parents were?

207
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,042
Their possessions
were nondescript,

208
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,001
and their bodies were both

209
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,504
ravaged beyond
recognition, so no.

210
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,755
Oh well.

211
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,174
[MERLIN] You're taking
this news rather well.

212
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,635
[SHIN] Hm. Well, I know
they were my parents,

213
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,969
but I don't remember them.

214
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,847
Also, I've always had
a great Grandpa.

215
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,641
[MERLIN]
Oh, uh...!

216
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,558
[SHIN]
And on top of that,

217
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,228
I've got Granny Melida,
and Michel too.

218
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,688
I've just never felt like
I was missing anything.

219
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,981
[MERLIN]
Shin...

220
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,358
[SHIN]
Listen, Grandpa.

221
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,693
I wanna tell you
how grateful I am.

222
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,613
Thanks for taking me in.
I'm really glad you did.

223
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,324
Oh, Shin, I...

224
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,743
Come on, stop crying Grandpa,
it's embarrassing!

225
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,663
I'm... just so happy!

226
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,332
[SHIN] But really though.
Thanks, Grandpa.

227
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,427
[DISEUM] Ahem.
Shin, the grandson of our hero,

228
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,596
Master Merlin,
has just turned 15,

229
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,684
and is to be regarded as a
man from this day forward.

230
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,227
[SHIN]
Hm.

231
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,354
A toast to the
young man's 15 years,

232
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,149
and to the many years
ahead of him. To Shin!

233
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,817
[ALL]
To Shin!

234
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,988
It's hard to accept that
the little baby I once knew

235
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,281
has grown into a man.

236
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,616
It happened much faster
than we thought.

237
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,619
I was meaning to ask. Where do
you plan to go from here?

238
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,871
I dunno.

239
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,581
You're free to pursue
your dreams now.

240
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,000
The first step is deciding
what you wish to do.

241
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,418
Well. For one thing,

242
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,628
I've never actually gone
beyond the forest.

243
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,464
So to start off, I might
go visit a nearby town.

244
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,091
[DISEUM]
I see. And then what?

245
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,217
Should there be more?

246
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,844
What do you wanna become?

247
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,430
Since you learned how to fight
from Sir Michel himself,

248
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,724
I'd imagine you could
join the royal order.

249
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,143
You could also do well
as a demon hunter.

250
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:25,935
[MICHEL]
Mm‐hmm.

251
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,479
[SHIN] I didn't know demon
hunting was a profession.

252
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,981
Yes, there's actually
a group called

253
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,399
the Demon Hunter's Society.

254
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,443
They have a system through
which hunters get rewards

255
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,777
for their victories.

256
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,322
[SIEGFRIED] Wow. You haven't
even heard about them?

257
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,074
No. I haven't thought
about jobs much.

258
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,201
You could also do pretty well

259
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,328
enchanting and
selling magic gear.

260
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,663
Or if the working life isn't
your style, you could always

261
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,082
use those looks to get a
girlfriend to support you.

262
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,876
Luckily he isn't sick
enough in the head

263
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,419
to think in those terms.

264
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,171
‐‐Say what?
‐‐Did I stutter?

265
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,464
Oh. Yeah.

266
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,091
Now that I'm an adult, I guess I
need to start making money,

267
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,135
not to mention, I need
to learn how to use it.

268
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,386
Hold on a moment.

269
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,264
You mean, you've never
gone shopping before?

270
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,515
Nope, can't say I have.

271
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,975
[ALL gasp]

272
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,478
You're kidding. Merlin!

273
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,689
I may have forgotten to teach
him some common practices.

274
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,524
[ALL]
What?

275
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,276
Come to think of it, I don't
really know much of

276
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,779
anything aside from how
to fight and use magic.

277
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,406
Eh. I'm sure it'll all work out.

278
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,083
[DISEUM gasps]
Amazing.

279
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,918
How'd we come so far
in the blink of an eye?

280
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,211
[SIEGFRIED]
Did we teleport?

281
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,255
[MERLIN] Yes, Shin made
the spell himself.

282
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,965
A spell like that
could transform

283
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,925
the world's supply chains,
communication,

284
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,760
even the way people think.

285
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,054
As if it wasn't amazing
enough that he mastered

286
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,973
all the magic Merlin
and I taught him.

287
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,391
I'm enjoying the walk and all,

288
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,601
but is there some reason
you brought us out here?

289
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,229
Yes, to ensure our safety,
I thought it best that we

290
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,981
do this in a place
without much around.

291
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,691
Safety?

292
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,944
[MERLIN laughs]
I've already seen this myself.

293
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,280
I'd advise all of you
to brace yourselves.

294
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,156
[ALL]
Huh?

295
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,367
[MERLIN] Shin. Show them
an attack spell.

296
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,411
Treat this like it's
one of your tests.

297
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,372
Yeah, sure.
How about a fire spell?

298
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,164
[ALL]
Huh?

299
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,834
[MERLIN chuckles]

300
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,795
[SHIN] First, visualize the
flames, then create a spark.

301
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,548
As long as there's oxygen,
this creates a small flame.

302
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,676
I've never seen such a pale
blue flame in my whole life!

303
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,012
[SHIN] Isolate more
oxygen and hydrogen.

304
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,889
Encase the mixture, sealing it
from surrounding air,

305
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,475
and ignite it from the
flashpoint on impact!

306
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,607
[ALL shout]

307
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,037
That's all I got right now.

308
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,788
[ALL gasp]

309
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,165
[SHIN]
Are... you guys okay?

310
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,669
[MELIDA]
What's wrong with you, Merlin?

311
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,463
You taught the boy
all manner of magic

312
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,630
but not an ounce of prudence!

313
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,049
[MERLIN] If he didn't
have any prudence,

314
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,343
he'd be making explosions
like that at the house!

315
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,553
I just wanted to see what
my grandson could do.

316
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,596
Is that so wrong?

317
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,640
Why don't you ask the crater
he left in the country‐side?!

318
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,100
[SHIN]
Please calm down, Granny.

319
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,311
It's not good for your heart
to get this worked up.

320
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,856
And whose fault is it
that I'm this worked up?!

321
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,859
[DISEUM] Between that fire spell
and his teleportation magic,

322
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,653
I'm concerned about setting
Shin loose on the world.

323
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,490
And don't forget that Michel
trained him in close combat.

324
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,075
Neighboring lands
would do anything

325
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,451
to get him on their side.

326
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,204
[MICHEL] Hm. This is
bound to spark conflict.

327
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,247
[SHIN]
So it's bad that I'm strong?

328
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,167
Master Merlin. Your grandson's
abilities could be enough

329
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,337
to upset the balance of
power in the whole region.

330
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,171
And on top of that,

331
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,632
he's utterly ignorant as
to how this world works.

332
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,509
[DISEUM] If we send him
into the world as is,

333
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,678
it'll spell disaster. Imagine if
an expansionist nation

334
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,722
like the empire learned of him.

335
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,516
Yes, I see your point.

336
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,518
[DISEUM]
But there is an alternative.

337
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,395
Enroll Shin in
the magic academy,

338
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,939
as a starting point to
learn of the world.

339
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,731
Huh?

340
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,401
It almost sounds as if you
wish to use Shin's power

341
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,612
for your own
country's purposes.

342
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,032
[DISEUM] I would never exploit
Shin for military use.

343
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,992
I've always thought
of him as my nephew.

344
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,787
I've no wish to involve him
in our nation's disputes.

345
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,789
Hold on, what's the
magic academy?

346
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,041
It's a school of magic
in the royal capital.

347
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,419
Those students who prove to
be exceptional at magic

348
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,922
in middle school, are invited
to continue their studies there.

349
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,092
If you were to attend yourself,
you would discover just how far

350
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,885
off the scale you are.

351
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,304
[SHIN]
Wait. Am I really off the scale?

352
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,014
[DISEUM] Not to mention,
you haven't had the chance

353
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,600
to be around people
your own age before.

354
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,728
This could be a good opportunity
for you to make some friends.

355
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,982
That is persuasive, but what
are your thoughts, Shin?

356
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,943
Sounds good. I think I might
enjoy going to school.

357
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,028
Then I'll make arrangements
back at the academy.

358
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,531
Your classes are determined
based on how you perform

359
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,324
at the entrance exams,
naturally.

360
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,577
My nation's magic academy
is under absolutely

361
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,370
no influence
from the nobility,

362
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,165
and it operates on an
extremely strict merit system,

363
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,208
so I can't show
you any favoritism.

364
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,251
Not that you would need it.

365
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,919
I'm kind of confused here.

366
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,255
What do you mean when
you say "my nation?"

367
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,217
[DISEUM] Oh. I guess I never
mentioned that, did I?

368
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,510
I'll start with my name.

369
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,971
In full, it's Diseum
von Earlsheid.

370
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,475
And I'm the monarch of
the Kingdom of Earlsheid.

371
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,810
[SHIN]
My Uncle Dis is a king?

372
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,147
So then what about my big
sis Chris and big bro Sieg?

373
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,774
I'm a member of the
Order of the Royal Guard.

374
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,402
And I'm here now as
His Majesty's escort.

375
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,489
And I'm a veteran magician with
the Court Magic Division.

376
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,948
Also here as an escort.

377
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,827
Huh? Big sis Chris I can
understand, but big bro Sieg?

378
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:35,953
There's no way!

379
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,747
[SIEGFRIED]
What does that mean?

380
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,166
Guess we can add a keen eye
to Shin's list of traits.

381
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,667
Just keep on
runnin' your mouth.

382
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,544
Don't worry,
I fully intend to!

383
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,754
[SHIN]
What about you, Michel?

384
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,089
Huh? Oh, I'm retired actually.

385
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,592
But I used to be Knight
Commander of the Order.

386
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,219
[SHIN]
Why didn't anybody tell me this

387
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,137
when I met them the first time?

388
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,389
You really haven't told him
a thing about this world,

389
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,390
have you?

390
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,975
My mistake.

391
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,102
I still don't get why a
king would be a houseguest

392
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,521
of my Grandpa's.

393
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,857
I'm sure you've heard the tale.
Of Master Merlin's fight?

394
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,026
When he defeated
the demonoid man.

395
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,487
Yeah, Grandpa told
me about it himself.

396
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,614
It was Earlsheid
the fiend attacked.

397
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,200
This was the first demonoid
that we'd ever seen.

398
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,577
And everywhere it went,
it left death.

399
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,580
Two subjugation
squads had fallen.

400
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,876
What's more, a whole city
had been wiped off the map.

401
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,002
In the midst of the crisis,

402
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,004
the nation had to
draft its students.

403
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,923
And I, then the Crown Prince,

404
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,716
and a student of
the magic academy,

405
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,052
ignored all objections
and volunteered to join

406
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,097
a subjugation squad. But then...

407
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,848
[CHIEF A]
Your Highness! Run!

408
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,144
[DISEUM gasps]

409
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,648
[DISEUM] Just as the demonoid
was about to take my life...

410
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,608
[DISEUM yells]

411
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,278
[gasps]

412
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,364
I'd step back, kid,
it's rather dangerous here.

413
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,574
[DISEUM]
...I was saved.

414
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,619
By Merlin and Melida,
in the nick of time.

415
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,162
Melida fought beautifully:

416
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,665
graceful and bewitching
with her magical gear.

417
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,375
And Merlin was a
force of nature,

418
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,045
ferocious and unrelenting.
What a sight they were.

419
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,299
I can't express how great
my admiration for them was.

420
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,134
[SHIN]
Bewitching and ferocious?

421
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,885
We were full of
youthful excess.

422
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,888
I can still do a little
bewitching when I feel like it.

423
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,724
[DISEUM] After these two
put down the demonoid,

424
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,350
they were named
heroes for delivering

425
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,019
our nation from crisis.

426
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,021
And since that day,
we've shared a friendship

427
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,897
that went beyond
our stations.

428
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,443
Mostly I like coming here so
I can belly‐ache about work.

429
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,695
[SHIN]
I see. Wait, belly‐ache?!

430
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,323
[DISEUM laughs]
You've learned that I'm a king,

431
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,283
yet you aren't treating
me any differently.

432
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,660
Thing is, proper royal
etiquette is another thing

433
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,287
Grandpa forgot
to teach me.

434
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,164
Not to worry! You're one
of the only people

435
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,999
I can have a conversation
this relaxed with,

436
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,001
so make sure you
never change, Shin!

437
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,419
Yeah, well anyway.

438
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,546
The real surprise here is
that Grandpa and Granny

439
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,423
formed a party once.

440
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,468
Those two did a lot more
than form a party.

441
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,303
They used to be
husband and wife.

442
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:02,558
[SHIN]
Huh? Huh? Huh?! For real?!

443
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,648
[SHIN]
We're almost to the capital.

444
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,608
[MERLIN, MELIDA grunt]

445
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,776
[SHIN]
So hey, Grandpa.

446
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,278
What's your house at the
capital like, is it big?

447
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,696
[MERLIN]
I don't quite remember.

448
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,615
It was bestowed upon
me by the country,

449
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,367
so I think it was large.

450
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,452
[SHIN] At least we've got
other‐dimensional storage space

451
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,787
for the move‐in, right?

452
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,247
And listen, Granny, I know
you weren't all that keen on

453
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,207
coming to live with us,

454
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,000
but I'm really glad you
decided to do it anyway.

455
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,169
I had no choice, I mean
it's not like I could

456
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,005
leave everything up to
this doddering old man.

457
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,218
[gasps] Look! The capital walls!

458
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,930
[MALE GUARD A]
Do you have identification?

459
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,348
[MERLIN]
Certainly, will this do?

460
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,016
[MELIDA]
Right here.

461
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,311
[yelps] Merlin the Wise man
and Melida the Guru?

462
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,729
I can't believe it!

463
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,106
Wait, the wise man's here?

464
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,357
And the Guru?

465
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,316
No way!

466
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,776
Where are they,
let's find them!

467
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,696
[MERLIN] Pardon, but could I ask
that you finish this up quickly?

468
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,364
[MALE GUARD A]
Y‐Yes sir. I'm terribly sorry!

469
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,491
Um, who might the
young master, be?

470
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,867
Master?

471
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,163
You may call him Shin Wolford.
He's my and Melida's grandson.

472
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:06,997
[MALE GUARD A]
Master Shin!

473
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,291
[TOWN]
Master Shin!

474
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,628
It's huge.

[STAFF]
We bid you all welcome home.

477
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,136
Masters Merlin and Shin,
Mistress Melida.

478
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,637
Uh, hi there.

479
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,848
My name is Steve.
I'm your head butler.

480
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,600
My name is Marika.
I'll be your head maid.

481
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,936
And I'm Koller,
your head chef.

482
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,146
[STEVE]
If you require something,

483
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,189
you need but ask and
we'll make it yours.

484
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,608
What gives with the
sudden VIP treatment?

485
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,527
I would imagine Diseum
sent them here

486
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,862
once he knew we were coming.

487
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,990
I'm starting to remember
why we don't like to visit.

488
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:41,782
[SHIN]
Huh?

489
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,617
Melida and I can
handle things here,

490
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,536
why don't you go
explore the town a bit?

491
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,079
Okay, will do.

492
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,374
[SHIN]
Um, is this enough?

493
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,044
[SHIN] That was my first
time buying something.

494
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,098
I might be lost.

495
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,183
[SIZILIEN]
Please let us go!

496
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,517
[SHIN gasps]

497
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,353
[MARIA] Seriously, get away
from us, you creeps!

498
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,981
Ooh, scary. Stop with
the harsh words.

499
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,109
The boys and I just wanna
have a little fun with ya.

500
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,528
[MALE HUNTER B] This could be
fun for you too if you let it.

501
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,572
Hell, it might even feel good.

502
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,325
[SHIN]
These guys are walking clichés.

503
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,328
[SHIN] Uh, excuse me.
Are these guys bothering you?

504
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,164
They are! We're extremely
frickin' bothered!

505
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,166
Are you tryin' to
start something' kid?

506
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,251
I bet he thinks he's
some kinda hero.

507
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,837
We risk our lives every day
to protect these ladies

508
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,757
by hunting demons,
so we're the real heroes.

509
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,258
So you guys hunt demons.

510
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,638
While I have to admit, that does
sound like a noble line of work,

511
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,931
If you hunt girls too,

512
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,724
then you're just a
bunch of scum‐bags.

513
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,810
What did you just
call us, punk?!

514

So slow.

[MARIA, SIZILIEN gasp]

518
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,616
You all right? Hope they
didn't hurt you.

519
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,494
We're fine, but what about you?
That guy pulled a dagger!

520
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,288
Yeah, but luckily for me,
he didn't know how to use it.

521
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,541
[SIZILIEN] Um. Thank you
so much for helping us.

I'm really grateful.

Are you sure you're okay?

00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,677
How? How are you so cute?
