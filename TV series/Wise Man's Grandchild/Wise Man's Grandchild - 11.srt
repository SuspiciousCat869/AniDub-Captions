1
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:16,416
We promise, we're gonna
take care of those demonoids!

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,291
We're the Ultimate Magicians!

00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,333
[CROWD cheers]

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,500
[ALL]
What? The Ultimate Magicians?

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,250
[AUGUST giggles]

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,625
[SHIN] Let me guess,
you guys hate it.

7
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,750
I like that name, actually.

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,333
Well, I say we go
out with a bang.

9
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,625
We need to make sure
they have plenty of hope.

10
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,041
[SHIN]
Yeah. You're right.

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,666
And I know just what to do.
Here goes nothing!

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,833
[CROWD gasps]

13
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,958
[SHIN]
Ultimate Magicians, move out!

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,291
[ALL]
Right!

15
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,791
[SOLDIER A] Look, it's a red
signal flare from the border!

16
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,291
[SOLDIER B] So there's
a demonoid attack!

17
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,500
[COMMANDER A]
Send word to the castle!

18
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,375
Evacuate all the civilians!

19
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,375
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

20
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,375
[SOLDIER A] I see them! It's a
massive group of demonoids!

21
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:48,083
I'd say... roughly a
hundred of them!

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,791
[COMMANDER A] Did you
say a hundred demonoids?

23
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,250
Oh, no. All hands
to stations, now!

24
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,083
Deploy the defensive magic gear!

25
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,625
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

26
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,125
[COMMANDER A] Send Earlsheid
a request for aid, immediately!

27
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,583
[SOLDIER C]
Right!

28
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,333
[COMMANDER A] There's no
telling how many days it'll take

29
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:08,166
for them to receive word and
for reinforcements to arrive.

30
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,666
[COMMANDER A]
All units, quick!

31
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,708
Defend these walls
with your lives!

32
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,958
Don't let any harm
come to the civilians!

33
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,458
[chuckles]

34
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,083
Let's hurry up and break
through that wall of theirs!

35
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,041
[COMMANDER A]
Activate the magic gear!

36
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,541
[FABRO shouts]

37
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,583
[FABRO] Heh. They think a magic
barrier can keep us out?

38
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,458
Nice try.

39
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,625
I gotta say, I'm not too
proud of calling us the

40
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,958
"Ultimate Magicians."

41
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,833
How come? I think it suits
a tough group like us.

42
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,166
It was your fault for
putting me on the spot!

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,416
And you're a member
of this team,

44
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,833
so you're only making
fun of yourself here!

45
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,708
What's so bad about it?
I think it's a good name.

46
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,125
Well, I'm pretty sure
everyone in the entire kingdom's

47
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,791
heard it by now, so I guess
we're just stuck with it.

48
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,625
[THOR] Hey Shin,
the border's just ahead!

49
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,458
[SHIN]
Huh? That was fast.

50
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,291
It would have taken us days
to get here in a carriage!

51
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,625
It's a good thing we
traveled so quickly.

52
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,916
Shin's defensive magic gear is
good, but not indestructible.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,666
I made so many of those, and you
decided to lend them to Sweed

54
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,583
without even giving
me a heads-up?

55
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,875
Wow, this is real.
We're gonna fight demonoids.

56
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,166
Makes me nervous.

57
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,625
You'll be fine, Maria.

58
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,708
You're stronger than
the demonoids now.

59
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,958
It'll all work out.

60
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, that's easy for
you to say, Mr. Perfect!

61
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,291
[SHIN] Sizilien, I'd rather
you take care of anyone

62
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,166
who gets hurt.

63
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,666
I can do that!

64
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,958
Now, everyone else,
pair up and attack!

65
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,250
[ALL]
Roger!

66
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,833
Mark, sweetie.

67
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,541
I'll back you up, so please
don't throw any surprises at me.

68
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,875
Okay. I'll count on you.

69
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,416
If the rest of this
squad doesn't learn

70
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,250
to get a freakin' room,
I'm gonna scream!

71
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,583
It's the boys' fault.

72
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,750
They're all so busy living
the lovey-dovey life.

73
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,583
You've got a point.

74
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,333
Are Thor and Julius
the only guys here

75
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,708
who aren't seeing someone?

76
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,833
Actually, I have a fiancée.

77
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,208
Yeah, I don't think I mentioned
it, but I'm engaged too.

78
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,416
Seriously? Just you wait,
you stupid demonoids!

79
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,458
I'll take all my anger and
jealousy out on you!

80
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,458
Well, at least she's got
her mind off of how nervous

81
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,708
she was, I guess.

82
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,708
We should probably
stop joking around now.

83
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,750

is in sight.

Do you even understand
what you've just done?

I could ask you
the same question.

Ha! You look like you
can handle yourself, kid,

101

but you're out of your mind if
you believe that a mere human

102

could ever stand a
chance of surviving a fight

103

against a demonoid like me!

to be beaten by a human,

We were sent here from your
neighboring kingdom.

I'm Prince August von Earlsheid!

We have acquired the necessary
power to save your nation

and drive out the demonoids!

127

Please rest assured that we will
work closely with your royal

threat once and for all!

As for you demonoids,

on our side,

have come to help us?

Right. I'll save as

Yeah. You too.

You're here, Shin Wolford.

159
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,541
In that case, I've got a real
fun game for us to play togeth--

160
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,000
[ALICE]
Watch where you're aiming!

161
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,291
This isn't the time
to get heated.

162
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,583
You fight sloppy when
you get too emotional.

163
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,958
This is serious!

164
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:31,750
Oh. Yeah, you're right.
I guess I lost my cool.

165
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,416
'Kay. I'll try to be more calm!

166
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,666
He's dead now.

167
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,000
[ALICE gasps]

168
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,041
[LYN] I mixed sand into
some high-pressure water.

169
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,750
I know he was a demonoid,
but that's hardcore!

170
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,708
I'm okay with that though.

171
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,750
He might've been human once, but
that part of him was long-gone.

172
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,750
I hear what you're saying,
and I understand, but...

173
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,625
Let me put it this way.

174
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,625
See, they're completely
aware of what they're doing.

175
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,708
And killing for the fun of it
makes them even nastier.

176
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,750
Because of them,
countless people could die.

177
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,500
Alice, get your
head on straight.

178
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,916
[ALICE]
Mm!

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,958
--[SOLDIER D yells]
--[LYN, ALICE gasp]

180
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,000
There ya go. How's that feel?

181
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,291
[SOLDIER D] I won't.
I won't let you--

182
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,916
[DEMONOID C] You won't let me
do what? Well, spit it out!

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,833
[SOLDIER D grunts]

184
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,208
[DEMONOID C laughs]
With this much power,

185
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,958
I've got nothing to fear!

186
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,500
If you won't get
up and fight me,

187
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,041
then I'll just bring
the fight to you!

188
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,958
[gasps]

189
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,250
You monster! You're gonna
pay for that one!

190
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,708
Two little girls? What the hell?

191
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,791
Why do all of you call me that?
I'm not just some kid!

192
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,625
How is she so powerful?

193
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,625
[screams]

194
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:06,250
[pants]

195
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,166
Wow, you really
snapped big-time.

196
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,750
[ALICE]
Hang in there!

197
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,916
Our friend at the aid station is
gonna fix you right up, okay?

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,666
[SOLDIER D] I feel weak for
having to be saved like this,

199
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,500
but I'm grateful.
I owe you my life.

200
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,375
That said, I think I can
get there on my own.

201
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,666
Thank you ladies
for all your help.

202
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,541
He seems like he's embarrassed.

203
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,416
At least we helped him.

204
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,041
Anyway, we have lots
more enemies to beat.

205
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,500
Heck yeah, we do!

206
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,416
Let's go kick some demonoid
butt and save the kingdom!

207
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,083
We'll see who can take out
the most. I'll race you!

208
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,500
[gasps]
No fair! Wait for me!

209
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,916
[SOLDIER E screams]

210
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:55,083
[FABRO chuckles]
Ah, what do we have here?

211
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,791
Those are some nifty little
magic items you've brought me.

212
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,500
[THOR grunts]

213
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,583
[DEMONOID D shouts]

214
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,500
[THOR gasps]

215
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,125
[JULIUS]
That's not gonna happen!

216
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,625
[DEMONOID D growls]

217
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,208
[DEMONOID E]
Ha! You're outta here!

218
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,166
[THOR shouts]

219
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,500
[groans]

220
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,416
I'm sure you won't tell
me anything helpful,

221
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,541
but here we go.

222
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,750
Are you acting on
orders from Schtrom?

223
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,708
[DEMONOID E] Forget it, boy.
I'm not interested in chit-chat!

224
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,625
Don't tell me this is the best
you weak demonoids can do!

225
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,916
[DEMONOID D growls]
You bastard!

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,791
[DEMONOID E groans]

227
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,708
[DEMONOID E chuckles]
I may be a demonoid,

228
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,041
but that doesn't mean
that I can't be killed.

229
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,458
And I was so sure that a hundred
of us would be more than enough

230
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,916
to take control of the country.

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,250
I could be wrong,

232
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,125
but aren't you former
commoners from the empire?

233
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,666
If so, how could you do
something so horrible?

234
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,416
[DEMONOID E]
Stupid question.

235
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
We're capable of all of this
because we're demonoids.

236
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,125
[THOR]
That's not what I asked you!

237
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,791
[DEMONOID E] Enduring
oppression from the nobility,

238
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,958
and having everything
we owned systematically

239
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,708
taken from us, all that
was left was our hate.

240
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,958
Burning, raging hate!

241
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:21,416
And after we turned into
demonoids, that hate erupted!

242
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,125
We're disgusted by those who
live in peace and comfort

243
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,291
within the walls of this empire!

244
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,875
[JULIUS shouts]
Be that as it may.

245
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,875
It still doesn't give you
the right to murder

246
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,625
innocent civilians!

247
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,166
We're not going to let
you hurt anyone else!

248
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,166
[chuckles]
Go ahead and stop me.

249
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,041
[SOLDIERS gasp]

250
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,708
[DEMONOID F]
Aw, too bad for you, fellas!

251
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,333
Looks like there's
nowhere left to hide!

252
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,375
These are the brave
protectors of the kingdom?

253
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:53,250
Huh? Wait a minute,
what's happening?

254
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,166
[DEMONOID F gasps]
Why you little!

255
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, goodness. I guess
I've been found out.

256
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,833
You're the one who did that?!

257
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,000
[shouts]

258
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,500
This shouldn't be possible.

259
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,875
Man, this thing
cuts like a dream!

260
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,625
[SOLDIERS cheer]

261
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,375
[DEMONOID H chuckles]
Lucky us.

262
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,625
We're the first ones
to their aid station.

263
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,750
This place'll be
full of weak humans.

264
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,625
[DEMONOID I]
Hey!

265
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,166
Stop! I won't let you past me!

266
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,791
[DEMONOID H laughs]
That boy's shakin' in his shoes!

267
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,458
I call dibs on his head!

268
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,416
[DEMONOID H]
Uh, wait!

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,916
[MARK gasps]
Olivia!

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,916
Let me protect you, Mark!

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,833
I'll get you!

272
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,166
[DEMONOID H laughs]

273
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,458
Only if I can
protect you, too!

274
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,291
[DEMONOID H groans] I thought
you were a swordsman!

275
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,125
What, just because I was
holding a sword?

276
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,708
[DEMONOID H yells]

277

[JULIUS, THOR grunt]

278
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,916
[MOTHER B] Lady Sizilien,
please help my child!

279
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,458
[SIZILIEN]
Right!

280
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,625
We need to give first priority
to the worst injuries!

281
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,666
[DEMONOIDS yell]

282
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,250
[DEMONOID L]
You brat!

283
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:34,000
[DEMONOIDS shouting]

284
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,166
You demonoids are really
starting to disappoint me,

285
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,750
you know that? I came
here for a battle!

286
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,458
[DEMONOID P]
What's this guy's deal?

287
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,958
[DEMONOID Q] Yeah, we can't
be defeated by a human!

288
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,583
[DEMONOID P]
We're demonoids, aren't we?

289
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,500
We're gonna take over this
nation and eventually the world!

290
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,500
[DEMONOIDS scream]

291
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,125
You've sure got some lofty goals

292
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,541
for someone of
your weight class.

293
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,833
So this guy is Shin Wolford.

294
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,958
How'd he learn to use
those amazing moves,

295
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,541
and where does he get
all that raw power?

296
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,791
I'll tell you one thing,

297
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,541
Shin Wolford gave me a
beating I didn't expect.

298
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,166
[LAWRENCE]
What is this guy's weakness?

299
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,125
I mean, does he even have one?

300
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,250
It looks like we're just about
finished clearing this area,

301
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,125
Your Highness.

302
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,125
Yes, but keep your guard up.

303
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,416
[BOTH gasp]

304
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,250
You've really done
a number on us, huh?

305
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,166
[AUGUST]
You don't know when to quit.

306
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,875
Wait, that voice. I knew
you seemed familiar.

307
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,625
You must be the famous
Prince of Earlsheid!

308
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:43,083
Yes. And I've come to put every
last one of you monsters down.

309
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,291
Someone's a confident leader.
I hate to break it to ya,

310
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,916
but once I claim your head,
all your little minions are

311
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,833
gonna turn tail and run away.

312
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,791
And I hate to break it to you...

313
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,791
[chuckles]

314
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,208
...but if you want the leader
of the Ultimate Magicians,

315
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,166
then you've got the wrong guy.

316
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,458
What are you cracking up about?

317
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,208
[AUGUST] And you? Are you
the demonoids' leader?

318
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,208
Huh? So what if I am?

319
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,416
[AUGUST]
Well, once I bash your head in,

320
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,250
the others won't have
as much will to fight.

321
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,708
[FABRO]
Go ahead and try it!

322
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,000
It'll take a whole lot more
than crushin' the empire

323
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:22,000
to satisfy my anger! I'm gonna
massacre every human here!

324
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,166
I assume anger is the
source of your power, then?

325
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,916
Either way, I'll still stop you.
Attack me as hard as you like!

326
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,333
I'll tear you twerps apart!

327
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,708
[MARIA]
You shouldn't talk a big game

328
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,625
when you're backed
into a corner, prince!

329
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,583
You're as bad as Shin is!

330
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,958
[FABRO grunts]

331
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,916
[gasp]

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,458
You fight dirty, girl, tryin'
to sneak in a surprise attack.

333
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,166
Name's Fabro, and I'm thinkin'a
makin' you my new woman.

334
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,250
Sound good?

335
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,708
I may be in the market
for a boyfriend,

336
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,250
but I'll never be desperate
enough to say yes to that.

337
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,250
Aw, look.
Somebody does like you.

338
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,125
Hey, that was uncalled for!

339
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,166
That's a damn shame. After all,
I can think of so many fun

340
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,000
things you and I
could do together!

341
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,583
[AUGUST, MARIA shout]

342
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,708
[FABRO grunts]

343
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,500
[MARIA groans]

344
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,791
[FABRO]
Somethin's not right.

345
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,875
A woman turns you down,
and you just punch her?

346
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,291
[MARIA] If it weren't
for this battle uniform,

347
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,666
that blow would have
shattered my bones!

348
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,833
--[MARIA gasps, yells]
--[FABRO laughs]

349
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,250
Messina!

350
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,208
[MARIA]
Don't worry! I'll be okay.

351
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,250
[FABRO] Huh... Your outfit's
protectin' you somehow.

352
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,250
But look. There's a nice
bruise on your cheek.

353
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,916
So I'll just hit you places
your clothes don't cover!

354
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,666
[MARIA]
You're welcome to try it.

355
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,083
That is, if you're able
to get close enough!

356
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,083
[FABRO gasps]

357
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,833
[MARIA grunts]

358
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,916
[AUGUST grunts]

359
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,500
[gasps]
He's not hurt!

360
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,583
[FABRO chuckles]

361
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,791
No way. Is that...?

362
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,125
This magic gear looked
like it would come in handy,

363
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,541
so I decided I'd borrow it.

364
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,000
Can't return it though, since I
killed the guy who had it.

365
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,416
[MARIA]
Is that what I think it is?

366
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,041
Yeah, no doubt.

367
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,333
How'd he get Shin's
magic-powered barrier?

368
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,791
[FABRO]
Well?

369
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,291
What happened to the guts
you had just a minute ago?

370
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,625
Now hit me with
that magic of yours!

371
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:24,250
Unless you're too scared to!

372
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,166
[AUGUST, MARIA grunting]

373
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,125
[FABRO]
That ain't gonna hurt me!

374
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:37,166
[ALL grunting]

375
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,875
[FABRO]
They're not givin' up!

376
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,916
They just keep launchin'
more magic blasts!

377
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't know how much
this thing can take.

378
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,958
No! They broke through it!

379
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,833
Oh, you didn't know? If you
don't focus hard enough

380
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:58,166
when you use it, your magic
gear stops working!

381
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,416
This is unbelievable!

382
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,000
[FABRO]
How could I lose?

383
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,791
[AUGUST] You managed to figure
out what I was planning to do.

384
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,250
Smart, Messina.

385
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, what else do you expect?

386
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,666
Shin and Merlin
trained me, remember?

387
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,416
[AUGUST]
This is tragic.

388
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,541
If only they had been
born in Earlsheid.

389
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,333
Anyway, there's nothing
more we can do.

390
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:37,166
[KING SWEED sighs] The fighting
appears to be reaching its end.

391
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,958
Then I take it our assistance
won't be needed.

392
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll be sure to congratulate
those kids on a job well done.

393
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,666
[LAWRENCE]
What the hell's going on?

394
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:52,625
And it's not just Shin Wolford.
It's that entire group!

395
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,875
He'll destroy us
all before long.

396
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,958
No. There's still time.
I know what to do.

397
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,208
Well, I certainly
wasn't prepared

398
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,708
for this new development.

399
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,000
The plan was to lure
Wolford out into the open,

400
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,041
so as to obtain an accurate
assessment of his ability.

401
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:16,083
But if he's this overwhelmingly
mighty, that tells me that I'll

402
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,250
need to reevaluate my
previous appraisal.

403
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,041
They may be disposable pawns,
but it's still a shame

404
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,666
to let all of those
demonoids go to waste.

405
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,666
And it would be asking
too much of Lawrence

406
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,708
to organize their
retreat all on his own.

407
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:36,458
Which means I'll have to ask
this favor of you, Miria.

408
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,791
[COMMANDER A]
The demonoid attack has been

409
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,583
brought to a halt, but do
not lower your guard yet!

410
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,041
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

411
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,625
[SOLDIERS yell]

412
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,000
[COMMANDER A gasps]
What was that?

413
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:59,125
Well, humans.
Show me what you've got.

414
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,541
[SCHTROM] Oh dear. I thought I
told you not to get involved.

415
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:44,083
This is quite an unfortunate
turn of events, Zest.

416
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,583
How could you start
something so fun,

417
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,708
and not even have the
courtesy to tell me about it?
