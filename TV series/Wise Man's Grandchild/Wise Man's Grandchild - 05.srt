1
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:17,708
[gasps]

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,833
[sighs] The toilets in
this house with the bidet

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,083
function really are
the best things ever.

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,000
This is civilized living.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,625
Pardon Maria, but come here.
I have a question for you.

6
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,000
Uh. Sure.

7
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,500
It's those two.
What do you make of them?

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,041
Oh, it's pretty much
known that they're

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,125
head over heels for each other.

10
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:41,000
That so? Well? Are they
officially dating yet?

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,500
No, I wouldn't go that far.
I mean it's completely obvious

12
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,458
that they have feelings
for each other.

13
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,875
But I don't think Sizilien's
quite realized that what she's

14
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,208
feeling is romantic interest.

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,000
[MELIDA]
How can she not know that?

16
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,500
Sizilien's good looking,
and she has a sweet personality.

17
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,000
I couldn't tell you how
many boys have

18
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,416
up and declared
their love for her.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,041
But she turned them all down.

20
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,083
She doesn't know what
romantic interest feels like.

21
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,333
[MELIDA]
So what you're saying is...

22
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,916
[MARIA]
He's probably her first love.

23
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,916
[SIZILIEN] Is it still a long
way before we reach Bean Works?

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,458
[JULIUS]
No. We're almost there.

25
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,000
[THOR] It's too bad that Tony
couldn't come with us.

26
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,083
This was his idea.

27
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,458
[SHIN]
Hm...

28
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,666
What's the matter, Shin?

29
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,833
You've been frowning
back there for a while.

30
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,458
Aug. It's likely that
Schtrom's alive.

31
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,833
What makes you say that?

32
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,625
You saw me end the fight.

33
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,000
Remember the explosion
my Heat Ray caused?

34
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,000
Well I tried it out
in the wilderness,

35
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,791
and it left plenty craters,

36
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,208
but there wasn't an
explosion at all.

37
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,291
I think Schtrom made
that explosion.

38
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,916
He probably used it
to trick our eyes.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,250
Thanks for telling me.

40
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,041
[SHIN]
Mm.

41
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,708
Shin, when we reach the smith,
order whatever you need.

42
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:23,916
The king will sponsor you.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,291
[SHIN]
Huh?

44
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,000
We're going to need
you at your best, Shin.

45
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,583
No one else can stand
against Schtrom as an equal.

46
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,625
[SHIN]
Uh?

47
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,250
[AUGUST]
So let's get you outfitted.

48
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,000
[MARK] Oh cool! You guys came!
Welcome to Bean Works!

49
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,750
Good morning!
How is everyone doing?

50
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,458
Good. Hi, Mark. Olivia.

51
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm confused. Why are
you together so early?

52
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,750
[SIZILIEN, MARIA squeal]

53
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,541
You don't mind
explaining, right?

54
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,708
I'm sure that she would be
happy to answer our questions.

55
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,833
Fine, I'll do it,
but please go easy on me.

56
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,541
[MARK]
Hey! C'mere old man!

57
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,000
Shut your trap, dumbass!

58
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,250
When we're in the forge,
you call me boss!

59
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,125
I ain't old yet,
and I'm the head smith,

60
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,708
so show some respect!

61
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,875
[ALL]
Uh...

62
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,791
[AUGUST]
Sorry for interrupting.

63
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,166
My name is August
von Earlsheid, sir.

64
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,000
[SMITHS yell]

65
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,416
[HAROLD] No need for apologies,
Your Highness.

66
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,333
it's a great honor to meet you!

67
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:24,333
So, do think you can help him
develop a new kind of sword?

68
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:28,083
A sword for this boy?
Or, young man, I should say?

69
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,083
Yes. I guess I should
introduce him.

70
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,958
This is my classmate
Shin Wolford.

71
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,541
He's Merlin's grandson.

72
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,333
You mean to tell me this is
the grandson of the Wise Man?

73
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,291
The prodigy who recently slew
a demonoid all on his own?

74
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,833
[AUGUST] Mm. That's him.
Will you accept the job?

75
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,791
I'd be glad to. Sure!

76
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,875
Forging the young
hero's new weapon?

77
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,458
That's called free advertising.
Not to mention it's an honor.

78
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,416
So tell me, what kind of new
sword do you want me to make?

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,541
Shin?

80
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,000
Right.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,083
[HERALD]
Zest. I'm curious.

82
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,625
From what source do you
obtain your information about

83
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,500
the Kingdom of Earlsheid?

84
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,416
I'm working with someone who
lives within the kingdom itself.

85
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,875
He tells me it's in chaos,

86
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,916
due to the rising number of
demons within its borders.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
[HERALD]
Heh. I see.

88
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,166
This may be my chance to
take its lands for myself.

89
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,125
I very much hope
that comes to pass.

90
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,708
[HERALD] Heh! I care not
what a commoner like you

91
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,041
might wish for.

92
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,958
That said, I will put
the information

93
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:32,125
you've given me to use.
Consider that your reward.

94
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,916
Yes. It's my pleasure
to serve you. Hm-hm...

95
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,958
[SHIN] Okay. I'll leave
the rest to you, sir.

96
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,541
[HAROLD]
Right!

97
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,625
[SIZILIEN] How'd it go?
Did you finish explaining?

98
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,625
Yeah. You ready?

99
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,500
[MARIA giggles]
Yeah. We're done here.

100
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,958
[SHIN chuckles]

101
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,375
[SHIN] What else do you
sell from this place?

102
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,208
[MARK] We've got housewares
on the second floor

103
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,583
and fashion accessories
on the third.

104
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,750
I guess that must
mean jewelry.

105
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,208
[SIZILIEN]
What's on your mind, Shin?

106
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,875
Oh. I'm thinking about
getting you something.

107
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,250
Know what you'd want?

108
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,708
[gasps]
You wanna get jewelry for me?

109
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,500
Um. I like rings?
So, uh... Yeah.

110
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,083
Wait, maybe that's a little
too much for right now.

111
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,250
A necklace might be more
appropriate this early on.

112
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,666
Though, a bracelet
would be hard to pass up.

113
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,375
Same goes for earrings.

114
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,416
[SHIN] I'm not sure I can
get you all of that.

115
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,208
That's not what I meant!

116
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,708
I only want one thing,
but I can't pick.

117
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:33,708
It's a big decision,
there's a lot to consider.

118
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,958
We just need something
that can hold

119
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,291
a defensive enchantment.

120
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,958
So its looks don't
really matter at all.

121
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,291
Oh. How practical of you.

122
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,250
Stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid.

123
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,666
[SHIN gasps]

124
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,666
What is your problem?

125
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,166
Baiting her in like that.
You're evil!

126
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,375
The poor girl may
never trust again.

127
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,583
[SHIN]
Huh? Huh?!

128
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,416
[SHIN] Did she think
I meant it like...?

129
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,125
[SHIN]
Hey, uh, Sizilien?

130
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,791
[SIZILIEN whimpers]
Yeah, what is it?

131
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,958
[SIZILIEN]
I'm sorry, Shin.

132
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,541
At this point, I feel like
I'm being kind of pushy.

133
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,958
You're definitely not.

134
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,458
I want to make up for
bumming you out is all.

135
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,833
And besides,

136
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,041
I do wanna get you something
you'll enjoy wearing.

137
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,708
[SIZILIEN yelps]

138
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,541
[SHIN] I should be able
to enchant any of this,

139
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,458
so take your pick.

140
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:27,583
Hey. Would you mind picking
something out for me?

141
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,250
[SHIN] But, don't you know
what you'd like most?

142
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,291
No. Cause what I really
want is something you chose.

143
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,625
[SHIN]
Hm.

144
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:39,541
Kay. Then, what do
you think of this one?

145
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,083
[gasps]

146
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:46,125
[FEMALE CLERK A] I'm sure this
piece would look lovely on you.

147
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,291
Kay. We'll take it.

148
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,500
[FEMALE CLERK A]
A fine choice.

149
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,000
[SIZILIEN gasps]

150
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,458
So. Should I...?

151
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,291
[SHIN gasps]

152
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,208
Thank you. This is
really beautiful.

153
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,416
I'm glad that you
like it, Sizilien.

154
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,958
[SIZILIEN gasps]

155
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,708
[SHIN] And I'm glad that
it can keep you safe.

156
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,750
[SIZILIEN] Shin got me this,
to keep me safe.

157
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,000
[SHIN sighs]
Ready or not,

158
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,750
It's time for the
Award Ceremony.

159
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,291
--[knocking]
--[door clatters]

160
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,833
Excuse me.
They're ready for you now.

161
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,000
Well here goes nothing.

162
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,166
Our honored guest is here!
He's our kingdom's savior!

163
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,833
Earlsheid's newest hero!
Shin Wolford!

164
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,208
[SHIN]
Wow. Is this for real?

165
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,291
[DISEUM]
Shin Wolford.

166
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,791
In recognition of your valiant
conduct, I confer upon you...

167
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,958
...the First Order of Merit.

168
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,666
I am both humbled and
honored to accept it.

169
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,875
[DISEUM]
You have my thanks.

170
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,750
I just did what I
thought was right.

171
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,083
My good people. Hear me well!

172
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,125
Shin Wolford is
more than a hero.

173
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,875
He's the grandson of
Merlin the Wiseman.

174
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,750
When I first invited
Shin to attend

175
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,291
the Kingdom's magic academy,

176
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,500
I made a promise
to the Wise Man.

177
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,875
Shin won't be used for
political or military gain.

178
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,958
Should this promise
ever be broken,

179
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,083
their heroic household will
leave this land behind.

180
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,833
On this point, there's no
more discussion to be had.

181
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:09,250
[SHIN] Uncle Dis really did it.
He told them about the promise.

182
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,083
[yawns]

183
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,000
You look exhausted, Shin.

184
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,000
After yesterday's
award ceremony,

185
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,458
I had to attend a reception
and then a party.

186
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,375
[ADMIRERS chattering]

187
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,750
[MALE ADMIRER A]
Any second now. Look!

188
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,208
He's coming outside! I knew it!

189
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,291
[FEMALE ADMIRER A]
Shin! He's really here!

190
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,875
Oh, he could save me any day!

191
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,916
[SHIN gasps]
What the...?!

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,458
What did you expect to happen?

193
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,458
His Majesty didn't
present you to the public

194
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,000
after the award ceremony.

195
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,125
Of course they'd try
to get a peek now.

196
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,625
Well, we can't walk to school
through that mob. Too bad.

197
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,833
Guess we'll just
have to use a Gate.

198
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,375
[gasps]

199
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,875
--[YURI gasps]
--[SHIN] Uh, sorry, Yuri.

200
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,291
You startled me!

201
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,458
What kind of magic is that?

202
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,958
Is that what you used
to get in here?

203
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,083
Yeah. There was a
big crowd of people

204
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,583
in front of my house today.

205
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,500
I'd have been late if
I walked through.

206
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,583
So you came by Gate instead.

207
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,250
Gate, huh? What is that?
Can you tell us more?

208
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,625
Sure. Gate's just the
name of the spell I used.

209
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,958
It's a way of connecting
two distant places.

210
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,500
That's amazing.

211
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,333
Do you mean to tell us that you
can use teleportation magic?

212
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,500
I wouldn't call
it teleportation.

213
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,458
It's more like it
manipulates space.

214
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't understand.

215
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,458
[SHIN]
See, to teleport something,

216
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,583
I'd have to move it from
one place to another.

217
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,125
[LYN]
That's not what this does?

218
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,041
[SHIN] Nope, this just reduces
the distance between places.

219
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,708
[LYN]
Hm...

220
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,166
Hey. No worries if it's
tough to follow.

221
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,250
It's a strange concept.

222
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,750
It even gives my
Grandpa trouble.

223
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,375
[MERLIN]
It doesn't make sense!

224
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,958
It's the same for him?

225
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,958
Yup. But you might be able to
use it if you put in some time.

226
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,000
I mean you are in
the study group.

227
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,916
[LYN grunts]
I'll work hard.

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,500
[SHIN chuckles] Maybe I should
do a little boot camp and put

229
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,875
everyone through the wringer.

230
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:55,958
[SHIN chuckles]

231
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,250
[AUGUST]
He's definitely up to something.

232
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you mean when
you say "level up"?

233
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,083
You looked like you were
plotting something before.

234
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,666
I guess this is it?

235
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,333
[SHIN] Look, there've been a lot
of strange incidents recently.

236
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,583
We've managed to get
through fine so far,

237
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,333
but if we're gonna be
ready for the next one,

238
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,750
then I need to help all
of you get stronger.

239
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,541
That makes sense. It isn't
even half as weird as what

240
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,750
I thought you
might have in mind.

241
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,291
--[ALICE] Ha, ha!
--[SHIN] Hey!

242
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,875
So, how exactly do you plan
to make the class level up?

243
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,166
First of all, I need to help
all of you get proficient

244
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,583
with some fairly
basic combat magic.

245
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,000
Also, I'll enchant some
accessories for you.

246
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,375
Ah... You mean like the
ring you gave to Sizilien?

247
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,541
[SHIN] Ahem. Anyway.
Why don't we start by checking

248
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,291
how much magic each
of you can control?

249
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,625
[AUGUST]
Interesting. Why start there?

250
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,666
Well, cause, to use
high level spells,

251
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,250
you have to gather
lots of magic power.

252
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,625
What about
precise visualization?

253
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,791
Not to mention, using better
chants for power.

254
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,000
[SHIN]
They're not enough.

255
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,375
Visualizations work,
but chants are optional.

256
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,416
Having magic to fuel
your spell isn't.

257
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,916
Amassing and controlling
magic power is the most basic

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,500
and important skill
that we could work on.

259
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,041
I'll have to break
down their perceptions

260
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,250
and start from square one.

261
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,875
[SHIN]
Gather around, everyone.

262
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,666
Maria, mind making
a magic barrier for us?

263
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,750
[MARIA]
Huh? Okay, sure.

264
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,875
[SHIN]
Hm...

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,625
This won't do.
The barrier's too thin.

266
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,916
This could barely protect
you from anything at all.

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,916
[MARIA]
Huh?

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,375
Sizilien.

269
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,500
The barrier your ring makes
should be a good example.

270
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,791
Could you show the class?

271
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,916
Oh. Sure.

272
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,791
Whoa! That's cool!

273
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,041
[TONY]
Two layers?

274
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,708
Yeah. And it's augmented
with a physical barrier!

275
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,333
[SHIN] That ring has
been enchanted with my

276
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,708
control visualization.

277
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,208
Once it's been activated,
it can gather magic power

278
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,458
on its own and
then project it.

279
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,833
So it would appear.

280
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,333
Guess nothing beats a bunch
of concentrated power.

281
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,416
You might've noticed that
in my battle with Schtrom,

282
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
he blocked my first attack.

283
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,458
Well, he did that
with a magic barrier.

284
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,041
Are you serious?

285
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,041
But magic barriers are basically
just walls of pure magic power.

286
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,333
They're one of the first things
anyone learns to conjure.

287
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,250
I assumed that Schtrom
used some difficult

288
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,958
but more powerful magic.

289
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,541
[SHIN]
He didn't need to.

290
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,583
With enough magic power, you can
defend against almost anything.

291
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,541
So, wanna see a portion of
the magic I can control?

292
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,291
[SHIN]
Hm!

293
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,333
[ALL gasp]

294
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,041
[THOR]
Look at how dense it is!

295
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,291
[YURI] There's no way!
How's it so concentrated?

296
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:44,333
[gasping continues]

297
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,250
If you can't control close
to that much magic power,

298
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,000
then you're not
getting anywhere.

299
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,708
So keeping that in mind,

300
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,375
we're gonna do magic control
drills every day after school.

301
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,416
And no slacking.

302
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,208
[ALL]
Uh-huh.

303
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,875
[SCHTROM] Ah. The kingdom's
preparing for war, is it?

304
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,208
[MIRIA]
Yes.

305
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,875
The Imperial Army's
movements were quite overt,

306
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,208
so Earlsheid realized at once.

307
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,666
[SCHTROM]
My regards to Zest.

308
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,750
He made a fine
account of himself.

309
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,625
So, what do you think
will happen next, Miria?

310
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:24,125
Something which I could
never predict, Master Schtrom.

311
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,958
Let's hope everyone
dances well, shall we?

312
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:32,000
[SCHTROM laughs]

313
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,333
Oh. Shin.

314
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,708
[SHIN]
Hey Granny.

315
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,083
Whoa! It's really the Wise Man!

316
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,333
And the Guru's with him!

317
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,833
This is so cool!

318
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,208
You've brought many friends.

319
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,750
They're welcome, of course,
but might I ask why?

320
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,416
We were trying to leave
school for the day,

321
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,791
but there was this huge
crowd gathered outside.

322
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,250
[ADMIRERS]
Wow, it's Shin!

323
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,583
Fame sure is inconvenient.

324
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,958
[MERLIN laughs]
It'll die down before too long.

325
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:09,541
Ah. So you've all begun to learn
magic under Shin's direction.

326
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,083
Yes.

327
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,000
And he's been pushing us rather
hard right from the get go.

328
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,250
So I was thinking,

329
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,541
if it's the Wise Man who
taught magic to Shin,

330
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,750
then we're pretty much his
second-generation students,

331
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,250
right?

332
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,000
And we're also first-generation
students of his grandson.

333
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,958
Ya figure that out on your own?

334
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,416
Well, I taught Shin the basics,

335
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,708
but he's accomplished
much on his own.

336
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,958
He has his own way of
visualizing magic, you see.

337
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,708
What do you mean by that?

338
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,416
[MERLIN]
He thinks not just of outcomes,

339
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,458
but of the processes by
which they're achieved.

340
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,250
Say, do any of you know
what causes fire to burn?

341
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,750
Yeah, um. You know...
It burns 'cause ya light it?

342
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't think that's quite
what he was getting at.

343
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:53,458
It's a tricky question.
I doubt any of us know.

344
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,208
[MERLIN] Of course
you don't. Neither do I.

345
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,166
[ALL groan]

346
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,125
But that's exactly the type
of question Shin raises.

347
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,833
What might fire be?
What causes it to burn?

348
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,458
By considering these
seemingly abstract matters,

349
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,041
he's able to look past
a spell's outcome.

350
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,250
He views the mechanisms of
this world, and uses them

351
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,583
to come up with spells both
powerful and utilitarian.

352
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,625
Take this for example.

353
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,416
[SHIN]
Grandpa is that?

354
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,000
[MERLIN chuckles]
It surely wasn't easy.

355
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,333
But thanks to your
description with the paper,

356
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,125
I finally figured it out.

357
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,416
Shin's not the only one who can
use the spells he creates.

358
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,333
If you understand and
visualize their mechanisms,

359
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:38,208
then you need but apply the
correct amount of magic power.

360
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,250
Shin is certainly
unconventional,

361
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,041
but he's not
impossible to follow.

362
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,916
[SHIN]
Grandpa. Thank you.

363
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,583
[MELIDA]
You know,

364
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,125
every once in a while, you do
have your moments, Merlin.

365
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,375
What do you mean,
"once in a while"?

366
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,625
[MELIDA] I know why you
learned that Gate spell.

367
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,916
It was for Shin's sake.

368
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,125
What makes you so sure?

369
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,291
It seems like every time Shin
uses magic, people start

370
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,708
talking about him like he's
some kind of freakish oddity.

371
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,583
Yes, I had noticed that.

372
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,000
[MELIDA] But if you at
least can use Shin's magic,

373
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:15,416
then people might stop seeing
him as such an utter outlier.

374
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,625
This will be a good thing for
his classmates too, I think.

375
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,166
Did you see how their eyes lit
up at the thought of being able

376
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,125
to use magic in the
same way he does?

377
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,958
You learned that
spell so that Shin

378
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,708
wouldn't have to feel alone.

379
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,291
Is that what you think?

380
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,416
[MELIDA]
It is.

381
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,458
[MERLIN chuckles]

382
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:37,291
[bell chimes]

383
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,875
[SHIN grunts]

384
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,083
Hey, is everything
all right, Lyn?

385
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,833
[LYN] I was practicing magic
control, and it got out of hand.

386
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,291
[SHIN] Seriously?
You're not hurt, are you?

387
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,541
It happens all the time,
so don't worry.

388
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,750
But there must have been damage
to the stuff around you, right?

389
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,041
I mean, your hair's
pretty scorched.

390
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,166
My father works as
a court magician.

391
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,666
We have a practice room at home,
so it's fine if I lose control.

392
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,375
It kind of sounds like
this happens to you a lot.

393
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,750
You're quite the
unbridled magical girl.

394
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,083
I like that! From now on,
I'm the Unbridled Magical Girl!

395
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,416
[ALICE]
Good morning, Lyn!

396
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,000
[LYN] Lyn is gone. I'm the
Unbridled Magical Girl!

397
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,625
[ALICE]
Huh?

398
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:19,250
[HAROLD] Ah, just in time.
I finished your prototype.

399
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,041
[SHIN]
Leave it to a professional.

400
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,458
You knocked this out quick.

401
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,416
What did you expect?

402
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,791
[HAROLD] Kay, go ahead and
push the trigger on the hilt.

403
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,208
[SHIN]
Right here? Ah!

404
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,791
It popped out!

405
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,625
This is incredible. To think I
get to see the first prototype

406
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,916
of Bean Work's newest invention.

407
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,375
What are you talking about?

408
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,416
This was your idea
to start, Tony.

409
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,083
[TONY chuckles]

410
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,625
[AUGUST]
Hm...

411
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,250
You get your weird new sword?

412
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:52,083
Yeah. And I got you all
gifts for waiting for me.

413
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,333
Cool! What are they?

414
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,208
[SHIN] Accessories.
For the whole class.

415
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,666
[gasps]

416
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,291
I'll give 'em out later,
once I've enchanted them all.

417
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,541
Ah. To help level us up.

418
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,541
Wait. If you got something
for everyone here?

419
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,500
[BOYS giggle]

420
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,208
[SHIN] I didn't get
rings for the boys.

421
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,500
[BOYS grunt]

422
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,291
Shin, about that sword of yours.

423
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,541
Mind if I suggest that the army
adopt something similar?

424
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,916
Um. I wouldn't really mind,
but I think Granny might.

425
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,416
You let them do what?

426
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,708
Wait. I don't plan to
use your vibration spell.

427
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,458
I'd rather focus on the
detachable blade.

428
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,000
We'll have to make adjustments.

429
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,375
But if we mass produce them,

430
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,125
I think we can improve
quality and keep costs down.

431
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,833
The detachable blade
thing was Tony's idea.

432
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,333
So if he's okay
with it, I am too.

433
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,208
Why is this on your mind?

434
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:47,875
[AUGUST grunts] Honestly. It's
because war is close at hand.

435
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:48,625
[SHIN]
Huh?

436
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,125
I knew it.

437
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,625
Customers warned us of an
upcoming war at the restaurant.

438
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,625
Wait, a war, against who?

439
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,375
[AUGUST]
The Blusfia Empire.

440
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,458
[SHIN]
The Empire? But why?

441
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,625
You would have to ask
them to find that out.

442
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,291
Apparently, they've been
amassing countless troops

443
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,500
at our border.

444
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,916
[SHIN grunts]

445
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,416
Hopefully the war won't be
dragged out for too long.

446
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,000
But if things should
get desperate,

447
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,125
they may be forced
to enlist students.

448
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,666
[ALL gasp]

449
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,333
Well. Hey, the war
hasn't started yet.

450
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,875
No need to get worked up.

451
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,916
As for Shin, this isn't
your problem at all.

452
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,291
We appreciate your help
with the demonoid,

453
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,666
but we will never drag
you into fighting a war.

454
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,000
Sure, you might not draft me,
but you won't have to.

455
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,666
If all of you are in danger,
then I will go to war.

456
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,458
[BOTH gasp]

457
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,750
I consider all of
you my friends.

458
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,250
You're people that I
just can't do without.

[DISEUM]
I see. So the day has come.

462
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,041
The Imperial Army has begun its
advance toward our kingdom.

463
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:42,458
When sparks rain upon us,
we have to sweep them aside.

465
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,916
Yes?

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,750
[DISEUM] Ready our forces.
Tell them to prepare for battle.
