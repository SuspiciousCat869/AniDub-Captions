1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,541
Well, then.

2
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:22,625
I guess I will consider the
experiment a success for now.

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,916
More importantly...

4
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:29,500
[sighs]

5
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,958
[AUGUST]
What's wrong?

6
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,041
Don't tell me the
sudden hero status

7
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,958
is wearing you out already.

8
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,125
Yeah, maybe a little.
But something's bothering me.

9
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,583
Is it that easy to
become a demonoid?

10
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,208
You're right.

11
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,333
Huh? Huh? What's easy?

12
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,875
You know the previous demonoid?
He was a strong magician.

13
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,625
They say he messed up while
casting advanced magic.

14
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,083
And apparently that's
how he demonized.

15
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:03,250
But Rietsburg... He had just
barely enrolled in the academy.

16
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,833
At worst, if he lost
control of his spell,

17
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:10,125
he would over-throttle.
But to go full demonoid?

18
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,833
Well he did, and the whole
thing was pretty crazy.

19
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:17,666
Do you think... maybe this
was artificially induced?

20
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,291
You mean, like,
someone did this to him?

21
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,791
According to grandpa, demonoids
lose all sense of reason.

22
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,333
They can't communicate,
they can only howl.

23
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:29,750
But when Kurt turned demonoid,
he could still talk.

24
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:36,625
And when it came to actual
combat, he was pretty weak.

25
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:40,041
[ALL] 

26
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,375
Something about this
doesn't add up.

27
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,916
Hey. What if Kurt was used in
some kind of human experiment?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,333
[ALL gasp]

29
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,541
Huh? Uncle Dis?

30
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,833
Oh, this is good timing,
welcome home, Shin.

31
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,583
[SHIN]
Hm?

32
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,625
Sir.

33
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:39,250
Our noble majesty values heroism
in the kingdom of Earls-hide's

34
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,833
time of need. In a
selfless act of bravery,

35
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,041
you successfully
slayed a demonoid.

36
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,916
Therefore, we would be
honored to present you,

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,208
the First Order of Merit.

38
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,375
The... First Order of--

39
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,041
Hold on. Are you
giving me a medal?

40
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,916
[BOTH gasp, chuckle]

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,208
Diseum, did you not say you
weren't going to use Shin

42
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,833
for political gain?

43
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,666
What's all this fanfare about?

44
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,083
You know the danger.
The last time this happened,

45
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,541
the demonoid's attack left
the Kingdom of Earlsheid

46
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,875
on the verge of extermination.

47
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,375
That threat looms
over us yet again.

48
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,708
As you can imagine, news has
spread quickly among the people

49
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:24,458
about both the appearance of the
demonoid and its suppression.

50
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,166
For the sake of the kingdom,

51
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,166
we must address these
matters by going public.

52
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,333
Yes, I understand that much.

53
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,291
But what is the meaning of
awarding the young lad?

54
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,416
[DISEUM] How would it look
if we denied him an award

55
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,166
for a feat you two have
also accomplished?

56
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,166
[MERLIN]
Mm?

57
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,458
I suppose you do
make a good point.

58
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,041
Of course, there are
those who wish to profit

59
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,375
by exploiting him,

60
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,000
but I'll do all that I
can to prevent that.

61
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,166
So, please, I implore you
to allow this to happen.

62
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,375
Not for my sake,
but for the people.

63
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,750
[ALL gasp]

64
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,666
[sighs] Very well,
Diseum, you win.

65
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,916
We'll take you at
your word in this.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,583
But if you break your word, we
will leave this kingdom at once.

67
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,083
Is that understood?

68
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,708
Absolutely. You can trust me.

69
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:14,208
You know, a nation's king really
shouldn't bow to someone else

70
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,833
so readily.

71
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,041
[MELIDA sighs] Honestly,
you seem to go from one spot

72
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,583
of trouble to another.

73
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,083
Uh, wait, this is my fault?

74
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,708
[ADMIRER A]
Everyone, look! It's Shin!

75
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,125
That's the new hero who
defeated a demonoid.

76
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,916
Wow, he's so cool!

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
Yeah! He's cute, too!

78
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,583
My uncle, Dis, said he
issued a gag order,

79
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:42,166
but that hasn't seemed to stop
anyone from gossiping about it.

80
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,875
Well, what'd you expect?

81
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,750
His Majesty specifically said
we couldn't keep you defeating

82
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,583
the demonoid a secret.

83
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,916
But he also said we weren't
allowed to reveal any

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,833
additional details about the
attack to the people, remember?

85
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,583
Who're those two girls
walking with him?

86
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,458
Come on, there's no way someone
who's as amazing as Shin

87
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,583
hasn't already been spoken for.

88
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah. One of them
could be his fiancée.

89
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,708

Sizilien?

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,375
I'm sorry... for this.

[SIZILIEN]
Oh, no, it's fine. Really.

94
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,833
You sure?

95
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,625
I'm here walking by your
side of my own initiative.

96
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,083
So please don't doubt
my intentions, okay?

97
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,666
[gasps]

98
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,125
[SHIN] Sizilien, I offered to
help you of my own initiative.

99
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,333
So, don't doubt
my intentions, okay?

We're begging you, sir!

[STUDENT A]
Please let us in!

103

We wanna study with
the Wise Man's grandson!

104
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,208
[ALFRED] This is a nightmare.
I can't let all of them into

105
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,708
the study group,
but they're relentless.

106
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,000
All right, then.

107
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,041
Who can use other-dimensional
storage space?

[STUDENTS gasp]

109
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,291
That's the minimum standard.

110
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,416
If you can do that,
then stick around.

111
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,041
And I'll conduct
an entrance exam.

112
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,625
[DOMINIC]
What did you say?!

113
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,708
You really think there's a
chance the demonoid

114
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,916
was artificially created?

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,166
[DISEUM] Yes. Shin himself
came up with this theory

116
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,000
after fighting him personally.

117
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,333
Then that means...

118
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,166
...the recent increase in
demons may be linked.

119
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,750
[DISEUM]
Hm.

120
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,333
Yes. This could be a
very serious situation.

121
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:20,166
Dominic, Dennis,
investigate this.

122
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,166
Work together to find
out whatever you can.

123
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,166
Do not overlook anything!

124
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,625
[DENNIS, DOMINIC]
As you wish.

[MARK]
Pardon the interruption.

126
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,125
Hello, there.
Are you the students

127
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,500
who passed Mr. Marcus's
entrance exam?

128
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,375
Yes and it's an honor to be
joining you all, I'm Mark Bean!

129
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,208
My family runs a smithy
that's called Bean Works.

130
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,625
Oh, yeah? I've definitely
heard of that.

131
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,458
It's a well-known outfit.

132
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,708
Well known? They're good?

133
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,166
The weapons at Bean Works
are nice and sharp.

134
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,208
I've always wanted one.

135
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,333
Nice. And you are?

136
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,041
Oh, right. I'm Olivia Stone.

137
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,125
I've known Mark since
we were just kids.

138
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,041
You might have heard of
my family's restaurant

139
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,375
called the Brick Oven.

140
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,291
Are you kidding?
That place is awesome!

141
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,458
I dream about their brick
oven gratin. It's perfection!

142
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,958
Oh, man...

143
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,958
I actually celebrated passing
my academy entrance exams

144
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,125
by eating there,
and it was amazing.

145
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,041
I'm jealous,
you really lucked out.

146
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,833
It was so busy that we
couldn't get a reservation.

147
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:25,041
I'm flattered. If you want,
you should all come by again.

148
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,666
I'll serve you personally!

149
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,416
I'm so in! Shin, these guys get
my official seal of approval!

150
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,583
That is no way to welcome them!

151
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,958
So Mark, since you're
the son of a blacksmith,

152
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,541
does that mean you
can make blades?

153
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:41,625
[MARK gasps] Uh, sorta.
But I'm not exactly an expert.

154
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,708
At this point I've only been
able to manage crafting

155
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,000
a few knives.

156
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,833
Too bad. If you had the skill,

157
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,541
I would've asked you to
make me a new weapon.

158
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,250
I don't even know
if that's possible!

159
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,958
I mean, you slayed a
demonoid with that sword!

160
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,083
I doubt you'd have any luck
finding a replacement for that.

161
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,000
Nah, it was just a sword,
nothing' special.

162
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:01,708
Huh?

163
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,041
But it is enchanted,

164
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,291
so the blade vibrates
at ultrasonic speed.

165
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,666
Thanks to that,

166
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,750
I can cut through almost
anything without much force.

167
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,958
I like blades to be a
bit on the thin side,

168
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,083
but as a result,
they can break easily.

169
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,375
I was hoping I could make
some improvements to it.

170
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,958
If that's all you need,
I think I can do it.

171
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,000
But I'll be asking for your
input in the process.

172
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,458
Seriously? I've had a hard
time with the finer details.

yours can't come up with, Shin?

That's incredible.

I used to think that my
enchanting skills were decent,

but now I'm not so sure.

on yourself, Yuri.

how to improve your technique

Forgive me. You have a patch

[SCHTROM]
It may surprise you,

197
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,791
but I was born to a
noble family in the empire.

[AULT gasps]

199
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,750
Years later, there was
a power struggle,

200
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,708
and I was exiled
to the kingdom.

201
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,333
The fight for leadership
was violent,

202
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,000
and a family member attempted
to fatally wound me.

203
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,333
I survived--my eyes did not.

204
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,125
That's terrible.

205
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,666
I shouldn't have asked
such a personal question.

206
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,791
No, I get asked about
it all the time.

207
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,000
Anyhow, what brings
you men here today?

208
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,750
Surely you didn't come here
just to ask me questions

about my eyes.

210
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,625
No. Mr. Schtrom, sir, we are
aware that you have formed

211
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,583
a study group for students
with magical aptitude,

212
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,708
and that you have fostered

213
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,375
some exceptionally
talented magicians.

214
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,041
That's right. What about it?

215
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,625
We've heard that you
are quite enthusiastic,

216
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,666
inviting many students
to join the study group.

217
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,083
Well, I am a one-time
noble of the Empire.

218
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,750
I'm accustomed to facing
opposition in the kingdom.

219
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,541
In order to establish
myself at this school,

220
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,208
I needed to show
tangible results.

221
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,333
So that's why. Go on.

222
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,500
All of the students who
participated in my study group,

223
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,125
well, they improved their
abilities dramatically.

224

And as a result,

225
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,916
they're starting to acknowledge
me little by little.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,458
Well then. This incident
must be quite a blow.

227
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:02,708
Indeed, it is. It pains me to
know this happened to Kurt.

228
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,083
Mr. Schtrom,
If it isn't a bother,

229
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,666
may I ask a favor of you?

In addition to your work
with the study group,

I'm sorry.

241

I was just thinking of ways
to customize my sword.

242
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,791
Do you have any idea what
kind you're looking for yet?

243
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,708
What's most important
to me is a thin blade.

244
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,875
But like I said, that's going
to make it easier to break.

245
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,958
[MARK] A sword that
combines both a thin blade

246
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,583
and increased durability, huh?
That's gonna be tricky.

247
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,166
Yeah, but if you do break it,

248
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,500
can't you just replace
it with another one?

249
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,041
I mean, come on, you are
the Wise Man's grandson.

250
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,333
I betcha can afford
a whole armory!

251
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,291
That's... not an option.

252
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,583
I don't get very much
of an allowance.

253

What? That's surprising.

254
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,041
But it's true. Granny told
Grandpa not to spoil me

255
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,791
so I'll learn the value
of money... Or something.

256
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,625
That sounds like the Guru.

257
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:30,375
Moderation can be just as much
of an asset as a suit of armor!

258
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,958
That's one way to
look at it, I guess.

259
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,875
[TONY] If breakage is the issue,
maybe it would be a good idea

260
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,958
to make the blades
easily replaceable.

261

[MARK, SHIN]
Huh?

262
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,750
Think about it. You could
hang on to the same hilt.

263
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,333
So that's one less
expense to deal with.

264
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,541
[MARK, SHIN gasp]

265
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,666
[TONY] The hilt and
blade are always firmly

266
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,250
attached for typical use.

267
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,583
But since you don't need
to use much force at all,

268
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,666
that feature wouldn't be as
important in its construction.

Huh! That might work!

What exactly was your objective?

314
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,458
Just an experiment.

315
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,000
What? You were conducting
experiments on humans?!

316
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,541
Yes, that's right.

317
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,750
[chuckles] And now, since I've
completed all my experiments

318
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,000
here in the capital,

319
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,250
I think it's a good time
for me to excuse myself.

320
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,041
Seize him! Right now!
Don't let him get away!

321
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,166
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

322
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,541
[SCHTROM chuckles]

323
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,041
No way! You and Mark
are really a couple?

324
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,291
We basically grew up together,
so it just happened.

325
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,375
I want to know
every single detail!

326
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,750
[OLIVIA]
Every detail?

327
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,541
[MARIA] Of course we
wanna know, are you kidding--

[ALL shout]

329
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,333
What in the world?

330
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,500
[SHIN pants]

331
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:42,666
That thing covering his eyes.
Aug, is that the guy?

332
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,375
Yes. Our middle-school teacher,
Oliver Schtrom.

333
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,625
Oh, look. If it isn't
Prince August

334
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,333
and his trusty companion:
the hero Shin Wolford.

335
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,541
He's dangerous, please run away!

336
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,208
This man is the culprit behind
the demonoid incident!

337
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,666
He is?

338
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,291
[SHIN] You're the one who
turned Kurt into a demonoid?

339
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,500
That's right!
A fascinating specimen

340
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,208
who danced to my tune
quite brilliantly.

341
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,916
I've heard enough.

342
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,083
[SHIN] I knew there was
something weird going on!

343
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,208
[SCHTROM]
Heh!

00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,166
Maybe!

[SCHTROM, SHIN grunting]

[SCHTROM] You've got spunk.
I'll give you that much!

350
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,375
[SHIN grunts]
Playin' dirty? Take this!

351
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,208
Had to go up there, huh?
Well, you can't dodge this!

me the grandson of the great

[SHIN]
No. But guess what?

357
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,375
I can fly for a moment!

358

A little advice, boy.

Red eyes? No...

367
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,125
Now you've done it, Wolford.
How annoying.

368
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,958
I would have preferred
to leave the capital

369
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,541
with my true identity
still hidden.

370
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,833
How can you be a demonoid with
your sense of reason... intact?

371
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,083
[SCHTROM]
My sense of reason?

372
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,666
If you're under the assumption
that reason is what separates

373
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,875
demons from humans,

374
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,416
then I suppose you could say
I'm an exception to the rule.

375
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,041
[SHIN]
What do you mean?

376
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,208
[SCHTROM]
Now that I've been demonized,

377
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,208
humans have been reduced
to little more than

378
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,708
insignificant creatures
for me to experiment on!

379
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,125
I can kill them or
exploit them at will!

380
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,875
You creatures mean
nothing to me anymore!

381
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,041
[SHIN]
That bastard.

382
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,708
[SHIN] This is bad.
I have to... Stop you!

What's the matter with you?

384
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,000
Is your terror of me
making you clumsy?

385
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,041
This is why I can't
abide humans.

386
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,625
Stay where you are
just a little longer.

387
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,666
Another moment and you'll
see what my magic can do!

388
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,708
The Wise Man's grandson,
and you're a helpless fool.

Argh. You got him, right?

Don't jinx it like that, Aug!

[AUGUST]
Huh?

00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,458
[THOR] The high temperature
turned the ground to glass.

399
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,208
How did he create a
heat ray that intense?

400
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,125
[AUGUST]
Mm-mm...

401
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,791
[SHIN] My search magic
hasn't picked anything up.

402
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,333
Does that mean I really got him?

403
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,375
[RUPERT]
Cheer up! Why the long face?

404
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:27,416
He was a demonoid. You don't
regret killing him, do you?

405
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,125
No, it's not that.

406
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,666
You should hold your
head high, then.

407
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,958
Take pride in the fact that
you saved all our lives.

408
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,958
Thank you, Shin Wolford.

409
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,208
Oh, you don't
have to thank me.

410
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,250
We came as quickly as
we could when we heard

411
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,500
that another
demonoid appeared.

412
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,500
But much to our surprise,
you'd already taken him down!

413
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,750
[SHIN grunts]

414
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,333
Pleased to meet you,
I'm Dominic Gastor.

415
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,625
I'm Michel's successor as the
knight commander of the order.

416
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,166
Oh, dear. I haven't introduced
myself either, have I?

417
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,333
The name is Rupert Olgran,

418
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,916
captain of the court
magic division.

419
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,625
Michel told me all about his
immensely talented pupil.

420
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:09,041
He also expressed how much he
enjoyed training you, young man.

421
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,291
[SHIN]
Mm...

422
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,666
[RUPERT] Wolford, if you
wouldn't mind humoring

423
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,416
my curiosity, what exactly
did you do, and how?

424
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,125
Let's see. I converged
the light from the sun

425
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,708
and blasted it down
as a heat ray.

426
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,458
From the sun? And you got
that much force out of it?

427
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,458
Well, you see, the sun puts out
more than one kind of light.

428
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,333
So I just visualized collecting
the light that emits heat,

429
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,125
and from there it was
relatively straightforward.

430
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,708
[SHIN]
They have no idea what I mean.

431
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:43,958
Still, was it just a heat ray
that created the explosion?

432
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:20,916
[SCHTROM grunts]

433
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,583
[You beat me this time, Wolford.

434
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,250
Luckily I was able
to get out of there.

435
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,375
But the only way was to
release explosive magic.

436
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,541
But if I'd endured even a
fraction more of his magic,

437
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:37,125
it could have very well
have annihilated me.

438
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,375
That boy. He's more formidable
than I first thought.

439
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,750
I'll have to take every
precaution to ensure

440
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:46,000
that he won't interfere
with my plans.
