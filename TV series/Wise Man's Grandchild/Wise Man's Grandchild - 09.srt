1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,500
[yawns]

2
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,208
[SHIN] What happened last night
was burned into my retinas,

3
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,541
so I barely slept at all.

4
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,583
[gasps]

5
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,125
[gasps]

6
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,333
[BOTH whimper]

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,583
Oh. Hi, Shin, I didn't see you!

8
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,875
Good morning, Sizilien!

9
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:37,416
Um, anyway, we should get
to the dining hall now.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,208
If we don't hurry,
our breakfast'll get cold.

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,416
[SIZILIEN]
Right, that's a good idea!

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,291
Oh, and by the way, Shin.

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,000
Um, do you have some time?

14
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,625
You see, I need to
ask you for a favor.

15
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,750
[SIZILIEN] I apologize
for asking something

16
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,083
this important of you so
early in the morning, Shin.

17
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,666
But if we'd waited too long,

18
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,083
then my father would
have been at work.

19
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,791
That's fine. If I'm coming
to meet your folks,

20
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,666
then they should
both be here, right?

21
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,125
[SIZILIEN sighs]
Yes!

22
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:45,166
[SHIN] But despite what we said,
when it came down to it...

23
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,541
Alright. So, what were
you wanting to tell us?

24
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,208
If you interrupted
your training camp

25
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,208
to make the trip all
the way back to us,

26
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,958
it must be something
terribly important.

27
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,166
[gulps]
Well, um...

28
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:06,250
Sizilien has given me the
great honor of dating her.

29
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,083
So, now that you know,

30
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,250
I ask for your blessing,
if you wouldn't mind.

31
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,958
[BOTH gasp]

32
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,750
Young man.

33
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,333
[SHIN]
Yessir?

34
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,083
[CECIL] Thank you!
From the bottom of my heart,

35
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,291
I'm so grateful that you would
choose my dear Sizilien!

36
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,625
[SHIN]
Huh?

37
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,750
[SIZILIEN gasps]

38
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:34,041
Oh my! This is a wonderful day,
and it's just morning!

39
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,083
Who could've guessed we'd
receive such great news?

40
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,250
Please, darling!

41
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,250
[CECIL]
Hm? Yes? What's wrong?

42
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,500
Sit down. You're too eager.

43
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,375
Oh. Right.

44
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,416
[EILEEN] Before I accept your
relationship with my daughter,

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,333
there's one question I'd like
to ask you. Do you mind?

46
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,666
[SHIN]
Sure. Ask away.

47
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,583
[EILEEN] This family is a
noble one, a viscountcy.

48
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,833
Sizilien may be our
third daughter,

49
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,208
but still, the next step
is extremely imperative.

50
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,916
What do you mean when
you say "next step"?

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,541
I mean marriage.

52
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,375
[SIZILIEN gasps]

53
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,541
[EILEEN] I'm not talking
about right away.

54
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,291
But, the daughter of a viscount
should not be permitted

55
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,291
to date without being
formally engaged, you see.

56
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,500
[chuckles] Luckily, it looks as
though you're prepared for that.

57
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,833
Yes.

58
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,208
Do you mean it?

59
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,833
[EILEEN]
Congratulations, dear.

60
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,250
[gasps]

61
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,875
It appears that your longtime
wish has been granted.

62
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,916
[SIZILIEN gaps]
Thank you, Mother! I'm so glad!

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,833
[SIZILIEN gaps]
But wait a minute!

64
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,166
Don't say those things
in front of Shin!

65
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,375
[grunts]

66
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,916
[shouts]

67
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,500
Not too shabby, Thor.

68
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,291
Same goes for you.

69
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,583
What's that magic?
Everyone is so powerful!

70
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,666
A nice effort, you guys.
Guess that's enough warmup.

71
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,250
Warmup?!

72
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:10,541
[MERLIN chuckles] Well, ladies?
How is the observation going?

73
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,458
You're welcome to try
for yourselves, if you'd like.

74
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,958
[BOTH gasp]

75
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,166
I do appreciate the kind offer,
but I'll have to decline.

76
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,208
I'm afraid I haven't the
slightest aptitude

77
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,375
for magic technique.

78
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,750
Please, sir! Can I try?

79
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,250
Of course. Why don't we
start off by teaching you

80
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,291
to master basic magic control?

81
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,750
[MAY]
Oh wow, this is so incredible!

82
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,791
Just look at all that power!

83
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,750
[MERLIN] Ah, that's quite
an impressive skill

84
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,958
you've got there!

85
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,958
Indeed, especially for
someone of your age.

86
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,416
You know, May, I think
you have some real

87
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,583
potential as a magician.

88
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,958
[MAY chuckles]

89
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,500
Princess May's really
good at magic, huh?

90
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,958
I wonder if she'll turn out
to be better than us?

91
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,500
I won't be outdone! Watch me!

92
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,791
[laughs]

93
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,333
Well, I'm glad her natural
talent inspires you

94
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,458
to work hard! Whoa! Easy, Lyn!

95
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,458
I think you're working
a little too hard there.

96
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,791
[LYN yelps]

97
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,291
[MELIDA laughs]

98
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,125
It's not my fault.
I tried to warn you.

99
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,000
See? Keep at it, you two.

100
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,791
If you don't apply yourselves,
I guarantee you little May is

101
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,833
going to surpass you someday,
in more ways than one.

102
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,000
[BOTH] When you say "more ways
than one," is that...?

103
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,083
[MAY giggles]

104
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:27,833
[LYN, ALICE]
You're dead!

105
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,708
[MAY whimpers]

106
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,125
What makes you want to
take cover behind Shin?

107
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,375
Your own big brother's
right here, you know.

108
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,666
[SHIN, MAY]
Hm?

109
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,333
It appears, some punishment
might be in order.

110
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,958
Uh-oh! Please protect me,
big brother Shin.

111
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,333
He looks really scary!

112
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,791
How did I get wrapped up
in this weird family drama?

113
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,291
I'm just kidding.

114
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,833
Are you, though?

115
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,291
[SCHTROM]
Miria.

116
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,875
I trust everything is
progressing smoothly?

117
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,083
Because of the many caravan
attacks along the roads,

118
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,416
cities throughout the empire
are facing food shortages.

119
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,541
Discontent is
increasing each day.

120
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:10,708
Well, then I would say the
ideal time is finally upon us.

121
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:16,583
[SHIN grunts] So, why are you
guys being extra cautious?

122
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,166
[YURI]
Because of you, Wolford!

123
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,458
You're experimenting with
new magic, aren't you?

124
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,083
Yeah, and the last thing
that I wanna do

125
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,375
is get blown away by
some crazy spell!

126
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,958
Better safe than sorry.

127
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,625
May. I want you to stay behind
me this time, understand?

128
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,375
Okay...

129
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,541
[SHIN chuckles]

130
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,666
[SHIN] This one isn't going
to be that dangerous, guys.

131
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,875
[AUGUST]
Define "Dangerous".

132
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,666
[SHIN] It's not even attack
magic. I promise, it's fine.

133
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,125
[AUGUST]
Oh, okay then.

134
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,083
[ALL gasp]

135
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,041
[THOR] He's collecting so
much power. It's extraordinary.

136
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,541
Uh... And you're positive
this isn't dangerous, correct?

137
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,375
[SHIN] Oh! That's great!
It actually worked!

138
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:09,375
[ALL gasping]

139
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:13,875
Excuse me, but exactly what
kind of technique is that?

140
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,791
It's floating magic.

141
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,958
Anti-gravity, or, I guess,
to use simpler terms,

142
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,333
it's like falling,
but the opposite way.

143
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,208
As per usual, I have no idea
what you're going on about,

144
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,375
but it's safe to assume you're
doing something amazing,

145
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,166
because that's kinda your thing.

146
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,000
[SHIN] No, this is the
truly amazing part.

147
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,291
[ALL]
Huh?

148
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,541
[SHIN] Casting floating magic
on myself to move upward.

149
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,458
While using wind magic to
travel from side-to-side.

150
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:53,708
[SHIN laughs] Hey, this is
kind of fun! Check it out!

151
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,083
[SHIN] There, another
successful experiment!

152
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,708
Of course. You're always
so over-the-top.

153
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,833
Nuh-uh! Schtrom used
the same trick.

154
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,125
I'm only doing it so
that I can counter him.

155
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,833
Oh, Shin! You're great!

156
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,416
Big brother Shin! I want to
fly around like that, too!

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,458
Teach me how, pretty please!

158
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,208
Uh. I don't think that's
such a good idea!

159
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,458
What do you mean?

160
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,583
Don't do it right now,
at least.

161
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,000
Why not?

162
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,875
Because if you do, then
everyone'll see your panties!

163
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,708
[MAY shouts]

164
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,500
[groans]

165
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,750
[MERLIN] What? You've already
gotten engaged?

166
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,125
[SHIN]
Yeah, we have.

167
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,708
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about it sooner!

168
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,541
It was all my fault, sir!
It's just that...

169
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,416
...I couldn't wait to tell my
parents we were together.

170
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,666
Oh, no. It's nothing you
need to apologize for.

171
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,625
Well, that's that. Though it
was only a matter of time,

172
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,791
so I can't say that
I'm surprised.

173
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,208
[BOTH gasp]

174
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:58,416
However, before you go public
with your engagement,

175
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,291
there is one matter you'll
have to settle first.

176
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,791
[BOTH]
Hm.

177
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,166
My dear. I know it's late,

178
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,416
but I must pay a visit
to your parents.

179
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,833
Whoa, Granny! You're gonna--?

180
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,208
[MELIDA]
Mm.

181
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,291
My! The Wise Man and the
Guru right in my own parlor!

182
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,250
To what do I owe such
an unexpected honor?

183
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,125
Normally, we wouldn't
visit at this late an hour,

184
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,458
but time is of the
essence here.

185
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,916
There's something we must
discuss with the two of you.

186
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,250
[MELIDA] Now then. I believe
that sums it all up.

187
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,333
I see. So Shin here...

188
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,541
Right, he's not my actual
grandson by blood.

189
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,083
[gasps]

190
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,791
[SHIN grunts]

191
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,208
With all due respect,

192
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,708
we're glad to hear you
approve of their union.

193
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,916
And forgive me if I'm wrong,
but I assume that was because

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,958
you thought that we
were his grandparents.

195
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:01,541
Though, now you know that
there's no biological relation.

196
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,666
Regardless of that, they're
quite fond of each other.

197
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,750
Will you still allow it?

198
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,083
[sighs]

199
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:14,041
Milady. Master Merlin.
I have to say I'm upset...

200
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,208
[grunts]

201
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,291
I thought so. Very well.

202
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,333
There's nothing
we can do now.

203
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,291
...that you would
view us this way.

204
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,166
That is what upsets me!

205
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,125
[BOTH gasp]

206
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,458
We accept Shin,

207
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,583
not because we believed
he was your grandson,

208
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,291
but because of something far
more important than that.

209
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,583
He values Sizilien
more than anything

210
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,875
and does his best
to protect her.

211
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,875
It's because of the kind of man
he is that we approve of him

212
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,583
as a husband for our daughter.

213
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,208
I believe he's
what's best for her.

214
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,458
Yes, and I wholeheartedly agree.

215
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,500
[BOTH gasp]

216
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,416
I apologize for making
assumptions about you.

217
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,291
I hope you'll forgive me.

218
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,666
It's alright!

219
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,000
Please don't give it
another thought, Lady Melida!

220
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,125
Oh, and Shin.
I feel the same way.

221
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,791
I like you for you!

222
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,291
After all, when we were
first getting acquainted,

223
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,875
I had no idea you were
the Wise Man's Grandson!

224
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,416
[SHIN sighs]

225
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,666
Thank you, all of you.
I'm so happy.

226
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,083
And I promise you this.
I'll always protect Sizilien!

227
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,083
Right. I trust you.

228
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,750
Keep her safe... for life.

229
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,041
Grandpa. Thanks a lot
for taking me in.

230
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,500
I've said it before,
but I'm serious.

231
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,125
I'm so glad we're family.
You're the best.

232
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,833
Shin...

233
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,583
Granny. I'm really
grateful to you, too.

234
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,250
You may get mad at me a lot,
but I'm happy to have you,

235
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,875
you know that?

236
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,208
Oh, Shin, you're making
me so emotional!

237
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,875
[BOTH chuckle nervously]

238
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,500
[SHIN]
Wow. You guys look great!

239
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,541
So, the defensive magic you used
to enhance all of these garments

240
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,666
is supposed to make them
more protective, right?

241
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,041
[SHIN] Yep! Plus I added
"optical camouflage"

242
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,416
to help you blend in,
and "cozy temperature"

243
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,625
to make it so they'll never
be too hot or too cold.

244
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,666
Let me get this straight.
They're national treasure grade,

245
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,041
but you made all
these improvements?

246
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,125
[SHIN]
Right!

247
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,250
[MARIA groans]
So despite everything,

248
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,833
I'm still walking around wearing
a bunch of state secrets.

249
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,416
[SHIN] Oh, and I didn't end up
doing anything to the footwear.

250
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,208
At first I thought about making
them into jet boots like I did

251
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,583
with mine, but those
tend to be a little bit

252
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,833
difficult to operate.

253
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,916
[AUGUST] So, with these
clothes and the accessories

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,500
we received before, our defenses
are essentially perfect.

255
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,583
Which means whatever's
in store today,

256
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,333
it must be incredibly dangerous.

257
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,666
[SHIN chuckles]
You guessed it!

258
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,000
[ALL gasp]

259
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,500
[SHIN] I've been thinking
it's time we did some

260
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,041
combat training.

261
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,625
[ALL]
Huh?

262
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,708
We'll be taking down a
Catastrophic-class demon.

263
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,708
What? Catastrophic-class?

264
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,708
There's no way we'll survive!

265
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,875
I promise you,
everything'll be fine!

266
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,250
You've all gotten strong enough
to hold your own out there.

267
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,166
And besides, you're wearing
maxed-out protective gear.

268
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,583
It'll be pretty hard for
anything to hurt you in those.

269
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,291
[GIRLS groan]

270
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,833
It's so mean of you guys
to leave us behind!

271
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,958
Why don't you just let
us tag along with you?

272
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,041
Today is real combat training.

273
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,416
I refuse to expose you to the
slightest bit of danger.

274
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,791
[MARIA]
Sorry, Princess.

275
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,583
But you'll have to wait
in your room, okay?

276
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,583
[MAY whines]

277
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,833
Stop throwing a tantrum.

278
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,041
Hey, I know!

279
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,583
[SHIN]
Here, May. Take this.

280
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,166
What is it? Food?

281
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,541
[SHIN]
A magical communication item.

282
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,791
It's enchanted with
"transmit-and-receive sound"

283
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,333
magic.

284
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:08,166
When you talk, you hold
it like this. See?

285
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,750
Why don't you give it a try?

286
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,708
Hello? May? What's up? Hear me?

287
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,791
Yes, I do! Loud and clear!

288
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,875
[SHIN]
See? Told you.

289
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,791
Look at that.
Another cool gadget.

290
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:25,333
Yeah. It'll help us
with gathering intel.

291
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,916
Nice, huh?

292
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,125
You should hang onto this so you
can talk to us while we're away.

293
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,583
It's magical gear, so it'll
be good practice for you!

294
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,958
You're right!

295
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,916
Oh, come on.

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,541
[MAY]
Look, Lady Melida!

297
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,750
Shin made something
really neat for me!

298
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,166
Uh-oh.

299
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,541
I see you've made another
unprecedented magic item!

300
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,875
A device that remotely
transmits a person's voice

301
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,291
is something that's barely
been dreamt about!

302
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,000
And now you go and whip
one up like it's nothing!

303
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,333
Why, if enough people got word
that such a thing had been

304
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,500
conjured, disputes about the
right to its usage would break

305
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,125
out all over the land!

306
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,166
Don't be so irresponsible!

307
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,875
Hello? You'd better not be
ignoring me, young man!

308
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,291
Wait! What is that?

309
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,291
I'm guessing you feel it too?

310
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,416
Yes. Some large presence.

311
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,833
[SHIN] Hm. We're picking
up a Catastrophic-class.

312
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,166
Unlike the tiger,
which is pretty swift,

313
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,291
the lion is stronger,
but slower-moving.

314
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,166
Which means?

315
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,250
Um, that we should
attack it from a distance?

316
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,916
[SHIN] Correct! You sure
know your stuff!

317
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,541
[ALL groan]

318
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,833
[SIZILIEN, SHIN yelp]

319
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:44,583
[SHIN] Anyway. Julius.
Yuri. Mark. Sizilien. Olivia.

320
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,708
You five will go first.

321
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,875
But they're all more suited
to supportive positions.

322
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,458
Are you sure that's wise?

323
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,333
Yeah, I think they'll be more
than a match for this thing.

324
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,000
[OLIVIA whimpers]

325
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,875
Don't worry. Just have
faith in Wolford.

326
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,416
[OLIVIA sighs]

327
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,666
[LION roars]

328
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,791
Alright! Ready?

329
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,000
[SHIN]
Fire!

330
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:21,208
[OLIVIA]

331
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,083
[roars]

332
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,375
[All exhale]

333
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,375
[chuckles]
Oops. Guess we overdid it.

334
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,875
Um, but Shin. I'm lost.
What happened to the lion?

335
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,166
You defeated it. Wiped the
thing clean off the map.

336
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,791
Wait, so we just took down
a Catastrophic-class?

337
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,791
[SHIN] The support magicians
managed this as a team.

338
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,916
But since the rest of you
specialize in attack spells,

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,166
I'm sure any one of
you could do it.

340
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,833
[BIG CAT roars]

341
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,333
[shouts]

342
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,958
See? You did it!

343
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,583
Yeah, guess we did!

344
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:29,666
The question is, though,
should we have done it?

345
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,000
I think you did the best
out of all of us, Tony!

346
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,125
That vibration sword was
all like, "whoosh, gotcha"!

347
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,916
Hold on. When did you
acquire that thing anyway?

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,333
Oh, it's from Shin.

349
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,291
He thought that I might get
some good use out of it,

350
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,666
so he lent it to me.

351
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,166
I want to use it!
That's not fair!

352
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay, well take
it up with him!

353
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,416
Good. It looks like
everybody in the group

354
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,000
has advanced to the next level.

355
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,083
Uh?

356
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,583
That's right, and now
it's your turn.

357
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,375
[SHIN]
Huh? Oh, yeah.

358
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,375
It's almost time for your
big engagement party.

359
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,375
Can't wait to see you there.

360
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:11,416
[SHIN grunts] I have no
idea what this thing

361
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,833
is even supposed to look like.

362
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,416
--[knocking]
--Uh, it's open!

363
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,666
[gasps]

364
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,208
Wow.

365
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,125
Um. Hi, Shin. Something wrong?

366
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,750
[SHIN]
Oh, no! I'm fine.

367
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,000
You look really
cute, that's all.

368
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,333
Oh. Well, thanks so
much for saying that.

369
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,875
And you! So handsome!

370
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,416
[SHIN]
Yeah? You think?

371
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,125
Definitely! And do you really
think that I look that cute?

372
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,916
Yeah. You're beautiful.
My heart's pounding!

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,333
[SIZILIEN sighs]
Oh, Shin.

374
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,833
Sizilien.

375
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,708
[EILEEN]
Ahem. That's enough, you two.

376
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,000
It's clear that
you like each other.

377
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,375
Now, hurry and make your
way over to the dining room,

378
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,375
if you please.

379
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,541
[SIZILIEN, SHIN giggle]

380
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:13,583
[ALL clapping]

381
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,791
[DISEUM] Now. Does everyone
have a glass for the toast?

382
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:37,541
My dear nephew, Shin Wolford,
and Sizilien von Klode.

383
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,458
I am here this evening, to bear
witness to your engagement

384
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,250
and to celebrate
your joyous union.

385
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,291
As ruler of the proud
Kingdom of Earlsheid,

386
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,041
I hereby deliver
this declaration.

387
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,375
I wish you both great happiness!

388
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,500
Now, let us raise our glasses,
and toast the couple!

389
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,666
[ALL]
Cheers!

390
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,833
[SHIN]
Whew. That's over.

391
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,666
You made it through, Shin!
I'm glad!

392
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,958
And now, things are going
to settle down, aren't they?

393
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,208
No. I have one more thing
that I need to do.

394
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,083
[SIZILIEN]
Hm?

395
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,500
Sizilien?

396
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,625
[SIZILIEN]
Yes? What is it?

397
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,125
[SHIN] I'm sorry for doing
this in the wrong order.

398
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,416
[gasps]

399
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,750
[SHIN] And I know our engagement
party is already over...

400
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:11,875
...but, hey, here goes.
Will you please marry me?

401
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,416
[SIZILIEN sighs]
Yes. Of course!

402
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,458
I would be honored
to be your bride.

403
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:32,583
[SIZILIEN sisgh] Oh, goodness.
This is... wonderful!

404
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,416
Sizilien...
