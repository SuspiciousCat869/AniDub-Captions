00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,166
[FEMALE NURSE A] Lady Sizilien,
over here, please!

2
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,291
[SIZILIEN]
Right!

00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:37,083
[SOLDIER A groans]

00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,291

[SIZILIEN sighs]

7
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,541
[SOLDIER A]
Thanks a lot.

8
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,083
Sure! Now, get some rest.

9
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,500
[GIRL A whimpers softly]

10
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,458
[SIZILIEN]
Hm.

11
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,875
[WIFE A]
Lady Sizilien!

12
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,833
I beg of you, please come
check on my husband!

13
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,291
[grunts]

14
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:03,833
[HUSBAND A coughs]

15
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,916
Damn. He's bleeding fast!

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,666
Oh, thank goodness!

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,083
[HUSBAND A groans]

18
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,083
[SIZILIEN gasps]
Oh no!

19
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:16,333
Milady, please save him.
Whatever you have to do!

20
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,416
[SIZILIEN grunts]

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,375
[SIZILIEN gasps]

22
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,208
[SHIN]
What kind of power is that?

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,791
[COMMANDER A]
She's on a different level

24
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,041
than the rest of them.

25
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,000

You guys stay behind this wall!

29
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,291
[COMMANDER A]
Are you sure?

30
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,333
[LYN] No offense, but you'll
only slow us down!

31
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,833
[COMMANDER A]
Okay, I'll trust you.

32
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,833
And who might you be?

33
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:53,250
[BOTH]
We're the Ultimate... Magicians!

34
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,916
[LYN shouts]

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,166
Where did she go?

36
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,250
[MIRIA] You aren't chanting?
That could be a problem.

37
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,500
[ALICE shouts]
Take this!

38
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,958
[COMMANDER A gasps]

39
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,166
Oopsie, I guess that
was a little much.

40
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,041
Alice, behind you!

41
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:21,625
[ALICE]
Huh?

42
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,541
[MIRIA shouts]

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,208
Magic gear?

44
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,625
[ALICE]
You're mine!

45
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:35,666
[MIRIA, ALICE grunt]

46
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,750
Get out of there!

47
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,500
I can't! She's way too powerful!

48
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,458
Alice!

49
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,791
[ALICE grunts]

50
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,208
[MIRIA] Your fighting
technique is so juvenile.

51
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:55,125
[LAWRENCE] Reinforcements?
Did Master Zest come to our aid?

52
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,375
Either way, now's our chance!

53
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,458
[LAWRENCE] Everyone, retreat!
That's an order!

54
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,333
All demonoids withdraw,
immediately!

55
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,500
Did he just tell us
to stop fighting?

56
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,458
But I wasn't done
playing with them!

57
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,041
We can't let a human tell--

58

[DEMONOID A grunts]

59
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,916
[LAWRENCE]
We're at a disadvantage!

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,208
We should fall back
and regroup, now!

61
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,958
[DEMONOID B]
Whoa!

62
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,666
[DEMONOID A] Hey you!
Get the hell out of our way!

63
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,708

[gasps]

65
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,916

can get away that easily.

[LYN yells]

74
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,333
No! Lyn!

75
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,791
It looks like Alice
has been captured!

76
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,708
This might be tricky, then.

77
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,666
Yuri! Let's go!

78
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,833
I'll attack her from the rear!

Is that Yuri? Wait,
I gotta stop!

I'll cover you!

Crap!

Oh no!

00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:49,458
Now you're gonna pay!

Alice... no!

94
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,583
[SHIN]
Hold it.

95
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,000
[MIRIA]
Hm?

96
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,208
Oh, Wolford, thank goodness!

97
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,041
[MIRIA]
So this... is Shin Wolford.

98
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:37,000
[LYN grunts]
Be careful, Wolford.

99
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,291
This one knows what she's doing.

100
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,375
[SHIN]
That's okay. So do I.

101
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,375
Yuri! Help the others!

102
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,291
Uh, right!

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,666
[MIRIA] It would appear that
Lawrence was successful.

104
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,041
How dare you cause
all this pain?

105
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,125
[MIRIA] Now, then. Let's see
how good this young man is.

106
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,416
I'm curious!

107
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,458
[SHIN, MIRIA grunting]

00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,208
[YURI yelps]

109
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,666
[MIRIA]
Two of them at once?

110
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,583
[MIRIA gasps]

111
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,583
[MIRIA] If I'd been
one second slower...

112
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,333
[AUGUST]
Shin!

113
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,791
[MARIA]
Are you okay?

114
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,125
We're here to back you up!

115
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,750
[MIRIA] Perhaps it's
time I took my leave.

116
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,833
[gasps] Guys! Here she comes!

117
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,208
[ALL gasp]

118
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,875
[SHIN]
Damn!

119
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,750
Now, Miria, surround them
with explosive magic!

120
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,125
[MIRIA gasps]

121
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,833
What?

122
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,833
Listen, Aug, guard the group!

123
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,458
[MIRIA shouts]

124
00:06:55,125 --> 00:07:00,083
[ALL shouting, grunting]

125
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,458
[SHIN gasps]
I think they're gone now.

126
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,875
[AUGUST]
Shin!

127
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,375
[SHIN]
Guys.

128
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,666
[LYN]
We're all okay.

129
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,333
[SHIN]
I see. Thank goodness.

130
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,041
[SHIN] Sorry. I let
the demonoids escape.

131
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,333
[MARIA]
No. I'm sorry.

132
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,833
[AUGUST] That female
demonoid surprised me.

133
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,541
Yeah, she was really powerful.

134
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,833
She was probably a hunter or
soldier before she transformed.

135
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,791
This is an epidemic.

136
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,375
But still, what was their
reason for attacking Sweed?

137
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,625
What could Schtrom be up to?

138
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,583
Speaking of Schtrom.
We're lucky he wasn't here.

139
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,041
'Cause if he had been,

140
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,625
then things would have
been a lot tougher.

141
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,666
[THOR] Even so, the demonoids
managed to do a lot of damage.

142
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,875
[JULIUS] We need to focus
on saving whatever lives

143
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,833
we still can.

144
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,833
[SHIN]
I'm worried about Sizilien.

145
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,208
Yeah, good point.
Alright, magicians.

146
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,708
Keep watch for demonoids,
but try to be careful.

147
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,250
[ALL]
Roger that!

148
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,416
[DEMONOIDS growling]

149
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,791
[LAWRENCE]
So, Master Zest sent you?

150
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,291
Yes. He asked me to
create an opportunity

151
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,750
for you to get away
from the fight.

152
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,083
[LAWRENCE] Man. We weren't
expecting that amount of power.

153
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,916
We lost too many of our pawns.

154
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,458
[SCHTROM]
They invade so valiantly

155
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,375
only to be driven back.

156
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,416
Then they retreat with their
tails between their legs

157
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,000
like the cowards they are.

158
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,875
Things may have fallen
into a lull since I

159
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:54,500
decimated the empire. But with
you around, Shin Wolford,

160
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,625
I might just be able to
keep myself entertained

161
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,875
for a little while longer.

162
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,083
[SOLDIER G gasps]
They can fly?

163
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,333
[SOLDIER H]
Demonoids!

164
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:16,166
At ease. We're allies.

[SOLDIERS sigh]

166
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,750
How is it? Crowded?

167
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,250
[SOLDIER G] Lady Sizilien's
tending to the

168
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,875
injured people inside.

169
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,125
[SOLDIER H]
But, well...

170
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,541

[MARK gasps]

173
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,166
You guys! You're back!

174
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,791
[AUGUST] Bean, what was
it like over here?

175
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,041
[MARK]
Olivia and I fought them off.

176
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,125
[SHIN]
And Sizilien?

177
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,875
She's tending to people
further inside.

178
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,125
Okay.

179
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,541
Even with us,
we're shorthanded.

180
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,916
Call the others in so they can
help heal. Go find Klode.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,416
Got it.

182
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,000
[SIZILIEN gasps]

183
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,250
[HUSBAND A coughs]

184
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,708
What do you think we
should do, Lady Sizilien?

185
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,958
Will he survive?

186
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,500
[SIZILIEN sobs]

187
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,541
[SIZILIEN]
I'm sorry. I did all I could.

188
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,416
But I can't save him.

189
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
That can't be true!

190
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,458
[SIZILIEN] Healing magic
doesn't cure everything.

191
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:33,541
[WIFE A sobs]

192
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,875
What are you doing, miss?

193
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,583
[WIFE A]
I don't understand this at all!

194
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,875
This robe's special!

195
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,083
It's got auto-healing
magic on it!

196
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,791
Maybe it'll help him--!

197
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,708
[SHIN]
No, stop!

198
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,291
[SIZILIEN]
Shin?

199
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,916
[SHIN] Even if it has been
imbued with magic,

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,958
it won't heal these wounds.

201
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:05,291
[SIZILIEN] Are you sure?
Does that mean he's going to...?

202
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:09,416
Don't worry. I can
handle it myself.

203
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,791
[SHIN]
It's a miracle he's alive.

204
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:21,125
Sizilien's healing magic was
enough to keep him holding on.

205
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,708
[SHIN exhales]

206
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,583
[SHIN]
Don't treat it all at once.

207
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,250
Focus on healing
each area by turns.

208
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,333
[SIZILIEN gasps]

209
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,791
[AUGUST]
Shin, just how powerful are you?

210
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,083
I can't even compare to this.

211
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,958
[HUSBAND A sighs softly]

212
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,083
[SHIN sighs]
His breathing is stable now.

213
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,625
It looks like he'll make it.

214
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,708
Oh, good, I can't thank
you enough! Really!

215
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,250
From the bottom of my heart.

216
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,416
I'm so grateful that
you saved my husband!

217
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,958
[SHIN]
Hey, what's up?

218
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,916
[SIZILIEN]
You truly are incredible, Shin.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,333
I could never be capable
of the great things you do.

220
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,833
[SHIN]
Hey, that's not true.

221
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:18,041
I lean on you all the time.
You're always helping me.

222
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't do anything.
I'm pathetic and useless.

223
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,500
[SHIN] Please don't say that.
I may have helped,

224
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,625
but you're the reason
that man is still alive.

225
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,583
And you healed so many
other people's injuries, too.

226
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,583
But, I--!

227
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,708
See? Look.

228
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,375
[SIZILIEN gasps]

229
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,125
Thank you very much, ma'am!

230
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,750
We truly appreciate
the work you've done.

231
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,125
Miss. These are all the
people you've rescued.

232
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,375
[SIZILIEN gasps]

233
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,458
They're alive and
well because of you.

234
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,916
So give yourself some credit.
You're a wonderful girl.

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,791
[SIZILIEN gasps]

236
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,791
You're a saint, milady.

237
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:54,833
I agree.

238
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,583
[INJURED chatter]

239
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,291
Huh?

240
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,916
[SHIN chuckles]

241
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,750
[AUGUST] King Sweed. There are
a number of matters regarding

242
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,500
this demonoid attack that are
of serious concern to me.

243
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,833
One of them is that the demons
that appeared during the

244
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,625
imperial invasion were
not present for this fight.

245
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,583
[MALE MINISTER A]
Yes, that's true.

246
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,416
[AUGUST] I'm also left with some
questions about their leader.

247
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,166
Oliver Schtrom.

248
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,000
Questions? Such as what?

249
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,583
Well, since he's already
overthrown the empire,

250
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:52,666
what's his plan now?
Why did he send troops here?

251
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,541
At first I thought this might
be some kind of diversion.

252
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,458
but we haven't heard of
anything happening elsewhere.

253
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,208
[KING SWEED]
Hm...

254
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,666
[AUGUST]
During a previous battle,

255
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,375
Shin fought him directly and
managed to drive him away.

256
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,000
Perhaps Schtrom sees
him as a threat.

257
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,166
It's safe to assume he
predicted that Earlsheid,

258
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,458
and therefore Shin,

259
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,333
would intervene during
this incident, as well.

260
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,500
[FEMALE SECRETARY A]
You mean...?

261
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,250
Honestly. I can't
guess his intentions.

262
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,958
It could be internal conflict
among the demonoids.

263
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,500
If that's even a possibility,

264
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,083
we mustn't allow our
vigilance to waver.

265
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,750
Absolutely.

266
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,666
King Sweed.
In light of all this,

267
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,750
I would like the nations
to form an alliance.

268
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,333
Do I have your support?

269
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,833
[BOTH gasp]

270
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,208
Alliance, you say? You plan
to establish a united front

271
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,583
that would include your
own Kingdom of Earlsheid?

272
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,291
Yes.

273
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,750
[SHIN]
Huh?

274
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,083
[KING SWEED] Indeed,
this problem is too severe

275
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,458
to be shouldered
by just one entity.

276
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:55,208
Very well, we shall
discuss it further.

277
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,375
[AUGUST]
Thank you so much.

278
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,500
[SHIN gasps]

279
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,750
[AUGUST] I hope to hold a summit
in the coming days for all the

280
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,208
involved kingdoms. I'll be in
contact shortly afterward.

281
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,208
[KING SWEED]
Good. I shall be waiting.

282
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,833
[SHIN]
An alliance with other nations?

283
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,458
You've really put some
thought into this, huh?

284
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,583
What do you mean by that?

285
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,333
[SHIN] Aug, there's something
that I've been regretting.

286
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,000
[AUGUST]
Hm?

287
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,416
If we had come here
by way of a gate,

288
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,083
I feel like there might not have
been as many casualties, and...

289
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,250
Maybe, but still...
You couldn't make a gate.

290
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,083
You've never been here.

291
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,625
[SHIN]
True. That's why I have to ask.

292
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,333
[AUGUST]
How about that?

293
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,958
I was just about to ask you
to do something, as well.

294
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,333
[BOTH]
Let's save the world together!

295
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,000
[AUGUST] Can we count
on you guys to help ?

296
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,833
[ALL]
Sure!

297
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,000
[SHIN]
Huh?

298
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,041
His Highness and the
others are back!

299
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,416
Congratulations on
routing the demonoids!

300
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,708
[CROWD cheers]

301
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,458
I guess the word's already
gotten around back home.

302
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,416
[SHIN]
That goofy name still haunts me!

303
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,458
[SIZILIEN] Don't worry,
I think it's a great name!

304
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,208
Might as well leave him alone,
Klode. He'll get used to it.

305
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,083
There you are,
August, my darling!

306
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,166
You had me so worried!

307
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,750
Ellie. May. This is no place
for the two of you to be!

308
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,041
[DISEUM] It's all right.
I gave them permission.

309
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,750
[AUGUST]
Father!

310
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,958
[SHIN]
Grandpa, and Granny!

311
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,333
I say. You've done well.

312
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,291
I'm so proud of you kids.
Your training paid off.

313
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,916
[ALL]
Right!

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,375
May, what seems to be the
matter with your face, dear?

315
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,833
[MAY] Ellie's boobies could
crush all the demonoids

316
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,166
in the world!

317
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,208
[chuckles]

318
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,666
I agree.
They're quite impressive.

319
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,416
Let's rip 'em off!

320
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,458
Good thinking.

321
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,791
Let's not resort
to violence, please!

322
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:01,291
Never mind all that. Father.
I have a report from the attack.

323
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,083
Ah, yes. You're all business,
as per usual.

324
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,333
[DISEUM] I see. So King Sweed
is receptive to the idea.

325
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,375
[AUGUST] Yes. So, what I
need from you now,

326
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,291
is permission to be
your negotiator.

327
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,458
I'm not only a prince, but one
of the Ultimate Magicians, too.

328
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,166
I should have my
hand in this deal.

329
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,333
[DISEUM] That is true.
Do our kingdom proud, August.

330
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,791
[AUGUST] As you wish, sir.
I promise you,

331
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,708
I will reach a
successful agreement

332
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,166
with the other nations.

333
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,125
[SHIN]
Grandpa. Granny.

334
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,958
Yes, we know, my boy.
You have a responsibility

335
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,208
to accompany the
prince on this journey.

336
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,750
Protect the world and be safe.

337
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,416
[SHIN]
Thank you!

338
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,666
In that case...

339
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,958
...we'll be joining you
on this trip, as well.

340
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,208
Yep!

341
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,958
Don't be absurd! You act
like it's a vacation!

342
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,583
Aw, what's the harm, Aug?
This is sure to be a

343
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,875
long excursion, so I
say let them come.

344
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,666
You can't neglect your fiancée
and little sister again.

345
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,583
Yes, but...

346
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,208
[THOR] Don't worry. We'll be
sure to look after them.

347
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,916
They'll be safer with us.

348
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,458
We're stronger than any
guards here in Earlsheid.

349
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,125
[AUGUST]
Oh, good grief.

350
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,166
Well, that's that.

351
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,666
Now, Ultimate Magicians,
let's get going!

352
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,125
[MIRIA, ZEST gasp]

353
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,291
[SCHTROM] Well, you created
quite the spectacle.

354
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,291
I warned you when all
this began, did I not?

355
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,166
I made it clear the
wisest choice would be

356
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,416
to leave Shin Wolford alone.

357
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,458
Our actions have been most
regrettable, Master Schtrom.

358
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,333
[SCHTROM] No. In fact,
I enjoyed it very much.

359
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,208
Although, if you were
going to challenge him,

360
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:47,000
I would've preferred that you
had gone at it more intensely.

361
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,375
[ALL gasp nervously]

362
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,083
[SCHTROM chuckles]

363
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,125
[ZEST]
That Shin Wolford.

364
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,750
I wonder, is it better for us
to be grateful to that boy

365
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,541
for supplying our master
with a new purpose?

366
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,250
Or, should we be
infuriated instead?

367
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,666
Either way,
his immeasurable power

368
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,875
is something that we
simply cannot ignore.

369
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,750
[SCHTROM]
By the way, Miria.

370
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,625
How is the other
matter progressing?

371
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,791
[MIRIA gasps]
Well, sir, it's uncertain.

372
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,333
We'll need to wait a bit
longer for verification.

373
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,958
That's understandable.

374
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,875
I'll be awaiting your
next report, then.

375
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:22,833
[LAWRENCE]
Hm?

376
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,541
[ZEST]
Yes. After all,

377
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:28,333
the results of that endeavor
will determine our future.

378
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,416
It's up to you, son.

379
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,250
You can count on us.

380
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,666
Careful out there, Shin.

381
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,541
And try not to offend
any royal officials.

382
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,666
Yeah, I know. I'll do my best.

383
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,333
[AUGUST]
Shin.

384
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,875
[SHIN]
Uh! Right.

385
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,250
[ALL]
It's time to go!

386
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,125
[CROWD cheers]

387
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,166
[MELIDA, MERLIN gasp]

388
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,583
You know something, August?
You seem to be much happier

389
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,625
ever since you and
Shin became friends.

390
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,791
Huh?

391
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,791
Ellie, you're still
worried about that?

392
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,583
No, I'm not worried.
I've known from the start

393
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,125
he only had eyes
for Sizilien,

394
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,291
so I didn't think he would
make advances on you.

395
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,625
[SHIN]
Huh?

396
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,583
That's good, I guess.
But why make such a fuss?

397
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,083
I'm just jealous that
you're always spending

398
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,500
so much time with
him, that's all.

399
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,958
I thought I'd see if
I could shake up

400
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,416
your relationship a little
bit. I'm sorry about that.

401
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
[AUGUST]

402
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,458
[chuckles]

403
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,000
[SIZILIEN gasps]
That true, Shin?

404
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,333
[SHIN]
Uh.

405
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,333
[SIZILIEN giggles]

406
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,375
[SHIN]
Okay, let's do this!

407
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,041
[ALL]
Yeah!

408
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,875
[MERLIN]
Well, I guess he's off.

409
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,416
[MELIDA] Now that all the
hustle and bustle is over with,

410
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,958
I'm suddenly feeling
unusually relaxed.

411
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,666
[MERLIN]
So am I. You know Melida,

412
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,166
it just occurred to me that
this is the first time you and I

413
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,166
have been alone together
in quite a while.

414
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,666
Don't talk like that.
It's off-putting.

415
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,125
[MERLIN]
Off-putting?

416
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:03,416
You're right, though.
I didn't realize it until now.

417
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,250
[MERLIN coughs]

418
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,916
[MELIDA sighs]

419
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,333
[MARIA] For crying out loud,
you just had to get sidetracked!

420
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,208
I can't believe you didn't
arrange somewhere for us

421
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,583
to stay the night, genius!

422
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,375
[SHIN] What choice did we have?
There are 14 of us!

423
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,208
[MAY] I still say we
should've camped out.

424
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,208
[ELISABET] I'll be doing
nothing of the sort!

425
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,291
[AUGUST] No reason to push
ourselves on the first day.

426
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,958
[LYN sighs] I wanted
to see the temple.

427
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,333
[ALICE]
What a fun trip.

428
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,916
I'm still thinking about that
great pizza we had!

429
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,041
[OLIVIA] Yeah, the food was
better than I expected...

430
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,208
[SIZILIEN]
Um. Hello, Grandfather Merlin

431
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,125
and Grandmother Melida.
We're sorry it's so late.

432
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,291
[MERLIN laughs]

433
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:48,083
By the way... Can we stay here?

434
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:53,125
--[MELIDA growls]
--[GROUP chatters

435
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,375
[MELIDA] All of you, pipe down!
You're too noisy!

436
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,208

Yes, ma'am!
