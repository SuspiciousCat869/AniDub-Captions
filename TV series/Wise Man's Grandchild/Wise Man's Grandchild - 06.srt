Well, they're also bullies

158
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,500
Yeah, same here.

159
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,916
[SHIN]
I forgot.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,416
Tony and Julius both come
from families of knights.

161
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,833
If you were to make
a good magician

162
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,750
fight a tough knight in
a battlefield scenario,

163
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,166
it's obvious the
magician would win!

164
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,166
And yet those knights have it
in their meaty little heads

165
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,208
that they're the
stronger ones!

166
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,583
[SHIN]
Whoa there.

167
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,458
Everyone has their strengths
and weaknesses, right?

168
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,750
We have the brains, they have
the brawn. That's okay.

169
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,166
Yeah, except for
maybe you, that is.

170
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,291
You can use both
magic and a sword.

171
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,583
[SHIN] I guess I
mostly meant you guys.

172
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,500
I was wondering. How'd you
get your combat skills.

173
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,416
Were you trained by a knight?

174
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,958
Yeah. It was
Grandpa's friend, Michel,

175
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,666
and he was a pretty strict
instructor to be honest.

176
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,500
Uh. What's the deal?

177
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,458
I don't understand, did I
say something weird again?

178
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,125
When you say Michel,

179
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,083
would you be talking
about Michel Colling?

180
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,583
Yeah, I guess you've
heard of him?

181
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,625
Of course we've heard
of Sir Colling!

182
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,958
He's the former Knight
Commander of the Order!

183
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,166
Right, I remember him mentioning
something along those lines.

184
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,833
So not only were you taught
magic by the Wise Man,

185
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,375
you were taught how to enchant
magic gear by the Guru!

186
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,541
And on top of that...

187
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,750
...ou were taught combat
by the Swordsaint?

188
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,666
[squeals]

189
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,083
He's called the swordsaint?

190
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,958
[THOR] You didn't know?
Michel Colling's a legend.

191
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,208
He wasn't Knight
Commander for nothing.

192
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,291
He's the greatest swordsman
in the kingdom.

193
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,875
So yeah, people call
him the Swordsaint.

194
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,125
[SHIN] To me, he was just
a harsh drill instructor.

195
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,666
Wow. So if you were taught
how to fight by the Swordsaint,

196
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,375
then the students from
the Knight Institute

197
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,791
can't talk crap about you,
now can they!

198
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,583
Oh, sure they can,
were they so inclined.

199
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,125
"What right has a bean sprout
to study under the swordsaint?"

200
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,166
They might say
if they're jealous.

201
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,625
[SHIN]
Then don't tell them!

202
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,083
Well anyway, I for one
think both of our schools

203
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,583
could really benefit from
a little joint training.

204
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,875
We have the same
objective here, don't we?

205
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,541
That's what matters!
Forget the sprout thing!

206
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,375
[MARIA, ALICE]
Hmph! We'll never forget!

207
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:46,291
[SHIN] Okay... This is
definitely gonna be a problem.

208
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,333
[SHIN] So they're putting
us in teams of eight,

209
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,500
with four students
from each school.

210
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,500
And we'll be
slaying demons, right?

211
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,458
It'll serve as combat
training for us,

212
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,500
and it culls the demons.

213
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm a little bit apprehensive
about taking on demons,

214
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,250
but it's reassuring to know
that I'll be with you.

215
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,541
[SHIN]
Don't rest too easy.

216
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,750
This is training,
so you need to step up.

217
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,875
Oh! I'll do my best.

218
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,166
[KREIS] So that's the
hero's grandson, eh?

219
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,041
He's still just
another magician.

220
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,041
Looks like a sprout
to me. A bean sprout.

221
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,833
I'm just hoping that he won't
slow us down too much.

222
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,250
[MARIA groans]
See?

223
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,958
They're clearly a
bunch of jerks.

224
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,750
[SHIN chuckles]

225
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,625
We're all first-years
at the Knight Institute.

226
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,666
The name's Kreis Lloyd.
I'm top seat.

227
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,166
I'm second seat,
Miranda Wallace.

228
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,916
My name is Neun Curtis.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,416
Kent McGregor. Don't forget it.

230
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,166
[SHIN] Of course we got paired
with the group from before.

231
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,500
Hey, before we start,
can I ask you something?

232
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,666
[KREIS]
What?

233
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,375
Tell me. Have any of
you fought a demon?

234
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,333
I see. You're just asking
that so you can brag about

235
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,375
the demonoid
you defeated, right?

236
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,208
That's not it, I promise!

237
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,916
Look, we might be in for
some serious combat.

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,708
We need to forget our
prejudices against knights,

239
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,916
and you need to do the
same thing with magicians.

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,875
Oh yeah, and what if we don't?

241
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,125
[SHIN]
You'll die.

242
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,375
[KNIGHTS gasp]

243
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,041
Hey! Shut up, Sprout!

244
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,333
The fact is that us knights
in training can put these

245
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,375
demons down without your help!

246
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,583
Miranda's right,
you aren't needed here.

247
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,541
Just stay out of our way and do
your best not to slow us down,

248
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,291
all right?

249
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,291
[AUGUST]
You're joking.

250
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,375
Is that truly how you view
this training exercise?

251
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,041
[KREIS] Oh, no! Forgive me,
Your Highness. I misspoke.

252
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,250
I didn't mean that <i>you</i>
would slow us down.

253
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,416
I don't care what
you think of me.

254
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,791
What matters is that you
learn to work with my peers.

255
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,833
It's the whole purpose
of this exercise.

256
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,583
Yeah. I know that, but...

257
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,666
You understand the goal
but don't think it has merit.

258
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,708
There's no choice then.

259
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,291
Shin. Let them fight
on their own.

260
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,250
Don't step in until
things get dire.

261
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,708
[SHIN]
Huh?

262
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,625
It's settled.
Try to defeat a demon

263
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,791
without a magician's backup.

264
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,875
You'll learn this
training's value.

265
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,541
[KREIS grunts]

266
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,833
We'll do as you say,
Your Highness.

267
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,583
[KNIGHTS exhale]

268
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,041
[MARIA]
Hmph!

269
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,750
[SHIN] They've taken us
pretty deep into the forest.

270
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,333
We're S-class students, so I
think the teachers sent us

271
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,458
somewhere more dangerous
because of it.

272
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,250
So there's a decent chance
that we'll run into

273
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,333
some powerful demons,
is that right?

274
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,000
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I thought that every team

275
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,458
was to be escorted
by an advisor.

276
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,916
[SIEG]
Yo, Shin!

277
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,375
Wait, is that Sieg and Chris?

278
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,458
[CHRISTINA]
Hey little brother,

279
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,958
we look forward to
working with you.

280
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,625
Are the two of you gonna
be our advisors today?

281
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,166
[SIEG, CHRISTINA]
Hm.

282
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,541
[SHIN]
It's really good to see you,

283
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,458
but could you do me a favor
and not fight for once?

284
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,958
[CHRISTINA] He's the one
to ask, he always starts it.

285
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,458
I literally just asked
you guys not to do this!

286
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,041
Excuse me, but my name's Maria

287
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,625
and I'm one of
Shin's classmates.

288
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm really sorry
for interrupting,

289
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,208
but could I please shake
your hand, Lord Siegfried?

290
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:09,083
Well. If you're doing it--
Hi. Could we shake hands too?

291
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,041
Hi! My name's Kreis Lloyd!

292
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,208
Would you grace me
with a handshake?

293
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,666
It's an honor to meet you!

294
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,416
My name is Neun, and I hope
I can impress you today!

295
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,875
[KENT]
Hey! I'm Kent!

296
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,750
What is this?

297
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,666
It's normal. The two
of them are quite

298
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,541
popular at both our
school and the knights'.

299
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,791
[SHIN]
Huh?

300
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,875
Makes sense. They are
the knight and magician

301
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,750
entrusted with my
father's safety, after all.

302
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,625
[SHIN]
You have a point.

303
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,083
Big brother Sieg has always
been the debonair type,

304
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,166
so I get that he's popular.

305
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,375
But big sister Chris?
That's a surprise.

306
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,500
And why's it a surprise
that I'm popular?

307
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,958
Wait. You want us to let
the knights in training

308
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,958
fight the demons by
themselves at first?

309
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,791
Yes. By their request.

310
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,166
They won't understand the
importance of this training

311
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,041
through words alone.

312
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,583
[CHRISTINA] It's not rare.
Lots of newly enlisted knights

313
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,500
and magicians take
that attitude.

314
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,041
[SIEG] They learn how
to fight on their own

315
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,958
and take that to mean
they don't need help.

316
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,500
[CHRISTINA] Once they've
seen real combat,

317
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,291
they'll realize their mistake.
I think it might work.

318
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,666
It was smart of you to agree to
their request, Your Highness.

319
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,041
So now let's see how
it all plays out.

320
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,416
If they get knocked down a peg
while they're still in school,

321
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,833
it could save their comrades
a lot of trouble down the road.

322
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,083
I'm glad the four of you
are above that stuff.

323
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,625
Though some of us
are a little more

324
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,541
partisan about it than others.

325
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,833
[MARIA] Huh? Wait.
What're you getting at?

326
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,791
Oh. Just that you're not
fond of their school.

327
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,250
Not that you don't understand
the point of the exercise.

328
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,291
Good, because I really do.
I've watched Shin face off

329
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,250
against a demonoid
two times now.

330
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,750
I can't fight anywhere
near the level he did.

331
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,625
So unless I get way stronger,
I've got no chance of defeating

332
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,041
a powerful opponent without a
knight or swordsman helping me.

333
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,166
It was Maria. That right?

334
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,666
Um... yes.

335
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,208
It's admirable that you're able
to recognize your current

336
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,416
capabilities and limitations.

337
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,583
I'm certain that
you'll get stronger.

338

[MIRANDA] Why's Lord Siegfried
talking to her like that?

00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,166
Why isn't is me?

342
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,625
[SHIN] Why are those four
so on their guard right now?

343
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,625
My Search Magic isn't
picking up anything nearby.

344
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,083
It isn't that they
sense something,

345
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,375
they're just feeling tense.

346
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,083
I can't really
fault them, though.

347
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,000
It's their first time
hunting demons, after all.

I feel it. Kay.

what the top performers at

00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,041
[CHRISTINA]
That was a poor showing.

369
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,833
This demon was a weaker one,

370
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,291
even by the standard of
others around its size.

371
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,625
Yet it had you soundly beat.

372
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,208
You boast that you're
the best of the

but you're still students.

You know nothing of battle.

375
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,458
All four of you are weak.
You must take that fact to heart

376
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,166
and try to learn
from this exercise.

377

Right.

Oh. You're hurt. I'll perform

To think that you'd
show us such kindness

after we looked down on you.

Don't worry about it,

Yes you are. If you really
want them to stop.

Then step up and say,
"Sizilien's my woman."

00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,083
[SIZILIEN]
Right! Yes! What he said.

468
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,208
W-We haven't yet.

469
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,208
Yet?

470
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,916
[SIZILIEN, SHIN gasp]

471
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,666
[BOTH chuckle]

472
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:07,916
Judging by their reaction...

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,166
Yeah. It's true!

474
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,041
[SIEG] Shin was trying to
expose the knights' foolishness.

475
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,416
But it seems he ended up
exposing something else too.

476
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,416
[SHIN, SIZILIEN sigh]
