[KREIS]
It's fine. Stand firm.

Let's do this. You ready?

6
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,791

Yeah.

[ALL grunt]

12
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,583
[SIZILIEN] Well done, everyone!
Was anyone injured at all?

13
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,958
Just a few scratches.

14
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,458
Yeah, nothing bad.

15
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,958
[SIZILIEN] Then it's nothing
my spells can't heal.

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,666
The kids are starting
to shape up.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,916
I agree. Now that the knights
get how useful magic is,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,250
we're actually seeing teamwork.

19
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,416
Your team is strong.
Much like you.

20
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,958
What's the secret to
their improvement?

21
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,958
They're already at the
same level as some of our

22
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,583
best court magicians.
Maybe even better than that.

23
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,083
My classmates and I formed a
new study group at the academy,

24
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,416
and the three of them
are all members.

25
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,125
Are you doing some kind
of special training?

26
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,958
[SHIN] No, not really.
We've just been practicing magic

27
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,375
in the same way I
learned from Grandpa.

28
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,041
Is there really nothing else?
You're sure?

29
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:15,500
Well, uh. I did teach them how
I visualize magic as I use it.

30
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,250
[SIEGFRIED] That's it,
the way you visualize magic!

31
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,208
So, they're basically
learning magic

32
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,875
in the same way
you did, right?

33
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,333
You've taught them the basics of
Merlin's teachings. Amazing!

34
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,416
[SHIN]
I don't know.

35
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,958
Grandpa taught me
how to use magic,

36
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,333
but I don't visualize it
quite it like he does.

37
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,666
That's meant to be
unique for everyone.

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,041
Could you tell me what
you told your classmates?

39
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,666
I have room for improvement.

40
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,166
Yeah. I don't see why not.

41
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,916
[SIEGFRIED]
Hm!

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,833
[AUGUST]
Hold on, Shin.

43
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,375
Sorry Siegfried, but my
father made a promise.

44
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,125
The Kingdom isn't to
militarize Shin's power.

45
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,333
And you're a soldier, so that
may well cross the line.

46
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,583
[SIEGFRIED]
You're right.

47
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,833
We're pushing it
as things are now.

48
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,416
If this kind of power
spreads to more countries,

49
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,666
forget about demons.

50
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,750
Humans'll destroy the
world themselves.

51
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,500
The stakes are
actually that high?

52
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:06,666
[AUGUST groans] How have
you not realized that yet?

53
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,625
[SHIN] I dunno. Is what
I'm doing really a problem?

54
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,250
No. I wouldn't say that.

55
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,166
With the massive
outbreak of demonoids,

56
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,916
we're in a state of emergency.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,458
I've told the members
of our study group

58
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,250
to keep the secret of their
new powers to themselves.

59
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,916
I don't care if we're
monopolizing it.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,291
So, if you don't mind, I'd like
you to keep it a secret too.

61
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,625
Fine. I get it.

62
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,000
Fair enough, but could you just
tell me how you practice?

63
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,583
To be honest,
it's terribly ordinary.

64
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,541
You sure you're interested?

65
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:46,791
Of course. For power like that?
Go ahead. What's the secret?

66
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,750
Just practice your
magic control.

67
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,791
It's like exercise.
Every day you do it,

68
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,416
you'll be able to manage a
little bit more. That's it.

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,541
Is that actually
all I have to do?

70
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,416
Course it is.
Do you think I'd lie?

71
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,541
Klode, would you and
Messina come here?

72
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,041
[GIRLS]
Hm?

73
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,416
[MARIA]
What do you need?

74
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,458
So Sieg can see, would you mind
making some magic barriers?

75
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,208
Like Shin had you do when
the study group started.

76
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,041
[SIZILIEN]
Sure.

77
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,083
[MARIA]
Yeah, why not?

78
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,708
[MARIA, SIZILIEN grunt]

79
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,666
Whoa. No way. How can
those barriers be so thick?

80
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,375
[KNIGHTS]
Hm?

81
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,791
Strange, right?

82
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,250
We never knew that basic
spells could be this strong.

83
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,291
But once Shin trained
us in magic control,

84
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,791
they got like this.

85
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,666
Our barriers are
still pretty thin.

86
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,416
Compared to one
of Shin's, at least.

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,708
Wait, do you really
call that thin?

88
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,083
We still have a
whole lot to learn,

89
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,208
my technique's
pretty shoddy.

90
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,125
[SIEGFRIED]
No.

91
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,291
You should have more
faith in yourself.

92
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,625
In my eyes your magic technique
is incredible, Maria.

93
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,291
Anyway, I'll try your
training method too.

94
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,166
The exercise is over.
Head for the rendezvous point.

95
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,958

Right!

96

Thanks, Shin.

97
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,208
It's because of you that
we beat that demon bear.

98
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,708
[SHIN chuckles]

99
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,958
I see why magicians and fighters
should work together now.

100
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,083
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

101
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,416
That makes me wonder.
How'd the other teams do?

Oh yeah.

he was outdone by you.

00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,083
They're so disgusting.

160
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,250
[MALE KNIGHT STUDENT D]
Stupid mutt!

161
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,208
[ALICE growls]

162
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,916
What do you take me for?!

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,416
[GIRLS groan]

164
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,833
[MALE KNIGHT STUDENTS shouting]

165
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,250
[MALE KNIGHT STUDENTS gasp]

166
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,833
[ALICE]
That's it!

167
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,791
Just get out of
our way, you jerks!

168
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,625
[YURI] I think you boys
need to cool down.

169
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:49,375
[LYN gasps] I don't think
I can control all of this.

170
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,875
[THOR]
Get back! Run!

171
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,708
[ALL yell]

172
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,875
[SHIN] It looks like
the rest of our class

173
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,458
managed to get some
teamwork going.

174
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,250
So what exactly happened
with your team?

175
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,458
Well, we flexed our powers a
little more than we meant to

176
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,000
and there were side-effects.

177
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,041
The guys from the
Knight Military Institute

178
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,125
started it, okay?

179
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,708
Although we did
get carried away.

180
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,791
What's that guy's deal?

181
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,625
[MARK]
Just your typical teenage drama.

182
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,416
[SHIN]
Huh?

183
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,416
So uh, we beat our demons,

184
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
but it wasn't really
through teamwork.

185
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,208
Did the demon hunt go
well for your team, Wolford?

186
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,958
Yeah, it went okay.

187
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,916
Shin and Sizilien
spent the whole time

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,416
cozying up to each other.

189
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,875
Huh?

190
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,500
I don't know what you mean,
we didn't cozy up at all!

191
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,750
If you didn't think
that was cozying up,

192
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,000
then I can't imagine what
would actually count to you.

193
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,416
It must be steamy.

194
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,750
[SHIN]
Dude, shut up!

195
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,708
Putting all jokes aside though,

196
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,166
I'd say that our joint
training went pretty well.

197
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,708
The Knights in training
certainly learned a lot.

198
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,708
And on top of that, Shin gave
us time to help for once.

199
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,458
[SHIN]
Wait. "For once"?

200
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,083
[SHIN]
Huh. I guess he's right.

201
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,375
[ALICE]
Hey. You doin' okay, Shin?

202
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,125
[MARIA] I think he feels
responsible for what's

203
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,541
happened to everyone
in the study group.

204
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,583
[YURI]
Responsible?

205
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,833
[TONY]
How so?

206
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,541
Well, here goes...
You should know something.

207
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,583
Once we graduate
from the academy,

208
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,875
all of us in the Ultimate Magic
Study group, aside from Shin,

209
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,666
will be placed under the
Kingdom's supervision.

210
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,791
Chances are, we'll be
turned into a special unit,

211
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,208
led by me personally.

212
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,583
[SHIN]
I'm really sorry.

213
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,583
I didn't realize I'd be
upending all of your lives.

214
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,083
But it isn't like that, Shin!

215
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,083
Huh?

216
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,000
All our futures
are secure now!

217
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,250
[LYN]
Agreed!

218
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,500
[MARK] We're gonna be
the best of the best!

219
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,958
[YURI] My parents'll be
so proud when they hear!

220
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,375
Hold on. You're all
happy about this?

221
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,375
[AUGUST chuckles] Provided that
none of us abuse it,

222
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,500
this power you taught us may
well end up saving the world.

223
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,083
Right.

224
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,166
If you ask me, Shin, you're the
brightest hope this world has.

225
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,000
If we're gonna fight demonoids,

226
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,791
it would be nice if you
could teach us more.

227
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,416
[SHIN]
Yeah, I guess they're right.

228
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,750
For us to protect the
world from this crisis,

229
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,583
I'll need them all to
get even stronger.

230
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,500
[AUGUST]
Hey. We should be alright,

231
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,958
since I'll be here to keep
things under control.

232
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,083
But keep in mind
that we have limits.

233
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,791
Y'know, it's funny you
should say that.

234
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,708
I'm starting to think
you're a mind-reader, Aug.

235
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,125
[AUGUST]
Hm.

236
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,750
Oh, no. Not when
it comes to you.

237
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,250
You pretty much write your
thoughts all over your face.

238
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,458
[SHIN chuckles]
Am I that easy to read?

239
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,250
[OLIVIA shouts]

240
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,208
[ALICE shouts]

241
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:39,958
[YURI]
Lyn!

242
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,041
[LYN]
Got it!

243
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,125
[AUGUST] It's like a live-fire
Magic Division exercise.

244
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,250
We can't let anyone see this.

245
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,333
I've used this location to
practice for a long time.

246
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,291
It's far from any people.

247
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,583
[YURI]
You okay?

248
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,500
[AUGUST]
Hey, All of us need to talk.

249
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,166
[AUGUST] We have new
intel on the demonoids.

250
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,791
Earlsheid's civilians
aren't being told yet.

251
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,166
So you're just gonna
tell us a state secret?

252
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,583
Yeah, um, maybe you'd be better
off telling Shin in private,

253
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,958
Your Highness.

254
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,875
[AUGUST] I'm telling you all.
And for good reason.

255
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,583
You aren't just
civilians anymore.

256
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,458
When war breaks out
with the demons,

257
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,000
we'll be a key part of
Earlsheid's army.

258
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,625
Demons?

259
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,458
When you start
talking like that,

260
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,625
it really hits home that we're
different from most people now.

261
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,375
I guess you weren't kidding
about the special unit.

262
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,458
We need to learn a lot
more magic, and quickly.

263
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,791
[SHIN] So, what's this
new information?

264
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:43,250
It's the Empire. Demonoids are
rampaging across it unchecked.

265
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,000
The damage done to their towns
and cities has been disastrous.

266
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,083
Every last member of their
nobility has been killed.

267
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,375
As have most of their commoners.

268
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,541
We're talking about
demonoids here.

269
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,541
So stepping in is a huge risk.

270
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,833
If we're to stand
against them,

271
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,208
we'll need to form a
coalition of nations.

272
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,500
[BOYS grunt]

273
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,166
Countless people are suffering,

274
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,000
yet we have no choice
but to watch and wait?

275
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,541
That's right. And worse,

276
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,500
the demonoids' numbers
increase with each attack.

277
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,791
[ALL gasp]

278
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,958
[AUGUST]
It's crazy,

279
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,000
but they must be turning
civilians somehow.

280
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,041
Like what happened to Kurt.

281
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,416
[AUGUST]
Probably.

282
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
[SHIN]
Schtrom. What are you thinking?

283
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,666
Even a single demonoid
is enough of a threat

284
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,333
to rock a whole nation.

285
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,916
This calls for one thing.

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,583
[ALL]
A training camp?

287
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,833
Sounds great! I'm in! Let's go!

288
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,083
[SHIN] Summer break is
coming up soon, right?

289
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,375
[AUGUST] That's true.
We'll have lots of spare time.

290
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,291
Yeah. Right. But if we're
gonna take on demonoids,

291
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,666
we need to get stronger
as fast as we can.

292
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,791
We'll study spells from
dawn to dusk! I can't wait!

293
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,083
So, where should we
hold this camp?

294
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:55,000
[SHIN] Hm. I'd like to do the
magic exercises right here,

295
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,833
but we could sleep
somewhere else and come here

296
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,833
in the mornings by Gate.

297
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,541
[AUGUST] Let's stay on the
family land of someone here.

298
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,041
[SHIN]
Say what?

299
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,458
[AUGUST] Nobles tend to be
landowners, as a general rule.

300
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,208
My family owns a city
district full of craftsmen.

301
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,958
My family has a seaport.

302
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,333
But there aren't any good
places to stay there.

303
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,166
My family owns a nice
little resort town.

304
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,250
[SHIN]
Never would've guessed that one.

305
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,375
Sounds nice. Why don't
we stay out there?

306
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,166
Sounds too luxurious.

307
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,208
We would risk looking apathetic
about the demon scare.

308
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,833
Yes, I think His
Highness is right.

309
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:29,250
[MARIA] Ah! Sizilien's place
might be a nice compromise.

310
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,583
[SIZILIEN]
Hm?

311
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,500
Ya see, her family owns a
town with a hot spring.

312
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,875
[SHIN]
Can we use it?

313
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,958
Yeah. If that's okay
with everyone.

314
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,583
Sounds perfect to me.

315
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,916
Great!

316
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,750
[MELIDA]
A summer training camp?

317
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,500
Oh ho. Well with recent events,

318
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,791
I can see why you'd want
to train your classmates

319
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,000
all that you can.

320
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,458
So tell me, have you
found a supervisor yet?

321
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,625
[SHIN]
Supervisor?

322
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,208
As I expected.

323
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,583
You're planning to have boys and
girls who think they're adults

324
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,583
sleeping under the same
roof in this place!

325
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,708
I will not permit you
students to romp about

326
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,500
there unsupervised!

327
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,458
Kay. I get it.
Especially since Aug's royalty.

328
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,041
[MELIDA]
Yes indeed.

329
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,291
And I have to imagine that the
parents of the other study group

330
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,666
members will be
busy working.

331
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,750
I suppose I can make some time,
as a special favor to you.

332
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,875
[SHIN gasps]
You sure?

333
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,000
I can come too,
if you want me there.

334
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,166
[MELIDA]
Huh?

335
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,750
That would be great!

336
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,041
[MELIDA] Nothing good ever comes
from us taking our eyes off you.

337
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,458
Huh? C'mon, I've been way
more careful lately, at least.

338
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,208
[MELIDA]
Is that a fact?

339
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,083
Not even I can back you
up on that point, Shin.

340
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,958
Don't talk as though he didn't
learn his recklessness from you.

341
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:42,083
[MERLIN gasps, sobs]

342
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,833
[SHIN]
Hang in there, Grandpa.

[ROOSTER crows]

344
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,333
[ALL]
Good morning!

345
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,875
Hi, Master Wise Man!
And Mistress Guru!

346
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,625
Ah. Hello to you as well.

347
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,958
How's everyone doing?

348
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:57,208
[ALL] Great! Thanks a lot
for coming out with us.

349
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,500
[SHIN] We won't reach
the spring for two days.

350
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,083
Will the horses be
okay in this heat?

351
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,333
[AUGUST]
Of course.

352
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,791
They have enchanted harnesses,
they'll be fine.

353
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,416
[MARIA]
Those harnesses are great.

354
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
They're enchanted with
fatigue restoration,

355
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,875
physical enhancement,
and a few other things, too.

356
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,000
[SHIN]
Huh?

357
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,541
Please tell me that
you at least know

358
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,666
who it was that
first developed them.

359
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,416
Who?

360
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh boy.

361
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,208
It was your Grandmother,
Lady Melida.

362
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,291
[SHIN]
Huh?

363
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,625
Back in the day,

364
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,000
enchantments were mostly
just used for combat gear.

365
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,125
But Lady Melida saw their
potential in everyday living.

366
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,333
She made all kinds
of great things.

367
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,041
[AUGUST] The enchanted
items she came up with

368
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,708
improved countless lives.

369
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,541
And because of the
breadth of her influence,

370
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,208
we show our respect by
calling her the "Guru."

371
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,708
Huh...

372
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,708
Stop eying me like
some kind of freak show.

373
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,458
What? I was just thinking
of how amazing you are.

374
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,041
Eh, all that was
a long time ago.

375
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,375
And she didn't know how
to politely take a compliment

376
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,666
back then either.

377
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,833
[MELIDA grunts]

378
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,666
[SHIN]
It stands to reason.

379
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,708
[MELIDA] That's enough!
Leave me alone, both of you!

380
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,666
[gasps]
Hey. You sense that?

381
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,875
Yeah. It's a pack of demons.

382
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,875
They aren't that large,
but there're lots of them.

383
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:15,958
[WOLVES growling]

384
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,208
[COACHMEN gasp]

385
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,875
So, who should take them?

386
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,250
I can beat them easily!

387
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,875
You're not the only one.

388
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,958
I'd like to take
a crack at this.

389
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,500
[SHIN]
Guess we'd better draw straws.

390
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,708
Y'know, those are kind of
weird things to keep in your

391
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,125
other-dimensional storage.

392
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,500
I like to be prepared.

393
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,041
Eh...

00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,500

00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,750
Oh, cool. I won.

00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,750
Aw... I wanted to fight them.

398
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,333
[ALICE sneezes]

399
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,166
Piece of cake.

400
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,375
[SHIN] If you rein in your magic
power just a little more,

401
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,375
you'll be able to engage
it quicker next time.

402
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,500
Good to know.
I'll keep working at it.

403

The girl defeated
that many demons?

404
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,875
With a single spell.

405
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,541
Who are we driving?

406
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,333
Seems Shin's quite the teacher,
seeing how they've improved.

407
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,583
I can't believe we're doing
this to other people's children.

408
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,791
[LYN] You wouldn't say that if
you'd just went!

409
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,166
[MERLIN laughs]

the city of Klode!

whole town's a hot spring.

this is it. Hope you like it.

Welcome back, Miss Sizilien.

It's wonderful to see you.

[SIZILIEN]
Likewise, it's been too long!

Good evening, Prince August.

honor by visiting this place.

As for Miss Sizilien's peers,
all of you are most welcome.

00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,500
That goes especially for
our new hero, Shin Wolford.

that you and Miss Sizilien

We haven't even broached
that subject yet!

425

What do you guys want?

426
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,458
[AUGUST]
Nothing.

427
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,708
I'm sure we're all tired after
the long journey today.

428
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,416
Let's unwind for a bit.

429
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:21,208
[SHIN]
Ah... This is amazing. Wow.

430
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,500
Y'can't beat a soak
in a hot spring.

431
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,208
This water's given me new life.

432
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,875
I'd like to thank
all of you boys

433
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,083
for befriending my grandson.

434
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,875
Wait. What?

435
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,416
[MERLIN] For 15 years, he never
once had a friend his own age.

436
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,750
I wasn't sure he had the right
experience to fit in at school.

437
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,416
But, my fears were
proved unfounded.

438
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,916
Shin quickly found his way
into the hearts of many

439
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,333
fine young friends.

440
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:51,208
I thank each of you for
giving him that chance.

441
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,250
[AUGUST] With respect, Merlin,
you have it backwards.

442
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,416
I should be thanking you.

443
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,458
I'm the First Prince
of this kingdom.

444
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,458
No friend ever looked
at me as an equal.

445
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,458
They'd all pander to
my every stupid whim.

446
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,416
But Shin? He doesn't care
what I can do for him

447
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,166
once I become king.

448
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,208
In his eyes,
I'm nothing but a cousin.

449
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,166
Wow. Aug.

450
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,541
[MARK] We, like, just met.
But I'm glad we did.

451
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,291
You've done a lot
for me and Dad.

452
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,250
When we hang out, there's never
have a dull moment.

453
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,916
Thanks for the good times.

454
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,750
To be honest, A lot of
my peers in the nobility

455
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,000
tend to treat me
like I don't belong,

456
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,041
but Shin just treats me
like I'm one of the guys.

457
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,125
There's no trace of
judgement in his eyes.

458
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:39,291
I may prefer female company, but
as guys go, I like this group.

459
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,291
It is a good group. Grandpa?

460
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,291
Huh?

461
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,083
[SHIN]
I'm still grateful to you.

462
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,500
For raising me, and training me.

463
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,875
If it weren't for you, I don't
think I'd be who I am right now.

464
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,958
[SHIN] Because of who
you helped me to become,

465
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,250
I've made so many great friends.
So thanks again, Grandpa.

466
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,958
[MERLIN sobs]

467
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,041
[SHIN] Crap. I was trying
to make him happy.

468
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,958

Amazing! This bath is huge!

I'm so excited to jump in!

470
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,875
It feels so nice.

471
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,875
I can feel the day's
fatigue melting away.

472
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,541
[MELIDA sighs] It warms me
right down to my bones.

473
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,791
I'm so glad to hear
you're enjoying it!

474
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,958
Is something wrong?

475
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,375
Oh! Sorry.

476
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,375
To be honest, I was just
thinking you have a nice figure.

477
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,583
[MELIDA]
Hm?

478
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,041
What's your secret?
There must be something!

479
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,166
[MELIDA] Well, I do exercise
using the equipment

480
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,666
Shin made for me.

481
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,750
[MARIA]
Equipment?

482
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,041
It's a wide belt that
can move itself.

483
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,541
I've been making
an effort to run,

484
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,125
or at least walk on it every
single day of the week.

485
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,000
That sounds awesome, would you
mind letting me use it sometime?

486
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,000
I'd like to try it as well!

487
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,916
[MELIDA]
I don't mind if you don't.

488
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,208
But I feel compelled
to warn you.

489
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,875
There's a chance it'll
make your breasts shrink.

490
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,500
[ALICE, LYN gasp]

491
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,958
If you want to increase
your size,

492
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,833
then take it up with
your classmates.

493
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,541
She must know something.
Same goes for her.

494
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,250
Wow! These are really something!

495
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,583
That settles it. I want
a pair just like 'em!

496
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,458
They're firm and sensitive.

497
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,500
[GIRLS shouting]

498
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,833
[MARIA chuckles]

499
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,083
[MARIA] Thought'cha
could slip by, did you?

500
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,916
[BOTH groan]

501
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,291
[OLIVIA gasps]

502
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,833
[MARIA]
So why does exercising

503
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,083
too much make your
breasts smaller?

504
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,000
Let me remember
how Shin put it.

505
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,750
When you move around a lot,
you burn through fat.

506
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,958
And if you should run
low on fat to burn,

507
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,333
your body will resort to
using the fat in your breasts.

508
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,916
[ALICE sighs]

509
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,708
[MARIA] That's crazy. How did
Shin know something like that?

510
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,375
That boy's been going off to
do experiments on his own

511
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,875
since he was a child.

512
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,416
My best guess is that he found
out through one of those.

513
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,125
[MARIA]
I see.

514
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,375
Say. It dawned on me quite
recently that Shin grew up

515
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,375
with no one he could
call his friend.

516
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,916
So I wanted to tell you
girls how grateful I am

517
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,666
that he has all of you
to call his friends now.

518
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,250
Lady Melida, you're more
than welcome.

519
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,541
I don't think anybody could
be more grateful that Shin's

520
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,291
in my life than I am.

521
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,500
And the same more or less
goes for the rest of us.

522
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,375
Shin's an incredible guy!

523
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,875
Shin teaches us lots
of amazing magic!

524
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,875
We really have gained a
lot from his friendship.

525
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,625
We're super lucky.

526
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,875
Sure are!

527
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,833
You girls are so sweet.

528
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,541
Okay.

529
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,625
I'm sure Shin does what he can,
but if you're to learn quickly,

530
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,208
you'll need teachers
with experience!

531
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,500
[ALL]
Huh?

532
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,791
You're not talking about
you and Merlin, are you?

533
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,291
[YURI]
You're gonna teach us?

534
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:35,125
Yes. And in return, you'll work
harder than you ever have!

535
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,541
So get ready!

536
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,458
[GIRLS]
Right!

537
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:42,166
[GIRLS chatter]

538
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,916
[MELIDA chuckles]
This ought to be enjoyable.
