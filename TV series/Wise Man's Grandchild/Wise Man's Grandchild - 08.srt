00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,394
Careful, Thor.
You're looking a bit unsteady.

00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,312
Right.

3
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,563
Ah. Good form,

4
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,815
but I think you could stand
to push yourself further.

5
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,108
Yes sir.

00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,612
[MERLIN gasps]

That's too much power, Lyn!

8
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,156
[LYN]
Huh?

9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,241
[MERLIN]
You'll lose control!

00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,493

Oh. I guess I'd better stop.

Be careful!

At this rate, you'll mess up
all of our hair again!

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,754
[SHIN] Thanks to the
two of them helping out,

15
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,881
this camp is already
turning out a lot better

16
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,758
than I'd expected.

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,515
They're firing freely.
No chants required.

18
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,685
They'll put the Court Magic
Division right out of business.

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,936
[SHIN]
They're strong,

20
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,814
but they'll still have a rough
time against demonoids.

21
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,774
Yes. I think you're right.

22
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:10,237
My. This is horrible.
The whole world is in danger.

23
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,490
[SHIN] Demons run rampant over
what was once the Empire.

24
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,577
If we hope to stand up against
their overwhelming power,

25
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,621
then everyone at this
camp needs to get much stronger.

26
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,000
And yes, that's
including myself.

[MARIA]
Keep your guards up, everyone!

31
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,018
Make some magic barriers and
give 'em everything you've got!

32
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,062
[SHIN] Aw, I don't think
it'll hit you guys.

You don't think?!

She's right. Better safe
than slaughtered.

00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,903
We all know what Shin can do.

37
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,614
C'mon, I told you,
it'll be fine.

38
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,118
[SHIN] I just wanna
test out this idea.

39
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,372
Hydrogen, oxygen, and
something more volatile.

[GROUP gasps]

41
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,421
That looks super cool,
but what does it do?

42
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,839
[SHIN]
It's not done.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,882
This is the part
that really counts.

44
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,968
Hope I don't screw it up.

45
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,347
Kay! Let's brace for impact!

46
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,223
[SHIN]
Up to now,

47
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,017
the blast would spread out
as it got further away.

48
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,353
I need to set up a
single outlet point.

49
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,231
Contain it as it builds
for as long as I can...

50
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,984
...and then release it!

[ALL gasp]

Uh...?

00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,160
Almost forgot what
a monster he is.

54
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,245
I think that's my
strongest spell yet!

55
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,246
[MELIDA]
Idiot!

56
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,790
Why would you possibly
need that much force?!

57
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,668
[ALICE] Heh. Am I having
a weird dream right now?

58
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,794
[LYN]
This is real.

59
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,797
Yeah. I didn't realize the
spell would be that strong.

60
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,758
‐‐[MELIDA hisses]
‐‐Ah! I'm sorry!

61
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,177
It's strange.
Strong as that blast was,

62
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,804
I would've expected us
to feel more on our end.

63
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,097
Right. I don't think he

64
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,850
used much more firepower,
he just condensed it.

65
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,643
That seems accurate to me.

66
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,313
I've come a long way,
but up against that spell?

67
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,606
I would get destroyed.

68
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,108
True, but I'd never risk
letting that spell hit you.

69
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,401
Well then what was
all that about

00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,320
"I don't think it'll
hit you guys"?

71
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,988
Sounds pretty risky to me!

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,406

That'll be all for today.

I hate to trouble you, Shin,

introduce your friend,

I hoped I might get to meet
our Kingdom's new hero.

It's nice to meet you, too.

You care to tell me what
you're doing here, Ellie?

00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,188
[ELISABET]
Spending time with my betrothed!

106
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,858
Or so I thought, except
you left me and May behind

while you trounced
off to summer camp.

Do you plan to shame me too?

Uh! You're not turning
the tables this time!

How could you up
and leave me here?

00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,330
I heard that Melida the Guru

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,040
is one of the teachers
at that camp!

116
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,835
You know how much I like her,
but you left me behind anyway!

117
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,504
You didn't even talk to me
about it, how could you?!

118
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,505
Can't help it.

00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,341
You're much too fun to watch
when you get wound up like this.

You're so mean!

This isn't fair!

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,179
I want to see Lady Melida
way more than you do!

You mean Granny?

Oh, right! Um. Forgive my
rudeness, Master Shin!

I'm big brother August's
younger sister.

My name is May von Earlsheid.
Um, you see, I‐I'm...

00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,569
I'm a huge Lady Melida fan!

Oh. Cool.

Hi May, it's nice to meet you.

130

Aug and I pretty much act
as though we're family,

131
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,411
so feel free to think of me
in the same way.

132
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,831
[MAY] Uh? Then, can I
call you big brother?

133
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,500
Hm. Well it's better
than "Master Shin."

134
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,628
So, it's okay then?

135
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,837
[SHIN]
Mm‐hm.

I'll finally have a big brother
who isn't mean to me!

139

[SHIN laughs]

140
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,554
So, what can I do for you?

141
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,056
[MAY, ELISABET]
Hmm.

142
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,265
We've made a decision.

143
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,018
The two of us are going to join
you at this summer camp.

144
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,852
Right.

145
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,270
Don't be foolish!

146
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,023
It may be a camp,
but it's not for fun!

147
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,234
There's no way you'll get
permission to come with me!

148
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,363
I grant them my permission
to go with you.

149
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,280
Are you joking?

150
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,114
[ELISABET, MAY laugh]

151
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,325
I knew you'd come through
for us, Daddy!

152
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,035
The Klode Springs
are well‐protected,

153
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,163
as long as Master Merlin
and Lady Melida stay there.

154
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,998
These two should be fine.

155
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,209
Let the girls have some
fun at the Hot Springs.

156
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,169
Take Shin's gate
there for safety.

157
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,128
On a side note,

158
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,506
I've already gotten

[SHIN]
Ellie? May?

161
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,806
You can come across. It's safe.

162
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,516
[BOTH gasp]

163
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,685
[MAY] We were in the castle
just a moment ago!

164
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,144
How'd we move so fast?

165
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,396
[AUGUST]
I know you're excited

166
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,147
but try not to stray
from the group.

[MAY grumbles]

168
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,026
[SHIN]
Take my hand. Kay, sis?

169
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,529
Can't let ya get lost.
I'd be in big trouble.

170
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,905
[gasps] Okay!

171
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:13,576
May, do as Shin says.
Don't make any problems for him.

‐‐Also...
‐‐[ELISABET] Hm?

173
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,456
Like I told you, this camp
is for magic training.

174
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,376
And training is what I plan
to focus on while I'm there.

175
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,169
I don't intend to
get in the way.

176
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,422
Though, I may have to
take some measures

177
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,507
to ensure that you
stay free of pests.

178
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,050
Oh. Yeah, I get it.

179
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,720
You're talking about all our
female classmates, right?

180
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,972
Are ya worried that one
of 'em might make a move?

181
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:34,889
No.

182
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,516
The girls aren't a threat to me.

183
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,561
If you must know who it is that
I do not trust with my fiancé‐‐

00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,897
then check a mirror!
'Cause it's you!

[SHIN yells]

186
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,152
[ELISABET] You should hear
August at dinner. Really...

187
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,738
Every time he opens his mouth,
it's "Shin invented this,"

188
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,197
or "Shin saved the
kingdom from that."

189
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,824
You're all he talks about!

190
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,868
Can you blame me
for being suspicious?

191
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,286
[SHIN]
Wait, really?!

192
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,746
It's not what you
seem to be thinking.

193
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,581
That never even crossed
my mind 'til now,

194
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,957
and we've been in
a bath together.

195
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,960
[MAY] Oh! I'm thinking
about adult situations now!

196
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,047
Well, I was quite glad
that we became friends.

197
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,174
You're someone I can
be myself around.

198
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,468
[ELISABET growls]
What's that mean?!

199
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,553
Why don't you feel like you
can be yourself around me?!

200
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,888
Is it because of my temper?!

201
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,390
I'm myself with you, too.

202
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,642
When I'm with you,
I feel at peace.

203
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,852
[ELISABET gasps]

204
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,979
[AUGUST] But I'm getting
to horse around

205
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,355
with another guy for once.

206
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,025
It's a new experience,
so I got carried away.

207
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,944
But it doesn't replace
what we have.

208
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,029
Please understand, Ellie.

209
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,364
So, that's all that's going on?

210
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,367
Besides, Shin's already
found himself a woman.

211
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,869
You mean like a girlfriend?

212
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,954
[SHIN] Uh?! What the
heck are you saying?

213
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,623
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

214
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,916
But you know who you want.

215
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,417
[gasping]

216
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,505
Look, now's the time.
You need to make things clear.

217
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,256
What do I need to make clear?

218
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,383
Where it is that you two stand.

219
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,177
She's feeling
the same way you are.

220
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,888
Everything'll work out.
Just talk to her.

221
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,598
[SHIN]
She feels the same...?

222
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,517
Sure, Sizilien's nice to me,

223
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,645
but that's only because
Sizilien's a nice person.

224
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,063
Wait, I don't see
how you could know

225
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,023
that she has feeling for me too.

226
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,441
I see it in her eyes.

227
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,318
[SHIN] How can you say
that for sure though?

228
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,613
What if you're mistaken somehow?
That would be so awkward!

229
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,782
[AUGUST] Are you fine with
things as they are then?

230
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,660
It's called a confession
for a reason, it's risky.

231
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,036
And it takes courage.

232
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,622
Something I had thought
you had plenty of.

233
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,291
You could wait though.
Force her to risk her dignity.

234
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,335
I don't know, it's tough.

235
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,462
I've been close to Ellie
since we were kids.

236
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,631
Now we're set to be
husband and wife,

237
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,341
but even we have
misunderstandings

238
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,926
of this nature sometimes.

239
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,094
I would appreciate it

240
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,013
if you avoided using me
as an example for this.

241

[SIZILIEN]
You two are joining our camp?

Yes, as fate would have it.

Sorry, but uh, would you mind
putting them up here, Klode?

244
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,194
[SIZILIEN]
Not at all. It's no problem.

way of your training.

Is everything okay, Shin?

Uh. Yeah, I'm fine.

I'm glad to hear it.

Ah. So all of that talk
before was about Sizilien.

them are together?

Sorry to disappoint,
but I'm just an old lady now.

No, I'm not disappointed at all!

Um. Not to be a bother, but...

265
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,330
I wonder if... you would
let me... take your hand?

aren't that cute.

You used to think I was cute.
You even held my hand.

you'd get into.

Huh?

and thought I'd cool off.

316
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,073
Same here.
That water really is warm.

317
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,408
I'll say.

318
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,826
[wind blows]

319
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,041
[SHIN, SIZILIEN laugh]

320
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,295
‐‐[SIZILIEN] Listen.
‐‐[SHIN] Huh?

321
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,589
I'd like to apologize
for earlier.

322
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,923
What?

323
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,761
Oh. Thanks, but you have
nothing to be sorry for.

324
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,928
I was really flattered.

325
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,389
[gasps]

326
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,308
Can I ask you something?

327
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,478
Do you remember
the day that we met?

328
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,480
Yeah. Of course I do.

329
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,731
I was with Maria.

330
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,400
We got held up by
some demon hunters.

331
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,111
And when I asked if they
were bothering you.

332
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,947
She said, "We're extremely
frickin' bothered!"

333
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,325
[BOTH laugh]

334
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,618
[SIZILIEN]
And ever since,

335
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,746
you've done nothing but help me
in every way you could.

336
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,247
[SHIN]
The thing is,

337
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,415
when I first saw you,

338
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,043
it was like‐‐like I'd been
struck by lightning.

339
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,002
Huh?

340
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,297
Because you were
just that cute.

341
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,551
You know, I had
a similar moment.

342
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,637
When I first saw you, I, uh...

343
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,764
I thought that you
were very handsome.

344
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,891
[SHIN]
Wait. You mean it?!

345
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,351
[SIZILIEN]
Yes.

346
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,561
Sizilien.

347
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,605
Oh, uh, yeah?

348
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,109
I love you.

349
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,485
[gasps]

350
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,658
[SIZILIEN]
That makes me so happy.

351
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,120
You're always so nice
to me, but I thought...

352
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,207
...that you were just doing that
because you're a nice boy.

353
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,210
Did the way I acted really
lead you to think that?

354
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,547
Yeah, but now you're
saying that isn't true!

355
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,966
I was special to you.

356
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,051
I feel the way you do.

357
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,387
I love you too. 'Kay, Shin?

358
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,847
Sizilien.

359
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,764
[SIZILIEN]
Yes?

360
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,393
Would you...
wanna be my girlfriend?

361
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,103
Yeah.

362
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,443
‐‐[MARIA] Whoa!
‐‐[SHIN, SIZILIEN gasp]

363
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,027
[GIRLS groan]

364
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,320
[BOYS gasp]

365
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,948
[GROUP laughs]

366
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,700
‐‐[ALICE] Well that was fun.
‐‐[LYN] Did they see us?

367
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,118
‐‐[JULIUS] I can explain?
‐‐[THOR] Congratulations?

368
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,162
Wait... What in
the world's going on?

369
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,456
Did every single one of
you come to spy on us?

370
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,166
[ALICE, MARIA] There was
no way we were about to

371
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,542
miss a massive event like this!

372
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,836
Why the heck're you
yelling at me?!

373
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,630
I'm the one who put you up to
it in the first place, Shin.

374
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,340
I was obliged to see it through.

375
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,301
And I share in all his duties.

376
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,219
This is an adult situation!

377
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,473
That was very smooth!
We're both proud of you.

378
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,183
[laughs]

379
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,059
[sighs]

380
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,353
[SHIN]
Well, there you have it.

381
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,398
As of now, Sizilien and I
are officially together.

382
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,275
[GROUP]
Aww.

383
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,443
Wow, good show!

384
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,737
We'll have to throw you two
a celebration tomorrow!

385
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,072
[SHIN]
Even he was watching?

386
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,115
[sighs]

387
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,619
So, congratulations
are in order, but...

388
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,747
Well, the country's
still in a crisis.

389
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,709
Just try not to get so caught up
in love and neglect training.

390
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,212
If that was a concern
then why encourage me?

391
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,129
[AUGUST chuckles]

392
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,007
"I'll tell her how I feel
once the battle is over."

393
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,300
I've read enough stories to know

394
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,719
that the guy who says
that is gonna die.

395
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,930
[SHIN] He was defusing
a death flag?

396
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,435
[SHIN]
'Kay!

397
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,895
Listen up, everyone.

398
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,856
We're gonna try out a brand new
form of magic training now.

399
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,483
Wait, so we came
here to train?!

400
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,944
Is it something we can
do in our swimsuits?

401
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,778
Yeah.

402
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,405
We're gonna train with
this specially‐made ball.

403
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,575
What do you suppose
they plan to do?

404
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,410
I don't trust that boy.

405
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,287
He's just having fun.

406
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,207
So yeah, those are the rules.
Have questions?

407
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,626
[LYN] We're free to use
our magic for this, right?

408
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah, but you can only
have it target the ball.

409
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,215
If you hit a person,
I'll have to call it a foul.

410
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,011
Don't do anything crazy
and get hurt!

411
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,054
[ALICE]
Right!

412
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,515
Okay! Here goes nothin'!

413
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,851
Huh?!

414
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,311
[ALICE grunts]

415
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,105
[SHIN]
How did she...?

416
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,024
Oh, right. Physical enhancement.

417
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,736
[ALICE yells]

418
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,780
[OLIVIA]
I've got it!

419
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,157
That was really
well done, Olivia!

420
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,369
Here we go!
Fury of the Tempest!

421
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,829
Ha!

422
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,913
[TONY]
How?!

423
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:01,747
[MARIA]
Lyn!

424
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,873
[LYN]
I'm there!

425
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,168
Flame... Attack!

426
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,215
[screams]

427
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,636
Aw, dang it.
I dropped the ball.

428
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,929
Not bad.

429
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,097
[LYN sighs]

430
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,348
Way to go, Lyn!

431
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,392
[GROUP chattering]

432
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,019
All of them are amazing!

433
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,813
Who knew that you could
use magic like that?

434
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,773
Now this is what I
call training, guys!

435
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,817
Way to think differently,
Wolford!

436
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,986
Thank you. Heh, heh, heh...

437
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,071
[SHIN]
Why's everyone so fired up?

438
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,906
[MAY]
Aww. That looks fun.

439
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,617
I wanna play, too!

440
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,620
You better not. That bunch'll
chew you up, and‐‐

441
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,580
[ALICE]
Hey, look out!

442
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,082
[BOTH scream]

443
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,167
[MERLIN grunts]

444
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,462
Thank you!

445
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,255
Sorry about that. I slipped!

446
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,758
I think that really
could've injured us.

447
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,510
[MELIDA]
Shame on both of you!

448
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,305
If you can't be careful, I will
ban you from this training!

449
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,931
[LYN, ALICE]
We're very sorry.

450
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,060
[MERLIN laughs]
It's fine. Everyone's safe.

451
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:08,606
Besides, I think we just hit on
what this exercise is all about.

452
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,608
You need to measure
your magic control

453
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,195
and adjust your output
to suit your needs.

454
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,906
Okay. Now hop back
to it, all right?

455
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,907
[GROUP]
Right!

456
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,118
[MARIA]
Spiral Flame Burst!

457

[SIZILIEN]
Lightning Thunder Tornado!

458
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,207
[SHIN] Another self‐deluded
magic recital.

459
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,128
I've been wondering.

460
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,922
How long have you guys
known Aug and Ellie?

461
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,131
When did you first meet?

462
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,966
We met them when
we were just five.

463
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,426
If you're a noble or a royal,

464
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,262
you have to attend a debut
party when you turn five.

465
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,430
[SHIN]
Oh, yeah?

466
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,099
So it's kinda like
you noble kids

467
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,975
are all friends
from kindergarten.

468
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,310
Which is why I can tell you

469
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,605
that Thor was mistaken for
a girl a lot in those days.

470
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,316
Could you not bring up
my dark past right now?

471
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,526
Sounds nice.

472
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,570
When I was five, I was alone
in the woods, hunting deer.

473
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,948
[THOR] That's pretty amazing
too, in its own way.

474
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,867
Wow, debut parties!
That takes me back!

475
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,911
There was always
this huge swarm of girls

476
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,913
surrounding Prince August.

477
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:06,789
[AUGUST grunts]

478
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,041
I used to dread
that kind of event.

479
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,502
All those mademoiselles
trying to impress me;

480
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,337
it was downright exhausting.

481
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,047
[SHIN]
Well, you are royalty.

482
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,924
I tried to keep my
distance from him,

483
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,051
but then he came to me.

484
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,511
[AUGUST]
Hey! You.

485
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,595
What is it?

486
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,348
I've decided to permit
you to walk at my side.

487
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,433
I think I'll pass.

488
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,267
[gasps]

489
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,227
[ELISABET] Sorry, but
getting close to a prince

490
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,147
sounds like lots of trouble.

491
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,484
Of all the children I met,
only Ellie was honest with me.

492
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,695
That's what got me interested.

493
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,281
[AUGUST] I was also struck
by the cold looks

494
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,783
she'd give the young ladies
who followed me.

495
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,579
Come on, August.
Everyone can hear, stop it.

496
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,997
Aw, man.

497
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,708
Why don't any of these boys
come and try to woo me?

498
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,294
Not the prince, the hero,
or even the knights.

499
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,755
I've missed out on every chance
that's come around.

500
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,382
I'm not really sure I
would call those chances.

501
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,843
Magic's the only love I need.

502
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,386
[MARIA]
What about you, Yuri?

503
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,014
You must have had a
boyfriend or two, right?

504
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:09,685
Oh. I'd never... kiss and tell.

505
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,437
[ALICE]
That isn't fair, Yuri!

506
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,938
[GROUP laughs]

507
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,231
[SHIN]
Shh!

508
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,154
Quiet down!
You kids need to rest!

509
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,281
Tomorrow's a big day.

510
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,699
Huh?

511
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,495
[MELIDA] I could've sworn
I heard their voices.

512
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,414
Guess I was imagining things.

513
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,751
[SIZILIEN whimpers]

514
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,461
Hey, is everything all right?

515
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,004
[SIZILIEN]
Well, um...

516
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,631
Am I too heavy?

517
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,425
No. That's not really
the issue at hand.

518
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,512
Uh. Then what?

519
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,349
[gasping, panting]

520
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,684
[SIZILIEN]
Shin. You're touching my...

521
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,520
[SHIN]
Your what?

522
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,271
[SHIN yelps]

523
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,400
Ahh! I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean to!

524
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,027
[SIZILIEN whimpers]

525
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,153
[MELIDA]
Shin!

526
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,863
What do you think you're doing?!

527
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,323
You just starting dating

528
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,075
and you're taking it
to the next level?!

529
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,202
No! It's not what
you think, Granny!

530
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,913
I don't want to hear
any of your excuses!

531
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,039
Understood, ma'am.

532
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,291
Wow, you're such
a horndog, Wolford!

533
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,627
I was supposed to
be the wild one.

534
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,963
How did she get
so far ahead of me?

535
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,090
[MELIDA growls]
Okay, blankets off!

536
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,467
I know you're awake,
now get up and face me!

537
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,678
[GROUP]
We're sorry!
