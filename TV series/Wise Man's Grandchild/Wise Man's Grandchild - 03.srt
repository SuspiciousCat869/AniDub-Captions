1
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,000
[SHIN]
Okay. I'm heading out.

2
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,500
[MERLIN] Alright, best of
luck on your first day.

3
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,666
[MELIDA]
And Shin.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,541
Whatever happens,
think before you act.

5
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:25,500
[SHIN] Hm. There's no need to
worry about me. I'll be fine.

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,916
[SHIN] Well, I haven't picked
up anything abnormal

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,041
with my search magic yet.

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,666
[SIZILIEN]
Thanks, Shin. And sorry.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,250
[SHIN]
Huh?

10
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,041
For making you come all the way
to my house just to make sure

11
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,375
I get to school safely.

12
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,541
I was happy to do it. And with
a gate, it took next to no time.

13
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,666
I refuse to stand by
when there's a chance

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,750
you're in danger. That isn't me.

15
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,375
[gasps] That's so sweet of you.

16
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,208
Ugh. I'm pretty sure I just

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,166
threw up in my
mouth a little bit.

18
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,625
[bells ring]

19
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,166
Good morning, Shin.

20
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,875
Already coming to school
with girls in tow, I see.

21
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,375
And so soon after enrolling.

22
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,083
Oh, give it a rest,
will you, Aug?

23
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,708
You know why I'm doing this.

24
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,291
Yeah. But that doesn't make
it any less fun to mock you.

25
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,416
Uh-huh.

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,416
It's a pleasure
to see you, Shin.

27
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,041
We wish you a fine morning.

28
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,791
[SHIN]
Right back at'cha.

29
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,250
[ALICE yelps]
I actually made it!

30
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,625
I'm not late, am I?
I'm okay, right?

31
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,000
Um. Yeah.

32
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,791
You made it, but what
gives with you barely

33
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,958
managing to show up on time
on the first day of school?

34
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,416
Oh, I was so excited
about our first day,

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,666
I had the hardest time
falling asleep last night.

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,583
And then, of course,
I overslept.

37
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,875
What, are you a child?

38
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,416
[SHIN]
I mean, officially,

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,875
you're an adult at 15
in this world, so...

40
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,416
[door clatters]

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,875
[ALFRED]
I assume everyone's here?

42
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,125
I think that's right.

43
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,291
How are you today, Teach? Good?

44
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,041
I'm all right.
Now take your seats.

45
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,083
We're about to start homeroom.

46
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,208
Once we finish in here,
I'll show you around the school.

47
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,916
[ALFRED]
Here's the basic breakdown.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,916
The school is broadly
divided into two buildings.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,458
One of them holds
all the classrooms.

50
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,791
And the other one has
the faculty offices

51
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,375
and the student council room.

52
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,666
As well as the rooms used
for labs and study groups.

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,875
[SHIN] Study groups?
Are those like clubs?

54
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,375
[ALFRED] There's the Attack
Magic Study Group...

55
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,250
[ALFRED] The Quality
of Life Study Group...

56
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,083
They come up with Magic Gear.

57
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,916
And the Body Language
Study Group.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They use magic to increase
their physical strength.

59
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,375
[SHIN]
What was that last one?

60
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,916
That seems like a pretty
weird way to use magic.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The Body Language Study
Group sounds great.

62
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,375
If I weren't dutybound
to guard His Highness,

63
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,708
I would apply to join that
study group in a heartbeat!

64
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,125
Look Julius, you don't
have to worry about me.

65
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,708
If you want to join
the group, go for it.

66
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,541
[JULIUS gasps] No. I wouldn't
even dream of it, Your Highness.

67
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,833
[AUGUST sighs]
This is the magic academy.

68
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,208
As long as we're
on these grounds,

69
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,333
my royal blood is
completely irrelevant.

70
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,166
There's no reason you
should have to guard me

71
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,750
the whole time we're here.

72
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,333
Your Highness! I'll never forget
the kindness you've shown me.

73
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,333
[SHIN] He's saying it's
because of that school rule,

74
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,791
but it's clear he just
doesn't want to be escorted.

75
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,041
Is there a particular study
group you wanna join, Shin?

76
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,541
[SHIN]
No, not really.

77
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,916
Guess that makes sense.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,416
I doubt they would be
able to teach you much.

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
That's not what I
was trying to say.

80
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,625
Here's a thought. You should
start your own study group.

81
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,750
[SHIN]
Huh?

82
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,500
Oho. A study group
created by Wolford?

83
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,166
That may well be interesting.

84
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,416
I thought the same thing.

85
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,916
So, hypothetically, if you
were to start a study group,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,291
what kind of magic do you
think you'd focus on?

87
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,166
Regardless, I'm quite intrigued.

88
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,500
I would join whatever
the subject is!

89
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,000
I think I'd look
into it as well.

90
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,625
Same here. What better
way to stay in S-Class

91
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,791
than to study with you, Shin.

92
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,166
[AUGUST]
All right.

93
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,416
So what does it take to
start a study group, anyway?

94
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,750
Five or more members
and a faculty adviser.

95
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,208
Once you've lined all that up,

96
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,916
you just need to submit a
request form and you're set.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,750
If you kids ask nicely,
I'm willing to be your advisor.

98
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,500
[ALL cheer]

99
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,875
[SHIN] Can we slow this
bandwagon down, please?

100
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,083
It's fine if you don't want
to start a study group,

101
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,333
but if you did then I
would definitely join it.

102
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,750
Huh?

103
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,791
Well, it only makes sense.
If you're gonna be taking

104
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,791
her home, then you may as well
do extra-curriculars together.

105
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,625
[SHIN]
Huh. I guess you're right.

106
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,583
So once you're president
of your own study group,

107
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,916
what will you name it,
and what will we do?

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,833
[SHIN] I haven't even
agreed to this yet!

109
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,958
I know, let's make it
a hero study group!

110
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,791
Wait. What does that mean?

111
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,916
I kinda figured you'd spend
the whole time telling us

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,958
stories about Merlin and Melida!

113
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,458
[yelps]

114
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,333
That isn't a bad idea,
but unfortunately,

115
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,083
there's already a study
group that follows

116
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,541
the heroes' exploits.

117
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,125
[SHIN]
There is?

118
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,875
[LYN] In that case, why don't
we all just focus on mastering

119
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,416
different kinds of magic,
using Shin as a tutor.

120
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
[SHIN]
Huh?

121
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,583
I can see it now, we'll call it
the Ultimate Magic Study Group!

122
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,875
[SHIN] You're killing me, Lyn.
I'm actually gonna die.

123
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,166
Yeah, I like it.

124
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,083
"The Ultimate Magic
Study Group" sounds great.

125
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,250
And with Shin here,
it's quite fitting.

126
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,500
[SHIN]
Huh?

127
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,875
That settles it,

128
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,333
we'll be known as the
Ultimate Magic Study Group.

129
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,500
It'll be awesome!

130
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,208
Aren't we getting ahead
of ourselves here?

131
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,875
Shin's right, you can work
that out after class.

132
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,208
[SHIN groans]

133
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,958
[ALFRED] Everyone who
wants to join, sound off.

134
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,333
[ALL]
I do!

135
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,583
[SHIN] Can we please take
out the "ultimate" part?

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,166
So just in the last year,
the number of demon sightings

137
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,291
has gone up by this
large an amount?

138
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,250
But how? If demons
are proliferating as this

139
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,250
would imply, the whole kingdom
should be in a state of chaos

140
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,583
[OFFICIAL A]
That's true.

141
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,791
But the people seem to be
calm for the most part.

142
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,416
What do you make of
this puzzle, Dominic?

143
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,416
If you look closely
at the daily reports,

144
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,208
I'm sure it will be clear.
The day by day growth

145
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,041
in their numbers would
seem quite negligible.

146
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,083
No single increase went
outside the margin of error.

147
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,166
Hence why we didn't
notice this before.

148
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,625
[DISEUM]
Hm...

149
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,541
[DOMINIC] We had to look at
the data over the course

150
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,833
of this whole year to
see what was happening.

151
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,333
It's almost as though it
were planned that way.

152
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,625
One might even think this
was artificially induced.

153
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,833
That's ridiculous!

154
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,333
There's no way these
demons were made by men!

155
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,791
My King. It's a
strange situation.

156
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,916
We should launch an
investigation at once.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,916
[DISEUM]
Very well.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,166
Enlist the aid of the
Demon Hunters' Society

159
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,208
and investigate this
matter thoroughly.

160

[DOMINIC]
As you wish.

[RUSSELL]
Kurt...! Kurt! Come here!

162
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,041
What do you want now, Daddy?

163
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,208
Drop that defiant
tone at once.

164
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,625
I've received a
summons from the king.

165
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,250
And I'm sure you know why.

166
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,708
[growls]

167
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,166
[RUSSELL] Idiot! The hell
were you thinking?

168
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,833
We nobles are forbidden from
throwing around our influence

169
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,250
at the Magic Academy.
I've told you that!

170
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,541
With respect, Father,

171
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,875
it's a fact that no
commoner is my equal.

172
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,791
I refuse to pretend
that's not the case.

173
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,625
Not for you or anyone else!

174
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,833
Kurt. What is this? Where did
this ignorance come from?

175
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,250
[KURT] I'm chosen!
Destined to be special!

176
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,375
It's obvious that I'm
better than the rest!

177
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,250
And yet everyone I meet
disrespects and defies me!

178
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,875
[KURT growls] It isn't right!
I won't stand for it, I won't!

[gasps]

180
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,041
[KURT]
It's Wolford's fault.

181
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,666
Everything would have been
just fine if he hadn't shown up.

182
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,916
I can't even do as I
please with my girl now.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,458
And what's more,

184
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,166
he went and turned His Highness
against me too. They'll pay.

185
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,416
You fool!

I cannot turn a blind eye
to a statement like that!

I'll inform you of your
punishment shortly!

[RUSSELL] You! Take my son to
his room and lock the door.

[KURT grunts]

191
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:15,333
When did it come
to this, Kurt? And how?

192
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,875
Kurt's dad grounded
him from school?

193
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,458
Yes.

194
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,500
If I heard right, the Rietsburgs
told the school this morning.

195
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,208
[SHIN] So, if it's
all right to ask,

196
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,958
why does Kurt have such
an attitude, anyway?

197
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,291
No one else throws their
name around. What's his problem?

198
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,458
[THOR, JULIUS grunt]

199
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,041
Frankly, we've been
wondering that too.

200
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,041
Julius and I attended
middle school with Kurt,

201
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,375
as did His Highness

202
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,125
and he didn't act anything
like this in those days.

203
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,375
I suppose he could be a
little cocky at times.

204
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,541
But aside from that,
he was normal.

205
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,500
I think I know when
the change began.

206
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,208
It was right after
he started visiting

207
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,041
Mr. Schtrom's laboratory.

208
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,291
Come to think of it,
you're right.

209
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,916
Who's Mr. Schtrom?

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,333
[THOR] In our third
year of middle school,

211
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,291
he transferred in
as a magic teacher.

212
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:07,333
He said he was exiled from
the Empire. I'm not sure why.

213
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,041
[AUGUST] He ended up gathering
every student who was

214
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,416
half-decent with magic and
inviting the lot of us to come

215
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,958
and visit his laboratory.

216
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,875
Though it sounded shady to us,
so we turned him down.

217
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,125
Plus, he covers his eyes,

218
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,750
which originally made me
think that he was blind.

219
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,000
Although he never
seemed to show it.

220
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,541
Most search magic spells
only detect living things,

221
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,208
but I guess he might've used
a different version of one.

222
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,208
A magician who keeps
his eyes covered,

223
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,541
and who claims to be in
exile from the empire.

Any changes?

Not yet. He's been the

what happened.

Why would my sweet boy

Yes.

But then this guy came

like he's an obstacle.

Well, why wouldn't I?

Kurt isn't allowed to leave
his house anymore.

So there's not too much chance
of him attacking her now,

is there?

270
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,958
[SHIN] Oh. You're right. So she
has no need for an escort.

Still, I don't think

ever be so bold.

ever hunted a demon?

No way, I've never done
anything like that.

since I only just got
out of middle school.

00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,291
Using that for reference,

311
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,916
I can tell if a human wants
to hurt someone too.

312
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,416
What are you saying right now?

313
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,541
Are you implying that you
have hunted demons before?

314
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,291
Yup.

315
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,833
[THOR, LYN, AUGUST gasp]

316
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,166
If you don't mind my asking,
how old were you the first time?

317
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,208
I was ten.

318
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,833
[ALL]
You were just ten?

319
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,708
It was a demon bear,
as I recall.

320
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,333
[ALL]
A bear?

321
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,291
Yeah, it was about
three meters tall.

322
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,000
Had to cut the thing's head off.

323
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,666
[ALL gasp]

324
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,458
Uh, what's wrong?

325
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,375
[SHIN] Uh-oh. Think I
went and did it again.

326
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,041
[SHIN] So. Which part of
this weirded you out?

327
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,208
[ALL]
All of it, Shin.

328
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,125
[MARIA] Now we've gotta do
Study Group Orientation.

329
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,666
Seems a bit pointless,
I mean we've already decided

330
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,625
that we're gonna start the
Ultimate Magic Study Group.

331
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,958
It does feel like a waste of
time to have them tell us

332
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,833
about study groups that we
have no intention of joining.

333
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,333
We should play along anyway.
If we refuse to participate,

334
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,791
some of our classmates
might feel insulted.

335
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,500
[SHIN gasps]

336
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,541
[SHIN]
Such tremendous malice.

337
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,333
[SHIN]
And it's aimed at us.

338
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,958
[KURT laughs]

339
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:23,708
It's Kurt!

Sizilien, Aug! Your uniforms!
Channel magic energy into them!

[KURT yells]

347
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,708
[TONY grunts]
He made a magic barrier.

348
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,583
[SHIN pants]

349
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,625
Oh, no. You're hurt!

350
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,166
I should be all right.
My auto healing is kicking in.

351
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,583
I can feel it.

352
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,208
[SIZILIEN, AUGUST sigh]

353
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,958
[SHIN]
His attack was so sudden.

354
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,083
I didn't have time to completely
visualize my barrier.

355
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,208
[AUGUST] What does he
think he's doing here?

356
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,500
[MARIA] Isn't he supposed
to be grounded right now?

357
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,250
That spell was powerful.
I think he wanted to kill us.

358
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,750
Yeah. That was attempted murder.

359
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,291
There's no way we
can let this slide.

360

[KURT growls]

Damn you, damn you, damn you,
damn you, damn you, damn you!

362
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:28,000
[KURT gasps]
Damn you...! Damn you!

363
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:32,416
So what do you think, Aug?
Is Kurt in control of himself?

364
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,083
[AUGUST]
There's no way.

365
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,708
It's bad, right?

366
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,083
Bad as it gets.

367
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,750
Damn you, damn you, damn you,

Is this for real?

[groans]

372
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,750
[SHIN]
He's turned into a demonoid.

373
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,125
Aug, you take the
others and run.

374
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,416
[AUGUST gasps]
Wait, you're not going--

375
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,666
One way or another,
I'll stop him.

376
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,833
That's crazy! Come with us!

377
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,750
[SHIN] I won't let him
rampage through the capital.

378
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,250
Then I'll help.

379
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,916
You've never fought a
demon before. Don't be stupid.

380
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,500
[AUGUST grunts] So we would
only get in the way?

[SHIN]
Yes. You're in my way.

383
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,791
I see.

384
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,083
[KURT screams]

385
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,708
Let's get out of here, now!

386
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,666
No! I won't leave Shin
to fight by himself!

387
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,375
We would only slow him down!

388
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,541
[SIZILIEN]
I don't care!

389
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,166

out if you have to!

Um, right! We're leaving!

[SIZILIEN shouts]

392
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,791
[AUGUST]
You need to go with them.

393
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,208
You two find the
nearest teachers

394
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,791
and tell them what's happening!

395
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,000
[THOR, JULIUS]
Right!

396
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,625

Come at me.

[SHIN, KURT grunting]

400
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,291
[SHIN gasps]
Did that actually do damage?

401
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,958
I only hoped it
would slow him down.

402

[KURT grunts]

403

I hate you, Wolford. Just die!

404
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,625
[SHIN]
A demonoid that can still speak?

405
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,583
This isn't like what
Grandpa told me.

406
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,958
He said demonoids were supposed
to lose all sense of reason.

407
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,041
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

[SHIN, KURT shout]

410
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,666
[SHIN]
That really is hurting him.

411
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,375
I think this means he hasn't
completely turned yet.

412
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,208
Then maybe there's a
way to turn him back.

413
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:03,000
[KURT yells]

414
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,083
[SHIN] If I can find a way to
control the magic that's

415
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,708
demonizing Kurt, I can save him!

418
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,083
It can't be.

419
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,416
He's condensing magic within
himself to make an explosion!

420
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,083
No way!

421
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,583
Damn it! With that
much magic power,

422
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,083
he could destroy
the entire academy!

423
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,791
It's over, Wolford!

424
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,708

What can I do?

No. I'm all right.

00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,666
I can't believe you actually
took down a demonoid

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,500
in a one on one fight.

440
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,333

Mm-hm.

Was there another way?
Could I have saved him?

[SIZILIEN]
Huh?

445
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:59,083
[SHIN]
He was stalking you, Sizilien.

446
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,750
And if I hadn't stopped him, he
would've killed everyone here.

Yeah.

452
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,291
In our whole history,
two demonoids have attacked us.

And you bested one of
them just like that.

00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,625
[MALE SOLDIER B] He really

470
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,125

00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,166
Yeah, and his name's
Shin Wolford!

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,500
[SOLDIERS chanting] Shi-in!
Shi-in! Shi-in! Shi-in...!

473
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,041
