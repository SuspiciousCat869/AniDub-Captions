That magic gear.

It'd be handy for
lots of things.

[SCHTROM] I see. So the final

As the nobility continued
their lives of luxury,

33

And so, as the commoners
gradually transform

Pardon me, Master,

hate for the empire?

I never told you the story.

Well, then. Why don't
I tell you right now?

And the crops

[FARMER A] Yes! There's a
bumper crop in every field.

we've been able to
increase our crop acreage.

95

There wasn't enough manpower,

96
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,171
so we started welcoming
workers from other territories.

trend continue?

[BODYGUARD A] Well, there are
other industries in town

By the way,

I've been meaning to ask you
this question for a long time,

103
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,898
Lord Oliveira, but why do you
always treat the commoners

so favorably?

105
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,528
Back when I was a little boy,
I never questioned the idea

106
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,948
of nobility receiving
special treatment.

But during a trip to
another country,

108
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,329
I received quite the
unexpected shock.

109
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,957
Unlike the empire, this society
had no system of slavery.

110
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,083
and even average people

a vibrant lifestyle.

[SCHTROM]
Aria! Excellent news!

157
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,503
The other nobles,
they sent me this letter.

158
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,214
It says they want to go
along with my ideas!

159
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:12,218
Congratulations, dear!
But, why now of all times?

160
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,512
Lately, tax revenues
haven't increased as much

161
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,722
as they'd like.

162
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,809
Which means it's harder to
contribute funds to the empire.

163
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,021
If they're late with that,
they risk losing their titles.

164
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,356
They're concerned about
protecting their privilege,

165
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,901
so they're doing
whatever they have to.

166
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,362
It says they'll be holding
a meeting in the capital soon.

167
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,406
They're inviting me to go
teach them some things

168
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,283
about territorial management.

169
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,912
The capital? I don't know.
Are you sure that'd be safe?

[SCHTROM gasps]

171
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,956
[ARIA]
After all, I know some noblemen

172
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,750
see you as having
the upper hand.

173
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,961
What if they're planning on
doing something terrible to you?

174
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,797
[SCHTROM scoffs]
It's fine.

175
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,216
You know how handy
I am at using magic.

176
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,468
That's true.
You are very strong.

177
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,637
People say you're one of the
most prominent magicians

178
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,679
in the empire.

179
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,557
[SCHTROM chuckles]
See, there's no need to worry.

180
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,434
There was a time in my
youth when I worked

181
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,144
as a demon hunter, remember?

182
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,980
So it'd be hard for someone
to assassinate me.

183
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,775
You say that, darling,
but it's not much consolation

184
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,735
since you only did
it for a month.

185
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,987
[SCHTROM gasps] Well,
that's rather harsh of you.

Please bring him back safely.

Don't let anything

This is terrible!
And rumor has it,

the same thing's been
happening in other places, too.

Yes sir, how can we help you?

Well, madam. I work for the
capital's military police force.

196
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,819
We've heard there's been

Sh! Keep your voice down.

199
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,825
We've also received
information saying the people

00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,703
they've abducted have
been sold into slavery.

Yes, it's awful.

Do you know anything?

00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,212
[FARMER A gasps]
The feudal lord's responsible?

But there's no way
that can be true.

He's always been so kind
to all of us commoners!

[FARMER C] Not according
to what my wife heard.

208
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,763
Turns out, the whole reason he
gathers people like us into his

209
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,057
territory is so he can turn
around and sell them off

as slaves!

211

Lord Oliveira really does that?

[FARMER C]
Think about it.

213
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,191
Why else would an imperial
feudal lord be so interested in

214
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,276
giving commoners
special treatment?

Good point.

[MILITARY POLICE B] Looks like
it's all going as planned.

up this fake story,

we're not really the police!

to gain by putting me

only to receive evil in return.

And for the empire, which has
always favored the comfort

00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,337
That mob...

311
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,215
The noblemen who
put you up to it.

312
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,635
And the fowl empire that allows
such atrocities to occur.

313
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,680
You'll pay! Yes! Everyone!

314
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,267
I swear, you will pay!

315

[SCHTROM yells]

[SCHTROM laughs]

319
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,202
[SCHTROM]
Mark my words, Blusfia Empire.

320
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:20,039
I am going to
obliterate everything.

321
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,459
The emperor and every last
member of the nobility.

322
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,670
Not to mention the
lowly commoners I once

323
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,713
strove to protect.

324
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,638
[ZEST]
So, Lawrence.

325
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,267
What are your thoughts after
hearing Master Schtrom's story?

326
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,851
What are my thoughts?

327
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,812
After everything
that he went through,

328
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,564
I kinda understand it.

329
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,732
I mean, the whole empire
turned their backs on him.

330
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,818
Even the commoners
he'd befriended.

331
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,236
[ZEST]
Yes, but at this point,

332
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:54,407
he's already accomplished
the thing he set out to do.

333
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,659
It's probably for the
best if Master Schtrom

334
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,494
has a new objective
going forward.

335
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,496
You agree with me, don't you?

336
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,208
I guess so, sure.
Better than not, right?

337
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,793
Yes, Lawrence.

338
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,212
Which is why I'd like you to
mix in with those demonoids

339
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,548
who parted ways with our cause
earlier and convince them

340
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,550
to launch an attack on
the Kingdom of Sweed.

341
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,676
[LAWRENCE]
Hm?

342
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,262
Not only is Sweed a smaller
and less powerful nation,

343
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,888
but it also happens
to share a border

344
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,224
with the Kingdom of Earlsheid.
So, it's safe to assume

345
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,059
if a band of demonoids
were to show up there,

346
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,979
he would come running as
fast as he possibly could.

347
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,522
Wait, who is "he"?

348
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,400
[ZEST]
The famous Shin Wolford.

349
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,528
The person who drove
Master Schtrom away? Really?

350
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,656
Indeed, which is precisely what
makes him the perfect target

351
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,117
for our leader to set
his sights on crushing.

352
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,995
Understood. When
the day arrives,

353
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,206
you want to know exactly what
kind of power you're up against.

354
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,792
My! You learn quickly.

355
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,378
I'm entrusting this important
task to you, Lawrence,

356
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,381
so be certain you do
not disappoint me.

357
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,557
[SHIN gasps] Aug really
looks like a prince!

358
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,726
Well, he is a prince.

359
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,193
I ask you, noble August
von Earlsheid.

360
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,945
Do you swear to become the
crown prince, and to endeavor

361
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,489
with all of your
strength and honor

362
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,742
to serve this
magnificent kingdom?

363
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,952
Upon my very life, Sir.

364
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,581
I promise to protect this
nation and its people.

365
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,333
Eloquently spoken.

366
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,753
In that case, I now recognize
you as crown prince.

367
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,880
I expect you to devote
everything you have

368
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,507
in service to our people.

369
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

[MESSENGER A]
I have urgent news!

372
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:38,969
[gasps]

373
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,055
A large group of demonoids
has just appeared

374
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,558
in the Kingdom of Sweed!
And they're already attacking!

375
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,686
[KNIGHT A] You fool!
How dare you barge in

376
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,438
and report something like that
during this important event!

377
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,774
No. Leave him alone.

378
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,025
[KNIGHTS]
But, sir!

379
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,860
Thank you for the news.

380
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,280
If demonoids attack,
then that takes priority.

381
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:58,948
Wait a minute,

382
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,158
did that guy just say there
was a demonoid attack?

383
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,370
That's terrible. I sure hope
those people are alright!

384
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,706
Please. Let's not panic.

385
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,333
It's true.
According to the report.

386
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,586
there are demonoids in
the Kingdom of Sweed.

387
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,630
But do not be alarmed.

388
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:18,884
We have a group to fight them.
We'll resist the demonoids!

389
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:20,970
You ready?

390
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,263
[gasps]

391
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,600
[AUGUST]
This is Shin Wolford,

392
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,271
grandson of the renowned
Wise Man, Merlin Wolford.

393
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,565
He's also the one who
defeated the demonoid

394
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,900
that appeared recently.

395
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,944
And, I‐‐No.

396
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,363
We have been continually
improving ourselves

397
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,073
under Shin's leadership!

398
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,951
We've gained the strength
we need to stop this!

399
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:48,497
We'll go to Sweed at once,
and eradicate those demonoids!

400
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,174
[SHIN]
They took them off?

401
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,050
Shin, it's your
turn to speak now.

402
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,427
Wait. My turn?

403
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,304
Yes, this is basically
a performance

404
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,139
to put the people's
minds at ease.

405
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,807
So make it good.

406
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,936
Another thing, think up
a cool name for our team.

407
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,607
Calling us a study group makes
us sound like a bunch of nerds.

408
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,984
[SHIN]
What? Like, right now?

409
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,449
[SHIN] Ladies and gentlemen,
there's nothing to fear.

410
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,160
Everyone here has more than
enough courage and ability

411
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,912
to combat the enemy.

412
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,371
We're...

413
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,416
[SHIN]
Come on, Shin, think fast!

414
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,503
We're the Ultimate
Magic Study Group, so...

415
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,547
The Ultimate, uh...

416
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:46,347
We promise, we're gonna
take care of those demonoids!

417
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,224
We're the Ultimate Magicians!

I like that name, actually.

Well, I say we go
out with a bang.

00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,532
We need to make sure
they have plenty of hope.

00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,951
[SHIN]
Yeah. You're right.
