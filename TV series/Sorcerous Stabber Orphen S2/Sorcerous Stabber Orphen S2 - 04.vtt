00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE sighs]

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
I just thought that Ponkan
here could use a little nap.

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
He seemed grumpy.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
Tell me. What happened
in the city?

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.488 position:50% align:center
From what I've heard, there was
some sort of disturbance

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
in the slums right
outside of the wall.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
Rumor is, a Sorcerer
caused the explosion.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
But no one knows for sure.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
Is everything alright?

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50% align:center
So, you're here.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
Long ago, the Dragons thrived
on the continent of giants,

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
where they created a peaceful
and prosperous civilization.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
The six Dragon races nominated
their wisest members

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
and together, they established
the Wise Council to lead them.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
They discovered the rules
that governed the world,

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
the Yggdrasil System,

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
allowing the Dragons to obtain
the powers of Sorcery.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
As a result,

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
they became the founding
Sorcerers, the Ayrmankars,

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
and achieved immortality.

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.790 position:50% align:center
But this act created
an imbalance,

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
and the world became warped,
angering the gods.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50% align:center
The gods attacked the Dragons,
and in an instant,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
they had destroyed the
peaceful civilization.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
Even the land beneath
them was shattered

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
because of the gods' wrath.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.808 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] The Dragons
retreated and sought refuge

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
on the Kiesalhima Continent.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, the founding
Sorcerers created

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
the Ayrmankar Barrier,

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
thus thwarting the gods'
invasion into the continent.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
But the barrier was imperfect,
and a goddess sent in

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
the Basilitrice as
well as countless

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
other monsters through a crack.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
Then, one of the goddesses
of fate, Vellzandy,

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
descended and managed to force
her way through the barrier.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
It was there, during the crucial
Battle of Fort Ragnarok,

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
that one of the
founding Sorcerers,

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
the Ayrmankar Aureole,
met Vellzandy in battle

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
and was able to push her
back outside the barrier.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
Aureole was able to seal
the crack in the barrier,

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center
exchanging her own
life in the process.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
I can't decipher any further.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
This is the Demon King
Swedenborge's World Transcript.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
I wonder just how much of these
legends are actually true?

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.906 position:50% align:center
This book was summoned
by Istersiva,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
one of Aureole's
trusted familiars.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
She also created the play
at Kamisunda Theater.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50% align:center
What was she trying
to accomplish?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.877 position:50% align:center
[DEMON KING A] What a
horrific task this goddess

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
has taken upon herself.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.632 position:50% align:center
If this world is to be saved,
she can do naught

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
but to slaughter the
very gods themselves.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] When Master and I
investigated those ruins...

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
What happened back then?

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS chatter]

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] Krylancelo seriously
went to Kimluck...

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.171 position:50% align:center
...to go after Azalie?

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.757 position:50% align:center
My apologies for not
informing you sooner.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
I've been quite busy
establishing the new order

00:11:58.385 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
within the Tower.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
Forte, are you absolutely sure
that person was really Azalie?

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
I am.

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
then who did Master kill?

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
Unless, that monster was...

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
...Master Childman himself.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
Azalie used White Sorcery
to trade bodies.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
That can't be true!

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
That means the rumors
of Master's death are...

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] I'll return this
sword to the Tower, Master.

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN grunts]

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center
Azalie came back to the Tower
the other day and saw me.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
That's when she told me of
what happened to Master.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
Does Krylancelo know?

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he had already
figured out the truth

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
before leaving Totokanta.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA]
Mm!

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
I'll let you know if I
learn of anything new.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Krylancelo. It feels like
I'm always one step behind.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
Well, that's just the way he is.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
Always losing his head
whenever it comes to Azalie.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] This whole thing
stinks of Azalie's meddling.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
What do you mean?

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
How likely is it that a
carriage from the tower

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.770 position:50% align:center
gets attacked by bandits,

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
who then get away with all the
Celestial Artifacts onboard?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
Dealing with this stuff is
usually Master and Azalie's job.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
So why in the world would
they send out you and me

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
to clean up the mess?

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
We're just pawns in some
game Azalie's playing.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
Just shut up!

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
I'm so sick of listening
to you complain!

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] Hm! You really need
to grow up, Krylancelo.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean?

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
You always get so heated
whenever your sister

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
--gets brought up.
--[ORPHEN] Hm?

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
You're at the top of the class,

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.256 position:50% align:center
but you just can't let go
of big sister Azalie's hand.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
It's kinda sad, if you ask me.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
But not as sad as second place,
who has to gossip all the time.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
Stop letting her carry you!

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you went
to Kimluck to chase Azalie.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA]
After all this time,

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
you still can't
let go of her hand.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
Although, once you
settle your business,

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
you'll be able to come back
to the tower, right?

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
So, this is where
you were hiding.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
up here, Master?

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
Watching the clouds.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Oh, that's kinda boring.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
The big sky over Kimluck.

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.509 position:50% align:center
Never thought I'd get to see it.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
Though I'm sure the two of
you think this is just some

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.138 position:50% align:center
sightseeing trip.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
No way, Master!

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
I followed you all the way here
because I wanted to help you

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
in any way I could!

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling that you needed
someone you could rely on

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
to watch your back,
so that's why I'm here!

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait! What does that mean?

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.861 position:50% align:center
It means exactly
what it sounds like.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
I can help too, you know.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
We'll see about that!

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
It's going to rain tomorrow.

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
Rain is rather rare in Kimluck.

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
--So, we lucked out!
--Yes. In a way.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.139 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] It doesn't look like
it's going to let up soon.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
[LANIOTE]
Once it starts, it doesn't stop.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Ugh.

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center
So, do you know a way for us

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
to sneak into the
center of the city?

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.440 position:50% align:center
[LANIOTE]
I do.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] In that case,
I'd like us to move out soon.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
We would be in trouble if
they found out our location,

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
wouldn't we?

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
That's right. If it weren't
for a certain someone,

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
my plan wouldn't
have been ruined,

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
and I'd be the city center
by now, instead of here.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! We're in this jam
'cause of you, Laniote!

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN coughs]

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center
Anyway, with the ridiculous
number of guards

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.338 position:50% align:center
wandering around the city,
it's only a matter of time

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
before they figure out
where we're hiding.

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
Very well, then. I'll show
you the way to get inside.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.597 position:50% align:center
If I leave you on your own,
you'll probably just get lost.

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
We'll get lost?

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know, but as
a city, Kimluck is split.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
There are three sections.

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
The outer city,
inside of the wall,

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
and the Holy City
where the cathedral is.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
The only people allowed into
the Holy City are merchants

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
bringing in food and supplies.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
It's highly regulated.

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
The merchants are allowed in,

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
but they can only enter
at designated times.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
That seems like a lot of
trouble to go through.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
Makes sense if you
think about it.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
What do the believers of Kimluck
hate more than anything else?

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
Oh! Sorcerers!

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
And that's exactly why
they're so strict.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
They don't want knowledge of
Sorcery to spread inside.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
Mädchen mentioned that
about purebloods.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
Only they live in the Holy City.

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
That's correct. Only those
who live within the walls

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
are considered to be the
true believers of Kimluck

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
by the Church.

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
You know, I've always wondered
why the Kimluck Church,

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center
with all its worshippers, never
really tried to spread out more.

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
To think it's because
they don't acknowledge

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
any churches outside the city.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
They're believers, though.

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.325 position:50% align:center
They're obsessed with the
purity of their blood.

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
It's no wonder that
their greatest enemy

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
are the Sorcerers, who were
created by the intertwining

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
of Dragons and humankind.

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
So it doesn't matter
how cute a stray cat is,

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
they'll hate it
'cause it's a stray?

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
Well, that's one way to put it.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
If Sorcery comes from Dragons,
why are there human Sorcerers?

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:38.016 position:50% align:center
Master already told us
that story, don't you remember?

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] The most intelligent
among these races were called

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
the Nornir, or Weird Dragons.

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
They're also known
as Celestials.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
But their entire
race was female,

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
so they had to mix with
the human population

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
to produce heirs.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
But why couldn't they
leave descendants?

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
It was the Basilitrice.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
Sent by the goddess
to attack the Dragons.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
Its poison stripped the
Celestials of their ability

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
to leave any descendants.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
Realizing their dire situation,

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
the leader of the Nornir
proposed that they mix

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
with humankind in order
to preserve their race.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
Who was their leader?

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
Sister Istersiva.

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
Oh, she summoned the
World Transcript, right?

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
Wait, isn't she also the
person who built that

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
Kamisunda Theater thingy?

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
So, anyway, before we
got off track,

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
you said you knew of a secret
way to get inside the city.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
You made getting there
sound pretty ominous earlier.

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
It'll be easier if I show you.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
Although, I hope
it hasn't flooded

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:37.784 position:50% align:center
because of all this rain.

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be used
to places like this.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I just can't stand
the smell of alcohol.

What's the big idea, here?

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
The kid you brought in.
He's that Sorcerer, right?

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
The one who was hanging
around the Lady Instructor.

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
You're not suggesting that Lady
Mädchen was with a Sorcerer,

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
are you?

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
That is quite the
absurd accusation.

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
This young man is the
Instructor's bodyguard.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
Of course, I did receive
information that a Sorcerer

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
had infiltrated the city

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
in order to
assassinate Instructors.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
I believe that they're
responsible for the disturbance.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
You sure about that?

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center

was guarding the Instructor?
