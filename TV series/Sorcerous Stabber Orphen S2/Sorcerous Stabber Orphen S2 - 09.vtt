00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
the Sorcerers had all escaped.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
What's happening, and how
high up does it go?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
High enough that Mädchen and I
turned our backs on the church.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
This thing's really big.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
A dream? No...

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
[AUREOLE] I am the
leader of the Celestials,

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.383 position:50% align:center
and I stand at the head
of the six Dragon tribes.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.387 position:50% align:center
[AUREOLE] It was I who founded
the practice of Sorcery

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
among my kind.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
The founding Sorcerer?

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
[AUREOLE] That loathsome
war with the gods

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
that occurred 300 years ago...

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
...spurred the creation
of the Ayrmankar Barrier.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
At Fort Ragnarok,
the barrier was torn,

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
and the Goddess Verthandi
attempted to intrude.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
What is she saying?

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Ramonirok? The Kimluck Pope?

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
You're the founder...
of all Sorcery?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
I can't figure out what
I'm seeing right now.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
I have no idea where we are.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
Where is the familiar with whom
I have shared my consciousness?

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.951 position:50% align:center
Familiar?

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
The assassin to whom Istersiva

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
entrusted everything
upon her passing.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
Istersiva?

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:10.670 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Is this... Fort Basilitrice?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] And this shall
be my final feat of Sorcery.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
It's Master!

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
Here, then, I die to
protect you evermore.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN yells]

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] For all of you
are my beloved children.

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Her children? Could it be...?

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
I'll be teaching you all I know
about the art of combat.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
Learn it well.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
In the end, your strength
must surpass mine.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, all my efforts
will be for naught.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
And you'll be left to bear
the same burden as I do,

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
knowing that you
lacked the power

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
to stop somebody from doing
something disastrous.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Then, did Master...

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
...travel through time?

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Is this really your room?

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
It's where I used to live.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
Till I became a
Death Instructor,

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
this was home sweet home.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[footsteps]

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN] Sorry. I wasn't
sure where else to go.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Are you doing all right?

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN]
Are you?

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
When I asked Carlotta about you,

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
she told me that they
had killed you.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
She was probably going
off what she'd heard

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
about the interrogations without
ever seeing one herself.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
Quo is a professional.

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't let anyone die till
he'd squeezed all he could

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
out of 'em, and he had
barely gotten started

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
when they sprung me.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN chuckles]

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see both of
you made it to safety.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
If we wanna call this "safety."

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
And where did you
disappear to?

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN]
I had business to take care of.

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
How did we all end up back here?

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo got
into the Cathedral

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
through the underground passage.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
Apparently, this Deep Dragon
led them through it.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.631 position:50% align:center
From what I can figure out,
I think the Dragons might be

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
looking for the same thing
we are in all this.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they've been waiting.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
The Dragons have lived on this
continent for centuries now.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
No doubt they wanna
see the goddess, too.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.561 position:50% align:center
I think they're trying
to establish a proxy

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
to receive the Final Audience.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.774 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
First there was MacDougal.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] He had received the
Final Audience already.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.370 position:50% align:center
The Deep Dragon could have
learned everything he knew

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
if they'd actually managed
to make contact.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.916 position:50% align:center
What's this Final
Audience thing?

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.794 position:50% align:center
If we go back to the
cathedral, you'll know.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
[door creak]

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
[LAPOINTE]
Hm?

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
I've never seen an
umbrella like that.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center
"Report in to Quo if
your brother shows up."

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
Those were your orders,
by my recollection, yes?

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
Never mind that.
Quo lied to us both.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
There could still be Sorcerers
inside the cathedral right now.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
I'm issuing you a direct order.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
You are to turn back and
protect the cathedral.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
His Holiness is already
aware of that possibility.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what are you
playing at, Carlotta?

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
Has His Holiness finally
bestowed his words upon you?

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
You should answer
my questions first,

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
lest you create the impression

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
that you're harboring
your brother.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
Do you plan to
make this difficult?

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
I can't surrender my
brother until I understand

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
what's happening
within our ranks.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:14:59.816 position:50% align:center
Then you have
made your choice.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.359 position:50% align:center
[LAPOINTE gasps]
As Death Instructors,

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.695 position:50% align:center
you're all meant to work
together to protect the city.

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
So, what is this?
All the lying, the scheming!

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
Do you fancy yourselves spies?

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
I don't know quite
how to explain.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center
When you look at this Holy City,
what does it look like to you?

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
Because to me, it looks
like a playground.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
[clattering]

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] You were taking us
to your family's armory?

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
Did you think we were gonna
break in there empty-handed?

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH giggles] I could do
some damage with this!

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
You got a good eye
for blades there, kid.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
That sword you have in your
hands is called "Slake Thirst."

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
That one... and this one
are the crown jewels

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
of the Solude family collection,
but this one has no name.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:49.199 position:50% align:center
Though actually, Krylancelo
might know something about it.

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
So pass it along to
him when you see him.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's our best bet.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
The thing would be wasted
on anyone but Krylancelo.

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
Orphen's name is Orphen

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
and you need to quit calling
him by that other name.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
Fine, got it!

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
Anyway, point is, you can
take both those swords.

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.424 position:50% align:center
Well thanks, but aren't
you gonna need a weapon?

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN]
Like this?

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] I can take Quo
if I've got this thing.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
You can't.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
I don't care what kind
of sword you're using.

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
It's not going to do anything
against his armor!

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
Either way, we're gonna
have to face him.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
So what. Are you two
going there to die?

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
And the two of you are gonna
get to stay here and live.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
But why?

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be fighting Quo and
Carlotta at the same time.

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
There's no way I can stay alive
and keep both of you safe too.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
Keep us safe? I don't
need your protection!

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.041 position:50% align:center
I'm a Sorcerer too, you know!

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
Fine, then show me
what you got, kid.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
Salua.

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
Sure, let's go!

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you two?

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
I now unsheathe thee. Sword of--

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center

[CLAIOMH, MAJIC gasp]

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
Easy! That could have
literally decapitated him!

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
After all that,
you're just letting me win?

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Huh?

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] I've thrown away my
only weapon. You're unharmed.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
The fight would have been
yours if you'd taken it,

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
but you didn't even
try to capitalize.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
And that's one of the things
that separates you from him.

Quo.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
We who inherit the holy blood
of the progenitor Ymir.

We who are born into nobility,

It would appear as though you've
killed another of your servants,

Your Holiness.

[RAMONIROK] For this you
cut short your recitation?

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
It was your sin that
condemned her, Quo.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
Her eyes saw my face.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
Had your pity not overcome you,

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
you'd have wounded
them more deeply.

Had I wounded them more deeply,

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
I would surely have penetrated
her brain and killed her.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
Unlike Your Holiness,
we are quite frail creatures.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
You should have known
better than to think your

mental domination
would work against me.

[RAMONIROK] I knew that
granting you that armor

to be a mistake.

Was it the Final Audience?

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps it was
because of Aureole?

It was the gods.

Or, rather...

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.594 position:50% align:center
I suppose it would be more
accurate to say that it is

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
the most powerful form of
Sorcery presently usable

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
