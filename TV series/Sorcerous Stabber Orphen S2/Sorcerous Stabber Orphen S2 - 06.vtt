00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
And you. Who are you?

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
Who are those two?

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.049 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hey, that's my line!

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well I hope
ya choke on it!

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Atelence Finlandi.
Martha Finlandi.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
The ones who birthed me.
Nothing more and nothing less.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.940 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Azalie... Tish...

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.360 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] The Tower of Fangs.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
Heartia. Comicron.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:14.531 position:50% align:center
I won't be your only customer...

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Bagup's Inn.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
Hey buddy, I've got a deal

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
you're not gonna wanna miss.

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
Those idiots... Hang on...

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Fairy lights are a
skill that most Sorcerers

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.968 position:50% align:center
can master easily.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Right. Easily.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
It's a low-level spell.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
Man, getting dragged
around on the rocky ground

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center
like this really sucks.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
What the hell is this?

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50% align:center
Do I look like a damn
sack of potatoes, huh?

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Seriously!

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
Why am I waking up to
you pulling me along

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
like a deer carcass, Majic?

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
Wow, Master, you must have
done that hundreds of times

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
to be that quick!

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
Ah! Which is a little weird.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.164 position:50% align:center
Shut your mouth!

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
That's right. Majic.
That was your name.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
You've known that for a while.

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
Wait, did you really
forget my name?

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] The passed-out
girl is Claiomh, right?

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
And that furball!

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
Master, I'm not sure
what happened,

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
but I'm starting to think you
might have a head injury,

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
and I don't believe
I'll be able to heal you.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
Did I ask? Wait a sec.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.521 position:50% align:center
I did manage to
heal your arm.

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
It seemed like a good chance
to practice my Sorcery.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
Well, Look at that!

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
How'd I do? Bet you barely
even noticed, right?

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
--[ORPHEN screams]
--What happened?

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
Your Sorcery made me grow
an extra finger, somehow!

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Did I
actually do that?

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
--[thudding]
--[MAJIC] Ow!

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
You're really asking?

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
If you really thought
that was possible,

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
you have no business
trying to heal anyone!

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
It was a complete amateur move!

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
Why are you being such a jerk?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.596 position:50% align:center
Although... Honestly, you pulled
it off like a pro.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50% align:center
Feels good as new.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
Anyway, there a reason
you're just leaving Claiomh

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
knocked out like that?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] I was worried I would
mess up and make things worse.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
What if you messed me up?

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
It seemed like you were
gonna die back there

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
if I didn't do
something to help.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
And I knocked out a
few of those guards,

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
but I don't know how long
they're gonna stay out for.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
Whatever happens, we need
to keep moving, don't we?

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] How long have you
been dragging me around?

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Maybe two hours?

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You shouldn't
have that much stamina.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
How do you know you haven't
been walking in circles

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
the whole time?

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] This underground tunnel
complex is ridiculously huge.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It looks like all the
passages are similar in size.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
This map only covers a small
portion near the entrance

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
at the pub, but it seems
like it's drawn to scale.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
If we assume that, I'd say
there are somewhere

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
in the neighborhood of ten
kilometers of tunnels down here.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
Why would anyone bother
to build all this?

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] It seems like
there are lots of

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
underground ruins around.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
There was the hidden
underground theatre, too.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] True, there are a
number of Celestial ruins

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
buried on this continent.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
The entire Nornir society was
built underground, of course.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
But it's pretty clear this place
wasn't built by the Celestials,

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.057 position:50% align:center
or by human Sorcerers.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
It's not a Celestial ruin?

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
The Celestials used Sorcery

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
to reinforce their buildings.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
Specifically, they used
silent Sorcery,

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
which stays in effect as
long as the surface bearing

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
the Wyrd Glyphs remains intact.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
The Kamisunda Theater
was made of wood,

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
but it hadn't decayed at all.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
It was protected
by silent Sorcery.

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center
To take out a
Celestial structure,

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
you'd have to use a
matter destruction spell.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
I've never even heard of those.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
It's well beyond your
ability at this point,

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center
but it's still worth
knowing about.

00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
Matter destruction is one of the
ultimate forms of Sorcery.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
I haven't dived into
theory with you.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
We've been forced to do mostly
practical work from the start.

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
It's a lot different than
learning it from Childman.

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:12.769 position:50% align:center
There are three
mechanisms through which

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
Black Sorcery operates.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
And each of these affects and
is affected by the others.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.943 position:50% align:center
Matter destruction,
wave neutralization,

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.945 position:50% align:center
and meaning dissolution.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
As you may have noticed,

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
each mechanism entails
the negation of another.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.703 position:50% align:center
The destruction of
matter forms waves.

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
The neutralization of
waves lets matter cohere.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
The manifestation
of Sorcery arises

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.502 position:50% align:center
from the Sorcerer's
thought patterns.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
We believe this is why
each Dragon species

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
displays a unique
form of Sorcery.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
How these thought patterns
might differ between species

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
is not yet clear,

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
and we have little way to gather
any evidence at this point.

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
They couldn't have
built this place.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:54.144 position:50% align:center
Their structures barely
weather over time.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
And none of their buildings are
over a thousand years old.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
They would be in better shape.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.109 position:50% align:center
That makes sense, but the
tunnels still seem like they

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
have a lot in common with the
Kamisunda Underground Theatre.

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:10.452 position:50% align:center
That's true. They do.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
[sighs] But this is way
too big to be a theatre.

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
And why build a
theatre underground?

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
Doesn't seem worth
all the trouble.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
Is that what you came to
Kimluck to find out, Master?

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
No.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:30.096 position:50% align:center
It was wrong of me to get
you two involved in this.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
When I met you guys,

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
I was already neck deep
in my own mess.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
A mess that you never
needed to be part of.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
You both ended up in Kimluck
because you're with me,

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
and honestly,

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
I barely understand why
I came here myself.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
I was blindly following
my older sister,

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
and she's here.

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
I know Azalie is in
this city now.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
And I intend to keep
following her...

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.582 position:50% align:center
...to Yggdrasil Cathedral.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
And yet... I don't know
what'll happen next.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
If I find her, I have
no idea what I'll do.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
Fight her? Could I beat her?

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:09.052 position:50% align:center
Would I join her?

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
You're thinking about
this too much, Master.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
She's your sister!

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.183 position:50% align:center
What matters is that you find
her and work things out,

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
isn't it?

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Work things out, huh?

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
Standing up to her was hard
even back when we were kids.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
That's half the reason I'm--

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[MAJIC gasps]

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
They're gone.

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
There's nobody here
to protect you now.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
If I were you, I would wake up.

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
Or rather, stop
pretending to sleep.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
That act was enough
to fool your friend,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
but I don't buy it for a second.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN] You're wide awake,
Carlotta Mausen.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
Let's stop playing around.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
My goodness.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
I'd say it's rather
presumptuous of you

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
to speak as if you know
so much about me.

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
Yes? My dearest Mädchen?

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
Tsk!

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
Your sword is trained on me,
but normally you would point it

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
toward my throat or flank.

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
Instead, you aimed for my face.

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
You're not likely to
strike a killing blow

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
through my forehead.

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
I could easily counter-attack.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
But I would land the first cut.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
And I know you would never
allow me to leave a mark

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
on that face of yours.

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
Anyone blessed with such a gift
would want to take care of it,

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
would they not?

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
That's perfectly natural.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.771 position:50% align:center
I came here to ask
you one question.

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
Where has the church
taken Salua Solude?

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
I won't answer that.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
It's been far too enjoyable
watching you flail.

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
How are you going to survive now
that all your friends are gone?

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN grunts]

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
Dear me. It appears you failed
to learn the first thing

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
about my techniques.
What a shame.

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
Honestly. Did you expect
someone in my position

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
not to have a knife at
the ready as I slept?

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN grunts]

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A]
Lady Carlotta?

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT B]
Is something the matter?

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
[CARLOTTA] I do feel sorry
for you, little Mädchen.

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
You don't have a single ally
left in this whole city, do you?

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
If you intend to go up against
Quo all by yourself,

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
surely you realize
you'd be better off

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
with a weapon like mine.

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
You won't get far
using that heavy sword

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
with your one good arm.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
A few swings, perhaps.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN gasps]

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:44.249 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] If you mean to run,
you'd best do it now.

[grunts]

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.879 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you someday.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
Well, in any case,
you'll need to kill Quo first.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A]
Lady Carlotta!

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
Fetch me a bandage, quickly.

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
And something to clean up blood.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
I broke my glass and
cut myself on it.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN grunts]

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps] How? How could
Claiomh have run off?

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
Good question.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
Damn it all!

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
Huh? Footprints!

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
Gonna need a
brighter light, Majic.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
It's still way too dark.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
Sure thing!

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Looks like they
walked off straight this way.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Yeah, and we're
gonna have to follow them.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
I wonder what happened.

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
If she was mad about us
leaving her on the ground,

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
she would have
yelled at us, right?

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
She wouldn't skulk
off in silence.

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
She's never silent.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
Yeah, exactly.
That's not like her.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
But she did, so maybe
it wasn't her choice.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
She's up ahead.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
It's coming together now.

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
What's going on?

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
I think she'll be okay.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
I had a guess as
to what happened,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
and it seems I was right.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
You can blame the furball.

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
Do you remember Fenrir's Forest?

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] The Deep Dragon took
that Fiena girl as a familiar,

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
and sometimes took over her
body using mental control.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
Same deal.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
So, right now...

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.779 position:50% align:center
Leki must have taken
control of Claiomh

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
while she was out and
started walking this way.

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
But it's pitch black down here,
and I thought Deep Dragons

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
had to be able to see their
targets to use dark Sorcery.

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It wouldn't surprise me
if they had good night vision.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
What's strange is that the
furry little hellion took action

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
without Claiomh telling him to.
That's a new development.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
Do you think there's something
about the situation

00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
that forced him to
act differently?

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
Well. I'm guessing he
caught on to the fact

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
we weren't stopping to heal her,

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
so he decided to go look
for somebody who would.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
Not a complex plan,
but he is a baby.

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.149 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
I thought he'd picked a
direction and started walking.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:19.279 position:50% align:center
Could he have a destination?

00:21:19.362 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Let's assume Leki
is looking for someone

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
to help Claiomh, like you said.

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:26.661 position:50% align:center
He might've smelled a person
and started following his nose!

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:29.956 position:50% align:center
Maybe if we stick with him,
he'll lead us to an exit.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
Let's just hope that exit
doesn't take us somewhere

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
even worse.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
What is this smell?

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I'm too familiar with it.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
There's only one
thing it could be.

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center

♪

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.670 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You're never allowed
to use Sorcery again.

00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:42.464 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
And you're deciding this now?

00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:44.382 position:50% align:center

Do it and you're expelled!
