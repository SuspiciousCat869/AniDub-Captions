call these "guard dogs".

at the top of the stairs.

They're the Angel and
Devil of Swedenborge.

Wait, did you say Swedenborge?

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
Is that the same
Swedenborge who was

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
named in the World Transcript?

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center
Remember me telling you a while
ago about how the Dragons

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
originally stole the power
of Magic from the Gods?

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] One of the
Gods was able to protect

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
his secrets from the Dragons.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:15.610 position:50% align:center
That was the supreme ruler
of all creation. Swedenborge.

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
He tried to eliminate
the other Gods himself,

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
earning him the title of
"Godslayer Demon King".

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
He's a taboo figure in
the Kimluck Church.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
And this angel
and devil represent

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
the Demon King's two servants.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
So does that mean
this building was once

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
some kind of temple
for Swedenborge?

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
No idea.

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
That guy outside called it
a theatre before he died.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
But these two statues
are his servants,

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
and on top of that,
it's not on the map. Huh.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN] Yeah. This is it.
There's no doubt.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
If you keep skipping out
on the bill, we'll end up

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
with even more debt
collectors hunting us down!

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.573 position:50% align:center
Shut up! Those chumps
at the inn were rattling on

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
about all the treasure they
were gonna nab from this place.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.953 position:50% align:center
So we're gonna beat 'em all
to it, sell our haul in town,

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
and pay off everything we owe
with a hefty slice left over

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center

This place is dangerous.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center

end up dead.

Oh, really?

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Ask one of them
if you don't believe me.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN, DORTIN whimper]

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] And the fact
that Orphen is in there

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
doesn't improve your chances.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN]
No treasure, then?

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.901 position:50% align:center
This place is obviously
too dangerous to be

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
worth the effort,

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
especially when that thug
of a lender is around!

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
If there's such a thing
as justice, he'll be done in

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center

would wanna catch a show

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center

how do we get out of here?

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Can't Leki get us out somehow?

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Doubt it.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
I've tried asking him
for stuff before,

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
and he usually does something.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
Just nothing like
what I wanted him to.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH screams]

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
Too late for him.

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
So could those dog
things be in here too?

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
I think they would have
attacked already.

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It looks like there's a
barrier here made with Sorcery.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
I expect we'll find Wyrd
Runes inscribed nearby.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
They're a form of Sorcery
used for defense.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
And they'd be a clear sign
that these are Nornir ruins.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:52.809 position:50% align:center
Did you say "Nornir"?

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
Weren't they one of
the Dragon races?

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
Yeah...

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
People called them Celestials.

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
They were the second
most powerful Dragon race,

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.821 position:50% align:center
and the only ones to
defend humankind.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
But eventually,
they all disappeared.

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
They used silent Sorcery.
Wyrd Runes.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
It can stay active
for centuries.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
If these really are Nornir
ruins, we're in trouble.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
We are? Why is that?

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
Nornir ruins are always
protected by Guardians

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.675 position:50% align:center
who are instructed to remove
all trespassers on sight.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] And by "remove",
what you mean is.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] This place isn't
safe for us, either.

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
Though I'm not so convinced
that it's quite as abandoned

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
as it might appear
at first glance.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
What is that supposed to mean?

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] The Continental
Sorcerers' Association

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
may have been hiding these
ruins from the royal family.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Hiding them?

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Putting 'em in the
books as being demolished,

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
then sending in teams to raid
'em for Celestial artifacts.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
The Tower of Fangs
did the same thing.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
That's how they were able
to explore Fort Basilitrice

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:59.209 position:50% align:center
without anyone
getting in their way.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
And from what I've been told,

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
that's where they discovered
Istersiva's grave.

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
Istersiva... Are you talking
about Sister Istersiva,

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
the Nornir priestess who built
the World-Seeing Tower?

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] That's right,
though I didn't see it.

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] What would they
be looking for here?

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Usually Sorcery
tools the Nornir left behind.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
They might have been everyday
items in Celestial society,

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
but some are highly
dangerous to humans.
