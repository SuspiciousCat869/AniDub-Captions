today is hollow.

[AZALIE, ORPHEN gasp]

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
[QUO] The key to destroying this
continent is right over there.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
The arbiter of destruction,

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
the sands of death blowing
here from the other world!

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
You've experienced
the Final Audience,

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
so you should know.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
It is only a matter of
time before the goddess

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
rips her way
through the barrier.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
All beings except for the
pure humans in Kimluck

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
face destruction.

been in vain, Salua.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
No matter how much you may
struggle, nothing will change.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
Each and every one of us are
nothing more than puppets.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
If it is the goddess's will
for me to die, then so be it.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
But I will make sure that every
filthy Sorcerer as well as

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
the oath breakers who
harbor them, perish with me!

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
For today, this world will be
returned to its rightful owner!

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
And at last,
this half-done courtyard

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
infested with snakes will
finally be transformed

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.508 position:50% align:center
into a paradise for
the gods, Yggdrasil!

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
Go!

The Ayrmankar are immortal.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
Something like that
won't kill her.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
But if her powers
weaken even a little,

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
the equilibrium will be broken,

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
and there'll be no one else to
stand in our goddess's way!

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
Very well! I offer up all
the lives in this universe,

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
so that this wretched world
can finally be reborn!

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
Oh Goddess, through you,
I will save this world!

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center

Is it just the cathedral?

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
What if it's affecting
all of Kimluck?

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
Or even the whole continent?

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN gasps]
Save us, Goddess.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
Stop that! There's no
time for prayer now.

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center

This is all your fault,
you big dummy!

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
Because of you, we got
teleported underground,

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
got washed away
and nearly drowned,

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
then fell through a ceiling
and got blasted by that

damn moneylender's
stupid Sorcery!

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
You mean we got lost,
a lil' wet, then we fell,

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
and afterwards our clothes
got slightly singed, don't you?

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
You planned this, right?

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center

yourself, could you?

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] That was just from
her arm shifting a little?

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
Are the Dragons even
strong enough to compete

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
against that kind of power?

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
They've hidden themselves
away in their sanctuary,

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center

powerful they actually are.

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I understand, now.
What he wanted.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.891 position:50% align:center
For all that time, our Master
was trying to find a successor

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
to replace the dying Dragons.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
He was fulfilling his
mother's last wish.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo, have you ever
heard of spirit forms?

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
No, never.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] It's a special
kind of White Sorcery.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
It turns your body entirely
into a spiritual form.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
Not many know about it.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
Using it is risky because
you're freed from any

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
physical confines, so your
existence becomes unstable,

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
and can dissipate if
you're not careful.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
But in exchange,

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
your Sorcery increases
to the level of a Dragon.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
Wait a sec.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
That's impossible!

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
It is possible, if we use this.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
The Sword of Baldanders
can turn a physical form

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
into a spiritual one.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
There isn't another way.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
I'm the only person who can stay
alive even in a spirit form.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
And you're the only one who can
handle this sword other than me.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
We have to do this.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
I promised myself that I would
never lose my sister again,

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
no matter what.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Our master left his own
time and travelled 200 years

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
into the future to
protect this world.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50% align:center
It's not just him, either.

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
Istersiva gave her life
for the founding Sorcerer.

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
She sent master to our time,

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
using the last vestiges
of her power to do so.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
I truly believe
everything they did

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
was so that we
could finish this.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
Even so, you shouldn't have
to sacrifice yourself!

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
Master didn't have to give up
his life in his own time,

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
or obey Istersiva's Sorcery.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
But he did,

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center
so that he could stop this
continent from being destroyed.

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
Even if you were a spirit form,

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
we don't stand a chance
against the goddess.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
Aureole is slowly
regaining her powers.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
She can't push back
the goddess by herself.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
But if I help her...

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center
I won't sacrifice you!

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.923 position:50% align:center
Alright then, I'll do it myself.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
You can't! It's too
dangerous if you try

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center
to transform yourself
with the sword!

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps, grunts]

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
Azalie, I won't let you do this!

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
That's why I was put here.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
My entire purpose in this
life has been to stop you!

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:30.782 position:50% align:center
I understand, now!

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
The reason why he raised me
to be the only one who could

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
stand up to you.
Why I became a stabber!

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
If Master wanted to kill you,

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center
he could have done
it at any time.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.960 position:50% align:center
But he knew he wouldn't be
able to go through with it.

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
To kill the one he loved most!

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
Here, then, I die to
protect you evermore.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
He trusted me to stop you.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
Master wanted me to be
able to do the things

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
that he knew he couldn't!

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I'm not gonna let you do this!

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
Five years ago, I failed you.
But not this time!

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
I'll stop you! Me! Krylancelo!

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
You aren't Krylancelo anymore,
you're Orphen.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
Aren't you?

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
Azalie!

Don't think this is over yet.

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
The founding Sorcerer's
powers are limited.

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
It is only a matter of time
before it all runs out.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
And when that happens,

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
another hole in the barrier
will appear on this continent.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
Our goddess will
return one day soon.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.958 position:50% align:center

don't need any more time

I'm worried about Oleyl.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
I'll go see him. I'm sure
he's waiting for me.

where to go from there.

In the Church's eyes, we're just
as bad as you Sorcerers.

rest easy, that's for sure.

I can have this?

If not you, who else
would we give it to?

That's Childman's
dagger, anyways.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
Just take it. I mean,
all it does is remind us

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
how Oleyl got hurt
ten years ago.

We better get moving,

late and miss bath time!
