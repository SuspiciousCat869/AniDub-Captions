That's wrong. I'm me!

Back then and now!

I'm no one but me!

What's the matter, Sorcerer?

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.644 position:50% align:center
Though it would seem
you're no longer qualified

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:26.438 position:50% align:center
to hold that title.

[ORPHEN] Why won't you
just leave me alone?

I had almost forgotten myself.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
But now I can finally show you.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
[QUO]
Hm?

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
This is the real me!

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
You just don't know when
to give up do you, boy?

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
Quit your yapping!

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
You can spend all the time you
want on strengthening your body,

00:03:58.613 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
but it doesn't mean
a damned thing

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
if you're don't use your brain!

[gasps]

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
I know you're a Death
Instructor, or whatever,

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
but don't you have
anything better to do?

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
There's something that's been
bothering me ever since

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
I first laid eyes on you,

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
and I think I've finally
figured out what it is.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
The way you move and talk,
reminds me of my master!

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
Of course, Childman's pupil
would be able to recognize it.

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:21.970 position:50% align:center
I've spent the last ten years
trying to emulate him.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
I've heard the stories about
you facing off against

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
my master ten years ago.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
[QUO]
Mere fiction.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
The truth is,
he refused to fight me.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
[QUO]
By the time I'd discovered him,

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.525 position:50% align:center
he'd already broken into
the Hall of the Great Poet

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.694 position:50% align:center
and received his Final Audience.

[QUO] I couldn't raise
my sword against him.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
Fear had paralyzed me.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
And to this day,
it continues to plague me.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
But if I kill you,
so dies this sickness.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
Now come, O Successor
of the Razor's Edge!

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center

Who cares about all that crap?

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna make you pay
for what you did to Azalie!

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center

I knit thee thus...

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center

[QUO] Such Sorcery
may have killed Name,

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.720 position:50% align:center
but it's useless against me!

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
I shall crush thee,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
[QUO shouts]
What's wrong?

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.732 position:50% align:center
Is this the extent
of your Sorcery?

00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center

[grunts]

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] ...but you're
underestimating me

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
if you think I can't use this!

It's futile.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] If that's not enough,
I'll keep trying!

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
With the Pope gone,
there's just you left!

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
I won't stop fighting
until the very end,

Quo Vadis Pater!

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
I find it appropriate that
the name Quo Vadis Pater

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.125 position:50% align:center
reflects a question of where
one's faith will take them.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
And Ramonirok?

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
He's nothing more
than a hypocrite.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
That drivel about Childman
having knowledge

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.594 position:50% align:center
of some way to end his life?

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
Nothing but lies and delusion.

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
Even the goddess finds
herself unable to kill

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:16.436 position:50% align:center
the founding Sorcerer
after 300 years.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
He is well aware
that he cannot die.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.359 position:50% align:center
But he carries on acting
as if he wishes for death.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.278 position:50% align:center
It was only after I
received my Final Audience

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
that I was able to use it and
the power of the Demon Armor

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
Ifrit to break myself free
of his mental control.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
The others, Salua,
MÃ¤dchen and Carlotta,

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
haven't had direct
contact with him,

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
so they haven't been
affected by his Sorcery.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
Why are you telling us all this?

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.839 position:50% align:center
I heard footsteps
approaching our location.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
Ah, so I was just trying
to buy a bit of time.

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.052 position:50% align:center
Footsteps?

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
They've taken hostages!

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
What the hell!
Why didn't you run away?

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
Obviously, we weren't gonna let
you face all these bad guys

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
by yourself!

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.779 position:50% align:center
We wanted to help any
way we could, Master!

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
I understand, thank you.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
Do you truly believe you
can still win this battle?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center
Excellent work, Carlotta.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.625 position:50% align:center
Words of praise aside,
it was hardly a challenge.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
But... unfortunately,
Head Instructor Lapointe

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
decided to resist arrest,
so I executed him.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
And who are these two?

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
Just some intruders.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
Though, they'll be
gone soon enough.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center

[QUO]
What's so funny?

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
Huh?

You betrayed me?

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what you
were expecting, my dear Quo.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
Facing off against a Sorcerer,
a Deep Dragon and two

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
highly-skilled Death
Instructors is a bit much

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center
for even me to handle.

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
I mean, what was I to
do against them?

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
So you turned your
back on your oath?

I'll be alright.
Focus on dealing with Quo.

[CARLOTTA] I think I've
had enough of this.

today is hollow.

[AZALIE, ORPHEN gasp]

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
[QUO] The key to destroying this
continent is right over there.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
The arbiter of destruction,

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
the sands of death blowing
here from the other world!

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
You've experienced
the Final Audience,

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
so you should know.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
It is only a matter of
time before the goddess

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
rips her way
through the barrier.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
All beings except for the
pure humans in Kimluck

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
face destruction.

been in vain, Salua.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
No matter how much you may
struggle, nothing will change.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
Each and every one of us are
nothing more than puppets.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
If it is the goddess's will
for me to die, then so be it.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
But I will make sure that every
filthy Sorcerer as well as

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
the oath breakers who
harbor them, perish with me!

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
For today, this world will be
returned to its rightful owner!

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
And at last,
this half-done courtyard

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
infested with snakes will
finally be transformed

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.508 position:50% align:center
into a paradise for
the gods, Yggdrasil!

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
Go!

The Ayrmankar are immortal.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
Something like that
won't kill her.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
But if her powers
weaken even a little,

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
the equilibrium will be broken,

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
and there'll be no one else to
stand in our goddess's way!

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
Very well! I offer up all
the lives in this universe,

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
so that this wretched world
can finally be reborn!

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
Oh Goddess, through you,
I will save this world!

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center

Is it just the cathedral?

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
What if it's affecting
all of Kimluck?

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
Or even the whole continent?

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN gasps]
Save us, Goddess.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
Stop that! There's no
time for prayer now.

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center

This is all your fault,
you big dummy!

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
Because of you, we got
teleported underground,

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
got washed away
and nearly drowned,

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
then fell through a ceiling
and got blasted by that

damn moneylender's
stupid Sorcery!

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
You mean we got lost,
a lil' wet, then we fell,

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
and afterwards our clothes
got slightly singed, don't you?

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
You planned this, right?

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center

yourself, could you?

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] That was just from
her arm shifting a little?

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
Are the Dragons even
strong enough to compete

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
against that kind of power?

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
They've hidden themselves
away in their sanctuary,

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center

powerful they actually are.

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I understand, now.
What he wanted.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.891 position:50% align:center
For all that time, our Master
was trying to find a successor

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
to replace the dying Dragons.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
He was fulfilling his
mother's last wish.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo, have you ever
heard of spirit forms?

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
No, never.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] It's a special
kind of White Sorcery.

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
It turns your body entirely
into a spiritual form.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
Not many know about it.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
Using it is risky because
you're freed from any

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
physical confines, so your
existence becomes unstable,

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
and can dissipate if
you're not careful.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
But in exchange,

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
your Sorcery increases
to the level of a Dragon.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
Wait a sec.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
That's impossible!

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
It is possible, if we use this.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
The Sword of Baldanders
can turn a physical form

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
into a spiritual one.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
There isn't another way.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
I'm the only person who can stay
alive even in a spirit form.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
And you're the only one who can
handle this sword other than me.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
We have to do this.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
I promised myself that I would
never lose my sister again,

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
no matter what.

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Our master left his own
time and travelled 200 years

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
into the future to
protect this world.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50% align:center
It's not just him, either.

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
Istersiva gave her life
for the founding Sorcerer.

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
She sent master to our time,

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
using the last vestiges
of her power to do so.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.468 position:50% align:center
I truly believe
everything they did

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
was so that we
could finish this.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
Even so, you shouldn't have
to sacrifice yourself!

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
Master didn't have to give up
his life in his own time,

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
or obey Istersiva's Sorcery.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
But he did,

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center
so that he could stop this
continent from being destroyed.

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
Even if you were a spirit form,

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
we don't stand a chance
against the goddess.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
Aureole is slowly
regaining her powers.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
She can't push back
the goddess by herself.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
But if I help her...

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center
I won't sacrifice you!

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.923 position:50% align:center
Alright then, I'll do it myself.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
You can't! It's too
dangerous if you try

00:16:07.217 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center
to transform yourself
with the sword!

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps, grunts]

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
Azalie, I won't let you do this!

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
That's why I was put here.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
My entire purpose in this
life has been to stop you!

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:30.782 position:50% align:center
I understand, now!

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
The reason why he raised me
to be the only one who could

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
stand up to you.
Why I became a stabber!

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
If Master wanted to kill you,

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center
he could have done
it at any time.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.960 position:50% align:center
But he knew he wouldn't be
able to go through with it.

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
To kill the one he loved most!

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
Here, then, I die to
protect you evermore.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
He trusted me to stop you.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
Master wanted me to be
able to do the things

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
that he knew he couldn't!

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I'm not gonna let you do this!

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
Five years ago, I failed you.
But not this time!

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
I'll stop you! Me! Krylancelo!

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
You aren't Krylancelo anymore,
you're Orphen.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
Aren't you?

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
Azalie!

Don't think this is over yet.

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
The founding Sorcerer's
powers are limited.

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
It is only a matter of time
before it all runs out.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
And when that happens,

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
another hole in the barrier
will appear on this continent.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
Our goddess will
return one day soon.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.958 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Are you sure you
don't need any more time

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
to recuperate?

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
I heard about some
nice hot springs

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
just over those mountains.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN]
I'm worried about Oleyl.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
I'll go see him. I'm sure
he's waiting for me.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
Then I'll figure out
where to go from there.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
We're oath breakers now.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
In the Church's eyes, we're just
as bad as you Sorcerers.

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
So they aren't gonna let us
rest easy, that's for sure.

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK]
Instructor Carlotta.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
I hereby appoint you head
of the Death Instructors.

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
The Church has experienced
unprecedented losses.

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
I expect you to
fulfill your duty.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
We'll be heading out now.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
Are you really sure
I can have this?

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
If not you, who else
would we give it to?

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
That's Childman's
dagger, anyways.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
Just take it. I mean,
all it does is remind us

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
how Oleyl got hurt
ten years ago.

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Master Childman.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo. In your opinion,

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
who would you say is undoubtedly
the best Sorcerer of all time?

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
Well?

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:43.159 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
Oh, um...

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] It's all right.
Have confidence.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm?

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
Come now, attack me.
Show me you full strength!

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's the
hold up, Orphen? Let's go!

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:02.679 position:50% align:center
Ready to hit the road, Master!

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
The road? What do you mean?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
That place you mentioned,
hot springs!

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
We better get moving,

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna get there
late and miss bath time!

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
Also, once we get there,

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
do you think you could give me
another lesson on Sorcery?

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Come on, you have to!

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
It feels like it's been
forever since the last one!

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.698 position:50% align:center
And there's so much that
I still have to learn!

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
Teach me everything
you know, Master!

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
I did it, Dortin!
Look at his face!

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
I bet he totally
crapped in his pants!

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
Behold the Attack From Far Away

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
and then Hang Him From a
Hanger Until He Dies Strategy!

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
I, Vulcano Volkan,
have vanquished yet another

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
evildoer with my mighty bow!

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Like hell you did, you punk!

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
Um, sir? Am I free to go?
I really don't want any trouble.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50% align:center
Do yourself a favor
and cut ties with this

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:51.436 position:50% align:center
good-for-nothing idiot!

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
I've actually been thinking
about that for a while.

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:55.648 position:50% align:center
Come on, Orphen!
Let's get out of here

00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:57.817 position:50% align:center
before that annoying
little bug wakes up.

00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
Let's get going, Master!

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:03.114 position:50% align:center
Hey, exactly how long do you
guys intend on following me?

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC, CLAIOMH]
Huh?

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:06.493 position:50% align:center
I meant, how long are
we gonna travel toge--

00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center
Forever, I guess.

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:14.042 position:50% align:center
Well, we'll have to see
where this journey leads.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:16.378 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH, MAJIC chuckle]
Hm!

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:22.008 position:50% align:center line:10%
â™ª

00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:57.836 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] A tear in the barrier
will eventually appear again.

00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:01.589 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] And she'll
be there, I can feel it.

00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:05.802 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I won't make the same mistakes.

00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:10.557 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
And then, I'll save her.
