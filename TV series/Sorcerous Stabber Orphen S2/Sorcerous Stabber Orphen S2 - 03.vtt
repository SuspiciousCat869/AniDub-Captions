00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
I was badly injured.

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
Not fighting through my
wounds was taken as

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
a dereliction of my duty,
for which I was cast out.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
Only a violent death
awaits you in Kimluck.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.460 position:50% align:center
There's nothing you can say that
will stop me from going there.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
An assassin working for the
church chose to help me out,

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
knowing I'm a Sorcerer.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
I knew there was something
bigger going on.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
Is your life worth
so little to you?

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
I can worry all I want about
how I die and what for,

00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:59.974 position:50% align:center
but those worries will
be gone when I'm dead.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
Whether I die of
old age in 50 years

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
or someone kills me tomorrow,
I'll still be dead.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
You're a bit young to be
such a nihilist, aren't you?

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
That's not it.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
Death could come for me at any
time, so if I can't escape it,

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
I just have to constantly
be ready for a fight.

[ORPHEN exhales]

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
I've always been
terrified of death.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
And true. For a Sorcerer
who fears death,

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
going to Kimluck is
completely insane.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center
If I could just get him
to understand this fear.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.590 position:50% align:center
Then I could be sure he's ready
for full-bore combat training.

The past and the present...

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center

Hm. Thank you.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
[MALE INSTRUCTOR A] In fact,
I was hoping I could speak

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
with him today.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
I intended to ask him
about training my son

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
in the art of swordsmanship.

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
I understand that your
brother is a highly

accomplished swordsman.

[VOLKAN]
I'll show you melons.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.761 position:50% align:center
Argh! Just because
that lady told me to go

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
do her shopping for her doesn't
mean I'm actually gonna do it!

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
Okay, but she gave you money,
and you took it and came here.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
All of that is true.
And what of it?!

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
That woman tried to bribe me,
so I'm keeping the money 

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
she gave me as compensation
for that insult!

I guess we're gonna see
how that works out for us.

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
And if all else fails, I'll
track down that lady in black

and hang her with
her dumb suspenders.

If she wants me
to cut her loose,

have to pay the toll!

[DORTIN] What you're describing

would go smoothly.

Don't say that word out

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
in the middle of a city
where every last person

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
hates Sorcerers with
a burning passion!

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
Almost as much as us!
Screw Sorcerers!

That's Yggdrasil Cathedral.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center

I got close enough to
those walls to touch them,

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.727 position:50% align:center
but my projection still
couldn't get inside.

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
What kind of countermeasures
do they have access to?

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center
The Celestials' spatial
transfer device didn't work.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
I can't say for certain
what kind of defenses

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
the church might have set up
surrounding the cathedral,

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
but they work against
Nornir Sorcery.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Strange, considering
the Dragon Faiths

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
are outlawed here.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
In any case, seems I
have no choice

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
but to infiltrate the
place on foot.

[coughs]

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
Damn. What's up
with all the sand?

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN] You'd best try
not to breathe it in.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
It's impossible to grow
anything in the stuff,

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
and people tend to get sick
with too much exposure.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
The area's not a desert,

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
but it's caught in an
endless sandstorm.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
This place alone for 200 years.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
We left the inn
three days ago, now.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
And we've finally
reached the outer city.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
As long as you try not
to do anything stupid

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
from here on out,
I'm fairly confident

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
that we can get where
we're going without issue.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center
Are you really expecting
me to stay calm?

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
You're about to smuggle
me into a giant city

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center
with thousands of people
who'd all be more than happy

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
to burn me alive if
they caught wind of me.

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
Who said to stay calm?

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
What I said was "try not
to do anything stupid."

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
Keep quiet. Don't get jumpy.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.102 position:50% align:center
Avoid drawing attention
to yourself, that's all.

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.438 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
What's with the clothes?

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:41.358 position:50% align:center
I don't know why, but this
color is really creepy.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
Your clothes would
stand out too much.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
Black is strictly for formal
occasions in Kimluck.

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Glad Claiomh's
not here to laugh at me.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
As long as we're on
that subject...

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.161 position:50% align:center
Did you not bring those
two along because

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:56.039 position:50% align:center
you're still not convinced
you can trust me?

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
It's not that I don't trust you.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.919 position:50% align:center
Otherwise I wouldn't be going
along with your plan, either.

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
But if there's even
the slightest chance

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
I'm wrong about you,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
I can't allow myself to put
those kids in harm's way.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN] So you left them
at the inn with Oleyl,

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
who's also with the
Kimluck Church.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:15.308 position:50% align:center
Who's to say he wouldn't
hand them over himself?

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe the old
man I talked to at that inn

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.105 position:50% align:center
used to be a Death
Instructor like you.

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
One of the best,
and still a great mentor.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
So exactly how many
of you are there

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
in the Church's official
hit squad, anyway?

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
There are six at the moment.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
Meaning if a Sorcerer were
somehow to make their way 

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
into Kimluck, there would
only be six people

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:34.619 position:50% align:center
who could put up a fight.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
And killing Sorcerers
isn't your only job, is it?

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
What else?

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
We kill any instructors
who preach heresy.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN]
Also.

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.226 position:50% align:center
Collecting intel in Tafrem
and the Royal Capital.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
And investigating ruins.

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
When the church needs
something done

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
that a normal
instructor can't do,

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.567 position:50% align:center
they call on us.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN] Though as far
as the public knows,

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
we all have the same job.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
Oleyl told me that he
had to retire from being

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
