You think I'd know that?

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
I poof into this room with
these, like, operating tables?

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center

the door and I find--

But then suddenly
there's all these dolls!

And so I'm like,
"Do something, Leki!"

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
And obviously that just
makes everything worse!

Thanks, I think you've given me
more than enough to go on.

I got here or what's going on.

Childman's legacy.

His most powerful

[DEMON KING DOLL]
Sister Istersiva.

Did you say, "Istersiva"?

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.723 position:50% align:center
The last head priestess
of the Nornir?

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
[DEMON KING DOLL]
Two hundred years ago,

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
our creators were
stricken with a curse,

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
and the future of their kind
was taken away from them.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
The gift of Sorcery you bear
shall be lost to you in time.

Your kind faces the same fate.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center
"My kind."
Do you mean Sorcerers?

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
[DEMON KING DOLL] This place
was built to spread a warning

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
to all Sorcerers.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
Spare me that bullcrap!
How many people have you killed

in the name of
your damn warning?

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
[DEMON KING DOLL]
I have only done

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
as I have been ordered to do.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center

[DEMON KING A] Would you
call forth the Basilitrice?

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
[GODDESS A] No. I mean to
enlist your angel and devil.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
[DEMON KING A] Surely you jest.
Their power is vast.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
Indeed, far beyond even
my ability to control.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
[GODDESS A] It is.
And with that vast power,

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.812 position:50% align:center
I shall destroy all of the units
which have brought forth

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
the Sorcery that
corrupts this world.

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
The balance of this realm
has been disrupted.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
It falls upon us to restore it.

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
I have seen that the
fall of their kind

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
shall be from the greatest
height of prosperity.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
[DEMON KING A] You speak
so freely of their fall,

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.707 position:50% align:center
but were they not your angels?

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center

If this world is to be saved,
she can do naught

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center

She's a goddess?

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.415 position:50% align:center
That must mean she was
one of the three sisters

who control the past,
present, and future.

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center

go down hard, and I stuck
around all this time,

Yeah, I was there,

he'd gone inside the theatre.

She could have let gravity
do its thing, but no,

she just had to go stop that
jerk and all his jerk friends

be useful to us.

[VOLKAN chuckles]
Indeed!

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
I'll use her to get
to the loan shark.

It'll be easy to manipulate her

I'm gonna say that's the exact

[MADCHEN]
I'd known them longer than that.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
The building had been
kept off the map,

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
and yet you knew
about it somehow.

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
Did you come from Kimluck?

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
[MADCHEN]
This theatre.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
The church had been ordered
by the Royal Family

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
to raze it to the ground.

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
They reported that they'd
destroyed it, but they hadn't.

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
They let it sit undisturbed
for a while after that,

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:05.747 position:50% align:center
till I offered to
explore it for them.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
Explore?

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
I should introduce myself.
The name's Mädchen Amick.

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN sighs]
Only proper, right? And I'm--

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
Salua mentioned you.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
The one Childman
made his successor.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
The greatest talent of
your generation at the

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
Tower of Fangs, the Black
Sorcerer Krylancelo.

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
Salua!

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me you're
also a Death Instructor?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.654 position:50% align:center
He said that you'd find your
way to this place eventually

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.698 position:50% align:center
and he warned us to be
ready for a hard battle

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
when you showed up.

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
You know the mission
of a Death Instructor.

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:47.497 position:50% align:center
We're to kill any
Sorcerers on sight.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.082 position:50% align:center
Except we made a deal.

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
So instead, you're going
to get me into Kimluck.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
I trust you're not planning
to stab me in the back.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
No. I'm not.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.429 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't even be alive if
that girl hadn't shown up.

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't be right to
hurt someone she cares for.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
Not while I still
owe her, at least.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
What about your mission?

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
I don't follow Ramonirok,
but the goddesses.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
The three who control fate.

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
I serve the Weird Sisters,
and them alone.

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center
Then what was it
that made you decide

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.659 position:50% align:center
to become a Death Instructor?

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
I wanted to stay
in Kimluck, so--

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
Hey, Orphen! How come we
don't have any food?

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.420 position:50% align:center
'Cause you took the last edible
piece of meat we had last night!

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
Like that was supposed to
be enough to hold me over

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:40.467 position:50% align:center
all this time? Hurry up and
get us more food right now!

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
There is none!

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
Ya gonna make me do it?

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:45.430 position:50% align:center
Ya gonna make me eat
roast monster, huh?

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
Well, fine then!

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center

Claiomh, you can't!

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
I can and I am!

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
You could just bring
them back to the inn

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:52.228 position:50% align:center
where I've been staying.

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
There's more than
enough food there.

00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
Really?! Thank you!

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center
Could be a long walk, though.
Just one bite for the road.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
It's not a bluff, Master!
She'll really do it!

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:07.202 position:50% align:center
Do not put that in your mouth!

you're getting cold feet?
