you have some killer timing.

Hmph.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
Look up. That was
a serious question.

Sorcery gives us access.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
And in order to call up
our power, we use spells.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center

Right now I'm not able
to weave my spells.

The church's pride and joy.

it needed to be so damn big.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
I know the pope who had the
place built was named Ramonirok,

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
but that's the name of
the current pope, too.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] It's mostly a fortress
built to keep outsiders

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
from reaching the sanctuary.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
Was that when they built
the gigantic network

of tunnels underneath
the whole city, too?

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
None of that passageway
was built by humans.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
You should have known that
much just by looking at it.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
If it wasn't humans,
then who was it?

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center

Hm? I'm honestly stumped.

Well you can at
least piece together

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
what you do know, right?

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
Like you said, it clearly
wasn't built by humans.

It's been there a while.

The construction looks a
lot like Celestial ruins,

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
but it deteriorates like a
man-made structure.

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center

No idea.

Okay. You gonna tell us or not?

more with your head

be that decayed.

But then, maybe it hadn't
been abandoned the way most

[CHILDMAN] Long, long ago,
only a hundred years

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
after humans reached the
continent of Kiesalhima,

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
I was born as a human Sorcerer.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
A boy named Alfred Mynes.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
I was a ward of the Celestials,

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
a disciple of
their leader, Istersiva.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
From her I learned
Sorcery, combat,

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
and the ways of
the world at large.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] She asked that
I serve as the intermediary

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.724 position:50% align:center
between the Celestials
and mankind,

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
so I took dominion over a
region that humans had settled,

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
which lay close
to the sanctuary.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] I lived in the
service of many kings,

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
Dragon and human, and for my
dual allegiances I was branded

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
with the title, Doppel X,
the mark of a traitor.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
But then, the Celestials...

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
Weird Dragons, the very mothers
of Sorcery in humankind,

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
turned their powers against
their own children

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
and began to hunt us down.

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
The Nornir created the Killing
Dolls to exterminate us.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
Sorcerers perished in droves.

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:48.138 position:50% align:center
And Tafrem, the city of
Sorcerers was reduced to ash.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
Istersiva had been the one to
suggest that the Celestials

to assure the survival

vilified and cast out.

And now, in order to
bring the war to a close.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
There, they established

of this existence.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
And they created a way
to access this system.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
That is Sorcery.

[ISTERSIVA] But there was
a tear in the fabric of

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
the Ayrmankar Barrier.

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:22.649 position:50% align:center
And through this tear, the
goddess Verthandi would send

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
the monster Basilitrice,
whose poison would

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
take a horrific toll
upon the Celestials.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.616 position:50% align:center
The males of the Celestial
species were nearly eradicated

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
at once, leaving us on
the path to extinction.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:38.331 position:50% align:center
I had suggested that we might
intermingle with humans,

00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
in order to preserve ourselves,
and for this, the Dragons

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
decried me, saying I'd
saddled your kind with

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
the Goddesses' curse in my
efforts to save our own,

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
and cast me out
of the sanctuary.

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
Is it this for which
I am condemned to die?

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
So it is. The birth of human
Sorcerers is your sin.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
It was no sin at all
to grant you our gift!

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
Our existence made
this war inevitable.

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
Your "gift" brought
us death and misery!

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
Now I see. Again I'm
despised for my efforts,

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
and by those I sought to save.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
Yes.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
When our ancestors who first
settled the Kiesalhima continent

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
faced extinction, your kind
offered them salvation.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
In the years to follow,
we prospered under your rule.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
Our devotion to you
has been unwavering.

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
Through the years we have
loved and worshipped you.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
You betrayed us.

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
I know nothing of any betrayal!

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] We humans who
bear the gift of Sorcery.

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
Our loyalty has been
rewarded with death.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
We serve the sanctuary,

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
yet they would visit such
unspeakable violence upon us.

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.816 position:50% align:center
Tafrem was razed to the ground.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
There's nothing left
there but rubble,

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:51.613 position:50% align:center
save for that damned
World-Seeing Tower you built!

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
A useless monument to the
ones who butchered our kind!

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] That tower will
be the salvation of humanity!

00:17:58.036 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
Decades from now,

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
the World Transcript shall have
fully materialized within.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
I have also prepared the

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
Kamisunda Underground
Theatre for your future use.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:10.090 position:50% align:center
What's this? Salvation?

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
You've said nothing
of this before!

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
Never for a moment was your
devotion to us in doubt,

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
and we have loved you
just as you have loved us.

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50% align:center
For that love we
held our silence.

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
The destruction
that's come to pass.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
It is this we sought to avert.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
I still don't
understand, Mother.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] You must,
if your kind is to survive,

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
for you are to become the
successors to the Dragons.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
You are the seventh unit.

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
And within the
ground beneath us,

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
within the continent
of Kiesalhima,

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
where we once sought refuge,
lies the key of destruction.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
Key of destruction?

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
Now you learn a grim reality.

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
Is what you say truth?

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.228 position:50% align:center
"Truth" is too noble
a word, but indeed.

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
My words describe the
reality of what has been.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
And therefore I must
end your life.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
You were the one who created me!

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
How now?

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
Must you also become
the one to destroy me?

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] I've told you,
you shall not be destroyed.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps] By this, do you mean
that I am to be reincarnated?

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] Reincarnation is
the law of the gods,

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
the very same who have
long since condemned us

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
and unwound the
threads of our fate.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
We put no stock in it.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
I was the one who brought
you into this world.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.597 position:50% align:center
Indeed, you could be no
better prepared for this

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
than I have made you.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
In Sorcery, in all aspects,

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
you shall become unsurpassable.

you down to atoms

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
and reconstitute you in
another time and place.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
And this shall be my
final feat of Sorcery.

your body will be destroyed,

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
it shall be recreated
elsewhere on the continent,

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
unchanged by time.

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
But you mustn't!

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center
You don't have the strength
left to survive casting a spell

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
of that magnitude.
It'll kill you!

If you wish, it is well within
your abilities to evade
