[ORPHEN]
What is this about?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.430 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] They have a dumping
ground for corpses?

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.223 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
So it seems.

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.851 position:50% align:center
They must drop 'em in
through the hole up there.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.979 position:50% align:center
Isn't it weird to
dispose of your dead

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
by tossing them on a pile?

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:24.733 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, MAJIC gasp]

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
They just transferred!

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
So what're we
supposed to do now?

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
The only thing we can do. Climb.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.048 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, MAJIC grunt]

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.967 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
That's as high as it goes.

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Guess there's nothing
left but the hard part.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:20.598 position:50% align:center
I scale thee now...

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.852 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50% align:center
[gasps, groans]

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Master?

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
Yeah. Nothing serious.

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Okay. I'll give it a try.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.908 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] I ascend thee,
Heavenly Snowy Mountain!

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Majic, you can't!

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
[gasps, yells]

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.511 position:50% align:center
You wanna get yourself killed?

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's how
you do it, jackass!

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
Your body froze up?

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Uh-huh...

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
Let me take a guess.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.023 position:50% align:center
This has happened to
you more than once.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
Using Sorcery usually does it?

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
Especially when I
use a bigger spell.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.112 position:50% align:center
It really wears me out.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.156 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
I don't think you have any idea

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.742 position:50% align:center
how much danger you've
been putting yourself in.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
But wouldn't most people
get fatigued using Sorcery?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
You don't know a damn thing!

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:26.373 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
Have you noticed that
it doesn't happen

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center
when your spells are successful?

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
This isn't fatigue from
using too much mana.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
That would happen whether
a spell worked or not.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
You're causing damage
to your body.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
Weakening yourself.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts] You can
barely control your power

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.726 position:50% align:center
and your whole body is absorbing
the strain of using it.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
Hear me?

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
Sorcery will destroy you if you
can't learn how to control it!

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
Okay, but what was I supposed
to do in that situation?

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
You tried something
and it didn't work,

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
so did you expect me to just
sit around doing nothing?

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
You can't seriously be
angry at me for trying

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
to get us out of this hole!

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
What's that look for?

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
If I didn't know any better,

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
I would almost think that
you were jealous of me!

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH screams]

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC, ORPHEN gasp]

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
It's a dungeon and that sucks.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
When someone locked up
in here keels over,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
they must haul 'em out and
dump their corpse in the hole.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
Why does that suck
for us, though?

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] If it's a dungeon,
then the only other ways out

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
are all gonna be
heavily guarded.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
And I don't think they're
gonna be willing

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
to let us leave here
without a fight.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
But we have our Sorcery,

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
and once we're able
to track down Claiomh,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
we can probably get some use
out of Leki's power, too.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
I think we can take 'em!

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
As of now, you're not allowed
to use Sorcery anymore.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
Master, where is this
coming from all of a sudden?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
We're trapped down here.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
This isn't the time
for us to hold back!

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
We're not negotiating.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
This is an order and
you're gonna follow it.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
Disobey me and your
training ends early.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
Is that clear?

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
Master...

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
Shut up! Enough talking.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Hold on!
Why are you acting like this?

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.226 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
Claiomh?

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]
Orphen!

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
I remember the water
coming down the tunnel,

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
and then I was in a cage!

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
It was like some
kinda freaky dream!

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
In a bad way,
so nightmare would

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
probably be the better word,
and now I'm in a dungeon!

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
Why would anyone ever
wanna go to a dungeon?

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
They don't, which is kind of
the whole point of a dungeon.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
So anyway, while I
was sitting there,

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
I sorta figured out why Leki
would zap us here, and then--

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
Wait! Guys, I think
we're in danger!

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Specifically?

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
Look there!

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that's really weird.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
Did the dead person in
my cell just disappear?

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] I must have been
sleeping a while.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH yells]

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Salua?

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It looks like you finally
found your way into Kimluck,

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
eh, Krylancelo?

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
It's Orphen.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
[SALUA groans]

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
So she thought I was dead.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I can hardly
blame her for that.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
Orphen. You know this guy?

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
We've met him before,
back in Fenrir's Forest.

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] But you wouldn't
have seen his face,

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
since you knocked
him out from behind.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
Right! It's way easier to
knock somebody unconscious

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
when you don't
know their face!

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
He's an assassin for the church.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
The Death Instructor,
Salua Solude.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right?

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
Pfft. You toss my name
around and it's fine.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Still got the
energy to mouth off.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
You can't have been in
here very long, then.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
Two days in this place
isn't nearly as easy

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
as you make it out to be.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
Have a little chat with
the interrogators yourself.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
Let's find out how you fare.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
I've seen how that would end,

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.038 position:50% align:center
with my corpse getting
dropped into a hole,

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
so I'll just take
your word for it.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center
I think I hear the guards!

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] The guards always
show up in pairs.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
We're too far down
to be heard up above,

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN] Where the heck did
that Sorcerer lady run off to?

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
I certainly did put her
through the wringer.

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
I made it clear that her
violence was unacceptable.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
But that hardly excuses
her abandoning us

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the
night like this!

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
Women these days
act like children,

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center

[DORTIN] Not sure that's got
anything to do with this.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
Big Bro, did you really
go off on that Sorcerer?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
The way I laid into her, there's
no way she wouldn't break!

Bam!

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
When you said "laid into her,"

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.486 position:50% align:center
you meant, "tried to
guilt trip her?"

you have some killer timing.

Hmph.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
Look up. That was
a serious question.

Sorcery gives us access.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
And in order to call up
our power, we use spells.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center

Right now I'm not able
to weave my spells.

The church's pride and joy.

it needed to be so damn big.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
I know the pope who had the
place built was named Ramonirok,

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
but that's the name of
the current pope, too.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] It's mostly a fortress
built to keep outsiders

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
from reaching the sanctuary.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
Was that when they built
the gigantic network

of tunnels underneath
the whole city, too?

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
None of that passageway
was built by humans.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
You should have known that
much just by looking at it.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
If it wasn't humans,
then who was it?

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center

Hm? I'm honestly stumped.

Well you can at
least piece together

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
what you do know, right?

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
Like you said, it clearly
wasn't built by humans.

It's been there a while.

The construction looks a
lot like Celestial ruins,

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
but it deteriorates like a
man-made structure.

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center

No idea.

Okay. You gonna tell us or not?

more with your head

be that decayed.

But then, maybe it hadn't
been abandoned the way most

[CHILDMAN] Long, long ago,
only a hundred years

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
after humans reached the
continent of Kiesalhima,

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
I was born as a human Sorcerer.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
A boy named Alfred Mynes.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
I was a ward of the Celestials,

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
a disciple of
their leader, Istersiva.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
From her I learned
Sorcery, combat,

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
and the ways of
the world at large.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] She asked that
I serve as the intermediary

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.724 position:50% align:center
between the Celestials
and mankind,

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
so I took dominion over a
region that humans had settled,

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
which lay close
to the sanctuary.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] I lived in the
service of many kings,

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
Dragon and human, and for my
dual allegiances I was branded

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
with the title, Doppel X,
the mark of a traitor.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
But then, the Celestials...

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
Weird Dragons, the very mothers
of Sorcery in humankind,

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
turned their powers against
their own children

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
and began to hunt us down.

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
The Nornir created the Killing
Dolls to exterminate us.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
Sorcerers perished in droves.

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:48.138 position:50% align:center
And Tafrem, the city of
Sorcerers was reduced to ash.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
Istersiva had been the one to
suggest that the Celestials

to assure the survival

vilified and cast out.

And now, in order to
bring the war to a close.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
There, they established

of this existence.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
And they created a way
to access this system.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
That is Sorcery.

[ISTERSIVA] But there was
a tear in the fabric of

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
the Ayrmankar Barrier.

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:22.649 position:50% align:center
And through this tear, the
goddess Verthandi would send

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
the monster Basilitrice,
whose poison would

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
take a horrific toll
upon the Celestials.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:31.616 position:50% align:center
The males of the Celestial
species were nearly eradicated

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
at once, leaving us on
the path to extinction.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:38.331 position:50% align:center
I had suggested that we might
intermingle with humans,

00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
in order to preserve ourselves,
and for this, the Dragons

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
decried me, saying I'd
saddled your kind with

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
the Goddesses' curse in my
efforts to save our own,

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
and cast me out
of the sanctuary.

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
Is it this for which
I am condemned to die?

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
So it is. The birth of human
Sorcerers is your sin.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
It was no sin at all
to grant you our gift!

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
Our existence made
this war inevitable.

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
Your "gift" brought
us death and misery!

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
Now I see. Again I'm
despised for my efforts,

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
and by those I sought to save.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
Yes.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
When our ancestors who first
settled the Kiesalhima continent

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
faced extinction, your kind
offered them salvation.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
In the years to follow,
we prospered under your rule.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
Our devotion to you
has been unwavering.

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
Through the years we have
loved and worshipped you.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
You betrayed us.

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
I know nothing of any betrayal!

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] We humans who
bear the gift of Sorcery.

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
Our loyalty has been
rewarded with death.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
We serve the sanctuary,

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
yet they would visit such
unspeakable violence upon us.

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.816 position:50% align:center
Tafrem was razed to the ground.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
There's nothing left
there but rubble,

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:51.613 position:50% align:center
save for that damned
World-Seeing Tower you built!

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
A useless monument to the
ones who butchered our kind!

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] That tower will
be the salvation of humanity!

00:17:58.036 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
Decades from now,

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
the World Transcript shall have
fully materialized within.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
I have also prepared the

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
Kamisunda Underground
Theatre for your future use.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:10.090 position:50% align:center
What's this? Salvation?

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
You've said nothing
of this before!

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
Never for a moment was your
devotion to us in doubt,

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
and we have loved you
just as you have loved us.

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50% align:center
For that love we
held our silence.

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
The destruction
that's come to pass.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
It is this we sought to avert.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
I still don't
understand, Mother.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] You must,
if your kind is to survive,

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
for you are to become the
successors to the Dragons.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
You are the seventh unit.

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
And within the
ground beneath us,

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
within the continent
of Kiesalhima,

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
where we once sought refuge,
lies the key of destruction.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
Key of destruction?

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
Now you learn a grim reality.

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
Is what you say truth?

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.228 position:50% align:center
"Truth" is too noble
a word, but indeed.

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:08.773 position:50% align:center
My words describe the
reality of what has been.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
And therefore I must
end your life.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
You were the one who created me!

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
How now?

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
Must you also become
the one to destroy me?

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] I've told you,
you shall not be destroyed.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps] By this, do you mean
that I am to be reincarnated?

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] Reincarnation is
the law of the gods,

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
the very same who have
long since condemned us

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
and unwound the
threads of our fate.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
We put no stock in it.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
I was the one who brought
you into this world.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.597 position:50% align:center
Indeed, you could be no
better prepared for this

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
than I have made you.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
In Sorcery, in all aspects,

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
you shall become unsurpassable.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
These glyphs shall break
you down to atoms

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
and reconstitute you in
another time and place.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
And this shall be my
final feat of Sorcery.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:58.031 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA]
When the glyphs touch you,

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
your body will be destroyed,
and years hence,

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
it shall be recreated
elsewhere on the continent,

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
unchanged by time.

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
But you mustn't!

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:09.417 position:50% align:center
You don't have the strength
left to survive casting a spell

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
of that magnitude.
It'll kill you!

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
If you wish, it is well within
your abilities to evade

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.967 position:50% align:center
these glyphs, and then
there would be nothing left

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
to impede you from taking my
life as you came here to do.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
If my plan succeeds and you
should someday live again,

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
it shall be
incumbent upon you

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
to rear up those who might
protect this continent

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
even after you have passed on.

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
Soldiers who do not fear
the Killing Dolls.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
Who can stand as equals
against the sanctuary.

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, your kind
shall be doomed.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
Here, then, I die to
protect you evermore.

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN yells]

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:59.134 position:50% align:center
[ISTERSIVA] For all of you
are my beloved children.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
The moon... is gone.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.864 position:50% align:center
Is this... the world I left?

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
That means... it survived.

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
The World-Seeing Tower.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
Is that Tafrem?

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
Hark, o Light.

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:40.467 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] In my first life, the
world knew me as Alfred Mynes.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
The lone disciple
of Sister Istersiva.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
The one who she
raised as her child.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
The fruit of that hateful war.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
I am born anew from the powder
field, but forever her child.

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
My name shall be Childman.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] Istersiva left
just one question unanswered.

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:05.617 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
Who will be the successor?

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:12.457 position:50% align:center line:10%
â™ª

00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:40.837 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] What good am
I without my Sorcery?

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.840 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Well you're still a
good person, so it'll work out!
