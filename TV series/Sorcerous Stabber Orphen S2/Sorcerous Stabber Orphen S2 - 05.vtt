[gasps]

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center

And not a moment too soon.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
You've caught up
with me already?

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
[NAME] If you'd missed his
voice and kept running,

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.737 position:50% align:center
I could easily have cut
you down from behind.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
You're quite the lucky one.

[NAME]
I can't have them killing you.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
That's my privilege.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
Now, then...

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:58.510 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I unsheathe thee.
Sword of Light!

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts] I repair thee.
Scars of the Sunset.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
[NAME] That last incantation.
"Sword of Light," was it?

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
I suggest you don't use it here.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
That kind of power could
shake these walls apart.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
The flash flooding would
bring the whole tunnel

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center

Hey, thanks for the advice.

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
At least I know that if
worse comes to worst,

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
I can make sure you and
your lackeys all drown!

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
[NAME]
Really?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
Should I take that to
mean you've given up

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
on the notion of
leaving this place alive?

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
If you expect me to
give up, you're a fool.

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center

Laniote.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
Those kids with you.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
The guards have them surrounded.

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.650 position:50% align:center
Surely you're not willing to
leave them to their fates.

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
Your fight is with me.

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
[NAME] The guards wouldn't
lose sleep over the lives

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
of two heathen children,
nor would I.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
So, what will you do?

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center
[QUO] Have we heard
anything from Name yet?

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
[MALE HOLY GUARD A]
We believe he's currently

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.217 position:50% align:center
in the passageways
beneath the city.

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
He must be anticipating
a harsh battle.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.639 position:50% align:center
[MALE HOLY GUARD A]
With a Sorcerer, we believe.

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
Any reinforcements will have
to find them in the tunnels.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
Name will handle this himself.

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
[MALE HOLY GUARD A gasps]

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
Out of all the
Death Instructors,

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
he's the best equipped to
fight a Sorcerer head-on.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center
His resolve borders on inhuman.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You lured me into a
secret underground passageway

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
where using my Sorcery
could get me killed,

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
and you took my friends hostage.

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
Even for a Death Instructor,

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
that strikes me as
a little excessive.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
It seems like you
really want me dead!

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center
[NAME] I'm being realistic
about my chances.

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
Three amateurs can easily
defeat a veteran warrior

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
in a straight fight.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
A single human can only
become so strong.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
But of course, you would
know nothing about that.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
Sorcerers face no
such limitations.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
Your power can't be
measured against ours.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center

why I would go so far,
can't you, Krylancelo?

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
It's clear.

[NAME] To borrow your phrasing,
I really want you dead.

itself, piece after piece.

Indeed.

In order to effectively
combat Sorcerers,

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center

the limits of human capability

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.593 position:50% align:center
using drugs.

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
A choice he made readily,

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center
even knowing it would
come at a grave price.

Are you out of your mind?

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center

I'm only being realistic,

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:42.692 position:50% align:center
and I trust in the
power I've taken on.

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
I have to believe in it,
if I hope to stand against

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center

to you Sorcerers at birth!

Would you believe 17?

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
That's the toll these drugs
take on the user's body.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
Half the life I was born with

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
has already been given
back to the gods.

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
What else should I offer up to
them in the time I have left?

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
I certainly shouldn't
pass up the opportunity

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
to hand them your head!

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center

Can I do this?
Do I have a choice?

And to what end?

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
Still, the gods
turn away from me!

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
I've offered up my life.

Travelled the violent path
of the Death Instructors.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
Yet, they bestow the Final
Audience to mad Sorcerer spies.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
To heretic priests
who profane the faith!

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.772 position:50% align:center
Never to me.

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
I see now, Krylancelo.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
You, as well.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
You've come in search of the
Final Audience, haven't you?

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
They brought you here!

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center

Of course!

at me, it's been bothering me.

I didn't get why Master
refused to acknowledge me.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
I got hung up on it,
and I got mad.

[MAJIC] 'Cause I know
I can handle myself.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
[NAME] I've freely offered the
whole of my being to the gods.

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center
Could all I gave them
still not be enough?

Krylancelo, am I going to die?

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You said you gave up
half your life to the gods.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
Maybe they took more from
you than you realized.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
You asked me before if
I was out of my mind,

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
but look at how you
clutch that hand.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
You sacrificed it
without hesitation,

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
knowing that if it
shattered against my body,

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
you could heal it with Sorcery.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
You're hardly fit to judge

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
if anyone else is in their
right mind, are you?

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
I understand. I don't
think you're crazy.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center

Yes. I'm glad to hear that.

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
Such sweet satisfaction.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50% align:center
Yet the price must
still be paid in full.

Die, Krylancelo.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
A life can only be
repaid with a life!

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
That's justice.

00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
Give your life.

What happened?
