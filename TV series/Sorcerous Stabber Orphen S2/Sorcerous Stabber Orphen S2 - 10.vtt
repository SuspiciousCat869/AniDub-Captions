Let's see.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.788 position:50% align:center
The Dragons originally stole
the secrets of Sorcery

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:46.458 position:50% align:center
from the gods, then fled
and brought it here,

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center

just like Master.

it's really about me?

The only way he would have
taken me aside like that

was if he knew you and
I would fight someday,

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'd be satisfied
with that kind of life,

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
but I never could.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
It's not about you.
My home is where Childman is.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able to rest
until I'm at his side again.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Childman is dead.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
I know.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I killed him
of my own free will,

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
and that's exactly why
I have to do this.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
Well you're not gonna
be joining him,

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
because I'm not gonna let you!

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
It all has changed now,

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
and it can never go back
to the way it was before.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
You said it yourself.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Quit trying
to change the subject.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.485 position:50% align:center
Then you say we should try
and build something close?

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
You're a fool.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
You've started regressing
to the old Krylancelo,

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
the kid you were.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.576 position:50% align:center
That's the most
likely explanation

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
for your Sorcery failing.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
You have to overcome whatever
it is that's setting you back

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
and make up the
progress you've lost,

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
or you'll be stuck like this
for the rest of your life.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.378 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] It all started
with this sword.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
If I want to call myself
Childman's successor,

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
I have to understand everything
there is to know about him.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
That's why I've come this far.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
Where better to learn his story
than the place where it began,

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
where he first made
himself known as a Stabber?

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
It's thanks to my actions
that he's no longer

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
a part of this world.

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
I believe this is
how I can atone.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
If I can understand his goals,
and continue his work,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
his life won't have
gone to waste.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
Now, let's go.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.544 position:50% align:center
It's time to find
out what he saw

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
in the Hall of the Great Poet.
That's why he led us here.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us,
Aureole's hanging around.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing she knows plenty.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] The hell's the deal
with that arm, though?

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
That is the key of destruction.
And the lock is here.

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
What does that mean?

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
[QUO] It is also the goddess
that we worship.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
That's her?

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Then we're seeing the arm

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
of the goddess
Verthandi herself?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
Was the World Transcript wrong?

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
It said that Aureole was
successful in repelling her.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
But only once.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Float.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
Like all the gods,

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
the goddess despises those who
use the stolen power of Sorcery.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
And the Kimluck Church
worships her, so naturally,

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
her will is reflected
in your doctrine,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
and you seek to destroy Sorcery.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
You seem to have
misunderstood our doctrine.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
We do not seek to eradicate all
Sorcery, only that of your kind.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
We mean to correct
the disastrous error

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
that granted the power
to Humans, nothing more.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
There's a doll!

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
What? It can transfer?

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Azalie!

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
Move it!

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
The vulgar creature
standing before you

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
is the student of Childman
Powderfield himself.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
Lord Ramonirok.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
That's Ramonirok?

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] That doll's the
Pope of the Kimluck Church?

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK]
You need not hasten your death.

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
Tsk!

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
That's White Sorcery!

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] Indeed, and a far
cry from the crude facsimile

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
you've seen from that girl.

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
The hell is this?

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
Why is the Pope of the
Kimluck Church using Sorcery?

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
And why is a doll weaving
spells like a human?

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
They should only be
capable of silent Sorcery

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
using Celestial glyphs!

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] I am not one of the
dolls created by the Celestials,

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
but rather, their forerunner.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
In this body, the Celestials
found their inspiration.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.830 position:50% align:center
There is a question I am
compelled to ask of you.

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
It is within my power to
take the knowledge I seek,

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
but your frail kind often
break under such strain.

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
I would sooner you told me.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
The man who trained you.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
The one you call by the name,
"Childman Powderfield."

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
Where is he now?

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
My master?

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK]
He is the only one of your kind

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
who is worthy to
stand before me.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:19.359 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I can't move.
Mental domination?

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK]
Stay back, Quo.

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] Three hundred
years ago, when the war between

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
the gods and the Dragons
reached its bloody climax.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.539 position:50% align:center
The six founding Sorcerers,

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.874 position:50% align:center
each the most powerful
among their race,

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
exercised their strength as one.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
And together, they erected a
barrier over this continent,

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
one that even the gods
could not penetrate.

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
This was the
Ayrmankar Barrier.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] But there was
a tear in its fabric,

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
through which the goddess
Verthandi sent vicious monsters

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.607 position:50% align:center
again and again to
terrorize the Dragons.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] In time,
the goddess would attempt

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
to cross the breach and
invade their realm herself.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
But Aureole, foremost among
the founding Sorcerers,

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
was able to expel
Verthandi once again, 

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:21.212 position:50% align:center
putting her own life
at risk in the process.

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK]
One century later,

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
when I was but a man
called Segwa Olympus,

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
I came to investigate the
ruins of Fort Ragnarok.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
Could that be...?

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:44.861 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] It was here
that by happenstance,

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
I crossed paths with the goddess

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:55.663 position:50% align:center
and became the founding
Sorcerer of humankind.

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
My eyes turned green,
transformed permanently,

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
as all mortal eyes which
gaze upon the gods.

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
[AUREOLE exhales]

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] As the power of
Sorcery awoke inside me,

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
it was awakened
within others like me.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
Humans whose veins carry
the blood of the Celestials

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
who took refuge
on this continent.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
I could not help but fear
that this made us enemies

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
of the gods, and I wondered if
Verthandi would turn her wrath

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
against us if the Dragons
should be subdued.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
In preparation for this,
I founded the Kimluck Church.

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] Aureole's power
is not without limits.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
The day will come when the
goddess overpowers her

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
and brings destruction
to our world.

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
Before that happens, I will
destroy all human Sorcerers.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
All of us?

00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
Are you forgetting that
would include you?

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] This is why I await
the one destined to kill me.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
The man called
Childman Powderfield.

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
Your Holiness. I believe
you've explained quite enough.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
Drop that blade right now.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
You know what the Sword
of Baldanders can do.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
I could turn you
into a stone statue.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
Or a banana parfait.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
Azalie!

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK]
Then despite being trapped

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
in the Hall of the Great Poet,

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
the two of you had not
received the Final Audience.

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
The Final Audience, again.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center

That was the Final Audience?

be my final feat of Sorcery.

Who can stand as equals
against the sanctuary.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, your kind
shall be doomed.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] Then you have
received the Final Audience.

lay waste to this world,

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center

of those living in Kimluck

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center

Sorcerers from
entering the city.

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] All humans bearing
the stolen power of Sorcery

their transgressions,

There is no other

to bring my existence to an end.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
As the founding
Sorcerer of mankind,

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
my being is part of the
fundamental order of reality,

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
and in that order, I am undying.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
It is through my existence that
humanity came to possess

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
the power to alter
the order itself.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
If not for me,
the gift of Sorcery

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
would not have
emerged in humans.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
And should I die,

their link to that power
would be instantly severed.

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
We're humans who bear
Celestial blood.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
That's how we became Sorcerers.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
It has nothing to do with you!

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
[RAMONIROK] Our blood granted
us only elements of Sorcery.

The ability to feel mana
and to manipulate it,

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
but before my transformation,
it was dormant in our veins.

the knowledge of
how to end my existence

with Istersiva.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
It is for precisely that
purpose that she raised him

to be a Stabber.

disappeared from my network.
