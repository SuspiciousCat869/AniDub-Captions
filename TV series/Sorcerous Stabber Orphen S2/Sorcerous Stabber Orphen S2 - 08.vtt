00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
with the Sword of Baldanders.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
You could jump down.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
But the floor is stone, so I'd
think hard about it first.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50% align:center
When did you infiltrate
the cathedral?

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
Does it matter?

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
Right now, we need to
worry about healing him.

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
Except...

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
Except?

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
Somebody here might not be
willing to give us the chance.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
[SALUA grunts]

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
Then I'll just have
to convince him.

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
Tell me how much time you
need and I'll do what I can.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
Five minutes.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
If you need some backup,
I'm right here, Orphen!

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
That's good. I can't
do this on my own.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Mm! I'm ready!

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
I was the one who killed
Name Only. Got that?

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
I should be able to at
least buy us a little time.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
[SALUA grunts]
We can't win here.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo, you have
to open the Hall.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.624 position:50% align:center
If you can open those gates,
Quo's most powerful weapons

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
will be sealed by the
Hall of the Great--

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
The Hall of the Great Poet.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.132 position:50% align:center
It's just beyond the gates!

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Still got nothing there.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.854 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
[QUO] Baldanders. The Sword
bearing the moon crest.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.902 position:50% align:center
One of a number of powerful
enchanted weapons granted

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
by the Celestials to the
followers of the Dragon Faiths

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
during the war.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
It has the ability to
disassemble and reconfigure

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
matter cut by its blade
according to the will

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50% align:center
of its wielder.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
But the depth of concentration
required to reconstitute

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
matter is near inhuman,

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
rendering it useless
in most hands.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50% align:center
It's ironic that a Sorcerer
should be one of the few

00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
to become so
proficient with it.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
The thousand eighty-four
glyphs on its blade read,

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center
"I am both the
beginning and the end,

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:04.474 position:50% align:center
just as the beast
called time itself.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
The Soon-Another."

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
Those words activate
its enchantment.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
Frankly, it's a clumsy weapon.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
I once had it in
my possession, in fact,

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
but in the end I couldn't
find a reason to keep it.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:21.533 position:50% align:center
We also study the
Celestial Artifacts.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
You Sorcerers are hardly unique.

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
And the Kimluck Church
has been at this

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
since the end of the war,
though early on,

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
our progress was painfully slow.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
So explain that to me.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
Aren't you worshippers
of the three sisters?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't using the power the
Dragons took from the gods

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
be heresy or something?

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
If we hobbled ourselves
with such dogma,

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
we would be unable
to do our work.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
In short, to us,

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
the Dragon Races aren't to
be worshipped nor reviled.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
They are a resource to exploit.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
This conversation's so boring!

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
And now it's gonna be over!

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
Hey, Claiomh! Try and point
him at those giant doors!

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50% align:center

I can't close in. Dammit!

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
[QUO] You're thinking that
without this sword and armor,

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
I'd have no chance,
aren't you, Sorcerer?

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
Hm! And you would be correct.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.727 position:50% align:center
[QUO] Allow me to explain
to you exactly why

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
this man betrayed our faith.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
Fool that he is, he believed
that the Kimluck Church

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
was on a path to destruction,

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
and he intended to
alter that path.

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:24.322 position:50% align:center
That's not true.

Hm?

just boring--

I have never been troubled
by anything like boredom.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
The fruit of my faith
is unrelenting terror!

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
Sounds like something

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
What brings you here?

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:20.897 position:50% align:center
Do you mean to throw Kimluck
into chaos as well?

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
I would never come here
if I had a choice.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
You couldn't pay me
enough to spend a day

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
in this miserable
little dustbowl.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
But I forgot something.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
And what does that mean?

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
My mission.

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.704 position:50% align:center
I never had the chance to hear
Master Childman's final wishes.

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:39.416 position:50% align:center
But something tells me I'll find
that chance in Kimluck, right?

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:43.128 position:50% align:center
Childman's final wishes?
How utterly absurd!

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center
You will find nothing here
but an inglorious death.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
I shall see to that as the

It seems the church has
some book-smart types

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center

weren't you?

That really is something else.

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
The Tower of Fangs threw dozens

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center

in a league of your own.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
High praise coming
from a Sorcerer.

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center
Then kudos to you for
such open-mindedness

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
in the face of your demise.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
High praise?

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
Do you not even have the brains
to know I called you a fool?

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
I still haven't told you
what I'm after, have I?

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center

with the slightest touch.
