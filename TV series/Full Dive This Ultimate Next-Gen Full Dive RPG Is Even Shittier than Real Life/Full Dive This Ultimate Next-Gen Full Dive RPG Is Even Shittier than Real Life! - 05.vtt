Oh, my. It's gotten
kind of chilly.

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center
So, uh. Where are we now?

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:22.314 position:50% align:center
Ugh. What're you, blind?
We're underground.

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
This is a prisoner
transport tunnel.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.068 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:31.615 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Not the sound you wanna
hear in a place like this!

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Seriously?

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
All that lip service to realism,

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
and yet they speed up time when
it's convenient for the plot.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:45.921 position:50% align:center
Behold the mansion of Her
Royal Highness the Queen,

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.966 position:50% align:center

This is also the residence

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50% align:center
of esteemed City
Guard Captain Tesla.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.447 position:50% align:center
The likes of you are
seldom permitted within.

00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:37.324 position:50% align:center
This is exceptionally rare.

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:41.745 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine what
makes you so special.

00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] That noble personage
is Captain Tesla.

Do try not to make
a schmuck of yourself.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.630 position:50% align:center
Take a seat.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
You must be famished.
I implore you to dine with me.

00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:00.639 position:50% align:center
Sure. Whatever. Thanks, man.

[TESLA]
The upholstery reeks of urine!

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.314 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
...is totally what he'll say.

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:10.399 position:50% align:center
Not how I thought
my meeting with

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
the City Guard would play out.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.698 position:50% align:center
So, like, why exactly
did you summon me here?

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.868 position:50% align:center
Uh, it just seems a
little out of the blue.

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
'Cause you peed yourself!

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.247 position:50% align:center

[HIRO]
Will you please shut up.

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:29.168 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] Martin's sister makes
a most compelling argument,

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
but the evidence tends
to call it into question.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:34.173 position:50% align:center
Murderers aren't in the habit
of using fruit knives.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I know, right?

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] We'll just go ahead and
ignore Alicia's preferred method

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.846 position:50% align:center
of carving me up.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
Certain details stood
out when I examined the scene,

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:46.435 position:50% align:center
not least of which was
the unblemished sword.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:50.439 position:50% align:center
Wow. So, you noticed the sword.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
And of course, there's the bare
fact of the wound itself.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.195 position:50% align:center
However, accomplished you
may be wielding a blade,

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:58.989 position:50% align:center
the back of the throat
is an unlikely mark.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.034 position:50% align:center
Reason demands I rule
Martin's death an accident.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
[HIRO laughs]

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.162 position:50% align:center
Take it easy.
That's a nice chair.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Finally! Someone
in this game who knows

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:11.293 position:50% align:center
what they're talking about!
Sure, it's an NPC, but still!

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:14.505 position:50% align:center
And therefore you are
now acquitted, my friend.

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:17.508 position:50% align:center
Ha! And you are awesome!

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.885 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] Forgive us.
And enjoy your meal.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.304 position:50% align:center
Right! Thank you, sir!

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Holy crap!
Props to the taste feature!

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
Quite. Well, I should be
wary of Martin's sister.

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:32.523 position:50% align:center
Her ire toward you is
emphatically homicidal.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
Should you need my help,
come and see me at once.

00:04:36.527 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
Provided of course you wish it.
I am called "Thundering Tesla."

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:44.201 position:50% align:center
At least, by those
who know me well.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
Aw, dude. That on a
party member flag...

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50% align:center
Don't even.
He's just being polite.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:54.211 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Damn it. You know what?
I'll take it.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.964 position:50% align:center
I'm in the clear!

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.049 position:50% align:center
No more sneakin'
around in a hood!

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
Let's get this
adventure started!

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.556 position:50% align:center
First things first, I head back
to the house and get that sword.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.932 position:50% align:center
You good, though?

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.393 position:50% align:center
Need to pee before we head out?
Maybe go number two?

Hey! Will you cut that out?

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center

[REONA]
Your house is quite a way off.

00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:19.111 position:50% align:center
It's on the outskirts of town.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.822 position:50% align:center
So, I recommend you be vigilant.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no kidding, right?

00:05:23.407 --> 00:05:25.701 position:50% align:center
Especially with
Alicia still around.

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center

not an outcast now.

Ah! Hiro!

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:30.414 position:50% align:center

Isn't it great?

what you've done!

The hell? I thought
this was all over!

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:03.280 position:50% align:center
The court of public opinion
doesn't care for due process.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
Just like real life.

00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
I'm getting real sick
of hearing that!

00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
[MAN D] This way!
He can't have gotten far!

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
Don't these people get tired?

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.626 position:50% align:center
Crap. The only way
back to your place

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.252 position:50% align:center
is by crossing that bridge.

00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
It'll be a while before
we can get your sword.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
Fantastic.

00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
So, I'm still basically up
a creek without a paddle.

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but at least
the City Guard

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.470 position:50% align:center
won't be on your tail anymore!

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.764 position:50% align:center
Let's grab some items while we
wait for things to calm down.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
What kind of items?

00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:32.309 position:50% align:center
When your childhood friend
wants to eviscerate you,

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
a few smoke bombs always come
in handy. How much coin ya got?

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
That might buy you a
single herb, maybe.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:43.237 position:50% align:center
Not a great investment 'less
you have a ton of spare time.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.947 position:50% align:center
Wait. There's gotta be a way

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
for players to earn
money in this game.

00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:49.076 position:50% align:center
Sure! Matter of fact,
there're several!

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.620 position:50% align:center
You can work for it,
you can borrow, or steal!

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:52.955 position:50% align:center
Steal? Seriously?!

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:56.959 position:50% align:center

with the law, thanks!

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:10.097 position:50% align:center
Honest work it is, then.
What was that about spare time?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.685 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] What's an RPG without
a few side quests, I guess?

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center

That's one way of looking at it.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.495 position:50% align:center
Brian happens to be
a middle-aged man

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
who enjoys being struck
repeatedly while stark naked.

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:01.375 position:50% align:center
Wait. You mean, he's...?

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.918 position:50% align:center
I told you what he is.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.380 position:50% align:center
Now march over there and do
what the man asks for one hour.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
Oh, for christ sakes,
do I have to spell it out?

00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:11.635 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Easy money!
Might even be kinda fun!

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:12.928 position:50% align:center
How 'bout no!

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.514 position:50% align:center
It's an hour! We need
those smoke bombs!

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:17.099 position:50% align:center
Not as badly as that!

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.685 position:50% align:center
Is whipping some old geezer
your idea of a quest?

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.813 position:50% align:center
Come on, this just keeps
getting worse and worse!

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
Get off your damn high horse!
Jobs aren't easy to come by!

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.819 position:50% align:center
Especially when you live
on the fringes of society

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.196 position:50% align:center
like those of us who
are stigmatized!

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
This is about building a
chance to lead a normal life!

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:35.993 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get it.
Please stop yelling.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.995 position:50% align:center
[CLERK A] I'll stop yelling
when you get your

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
head out of your ass!

00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:44.877 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. Touchy much.
Was it something I said?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
Well, you definitely
hit a nerve.

00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:49.548 position:50% align:center
She built this business
to try and help people.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
Poor woman's been toiling away
on the fringes since childhood.

00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:54.428 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Wouldn't you be upset

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.138 position:50% align:center
if someone looked down
their nose at you?

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
Tell me this stuff sooner, dude!

00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:00.267 position:50% align:center
I never meant to hurt
anybody's feelings!

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.145 position:50% align:center
[REONA sighs] So, you don't
have the nerve to be a thief.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
And you're not decent
enough to work.

00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:07.274 position:50% align:center
Guess the only thing that
leaves us is borrowing.

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:09.359 position:50% align:center
Way to be super judgmental!

00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:10.485 position:50% align:center
Whoa--hold on.

00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:11.904 position:50% align:center
Who are we gonna borrow from?

00:10:11.987 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Oh, I don't know.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.741 position:50% align:center
Maybe a certain player
who does what he wants.

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
Who gambles, and pretty much
just ignores the storyline.

00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] For the record,
I'm not a fan of this guy.

00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Same, believe me.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
But circumstances force us
to think practically.

00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:36.512 position:50% align:center
[chuckling]

00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:39.515 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] Well, whaddya know:
the jiggle fairy.

00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:41.600 position:50% align:center
Ha! It's been a while!

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.894 position:50% align:center
Ginji. You're looking well.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
So, given any thought
yet to beating the game?

00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
[GINJI laughs]
Nah. I'm over all that.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.902 position:50% align:center
So, what brings you here?

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you might
help this player out,

00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:55.781 position:50% align:center
if you would be so kind.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, hi.
--Oh! Hey there.

00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.493 position:50% align:center
The fact that you're
standing here

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:00.953 position:50% align:center
must mean you
endured the torture!

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
You say that like
it's no big deal!

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:04.164 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't've had to
endure it if you'd--!

00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
He was so clever!

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.669 position:50% align:center
He wet himself just as they were
about to start the amputation!

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.212 position:50% align:center
No one's ever tried that tactic!

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.630 position:50% align:center
Gah! Don't tell him!

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
[laughing] They let your dumb
ass go 'cause you peed?

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:16.260 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
We can all laugh about it now.

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:20.973 position:50% align:center
I don't happen to think
it's that funny!

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
Hiro! Don't take it personally.

00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
We're trying to
open up a dialogue.

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:25.769 position:50% align:center
We didn't have to start there!

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
What're you laughing about?

00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
It's your fault I got
interrogated in the first place!

00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
You sold me out to the guards!

00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:33.944 position:50% align:center
Slow down. Watch yourself.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.654 position:50% align:center
I'm the reason
you're even out here.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
I got you acquitted.

00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
You should be lickin'
my boots right now.

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:42.411 position:50% align:center
This jerk's gonna make me
an actual murderer.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:45.956 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] Whatcha want, Jiggle
Fairy? I ain't got all day.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Right. Yes.

00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you could lend
my friend here a little money.

00:11:50.294 --> 00:11:54.006 position:50% align:center
Do what?
Throw money at this runt?

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
I'm the wrong man to
squeeze, piss boy.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
Get lost. Change your pants.

00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:04.892 position:50% align:center
Did you say piss boy?

00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.
Run that by me again?

00:12:07.603 --> 00:12:11.148 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Whoa! Take that back!
He is not a piss boy!

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.900 position:50% align:center
Reona! Stay out of this!

00:12:12.983 --> 00:12:14.276 position:50% align:center
Matter of fact,

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.612 position:50% align:center
his new name is the
"Nice Shower Best"--

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:18.989 position:50% align:center
Stop! Holy hell,
please just shut up!

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
I don't give a damn
what he's called.

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
The only thing I got
for him is diddly.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:29.458 position:50% align:center
Now piss off 'fore the barkeep
thinks you're a tap.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:34.755 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, piss boy?
I get under your skin?

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
You fat...

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.550 position:50% align:center
[GINJI grunts]

00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:40.761 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:44.932 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Bastard! Screw you!

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
Hiro!

00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Calm down, Hiro. Deep breath.

00:12:51.522 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
Don't let history repeat itself!

00:12:53.357 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Make him pay!
Teach him a hard lesson!

00:12:56.193 --> 00:12:57.236 position:50% align:center
Develop that story!

00:12:57.319 --> 00:12:59.196 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.364 position:50% align:center
You miserable brat!

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:13:02.783 --> 00:13:04.368 position:50% align:center
You think you'll just
walk outta here?

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.786 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunting]

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.955 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] Quit squirming,
you little bastard!

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:09.665 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Get off, you alky son of a lush!

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.501 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Yes! That's it!
Take advantage of the game!

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.461 position:50% align:center
I'm not following!

00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:16.380 position:50% align:center
Gah! You leave me no choice

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
but to break out
my secret weapon!

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Crap. It's magic, isn't it?

00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
He's gonna kill me with magic!

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
[GINJI grunts]

00:13:25.848 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:29.852 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh!
He's using brass knuckles?

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center
We're mixing genres!

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:34.690 position:50% align:center
Really? That's what you're
focused on right now?

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
[GINJI yells]

00:13:36.692 --> 00:13:39.027 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
Ah! What are you doing? Stop it!

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
That really hurts!
I don't wanna go bald!

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
This is what you get
for trying to punch me

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:47.077 position:50% align:center
with freakin' brass knuckles!

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.370 position:50% align:center
Ouch... hey!

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
[HIRO sputters] Ow!
What kind of move is that?

00:13:52.583 --> 00:13:53.750 position:50% align:center
Let go of my bread basket!

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:56.461 position:50% align:center
Let go of my best feature!

00:13:59.715 --> 00:14:02.968 position:50% align:center
[GINJI yelps, grunts]

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center
Cripes. My damn gout.

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.893 position:50% align:center
This is what you get,
assclown--!

00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:12.895 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN]
Hiro.

00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
Come now.

00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
Is this what you want?

00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
To tempt mortal tragedy
through anger?

00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
[HIRO screams]

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
[HIRO whimpers]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
What is it? What's wrong?

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Martin! He's dead,
but he's standing right there!

00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:34.041 position:50% align:center
Eh... What the--? Where'd he go?

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.752 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] The ghosts pop
in and out at random.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
Sometimes they up and
vanish immediately,

00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:40.881 position:50% align:center
sometimes they stick around.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Spooky at first,
but after a while you adapt.

00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] This isn't something
I wanna get used to.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.933 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Well damn,
speak of the devil.

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
Worried the newcomer
would upstage you?

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Get over it. Jeez.

00:14:58.357 --> 00:15:00.359 position:50% align:center
Ask me as many
times as you like.

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.361 position:50% align:center
I'm never gonna have
an answer for ya.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.363 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
He may act indifferent,
but I think he feels guilt.

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
Like he regrets, you know...

00:15:10.202 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Yeah. Killing someone
has to weigh on your conscience.

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center
What if that's why he's been
logging on all these years?

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:24.842 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Real emotions.
Tragic consequences.

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:27.928 position:50% align:center
KQ really pushes the envelope.

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.263 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
Hey, man. I'm really sorry
for losing my temper.

00:15:32.683 --> 00:15:34.977 position:50% align:center
[laughs] It's just a game.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.271 position:50% align:center
Still, some people get
caught up in the moment.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
Uh! I wasn't the only one
who snapped!

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.860 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Haven't lost it
like that in years.

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to think you're
a bad influence on me.

00:15:48.574 --> 00:15:51.869 position:50% align:center
Aw, well. That's youth.

00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, no.

00:16:02.713 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
What? I'm just tryin' to
catch a few winks.

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank god. I was
sure you were dead.

00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
When's anyone ever died
from having their hair pulled?

00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
Idiot.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Ginji. Aren't you
forgetting something?

00:16:14.183 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
I believe you failed to
beat Hiro in combat.

00:16:16.852 --> 00:16:19.438 position:50% align:center
As agreed, we'll be taking
all the coin you have!

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
Ah. Fair's fair,
I guess. Have at it.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.778 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Um. When did we agree to this?

00:16:26.862 --> 00:16:29.031 position:50% align:center
I thought we came
here to ask for a loan.

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.490 position:50% align:center
She's taking advantage
of the fact

00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
he's drunk as a skunk!

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.330 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Well done!
That battle was outstanding!

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
Must feel good to defeat
a boss on your second try!

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:41.335 position:50% align:center
Look at you! An RPG pro!

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:45.255 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but, uh, I don't
feel that accomplished.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
Uh! You're kidding me.

00:16:49.218 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
"Elder-Hunting Best
Friend Killer:

00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
Amicide Who Robs Old Men"?

00:16:54.223 --> 00:16:58.060 position:50% align:center
But I didn't... I was not the
one who wanted this to happen!

00:16:58.143 --> 00:16:59.561 position:50% align:center
Weren't you, though?

00:16:59.645 --> 00:17:01.480 position:50% align:center
You're the one who picked
the fight and took his money.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.190 position:50% align:center
If the shoe fits, pick a purse!

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:06.068 position:50% align:center
You're the one who conned
the poor guy, not me!

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.778 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Water under the bridge.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:11.240 position:50% align:center
We got money and a new title.
I call that progress!

00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
Now, let's go stock up
on smoke bombs!

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.496 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Here we are.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.958 position:50% align:center
Are you sure both of
them are item shops?

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.544 position:50% align:center
Of course.
Which one do you pick?

00:17:23.627 --> 00:17:28.382 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Hmm. This one
seems a little sus.

00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
Let's go with this.

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:38.350 position:50% align:center
[MELISSA]
Hello! Come in! Welcome, sir!

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Definitely the right choice!

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:43.647 position:50% align:center
Hi, there. My name's Melissa.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Hi. Do you have any
smoke bombs in stock?

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.527 position:50% align:center
We most assuredly do, good sir!

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.404 position:50% align:center
Twenty gald each, if you please!

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:52.281 position:50% align:center
How much did Ginji
have in the bag?

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
I dunno, um. Looks to
be about 60, I think.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
That was everything he had?

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.872 position:50% align:center
That old drunk is
the epitome of lame!

00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:02.666 position:50% align:center
Wow, yeah, you totally don't
sound like a sociopath.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:03.834 position:50% align:center
Glad you're my conscience.

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.711 position:50% align:center
Um. Pardon me, sir?

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.296 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Ah! Right!

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and hook a brother up
with two smoke bombs, m'lady.

00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:13.385 position:50% align:center
Indeed. Here you go!

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.721 position:50% align:center
Nice. And here you go!

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid in your case, sir,

00:18:21.143 --> 00:18:24.021 position:50% align:center
I have to include a
special surcharge.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
Excuse me? But I'm
no longer a criminal!

00:18:27.191 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
I sincerely feel for
your dilemma, sir.

00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
But the rumor mill takes
at least two months to settle.

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid till then my hands
are tied in this matter.

00:18:35.032 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
This'll go on for two months?

00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
[MELISSA]
Fifty gald for the pair,

00:18:38.577 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
if you're still interested.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:45.876 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Fine...

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
One moment before
you leave, sir.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.215 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I have to ask you
for a further ten gald, please.

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:53.050 position:50% align:center
Uh! What the hell for?

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.218 position:50% align:center
[MELISSA]
Service fee.

00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.637 position:50% align:center
Uh! You can't be serious!

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.057 position:50% align:center
Well sir, you did speak with
the Melissa of Melissa's Shoppe.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
So, yes. I assure you,
I'm quite serious.

00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:05.312 position:50% align:center
Whoa, whoa! Is this like a
shakedown or somethin'?

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.105 position:50% align:center
I didn't know I
was walking into a--

00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:09.233 position:50% align:center
[BOUNCER A grunts]

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Every NPC in this game is a POS.

00:19:17.074 --> 00:19:19.493 position:50% align:center
But you have to admire
how she runs her business.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
I could learn a thing or two.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.664 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Don't even go there.
Speaking of which,

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:26.208 position:50% align:center
I really ought to have chosen
the shabbier place.

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
You walked out of there
with a valuable lesson.

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:31.088 position:50% align:center
Try to be positive:
every thorn has its rose.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
Outward appearances are always
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:36.093 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Please...

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Huh? What?

00:19:37.803 --> 00:19:41.723 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Yeah. I'll try
to remember that.

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
The investigation's over,

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
so Martin's body
has been removed.

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:00.576 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:03.704 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Hm? Look, I get if
going in there is hard for you,

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:06.415 position:50% align:center
but it's not possible for me
to retrieve the sword.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.375 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That tracks.

00:20:18.177 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] There it is.
Just like Kamui said.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:25.017 position:50% align:center
Man. How did I miss
something so obvious?

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:33.609 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
Hiro...

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:41.450 position:50% align:center
[screams] Alicia!

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA laughs]
I knew you'd come back

00:20:44.578 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
to get something if I
waited long enough!

00:20:47.623 --> 00:20:49.583 position:50% align:center
Now! Use the bomb!

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.210 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:57.174 position:50% align:center
[HIRO yells]

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.176 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:01.053 position:50% align:center
What are you doing, Hiro?

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Uh! Don't you just
throw smoke bombs?

00:21:03.472 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
Ugh! This is not
a shonen manga!

00:21:06.058 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
You have to actually
light the fuse first!

00:21:07.893 --> 00:21:11.355 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay.
Uh. How does that work?

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
Do I just use a match?

00:21:12.773 --> 00:21:14.650 position:50% align:center
It should've come with a
flint when you bought it!

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:17.194 position:50% align:center
Of course. This is bullcrap!

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.238 position:50% align:center
I have to spark a flame in
the middle of a fight--!

00:21:19.321 --> 00:21:22.658 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA laughs]
No time for that.

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:23.909 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Didn't you know, silly?

00:21:28.497 --> 00:21:32.251 position:50% align:center
You have to test your tools
before the moment of truth.

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
That's really good advice.

00:21:34.086 --> 00:21:35.838 position:50% align:center
I'll keep that in mind
for next time.

00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
Oh. There won't be a next time.

00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:41.093 position:50% align:center
This was your last
chance not to screw up.

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
Embrace oblivion!

00:21:43.262 --> 00:21:45.681 position:50% align:center
[HIRO screams]

00:21:50.561 --> 00:21:54.648 position:50% align:center
Ah! How dare you
interrupt my vendetta!

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.401 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] H-He's come to me
in my hour of need!

00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:00.153 position:50% align:center
Tesla! I'm forever in your debt!

00:22:00.237 --> 00:22:01.697 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:03.699 --> 00:22:05.868 position:50% align:center
I am Mizarisa the Inquisitor!

00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:09.997 position:50% align:center
You are forbidden from killing
my glorious bed wetter!

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.875 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Son of a whore!
