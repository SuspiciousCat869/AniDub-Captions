honestly, I have no idea.

How are the goblins
even getting inside?

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
That's right.
They shouldn't have access.

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.829 position:50% align:center
Idiot. The damn
moat's dry as a bone

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center

need my sword cleaned.

hadn't noticed,

I'm sure you're a
force to reckon with.

00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:55.277 position:50% align:center
That's not my fault.
It was like this already.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
Whaddya mean it was
already like that?

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center

but how's it work?

from hilt to tip!

I'm the protagonist here and
instead of fighting goblins

00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
I'm stuck with the mindless task
of scraping rust off of a sword!

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.636 position:50% align:center
I hear you, but you
can't use the sword

until it's been
properly cleaned.

Out of the question! Goblins
may be on the petite side,

strength of an ogre!

but that's stupid.

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center

about mimicking real life,

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:56.982 position:50% align:center
but dying? Please,
you think we're in a manga?

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.276 position:50% align:center

Something breaks.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50% align:center
What does that even mean?
Like we talkin' a bone or what?

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.658 position:50% align:center
At least a bone can heal.

that malware or a feature?

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
Real talk.

I doubt this'll come as
much of a surprise to you.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.186 position:50% align:center

You really owned up to it.

so does their console.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.947 position:50% align:center

there've been more lawsuits

over that design than

Not that the corporation
broke a sweat.

comes zero accountability.

was up in arms.

Before long, a slew of
other issues came up.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
The company saw the writing
on the wall, cut its losses

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.345 position:50% align:center
and buried KQ altogether,

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
where it passed into
skid-marked legend.

00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:13.517 position:50% align:center
That's what I meant when I said

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.935 position:50% align:center
you'd have to pay
for the privilege

of having someone
take it off your hands.

00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:19.898 position:50% align:center
Then refresh my memory why you
sold it to me at full price?

for the time being.

Unofficial game guides may not
be the most reliable source

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.117 position:50% align:center
of information, but we
know goblins are powerful.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.953 position:50% align:center
Let's see if the Auberdine
Walkthrough has a strategy.

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
Okay.

Right. Triple tap.

Oh, good. We can save
during a siege.

Can I just have a peek first?

00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
over a computer simulation!

00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
And yet between
the two of you,

00:08:56.078 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
you're the one who sounds
more like a machine.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center
Come on! What do you want?

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
I'm not made of stone!

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:03.752 position:50% align:center
Not anymore.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.967 position:50% align:center
No more death. So what
if she's just an NPC?

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
That doesn't give me the right

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
to stand by while
she gets killed.

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:16.974 position:50% align:center
I've languished on the
sidelines for too long.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
Hiro, I don't know what to say.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.857 position:50% align:center
That's so noble.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
Unless you're an
attention whore.

00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:27.901 position:50% align:center
You disgust me!

00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:30.696 position:50% align:center
Huh? Reinforcements are here!

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
The City Guard! Oh, it is on!

00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
Filthy aberrant beast!

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.579 position:50% align:center
Stay back or we shall
cut you in twain!

[GOBLIN A growls]

00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:16.283 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] This game has
a sick sense of humor.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.327 position:50% align:center
Of course, when I say
"no more death" I jinx it

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.579 position:50% align:center
and two more people are
immediately slaughtered.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.039 position:50% align:center
Now you understand why I didn't

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
want you charging out
there at full bore?

00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:25.209 position:50% align:center
There's no way something that OP

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.878 position:50% align:center
is the first creature players
are supposed to fight.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
Full disclosure:
almost 99% of the people

00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
who managed to leave
Ted in the first place

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
avoid having to
face them at all.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.136 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Of course, they did.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.640 position:50% align:center
Kinda late for me to follow
their example now.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:42.893 position:50% align:center

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center

[GOBLIN A growling]

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:53.195 position:50% align:center
Uh, at least tell me a goblin's
been defeated before.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:54.905 position:50% align:center
Maybe wounded a little bit?

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.616 position:50% align:center
Well, to my knowledge,
only Kamui and Shouhei

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
have ever successfully
taken one out.

00:10:59.535 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
Naturally Kamui has.

00:11:00.953 --> 00:11:03.539 position:50% align:center
But what about that other
name you just tossed out?

00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Shouhei Aida.
Heavyweight championship boxer?

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
One of the best-known
personalities in the sport?

00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
One time,
an interviewer asked him

00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
to reveal the toughest opponent
he'd ever gone up against.

00:11:14.383 --> 00:11:15.926 position:50% align:center
Definitely goblins.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
Seems like a down to earth guy.

00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:19.930 position:50% align:center
Oh, gimme a break!
Goblins don't box!

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
You know what? Never mind!
These people need help!

00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:24.810 position:50% align:center
Hiro! But you'll be killed!

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.937 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm not gonna fight, I just--

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
I dunno, least I can do
is help them escape!

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:32.234 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Why in the world
did you have to choose

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.403 position:50% align:center
now to get fired up
all of a sudden?

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:36.238 position:50% align:center
Okay, tell you what:
break your console

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
and I'll give you a preferred
customer discount.

00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
One hundred and
five thousand yen!

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] That's still
higher than list price.

00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
But before you save the day.

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
[REONA] The blacksmith
left you a little gift.

00:11:50.294 --> 00:11:52.129 position:50% align:center
Finders' keepers, right?

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.923 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] They're probably
not even my size.

00:11:55.007 --> 00:11:56.592 position:50% align:center
Can't I just buy some?

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
Now, now. You don't want to
charge out there reeking of pee.

00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
That's not a good look.

00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
Well, no but, it's a
time-sensitive situation--

00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:05.309 position:50% align:center
Then quit dawdling and
change your pants!

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
My nostrils are on fire!
I'm done being nice about it!

Remember, I'm invisible, so I
can run interference for you.

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Be careful, wait till I distract
him then save her. Got it?

00:12:37.633 --> 00:12:39.176 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a plan to me.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
We've should've
done this sooner.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.513 position:50% align:center
Look at them.

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:43.931 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
We would've been useless.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:47.643 position:50% align:center
No point dwelling
on what we can't do.

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Maybe if we hadn't taken
the time to change pants.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
Snap out of it! Man up and
focus on saving the child!

00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:57.361 position:50% align:center
Let's do this.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:07.204 position:50% align:center

but you shot out like
a bolt of lightning!

Well, I've always been a
fast runner, but I dunno.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.540 position:50% align:center
Maybe my stress
response kicked in?

[HIRO] I mean adrenaline can
make you do some crazy things.

to be "realistic."

you meet this early in the game.

done your homework.

since playing this game,

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.944 position:50% align:center
I actually feel like one.

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Huh?
Oo! You've got a new title!

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.784 position:50% align:center
This one says, "Attention
Whore Best Friend Killer

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.536 position:50% align:center
with a massive God Complex."

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
That's a load of crap!

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.665 position:50% align:center
Easy there. You have
to admit objectively

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.375 position:50% align:center
the situation
looked kinda sketch.

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
You were hyper-focused
on being the "savior," so...

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.839 position:50% align:center
I was actually concerned
for her safety!

00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
Why you gotta make
that a bad thing?

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:31.677 position:50% align:center
Way to drop a deuce
on my moment.

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Damn it. NPCs can't see Reona.

00:17:36.974 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
He's gonna think
I'm a whack-job.

00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
So, a fellow warrior, eh?

00:17:44.273 --> 00:17:45.399 position:50% align:center
Are you talking to me?

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
Forgive my being so forward.

00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:48.735 position:50% align:center
I need all the
able-bodied comrades

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:51.989 position:50% align:center
I can muster and haven't
the luxury of time.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.657 position:50% align:center
Are you asking me to fight?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
Indeed. The pay is rather good

00:17:56.243 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
and the commitment
quite reasonable.

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:01.707 position:50% align:center
I humbly ask you join the
City Guard as a mercenary.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.543 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Is he for real?
That's an RPG classic!

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:07.254 position:50% align:center
I'd be badass by association!

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:09.506 position:50% align:center
Just show me where to
sign and I am in!

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
Excellent choice.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
This might be something
you wanna give

00:18:13.177 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
a little more thought.

00:18:14.303 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
Should I ask for references?

00:18:15.846 --> 00:18:18.015 position:50% align:center
Chill out. If I'm
near Tesla, I'm safe.

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Huh. Guess there's no way
to argue with that logic.

00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
Very well. Commence training
whenever you please.

00:18:23.896 --> 00:18:25.856 position:50% align:center
The facilities are
easy enough to find.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:29.610 position:50% align:center
The Queen Govern's estate.
I believe you're familiar?

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.153 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Yeah! You got it!

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Alrighty, then. This
feels like a good save point.

00:18:34.031 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
Best call it day
while I'm ahead.

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
Cool. Logging off now.

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:42.915 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Oh, sure. And remember
to check out the walkthrou--

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
Okay. Good.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
This game finally feels like
it's going somewhere.

00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
So, uh, you still on that game?

00:18:57.763 --> 00:18:59.348 position:50% align:center
The shitty one?

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
Sure am.

00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:02.518 position:50% align:center
Why do that to yourself?

00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
No clue, dude.

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:05.354 position:50% align:center
Everything about it's
a pain in the ass.

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:06.813 position:50% align:center
And believe it or not,
I just found out

00:19:06.897 --> 00:19:08.357 position:50% align:center
if you die in the game,
the stupid thing

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
actually annihilates
your console.

00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:13.070 position:50% align:center
[coughs] And they were
surprised that it tanked?

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.364 position:50% align:center
Every game has its share
of bugs, but damn.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
Trust me, you don't
know the half of it.

00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
In other words, "shitty's"
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:19:20.244 --> 00:19:22.663 position:50% align:center
Have to say that's
a hard pass from me.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:25.249 position:50% align:center
Healthy perspective.

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.501 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI]
Hey, man.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:28.836 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What's up?

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI] You seem
like you're in a good mood.

00:19:30.254 --> 00:19:31.839 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What're you talking about?

00:19:31.922 --> 00:19:33.215 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI]
Much as you whine about it,

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.509 position:50% align:center
I think you and this game
are made for each other.

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
I'm just sayin'.

00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:37.970 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Pfft.

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:42.391 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
KQ? Seriously? Is he joking?

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.980 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] The difficulty
level is sadistic.

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
Game over means goodbye console.

00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
"Shitty" is, in fact,
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:19:58.574 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
Though, I should log on
to see what happens next.

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.297 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Here we go.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
Unless I wanna be
better informed first...

00:20:17.301 --> 00:20:19.553 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Just what I need.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.896 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Hey, trash!
You've really done it now!

00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:32.191 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
There are more ways out of Ted

00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:34.109 position:50% align:center
than you have brain cells.

00:20:34.193 --> 00:20:35.986 position:50% align:center
Most people go the
standard route:

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:38.739 position:50% align:center
helping out townsfolk,
building up a solid rep.

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:42.034 position:50% align:center
Eventually Queen Govern grants
them permission to leave.

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
Sure, it's a hassle.
But it gets the job done.

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:47.497 position:50% align:center
You can always
flee the city on foot.

00:20:47.581 --> 00:20:49.625 position:50% align:center
But good luck
reaching Castle Flora

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
without getting
bushwhacked by goblins.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
Doable tactic, in theory.

00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:57.341 position:50% align:center
But I only recommend it
to hardcore martial artists.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
There are tons of other options,

00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:01.637 position:50% align:center
but if the city's under
siege, hunker down.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.889 position:50% align:center
Your options just
got real limited.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
Be glad I'm willing to outline
them for garbage like you!

00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:10.646 position:50% align:center
[HIRO sighs]
Man, he's still such a prick.

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Option one: Get a militia going.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
Only recommended
if you can recruit

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
a hundred NPCs, bare minimum.

00:21:17.194 --> 00:21:19.321 position:50% align:center
You popular enough
to manage that?

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
Didn't think so.
Chance of survival: 5%.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
Option Two: Hide like a
little bitch for four days.

00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
Dig a hole under some random
house and get comfy.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
You'll never be able to
leave the city, but hey!

00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
You'll be in touch with your
spiritual equivalent: Mud.

00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:36.964 position:50% align:center
Chance of survival: 10%!

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
Option Third:
Join the City Guard

00:21:39.258 --> 00:21:41.635 position:50% align:center
as a merc and fight
alongside Tesla.

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Bingo.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] I recommend this tactic
for anyone tired of life.

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:47.933 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:50.978 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] I'm a certified genius
and even I have trouble with it.

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:54.231 position:50% align:center
For bloated, mentally defective
turd buckets like you?

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
Chance of survival: 0.1%.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.571 position:50% align:center
Die. Not like you
have much choice.

00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What?

00:22:03.949 --> 00:22:09.037 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
A 0.1% of survival means...

00:22:09.121 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
...a 99.9% chance
of frying my console!

00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:49.429 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Episode 8:
Enlistment and Baptism.
