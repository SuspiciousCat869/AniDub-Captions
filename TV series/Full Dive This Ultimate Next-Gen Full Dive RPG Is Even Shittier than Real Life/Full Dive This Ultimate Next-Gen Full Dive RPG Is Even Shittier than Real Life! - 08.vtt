[KAMUI]
Join the City Guard as a merc

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.680 position:50% align:center
and fight alongside Tesla.

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:16.683 position:50% align:center
I'm a certified genius and
even I have trouble with it.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:20.479 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] A 0.1% chance
of survival means...

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:24.983 position:50% align:center
...a 99.9% chance of
frying my console!

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.127 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Okay, then, if the
odds are really that bad...

00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:09.713 position:50% align:center
...then, I mean...
that's my answer, isn't it?

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.466 position:50% align:center
I should quit while I'm ahead.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
I didn't shit myself!

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:20.766 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Heh. Welcome to it, clown boat!

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.935 position:50% align:center
That console is toast!

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:25.604 position:50% align:center
I'll press F to pay
respects for your loss.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.189 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hey! Shut up!

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:32.861 position:50% align:center
The point of listening to you
was to come out of this intact!

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] There is one way.
On the off chance you earned

00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:38.200 position:50% align:center
the title "Best Friend
Killer" before now,

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.619 position:50% align:center
the odds of survival
aren't dead-ass zero.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:43.830 position:50% align:center
What? Wait a minute,
is he saying...?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Too bad there's
no way you earned it.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:50.879 position:50% align:center
Sucks to suck. Abandon all hope.
Over and out. Kill yourself.

00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well that shows
what you know, jerk face!

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Quit yankin' my crank.

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:59.221 position:50% align:center
Type in the words
of "the promise."

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.100 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] He better not be
squirrelling this stuff

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
away behind a pay wall.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Wow. So, you survived a ghost

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
and the crazy best
friend who tried

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.573 position:50% align:center
turning you into one.
Kudos, boyo.

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:20.534 position:50% align:center
Most poor schlubs spend years
fumbling through the game

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
before they're lucky
enough to figure it out.

00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:27.833 position:50% align:center
Very well. Here's the
trick to Kiwame Quest.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
This had better be good.

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:32.713 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Congratulations,
your chance of survival

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.174 position:50% align:center
bumped up from 0.1 to 0.5.

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
How the hell is that
supposed to help me?

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] A second wave
of goblins is coming.

00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:43.015 position:50% align:center
For now, just focus on the
first five days of training.

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:47.311 position:50% align:center
But be warned,
depending on your mileage...

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
It might break you.

00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:53.358 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Seriously?
Feels kind of extreme.

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
If you're a garbage person,

00:03:55.194 --> 00:03:57.029 position:50% align:center
when the going gets
tough you'll bolt.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.907 position:50% align:center
You know, like in real life.
No surprise there.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.910 position:50% align:center
But if you're a winner,
you'll fake it till you make it.

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
Yes, the next goblins siege
is Hell with a capital "H."

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:08.999 position:50% align:center
But once you've cleared it,
you'll get at the real mystery

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.752 position:50% align:center
behind the City of Ted.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
Keep your mouth shut, eyes open,
and your mind alert...

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.007 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] ...0.5 is not
a forgiving number,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
but I made it work.

00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
Remember that.

00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
Even when you're teetering
on the razor's edge,

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
nothing is impossible.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
Good luck, tool.

00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:40.072 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] His tone still needs
adjusting, but I dunno,

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.782 position:50% align:center
it's like he was
passing the torch,

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.369 position:50% align:center
saying, "I've done my part.
Now it's your turn."

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.539 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm reading into it.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.666 position:50% align:center
That's one pudding cup ruined.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
So much for my appetite.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
I can't wreck my console.

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:57.214 position:50% align:center
I don't have the money
for a new one.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
Obviously,
the responsible choice here

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
is to cut my losses and run.

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] What? I'm in
the middle of something.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.563 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Here, it's yours.

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Uh. A pudding cup?

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Heads up: I'm jumping
onto that full-dive game again.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.572 position:50% align:center
What? Didn't you
plan on selling it?

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.658 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Yeah, but I had
a change of heart.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
So, it's not shitty?

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:31.874 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's still a shitty game.
The epitome of shit. But well...

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
...threw yourself
into video games,

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:36.712 position:50% align:center
and now you can't even
stick with that!

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
You're so pathetic! Look at you!

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.718 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I didn't wanna give up on it

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.304 position:50% align:center
before I reached a
good stopping point.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
And you went out of
your way to tell me that

00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:48.849 position:50% align:center
with a pudding cup.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] There's no school
for the next few days.

00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
I'll be playing the whole time.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.898 position:50% align:center
Just thought it'd be
polite to let you know.

00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:57.858 position:50% align:center
What makes you think I care?

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center
Listen, I might scream,
probably.

00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:02.279 position:50% align:center
I'll keep it down
as much as I can,

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
but still, it might get loud.

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:06.450 position:50% align:center
Wha-- Why're you...?

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
Am I soused to understand this?
Because if this is a joke!

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Kaede. You were always
right about everything.

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:15.292 position:50% align:center
Since the day I quit track,
it feels like I'm just

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.505 position:50% align:center
running away from the
person I'm meant to be.

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:21.507 position:50% align:center
I realize it's
gonna tick you off,

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.593 position:50% align:center
but I need to see this
game through to the end,

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:28.180 position:50% align:center
no matter what. Please.

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:34.353 position:50% align:center
Whatever floats your boat.
I don't care.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Kaede, I'm so sorry.

00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
I presume you're ready?

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:44.238 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:45.781 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Excellent. To the mansion, then.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.533 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah!

00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:53.247 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Zero-point-five?
From the walkthrough?

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.958 position:50% align:center
Not exactly the most
encouraging odds of survival.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
Maybe this will be
a lesson to you

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.255 position:50% align:center
to consult the experts
ahead of time! Doof.

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
Bit late for that now, isn't it?

00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:05.217 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, for the moment
let's just focus on

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
getting through this
training regimen.

00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Five days, huh?
How hard can it be?

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.683 position:50% align:center
'Course he did say
it might break me.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Guess we'll find out.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.604 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
A point of housekeeping.

00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:20.649 position:50% align:center
New recruits have
sleeping quarters on site.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
But before all that, we must pay
our respects to Her Majesty.

00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
[PRISONER A groaning]

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.534 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Again, with that
creepy-ass moaning.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
Is someone being
tortured down there?

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.292 position:50% align:center
Your enlistment is appreciated.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.710 position:50% align:center
As you doubtless expect,

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
I am Queen Govern,
administrator of Ted.

00:07:43.172 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
It's an honor.

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Definitely not what I imagined

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.553 position:50% align:center
someone named "Govern"
would look like.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:53.849 position:50% align:center
[QUEEN GOVERN laughs]

00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
[QUEEN GOVERN]
Enlistees are a treasure.

00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
I humbly ask that you
protect our fair city

00:08:00.898 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
from the goblin scourge.

00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
In return, I offer a prayer
for your well-being.

00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
Cool, awesome!

00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That was hilarious!

00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:13.994 position:50% align:center
I've heard some intense sounds
come out of your mouth,

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.747 position:50% align:center
but that high note would
totally get you a record label!

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.582 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
She latched onto me, okay?

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
The body does
what the body does!

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:22.503 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe we should
put that little theory

00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.340 position:50% align:center
to the test one of these days.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
Or here's an idea.
How about no?

00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:34.640 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Behold the training grounds.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
Everyone, allow me to
introduce our new recruit.

00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:41.605 position:50% align:center
This is my friend, Hiro.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.357 position:50% align:center
He'll be joining the
City Guard's ranks

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
as a mercenary. Step forth.

00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad to be here.

00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
And there are two more.

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm not the only new guy?

00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:59.248 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] This is Granada and
Paluù, also mercenaries.

00:08:59.331 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:01.333 position:50% align:center
Whaddup?

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.544 position:50% align:center
Let's give them all
a round of applause.

00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
Come, brothers at arms!

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
Welcome!

00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:07.923 position:50% align:center
[GUARD B]
Glad to have you!

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] Thanks to you,
the enemy is in retreat.

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.637 position:50% align:center
But they'll return soon enough.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.098 position:50% align:center
Train hard and remain
ever vigilant!

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS]
Yes, sir!

00:09:17.975 --> 00:09:19.810 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] You'll note the goblins
made an attempt

Doubtless their primitive
instincts know,

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:26.984 position:50% align:center
as goes the royal residence,
so goes the city.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS murmuring]

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:31.697 position:50% align:center
Ergo, protect the Queen.
Our fates are intertwined!

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
This is our sworn duty
and a sacred trust.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.410 position:50% align:center
For we are the City Guard!

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.078 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS cheer]

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:41.290 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
I expect great things from you.

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:42.833 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec.
I thought he was gonna

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.710 position:50% align:center
train me himself, what the--?

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.295 position:50% align:center
[BOB]
Hey, thanks for being here.

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, the dormitory,
Lemme show you.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
[BOB]
Bob, by the way.

00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:53.969 position:50% align:center
I just joined the Guard
about a month ago,

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
so truth is I'm only
technically your superior.

00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
No need to be too formal.

00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
Cool, nice to meet you.

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:01.727 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
Is it me, or was
everyone else squishy?

00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
Heh. Hey, most people aren't
as strong as you are.

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:08.567 position:50% align:center
Cut 'em some slack.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.279 position:50% align:center
Ah. You mercs have spunk.
That attitude'll get you far.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.198 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.620 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
So, this is my room, huh?

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:22.331 position:50% align:center
You've been pretty quiet
since we got here.

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
I have a policy of fading
into the background

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.460 position:50% align:center
during important exposition.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
It ensures that you pay
attention to the game.

00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it.

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
So, there's method to
your madness after all.

00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:34.051 position:50% align:center
Not to toot my own
horn or anything,

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
but I'm kinda good at this.

00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:37.679 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
She says without irony.

00:10:37.763 --> 00:10:39.473 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally, so anyway,

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.058 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna get
changed now, 'kay?

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
Go right ahead.
Don't mind me.

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:44.520 position:50% align:center
A little privacy, would ya?

00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:48.357 position:50% align:center
What? Come on, it's not like
I'm gonna see anything special.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Pretty sure I'd remember
asking for a commentary track.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.198 position:50% align:center
[BOB]
Suited up?

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
I'm ready when you are!

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.411 position:50% align:center
[BOB] Great. Let's head back.
Time for some light practical.

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Like, with a sword?

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.790 position:50% align:center
Yep, and some basic
martial arts.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.667 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Sweet! A tutorial!

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
Finally, this feels
like a proper RPG!

00:11:09.795 --> 00:11:11.213 position:50% align:center
[BOB]
No need to get anxious.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
Today's all about introductory
exercises. Just relax.

00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
Okay, unusual.

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:20.556 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
[BOB]
Sorry, you're just so small.

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:25.936 position:50% align:center
Ah, let me guess:
you specialize in covert ops.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Who, me? N-No.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
Huh. Well, I guess it's
not that big a deal.

00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:32.234 position:50% align:center
At least hopefully.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
Oh, um. Okay.

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:37.990 position:50% align:center

Bring it!

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:43.996 position:50% align:center
Excellent start.
This should be good.

Greetings instructor!

00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:49.877 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] Granada and Paluù,
I presume. And hello, Hiro.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
Why the hell are you here?!

[HIRO]
This guy's the instructor?

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
[AMOS]
The name's Amos.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
I'm the SOB who's gonna
run your sorry sacks

00:11:58.844 --> 00:11:59.887 position:50% align:center
through the ringer and kick you

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.264 position:50% align:center
to the flagstones
if you piss me off!

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.432 position:50% align:center
Especially you!

What'd I do?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
Captain Tesla's taken
a shine to you,

00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
but as far as I'm concerned,

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
the only thing that
matters is ability!

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
There's no room for dead weight!

00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:13.025 position:50% align:center

[CATHY] Hiro! You joined up
with the City Guard after all!

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.330 position:50% align:center
Oh, silly me. I keep forgetting

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
that we haven't been
properly introduced.

The girl you rescued?

00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:35.297 position:50% align:center
I took her home after the
attack. She went on and on

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.216 position:50% align:center
about how incredible you are.

00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:38.467 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Way to go, Amos.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
Escorting her was
supposed to be your job.

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
[CATHY] I count it an honor
to fight alongside you.

00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:45.807 position:50% align:center
My name's Cathy.

Oh. The pleasure's all mine.

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:52.314 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] Hey, lovebirds!
Less palaver, more training!

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.608 position:50% align:center
The only fraternizing here
is with swordplay!

00:12:54.691 --> 00:13:00.322 position:50% align:center
Huh. Actually, this is perfect.
Show us what you got, Hiro!

00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:06.370 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Fine. You think I'm scared?

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.621 position:50% align:center
I've seen people die,

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.623 position:50% align:center
been hunted by a
knife-wielding maniac,

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
and survived a goblin siege.

00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:15.379 position:50% align:center
A wooden sword doesn't
mean squat to me.

00:13:23.554 --> 00:13:24.805 position:50% align:center
Heh. Uh-oh.

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.266 position:50% align:center
Am I supposed to find
that look intimidating?

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:28.851 position:50% align:center
Go on! You can do it!

00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
Win this, and we can
eat together at lunch!

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
All right.

Get up! Shake it off!

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
Right! Try to keep
your wits about you

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.962 position:50% align:center

to his movements!

Eh?

That's an amateur stance.

From the way you
were loafin' around

I'd thought you'd be
made of sterner stuff!

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.400 position:50% align:center
I'm disappointed!

00:14:20.736 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center

what you really are?

better built than this kid.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.300 position:50% align:center
That must be the reason Bob
was acting so weird earlier.

they could take on a rhino.

about Amos. Thank you.

Yeah, could you not
say it out loud?

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.582 position:50% align:center
I hate to be the one
to tell you this,

00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center
but someone your age
has no business

00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:00.961 position:50% align:center
signing on as a mercenary
in the City Guard.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:03.881 position:50% align:center
I tried to tell you it
was a rash decision.

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
It was framed as a
typical class-change event!

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center

this isn't permanent.

four more days,

00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
once the hard part's over,

00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
the Auberdine Walkthrough
will tell you where to go.

00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:16.727 position:50% align:center
You're right,
it's only the first day.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
If I don't power through,
Kamui will roast me.

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
That's the spirit!

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
You've got this!
No more roasting!

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm exhausted.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
We can sleep in-game, you know.

00:16:31.742 --> 00:16:33.994 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh? Really? That's a thing?

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center
It's somewhat common, actually,
'specially with Full-Dives.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
See, realism means giving you
the opportunity to recharge.

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:41.919 position:50% align:center
Huh. That makes sense.

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Hey. You lonesome?
Do you want me to join you?

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:47.174 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but no thank you.

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Aw, you're no fun.

00:16:49.927 --> 00:16:52.638 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Dude. What's she trying to pull?

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:56.767 position:50% align:center
More importantly,
should I have said yes?

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
[REONA snores]

00:17:00.521 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
What?! Already?!

00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:08.529 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]
Good morning.

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, they actually
bothered to make

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
grogginess part
of the experience.

00:17:16.912 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
[REONA] The devs tapped into
state-of-the-art neuroscience

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:21.834 position:50% align:center
to make your brain feel
like you slept for hours.

00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
Kind of a weird use for cutting
edge technology, but whatever.

00:17:25.504 --> 00:17:26.964 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
You might want to get up.

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.383 position:50% align:center
The other recruits have been
at their training for a while.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:34.263 position:50% align:center
Do what?
Lead with that! [grunting]

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:37.641 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!
It won't happen again!

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:38.809 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA grunts]

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
Flawless technique!

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
Show 'em how
it's done, Granada!

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.232 position:50% align:center
That's the way! Bravo!

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:47.568 position:50% align:center
Take us to school! Ha, ha!

00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:51.822 position:50% align:center
Somebody wasted no time
playing favorites, huh?

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
[AMOS]
Huh? You still here?

00:17:53.991 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I be?

00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
I know Amos is infuriating,
but he's still the instructor.

00:17:58.996 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
You need to show him respect.

00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:02.708 position:50% align:center
Do I have to?

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
Instructor Amos, sir.
What would you like me to do?

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.963 position:50% align:center
[AMOS]
Practice your swings.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:09.882 position:50% align:center
You've got to be kidding me.

00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:11.425 position:50% align:center
At least tell me
if I do them enough

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.260 position:50% align:center
it'll unlock some special move.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:16.013 position:50% align:center
Are you a guardsman in training
or are you an infant?

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
Tesla has a special move,
doesn't he?

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] The captain is a genius.
You're an imbecile.

00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
I can't figure out for the life
of me why he recruited you.

00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:26.982 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Look, just teach me
something useful, please?

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
I'll practice my butt off.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
Ha! Typical. You think all
you need to get good

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
is a little practice?
To even approach Tesla's level,

00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
a warrior has to
keep at it for longer

00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
than you've been alive!

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:39.161 position:50% align:center
'Kay, that's a really long time.

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.747 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] And by "warrior,"
I mean someone with talent.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
Let me put it into
perspective for you, son.

00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
Ever seen an 80-year
old hag convinced

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
she's gonna be a
top-earning dancer?

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.505 position:50% align:center
That's basically you.

00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:53.175 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I'm not a senior citizen.
I'm the protagonist!

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
There's no point
arguing with him.

00:18:55.052 --> 00:18:57.221 position:50% align:center
Let it go for now and
do your practice swings.

00:18:57.304 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
I hate everything about this.

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
Look at this guy.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.899 position:50% align:center
Apparently they say he's
the Best Friend Killer.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
[PALUÙ] No joke?
And they let him sign up?

00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
What if he tries to
murder us in our sleep?

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:16.365 position:50% align:center
Oh, actually the whole
Friend Killer thing

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.242 position:50% align:center
was just this crazy
misunderstanding.

00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:21.537 position:50% align:center
Captain Tesla ruled
the death an accident--

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.540 position:50% align:center
Did I ask? Quit driving
down the average.

00:19:24.623 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:27.209 position:50% align:center
You remember that old saying

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
about a chain only being as
strong as its weakest link?

00:19:30.212 --> 00:19:31.964 position:50% align:center
Sure, you do.

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:33.549 position:50% align:center
I'm familiar with it, yeah.

00:19:33.632 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
[PALUÙ laughs]

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.220 position:50% align:center
[CATHY] Hiro! We can train
together if you want.

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
Uh. Thank you!

00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
Ah. You are pathetic.

00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
[CATHY]
Is everything all right?

00:19:45.394 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Y-Yeah. I'm good.
Just give me a second.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA]
Ain't that the truth...

00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
Gotta be reassuring to know
somebody's on your side.

00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:53.944 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:56.113 position:50% align:center
[GUARD T]
I'm beat.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
[GUARD U]
I'm starving.

00:19:57.531 --> 00:19:58.699 position:50% align:center
[GUARD V]
What's for lunch?

00:19:58.782 --> 00:19:59.867 position:50% align:center
[GUARD W]
Stale bread.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
Here's what you do. Watch me.

00:20:01.577 --> 00:20:03.704 position:50% align:center
It's all about how you
position your grip.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.122 position:50% align:center
The secret is using your thumb

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
and forefinger
for better support.

00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Oh, okay.

00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:10.252 position:50% align:center
Once you've got a decent
grasp of the hilt,

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.879 position:50% align:center
bend your elbow ever so slightly

00:20:11.962 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
so you can use your
left arm for balance.

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:15.257 position:50% align:center
Am I doing this right?

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.259 position:50% align:center
Like a seasoned pro.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
[HIRO laughs]

00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:20.512 position:50% align:center
"Am I doing this right?",
that's you.

00:20:20.596 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
That's what you
sound like right now.

00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:27.728 position:50% align:center
All right! Break time is over!
Move your asses! Yes, you!

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:32.149 position:50% align:center
Unless you're Granada.
He can do whatever he wants.

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Cool. Cathy's given me something

00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
I can build on, at least.

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Today we're sparing
one-on-one to fine tune

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.452 position:50% align:center
our combat technique.

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.454 position:50% align:center
I'm so screwed.

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.289 position:50% align:center
[AMOS]
No holding back!

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
Begin the practice match
on my command!

00:20:50.876 --> 00:20:51.752 position:50% align:center
En guard!

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA yells]

00:20:53.629 --> 00:20:56.632 position:50% align:center
[gasps] This is insane!

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:59.343 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Practice match,
my ass! Forget goblins!

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.762 position:50% align:center
This behemoth'll take
me out in one strike!

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA laughs]
What's the matter, Hiro?

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Okay. Remember:
it's all about the grip.

00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
Use your thumb and forefinger
to support the hilt.

00:21:09.895 --> 00:21:12.648 position:50% align:center
Bend the elbow.
Left arm for balance.

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:13.941 position:50% align:center
Just go for it!

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:16.235 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:19.488 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Dig deep! Hit him
with everything you've got!

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
[HIRO yells]

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:25.327 position:50% align:center
Come on, kid. That was tragic.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
[HIRO groaning]

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.498 position:50% align:center
Granada claims victory!
Practice match over!

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
[GUARD X]
Nice one!

00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:32.918 position:50% align:center
[GUARD Y]
You da man!

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:38.382 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA]
Wise up. Quit while ya can.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:41.677 position:50% align:center
The only thing I get outta
fighting you is target practice.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
If you insist on
training here with us,

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.598 position:50% align:center
then from now on the privilege
is gonna cost ya.

00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:49.977 position:50% align:center
Cough up the gald, and think
of us as your personal guard.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:04.533 position:50% align:center
