00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:11.595 align:middle
Die!

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.347 align:middle
[HIRO screams]

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.099 align:middle
[ALICIA] How dare you
interrupt my vendetta!

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.268 align:middle
[MIZARISA]
I am Mizarisa the Inquisitor!

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle
You are forbidden from killing
my glorious bed wetter!

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:24.816 align:middle
[HIRO]
Son of a whore!

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.044 align:middle
[laughing] Fear not, love.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.921 align:middle
I'm here to protect you.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.298 align:middle
This... This doesn't make sense.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:12.883 align:middle
I'll say it doesn't!

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:16.261 align:middle
Why's an inquisitor care whether
trash like him lives or dies?

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:19.306 align:middle
Well, this may be news to you,
but Hiro's been cleared.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.807 align:middle
City Guard Captain Tesla

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.685 align:middle
ordained the
acquittal personally.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.772 align:middle
The man holds absolute judicial
authority over the city.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.983 align:middle
Even the lowliest of peasants
here are answerable to him.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.693 align:middle
So, in other words...

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.612 align:middle
Harm so much as a
hair on his head,

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.322 align:middle
and you'll find yourself
in direct violation

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.324 align:middle
of an official mandate.

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:41.286 align:middle
At which point you become mine
to do with as I please!

00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:44.706 align:middle
[HIRO]
Nice! Way to bring it, Mizarisa!

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.959 align:middle
This might just
get her to lay off!

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.293 align:middle
Um. Question.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.838 align:middle
How'd you even know I was
here in the first place?

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:53.882 align:middle
Promise not to get upset, but
I've been keeping tabs on you

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:55.259 align:middle
since you left the dungeon.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.594 align:middle
I just feel like we should
hang out more, you know?

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:00.347 align:middle
Wait. You've been tailing
me this entire time?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.057 align:middle
Kinda surprised I didn't notice.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.184 align:middle
Let that be a lesson
never to underestimate

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:06.353 align:middle
an invested inquisitor.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.857 align:middle
[HIRO] So, like, is she
magical or something?

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.234 align:middle
[REONA] Suggestion:
maybe you should think about

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.028 align:middle
asking her to join your party?

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:16.905 align:middle
That could work.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.408 align:middle
[HIRO] True, we sorta
got off on the wrong foot,

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:22.077 align:middle
but she seems to have my
best interests at heart.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.288 align:middle
And she's clearly
a good tracker.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.749 align:middle
Thing is, I have an exceptional
nose. All I had to do

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.169 align:middle
was follow the scent of
your pee pants, and voila!

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:32.045 align:middle
Wha--? That's not a real skill!

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.923 align:middle
Besides, how strong
could the smell be?

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:36.466 align:middle
I didn't want to
hurt your feelings,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.261 align:middle
but yeah,
it's a pretty powerful odor.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.346 align:middle
Bad enough to make
my eyes water.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.515 align:middle
You should've said
something earlier!

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.851 align:middle
This is not how I
wanted to find out!

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.978 align:middle
[REONA] This game prides
itself on realism.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle
Details don't just automatically
reset the way they do in manga.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:52.941 align:middle
If you pee yourself here,

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.277 align:middle
you smell like it till
you change clothes.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.528 align:middle
Thanks for the tip.

00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:59.823 align:middle
I'll contact wardrobe as
soon as we're done here.

00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:05.662 align:middle
Damn! So close to his neck!

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.039 align:middle
[HIRO gasping]

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle
Are you crazy? Why'd you
make an attempt on his life?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.503 align:middle
Did you not hear a
word I just said?

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:17.090 align:middle
Huh? I didn't hear a thing.
What "mandate?" I'm sorry.

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:19.885 align:middle
Speak up. I'm rather
preoccupied at the moment

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.845 align:middle
bringing justice to
my brother's murderer

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:24.598 align:middle
and his blade-wielding
accomplice.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.434 align:middle
In fact, I'm so bereaved
I doubt news of his acquittal

00:04:27.518 --> 00:04:30.062 align:middle
will reach me
before it's too late.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.439 align:middle
Hold up. You're gonna play
dumb so you can get away

00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:34.316 align:middle
killing two totally
innocent people?

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:39.404 align:middle
[laughs] Oh, this might be
my favorite example of nuts.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:40.697 align:middle
Have it your way.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.617 align:middle
Best of luck taking
me off the board.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:51.041 align:middle
[MIZARISA laughs] Like a corn
shuckin sucker could dream of

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.043 align:middle
goin' toe-to-toe
with an inquisitor.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:57.214 align:middle
I'm as highly trained
as they, come, girly.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle
Your brains will be a lovely
addition to the dÃ©cor!

00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:05.639 align:middle
Look, I know she had it coming,
but this seems like overkill.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.724 align:middle
[REONA]
Huh?

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:09.852 align:middle
[HIRO]
Where...?

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:13.564 align:middle
H-How is that even a thing?
Does she have special powers?

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:15.691 align:middle
Heads up! She's on the ceiling!

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:16.817 align:middle
[HIRO gasps]

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.362 align:middle
What kind of childhood
friend is she?

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.198 align:middle
She's like-- She's like
a friggin' ninja!

00:05:23.282 --> 00:05:26.702 align:middle
[laughs] You're both
going to die!

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.788 align:middle
I will slice you open
from skin to pit!

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:32.207 align:middle
[HIRO gasps]

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:36.295 align:middle
There! We're okay!

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.675 align:middle
[HIRO]
What? Oh, come on!

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.886 align:middle
Where were you
even keeping those?

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle
[ALICIA cackles]

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:50.142 align:middle
It appears I neglected to take
your full measure, girl.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.186 align:middle
It's time for me to get serious.

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.522 align:middle
You're not walking away with
Hiro's blood on your hands.

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.316 align:middle
Liking your style.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle
[HIRO]
I'm so asking her to join!

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle
Oh, full disclosure: what I
said earlier was a pretext.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.866 align:middle
My reasons for protectin' him
have very little to do

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.452 align:middle
with the law.
They're quite personal.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.163 align:middle
What on earth are you
babbling about?

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.539 align:middle
He is exceptional.

00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:15.709 align:middle
When in pain, he shines
like a freshly minted gald.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.586 align:middle
Do what? I'm not
following you--

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.795 align:middle
He's my obsession!

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.923 align:middle
I want to torture him
relentlessly!

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.216 align:middle
Push him to the brink.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:24.426 align:middle
Sever his limbs!
Squish his eyes!

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.846 align:middle
See him covered in
his own filth! [laughs]

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.515 align:middle
What a spectacle that would be!

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:32.017 align:middle
My spine tingles
just thinking of it!

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.937 align:middle
Say what?! Why is she
talking like this?

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.105 align:middle
She's just as crazy as Alicia!

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:38.941 align:middle
Your vengeance
does not outweigh

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:42.277 align:middle
my need to see him
have another accident!

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.116 align:middle
What's so funny?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.077 align:middle
You're powerful,
but the tradeoff is

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.204 align:middle
you're quite slow in a fight.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle
And that saw,
the teeth are so worn out

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:58.418 align:middle
from overuse it can't possibly
compare to a knife!

00:06:58.502 --> 00:06:59.294 align:middle
[MIZARISA grunts]

00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle
[ALICIA grunts]

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:07.719 align:middle
Ha... You freak.
You'll be on my table!

00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:10.681 align:middle
Somehow, I doubt that.
Let me show you a move.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.891 align:middle
I call it Mincing the Orchard!

00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:14.351 align:middle
[MIZARISA grunts]

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.936 align:middle
[laughs]

00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:19.606 align:middle
[ALICIA yells]

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.234 align:middle
Crap! Not good!
She's on the defensive!

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.402 align:middle
If I didn't know better,

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.362 align:middle
I'd swear she was
aiming for something.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle
The way a boxer does.
Like a counter move.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.449 align:middle
[MIZARISA grunts]

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.538 align:middle
[MIZARISA laughs]

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle
You have admirable speed, but
your attacks are simplistic.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:41.003 align:middle
It's all in the timing.
I just parry.

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.921 align:middle
[HIRO]
Whoa! Who knew torturer school

00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:45.424 align:middle
included a course
in one-on-one combat?

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:49.178 align:middle
You fought well, but it's over.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle
[HIRO]
What? No way!

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:59.354 align:middle
[MIZARISA laughs]
You're better at this

00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:01.607 align:middle
than I gave you credit for,
peasant girl.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.609 align:middle
That's a solid
technique you've got,

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.736 align:middle
focusing your attacks
high to open up

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.071 align:middle
the middle for a good kick--

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle
[MIZARISA grunts]

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.366 align:middle
Mizarisa!

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.246 align:middle
[laughs] Don't be upset.
She's just unconscious.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.126 align:middle
I won't kill her till I'm
done with you. Priorities.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.713 align:middle
Oh, would you look at that.
There's no one to defend you!

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle
[HIRO gasps]

00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:28.634 align:middle
[HIRO]
Th-This is it.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.845 align:middle
She's too strong, not to
mention a total freak show.

00:08:31.929 --> 00:08:36.016 align:middle
I'm toast! Death by
a childhood friend!

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.101 align:middle
[KAMUI]
Fighting won't do you any good.

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:42.314 align:middle
You gotta be clever.
Find another way.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.609 align:middle
[HIRO] What did he mean?
What can I possibly do?

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:46.735 align:middle
[HIRO gasps]

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:50.906 align:middle
Time to die. Time to die.
Time to die!

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:56.161 align:middle
Run for it! I'll try to distract
her as long as I can!

00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:58.956 align:middle
I sense something otherworldly.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.457 align:middle
Naughty boy.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle
You're being safeguarded
by a fairy, aren't you?

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:04.962 align:middle
[REONA gasps]

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.714 align:middle
[ALICIA laughs]
I do hope she wasn't intending

00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:09.883 align:middle
to go for my eyes again.

00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:12.636 align:middle
Uh. That is not fair! Hiro!

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.429 align:middle
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:17.766 align:middle
Make a b-line for
the center of town! Now!

00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:21.061 align:middle
Seriously?

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:25.399 align:middle
[ALICIA laughs]

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.651 align:middle
[KAMUI] If you were in her
shoes, what's something

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:30.863 align:middle
an old friend might do
that would throw you off?

00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:32.322 align:middle
[HIRO]
I understand.

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:36.159 align:middle
I have to pull the one move
that gets 'em every time.

00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:40.664 align:middle
2D, 3D, HD or Double D.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.165 align:middle
Here goes...

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:45.711 align:middle
[HIRO yells]

00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:58.557 align:middle
[HIRO]
Yeah! Take that!

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.684 align:middle
No!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:04.271 align:middle
Yeah. That how you
thought it'd go?

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.857 align:middle
Uh? Wait, I--!

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.692 align:middle
You cannot be that
big of an idiot.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle
How old do you think I am?

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:13.363 align:middle
Like you're the first man who's
ever given my boobs a goose!

00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:16.325 align:middle
Okay. Another point
for realism, I guess.

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle
What was that
supposed to accomplish?!

00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:20.287 align:middle
Violating me doesn't make
you any less of a virgin!

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.122 align:middle
[HIRO groans]

00:10:22.206 --> 00:10:23.207 align:middle
Oh, come now.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.042 align:middle
Dropping to the floor already?

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:29.796 align:middle
I kicked Madam Saw
twice as hard as that.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.967 align:middle
Hmph. I suppose you'd like this
to be over with. Very well.

00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:36.803 align:middle
Get on your feet and run away!

00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:39.765 align:middle
[HIRO] Why can't I move?
I don't get it?

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.809 align:middle
Was the kick really that strong?

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:45.646 align:middle
[HIRO grunts]

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:49.483 align:middle
Hiro. I'm waiting for you
here--on the other side.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.861 align:middle
Ah! And evidently,
it's Martin Time again!

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:54.279 align:middle
I feel it! Yes!

00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:56.573 align:middle
My brother's spirit
is here with us!

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:59.117 align:middle
Martin. I shall
avenge your death!

00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:01.370 align:middle
Your soul will have justice!

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:05.415 align:middle
Kill him! Make him pay!
Hiro, must die!

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:06.458 align:middle
That's a checkmate!

00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:09.086 align:middle
I'm a goner!
Nice knowin' everybody!

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.421 align:middle
[REONA]
Don't give up, Hiro!

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.298 align:middle
[HIRO]
"Auberdine Walkthrough" my ass!

00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:17.928 align:middle
You suck, Kamui! Or maybe I just
don't have your galaxy brain.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:22.516 align:middle
Wait. Hold up.
What did he actually say?

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.978 align:middle
[KAMUI] Something an old friend
might do to throw you off.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.563 align:middle
[HIRO]
Grabbing her boobs! Hello!

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:32.734 align:middle
Already tried that!
Unless, he meant, like...

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:37.197 align:middle
Say goodbye. Time to die!

00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:39.741 align:middle
I love you!

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle
Huh? The hell is that
supposed to mean?

00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:51.837 align:middle
Alicia! Please, I am
madly in love with you!

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.548 align:middle
You what? If you think I'm
falling for a stupid trick--

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.592 align:middle
Listen! I'm dead serious!

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.636 align:middle
I've been bottling up these
feelings since we were kids!

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.597 align:middle
You-- You can't be...

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.682 align:middle
[HIRO]
I-It's working!

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:06.185 align:middle
This is a master class!
You go, Hiro!

00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:08.145 align:middle
Nothing discombobulates
a potential killer

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.522 align:middle
like confessing your love
for them out of nowhere!

00:12:10.606 --> 00:12:13.942 align:middle
So, you're saying that you've
harbored feelings for me

00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:15.777 align:middle
all these years?

00:12:15.861 --> 00:12:17.988 align:middle
No! You manipulative bastard!

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.531 align:middle
Listen to me!

00:12:19.615 --> 00:12:21.825 align:middle
You're so much a part of my
life that I don't even know--

00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:24.119 align:middle
I don't know if I could
go on without you!

00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:26.288 align:middle
You-- You're my
everything, Alicia!

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.623 align:middle
[gasping]

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:30.375 align:middle
I want us to grow old together!
To have a family!

00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:33.795 align:middle
Make me the happiest man alive
and let me have your babies!

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:35.756 align:middle
[ALICIA gasping]

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:40.469 align:middle
[ALICIA]
I... I don't understand.

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:45.057 align:middle
Was that a marriage proposal?
Is this really happening?

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.809 align:middle
[HIRO]
Sweet, almost there.

00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:50.187 align:middle
Alicia! Stop this madness!

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.649 align:middle
Let's put things back
the way they were!

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:55.067 align:middle
It's too late.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.652 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:58.987 align:middle
[ALICIA]
Too late, too late, too late!

00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:02.407 align:middle
We've passed
the point of no return!

00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:04.868 align:middle
I loved you with
all my heart and soul!

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:06.495 align:middle
You were my whole world!

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:10.249 align:middle
Martin felt the same. And yet...

00:13:10.332 --> 00:13:12.251 align:middle
You butchered him!

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:16.004 align:middle
Um, actually, that's a strong
word, plus it was accident.

00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:17.714 align:middle
[ALICIA]
Stop saying that!

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:20.634 align:middle
Maybe you didn't mean to kill
him but you might as well

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.886 align:middle
have run him through
like a wild boar.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.138 align:middle
You wanted to leave the city!

00:13:25.222 --> 00:13:26.765 align:middle
[HIRO gasping]

00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:28.725 align:middle
[ALICIA]
Oh! You remember that now?

00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:32.229 align:middle
Your selfishness ruined our
lives in one fell swoop!

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.815 align:middle
I-- I was only trying to...

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:37.359 align:middle
[ALICIA]
Someone died! Don't you get it?

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.279 align:middle
No, not just "someone."
My brother.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle
And why? What was the point?

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:46.535 align:middle
It made no sense!

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.871 align:middle
Then you ran and
left me here all alone.

00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:49.955 align:middle
[HIRO gasps]

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.582 align:middle
[ALICIA cries]

00:13:57.546 --> 00:13:59.006 align:middle
That was awesome!

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:02.759 align:middle
Way to play on the emotions
to keep from getting whacked!

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.386 align:middle
Yeah. Awesome.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.722 align:middle
You don't sound pleased.

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.724 align:middle
No? Imagine that.

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:11.018 align:middle
I just realized
what a jerk I am.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.728 align:middle
Don't be like that.

00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:14.229 align:middle
This whole time I've
just been thinking of

00:14:14.313 --> 00:14:16.398 align:middle
everything as part of some game.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.734 align:middle
I never saw Alicia
as an old friend.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:21.653 align:middle
And Martin was just some guy.

00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:25.032 align:middle
But I've been a big
part of their lives.

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:28.702 align:middle
To them, we've known each other
forever. We're like a family.

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.538 align:middle
And I'm pretty sure
Alicia was in love.

00:14:31.622 --> 00:14:34.333 align:middle
My actions cost Martin his life.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:37.544 align:middle
Then I ran away.
I could've stayed.

00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:40.005 align:middle
I could've tried to
help him, but no.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:43.217 align:middle
I took off like a coward.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle
Out of everything I've done,
that's the absolute worst.

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:52.392 align:middle
Oh, man. I suck. Not like
that's news, though.

00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:55.646 align:middle
[REONA] U-Uh. Okay, before
you get too down on yourself,

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.106 align:middle
bear in mind,
they're all just NPCs.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.776 align:middle
[MIZARISA grunts]

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.986 align:middle
Well, that's the first
time I've met someone

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.947 align:middle
who could take me
out in two hits.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.907 align:middle
Thank you. You all right?

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle
[MIZARISA]
No worries.

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:12.162 align:middle
And please, don't
thank me. Unless...

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:14.706 align:middle
You wanna gimme your
pinky finger as a keepsake.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.085 align:middle
[HIRO] Um, no. Matter of fact,
you should leave.

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle
[MIZARISA]
Aw!

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:33.141 align:middle
[REONA] We'll need to
take it to a blacksmith.

00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:34.768 align:middle
Or, better idea...

00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:36.812 align:middle
Where can I find
the Kenura tree?

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:37.771 align:middle
[REONA]
Huh?

00:15:37.855 --> 00:15:39.857 align:middle
You know what I mean.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.693 align:middle
Big tree, tiny hill.
Yeah. It's not far.

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:45.445 align:middle
Just a bit south
of here, actually.

00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:48.198 align:middle
Wait for me. I'll be back.

00:15:48.282 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle
[REONA] Okay, but before you go,
shouldn't you pee?

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle
I'll be fine. Let me do this.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.396 align:middle
Martin. You're here, right?
Come on out.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:32.451 align:middle
[MARTIN]
Hiro...

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:35.412 align:middle
[HIRO]
Oh, hey. How's it going?

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.498 align:middle
Strange. I thought
you'd be frightened.

00:16:38.582 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle
I guess I'm just used
to it by now, y'know?

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:44.171 align:middle
Have you come to join
me in the hereafter?

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle
'Fraid I have to
disappoint you, old pal.

00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:51.428 align:middle
But, uh, there's something
I really wanted to say.

00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:53.889 align:middle
[HIRO] Except wanting to
and being able to

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:59.853 align:middle
are two different things. I
don't have the words for this.

00:16:59.937 --> 00:17:03.482 align:middle
[HIRO]
Dammit. Come on!

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:06.860 align:middle
Quit being a useless
turd and think!

00:17:06.944 --> 00:17:10.489 align:middle
What would Kamui say right now?

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:13.200 align:middle
[KAMUI] I literally spelled it
out for you in the walkthrough.

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.536 align:middle
You brain-dead jackalope.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:16.912 align:middle
[HIRO gasps]

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.247 align:middle
[HIRO]
Of course!

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.832 align:middle
I was too hyper focused on
his attitude to register

00:17:20.916 --> 00:17:29.424 align:middle
what he meant. He was
trying to give me advice.

00:17:29.508 --> 00:17:35.722 align:middle
I don't expect you to forgive.
Or forget. Just come with me.

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:44.439 align:middle
Please, Martin. Join my party.

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:50.279 align:middle
[groaning]

00:17:58.579 --> 00:17:59.997 align:middle
Martin! Help!

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.583 align:middle
Hiro won't stop chasing me!

00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:03.834 align:middle
Give her a rest.

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:06.295 align:middle
One of these days
she's gonna get you back.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle
[HIRO]
Huh?

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.674 align:middle
[laughs] I apologize!

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.218 align:middle
Sometimes I just get
real carried away!

00:18:13.302 --> 00:18:15.929 align:middle
[laughing]

00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:18.015 align:middle
Okay, was it strictly
necessary to make

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:19.766 align:middle
the younger version
of me sound like that?

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.643 align:middle
[ALICIA]
You're not being mean enough!

00:18:21.727 --> 00:18:23.061 align:middle
You have to get mad at him!

00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:26.732 align:middle
[MARTIN] Settle down, Alicia.
He said he was sorry.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:29.401 align:middle
Yeah! And besides,
I was just playing!

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle
Whatever. I swear, Martin.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.198 align:middle
You let Hiro get away
with everything.

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:35.407 align:middle
Oh, come on.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.659 align:middle
What do you want me
to do? We're friends.

00:18:37.743 --> 00:18:40.412 align:middle
Nuh-uh! We're way
more than friends!

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:43.123 align:middle
Me and Martin are
bestest buddies!

00:18:43.207 --> 00:18:46.251 align:middle
Yeah we are! The bestest
buddies that ever were!

00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle
Forever and ever!
Nothing will ever separate us!

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle
[MARTIN] That's right!
Absolutely nothing!

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:57.095 align:middle
[HIRO]
Yeah! Hiro and Martin!

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:27.125 align:middle
Hiro and Martin.

00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:31.463 align:middle
The two bestest buddies
that ever were.

00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle
Well, what do you know?

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.426 align:middle
You do remember the
words of our promise.

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:43.183 align:middle
[gasps] What? I don't get it.
What's going on?

00:19:43.267 --> 00:19:44.476 align:middle
Farewell.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.727 align:middle
You can't go!

00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:48.856 align:middle
I asked you to become
a member of my party!

00:19:48.939 --> 00:19:51.817 align:middle
I know you did, old friend.
And I'm grateful.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.152 align:middle
Okay, then. So come with me!

00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:56.572 align:middle
[MARTIN laughs]
I have to move on now.

00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:58.365 align:middle
Martin Time is over.

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.826 align:middle
[HIRO gasps]

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:04.454 align:middle
By the way. Thank you, Hiro.

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:23.265 align:middle
[REONA]
Hey.

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:25.934 align:middle
What are you doing?
Were you watching us?

00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle
[REONA]
Yeah. Sorry.

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:32.274 align:middle
[HIRO]
Eh. No worries. We're good.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:40.324 align:middle
Martin. Oh, man.
Why'd you have to...?

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.409 align:middle
Hope I didn't ruin the
moment or anything,

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.912 align:middle
but for what it's worth,
I could only see you.

00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle
So, there's that at least.

00:20:47.164 --> 00:20:50.375 align:middle
Even if... you kinda looked
like a crazy person

00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:52.419 align:middle
hashing it out with
the voices in his head.

00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:54.922 align:middle
[HIRO]
Is that supposed to comfort me?

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:57.925 align:middle
Huh...? Never mind that!
Look at your nameplate!

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:01.929 align:middle
[HIRO]
Never mind the fact you just--

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:06.058 align:middle
"Best Best Friend Killer:
The Best Amicide"?

00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:09.895 align:middle
Um, yeah. That wording's
a little awkward.

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.939 align:middle
Turn that frown upside down!

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:14.858 align:middle
You've got a snazzy new title.
Plus, you're no longer

00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:16.985 align:middle
being haunted
by a vengeful spirit!

00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:19.279 align:middle
I think we can count
those as positives!

00:21:19.363 --> 00:21:22.324 align:middle
Sure, but there's still
Alicia to worry about.

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle
And you'll handle that better
the next time around, yeah?

00:21:25.494 --> 00:21:28.372 align:middle
Come on, kiddo!
You're making progress!

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.374 align:middle
You're not just saying that,
are you?

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:32.709 align:middle
No! Now buck up!

00:21:32.793 --> 00:21:35.379 align:middle
Let's get that sword
to a blacksmith ASAP.

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:38.215 align:middle
Oh, and uh... while we're at it,
we can buy you some new pants.

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:40.217 align:middle
Right! I still smell like pee!

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.094 align:middle
[REONA laughs]
You're adorable!

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:43.679 align:middle
[BOTH laughing]

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:45.472 align:middle
[bell ringing]

00:21:45.556 --> 00:21:46.557 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.599 align:middle
Am I losing my mind

00:21:47.683 --> 00:21:50.143 align:middle
or is that the sound
of church bells?

00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:51.019 align:middle
[HIRO gasping]

00:21:51.103 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle
[REONA]
That can't be good!

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.108 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:56.191 --> 00:22:00.696 align:middle
[ringing continues]

00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:04.283 align:middle
[HIRO]
Mind telling me what's going on?

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:08.620 align:middle
[REONA] Um, I would, but
honestly, I have no idea.

00:22:09.997 --> 00:22:14.418 align:middle
I've never seen this...
The City of Ted is on fire!

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:49.763 align:middle
