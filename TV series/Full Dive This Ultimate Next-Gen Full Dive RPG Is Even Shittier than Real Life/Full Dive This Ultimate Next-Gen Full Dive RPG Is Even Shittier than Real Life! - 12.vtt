[QUEEN GOVERN laughs]

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.069 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
So, then.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
Hiro, you intend to commit the
crime of Egress, do you not?

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
Misguided fool.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
I can say with absolute
certainty that you

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
shan't pass through
the gates alive.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What do I do?

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center
A goblin is too much
for me to handle,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
so Tesla's a whole other
order of magnitude!

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:47.130 position:50% align:center
Allow me to share with you
another secret, boy.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
I've yet to tap into the true
reservoir of my abilities.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
Extreme Lightning
is merely a taste.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center
The next level puts
that one to shame.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.268 position:50% align:center
I call it Extreme
Lightning Despair.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
I'd love to showcase the move
as a parting gift of sorts.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
But it's so rapid.
I doubt your eyes

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
will have the time to
process what's killing you.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.402 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
No need to remind me, dude!

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.612 position:50% align:center
I can't even see the normal

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
Lighting whatever-the-flip-
you-call-it.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:14.032 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, of course not!

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.451 position:50% align:center
Enough, my dear. Kill him.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:17.660 position:50% align:center
As you wish.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.331 position:50% align:center
Fare thee well, young friend!
It's been fun!

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.166 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Ha, ha!

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.043 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
So, this is how it ends.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:29.172 position:50% align:center
Worst part is, 'cause it's KQ,
it's gonna hurt like hell!

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.257 position:50% align:center
No, scratch that,
the worst part will be

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
it frying my console and
wasting all my money!

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:48.024 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Alicia, you...

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA gasping]

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:52.737 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.868 position:50% align:center
Ha. You would sacrifice
yourself for him?

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:02.914 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Why would you
do something like this?

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:07.752 position:50% align:center
I-- I'm not worth saving!
Damn it!

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:11.256 position:50% align:center
Alicia, I-- After everything
I put you through, you still...

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:15.093 position:50% align:center
I mean, this whole time I
thought you wanted me dead!

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
I saw my brother.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.556 position:50% align:center
He appeared in a dream

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.560 position:50% align:center
and said the time had come
to forgive you, so...

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.186 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.689 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:30.775 position:50% align:center
I'm mortified to think
of how I treated you.

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
When you joined the City Guard,
I knew what had to be done.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
I had to follow your example,
if only to keep you safe.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:43.163 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Alicia, stop...

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
No. Not yet. Listen.
Please. It's important.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.797 position:50% align:center
When you said you'd always
hoped to marry me someday...

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:57.469 position:50% align:center
For a moment,
I was the happiest girl.

00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No. No, no, no!
Don't do this! Stay with me!

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Promise,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.817 position:50% align:center
you'll live enough for
the three of us, okay?

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
[TESLA grunts]

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.246 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Reona. NPCs that die in-game,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
do they ever come back?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
They don't. I'm sorry.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That tracks.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
If it doesn't happen
in real life,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
why would it happen here?

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
KQ is the last word in realism.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Excuse me.

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
I trust the requiem is finished?

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
Your wench, alas, died in vain.
A noble sacrifice, to be sure,

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
yet merely serving to
prolong the inevitable.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I get it, it's not real.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
Just a console-based
full-dive RPG.

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
And she's only an NPC.
I understand that.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
It is time!

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
The sands of your
hourglass have run out!

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Still, you wanna know
what's real?

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
What's real is how I'm gonna
mess you up!

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
[TESLA yells, gasps]

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
What?

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
A coincidental piece of luck.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
It shall not happen again!

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
Extreme Lightning Despair!
It's over!

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] What? Impossible!
That wasn't happenstance!

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
He deflected the bolt
with his sword!

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
Um, I have no earthly idea
what's going on here,

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
but that was a total
shonen protagonist move!

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
Not to overreact,
but it's kinda freaking me out!

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
Will you knock it off?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] If I'm honest,
it's freaking me out too.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
Who'd have thought
facing down with this guy,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
right here, right now,

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
would spark Kamui's
so-called "trick" again.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Pay attention, maggot.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
This ain't your
grandma's cheat code.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:19.402 position:50% align:center
KQ isn't the only place
you can use it.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
The game models
itself on real life.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
Pain, pleasure, blah,
blah, blah. You get it.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
There may be a difference
in degree, but not in kind.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center
It's why this little trick works
both in-game and out.

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
"But wait, O Enlightened
One," you ask.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.128 position:50% align:center
"If this trick gives you an
edge in KQ and in real life,

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center
why don't I ever
see anyone using it?"

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
Simple, people are dumbasses.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
You share that in common,
so I'll make sure

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
to break it down for
you nice and slow.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
Player stats can be increased by

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
a judicious application
of feeling.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
But not just any
old feeling will do.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
It takes conviction.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
A fire in the belly.
The will to win!

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
I'm talkin' pure, unsaturated,
single-minded hunger.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
It's what pushes us up
past the breaking point.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
It's what redirects
the course of destiny!

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
That's the trick. No.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
That's reality.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center

[HIRO yelling]

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
Look at him go.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
He's moving so fast I can't
tell what he's doing!

00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
I mean... Where'd he learn
how to fight like this?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
Have I seen this before?

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Wait, that's how Kamui fought!

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
That's the way!
You've got this, Hiro!

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50% align:center
Send him to the grave!

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
Kill this douchebag
and marry me!

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] About that.
You're definitely a hottie...

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
And you've got boobs for days...

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center

just not my speed.

Oh, what an unpleasant
reversal, Hiro!

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh, okay maybe I didn't take

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.068 position:50% align:center
the best care of this thing.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
But why the hell does this game
always have to tear me down?

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
I don't need this crap!
Real life's bad enough!

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
Ha! Yet again, the heavens
choose Tesla as champion.

Oh damn.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center

Are you kidding me?

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
I had him freakin' cornered,
this isn't fair!

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:31.136 position:50% align:center
Game over! My console's toast!

Hey. Long time no see, pal.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Great. I'm dead.
That's just perfect.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:56.202 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Yeah. Feels like
it's been a lifetime, huh?

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN]
So, how ya doin'?

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Not great.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I got myself
killed by Tesla.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
My poor console... It's so done.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
And there's something
else I need to tell you...

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
Alicia tried to save me.
He killed her, too.

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN] I see. Well, 'least you
gave it your best shot.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Thank you.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
Eh, don't mention it. Hey,
c'mon. This isn't over yet.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
How 'bout I actually let you
take me along this time?

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm sorry, what?

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see how it is.
We're gonna stand here and act

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
like you aren't the one
who asked me first?

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
Wait. That's right.
I wanted you to join me.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. Let's do it.
You and me, together.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Martin...

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
Impossible!

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
Whoa, now! Okay!

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
What unholy manner
of sword is this?

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
[gasps] My Golden Blade
has been shattered?

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
You foul, unnatural thing!

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
You cur. How dare you
brandish an accursed sword?

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] So is this like,
my hero's moment?

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
"Sword 'Best Friend Killer'
User: Amicidal Blade Wielder"?

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
How 'bout that.
Never saw this coming.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center
Whatever you did, Martin,
I owe you one.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
So, thanks a lot, buddy,
but now what do I do?

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
The sword's not cursed,
Tesla, you are!

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
Ha. An impressive blade indeed.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
If you can land
another blow, that is.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
Rest assured,
I shan't make the task

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
of hitting me straightforward.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.007 position:50% align:center
Gird your loins, worm!

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
Witness true mastery!
The ultimate move.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
If you thought Extreme
Lightning Despair

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
to be the pinnacle of my
technique, think again!

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
Behold.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
I give you, Extreme
Lightning Ultima!

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
I'm not really sure
what all that entails,

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
but it sounds like a big deal.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I've got this.
Trust me.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Hiro.

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
And it's not just talk.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
I've never been more certain
of anything in my entire life.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
This is my pinnacle.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
This game's been pushing me from
the second I first logged on.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
Surviving moment by moment
is a personal best!

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
Prepare to be humbled
by immeasurable speed!

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
Lightning Extreme Ultima!

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.056 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I see him!

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
[HIRO yelling]

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Oof. I thought you had it.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Mm. Yeah, you're telling me.

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
Can you believe they really
pulled BS like that?

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
Didn't even realize
that was a thing.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
[HIRO yelling]

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] My fault for turning
my back on her, I guess.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
[QUEEN GOVERN laughs]

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
[HIRO groans]

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
[REONA] To be fair,
I didn't notice either,

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
so that's partly on me.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
I still can't process how
gruesome things got afterward!

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
The torture he subjected you to?
Totes worth a Double Z rating.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Um. I'd appreciate
not talking about that.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
Trying to move past
the trauma, thanks.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
[REONA laughs]
Right. Sorry.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Bad as that was,
I'll never forget

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
the moment KQ
forcibly logged me out.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunting]

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:04.784 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] You'd have thought my
console was a barbeque grill.

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
[HIRO sighs]

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
So, how about Round Two?

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:11.249 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:14.419 position:50% align:center
[REONA laughs] I know you don't
have the cash for a fresh copy,

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
let alone a new console, but...

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
It's not a problem.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Because I see
real promise in you,

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
I'll rent 'em both out pro bono.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
A friends and family discount
for my future husband!

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Yeah. About that,

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need to give it
some more thought.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
[REONA] What? You're kidding,
right? You can't quit now!

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Mm...

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Hiro! I haven't seen
anyone get this close

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.779 position:50% align:center
to beating the first
part of KQ in years!

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:43.948 position:50% align:center
You have a responsibility!

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Maybe.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Honestly, I wanted to
start over when the game

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
slapped me with that
stupid "Amicide" label.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
Now, though? When I think about
all the crap I went through

00:13:56.211 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
getting erased,
it's hard to feel motivated.

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
Huh? Sorry, Reona, gimme a sec.

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
[REONA] What's the matter,
you need a bathroom break?

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.940 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That wasn't there before.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center
Did Kamui make it
so this only comes up

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
once you've learned the trick?

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:24.072 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI laughs]
You little bitch!

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
Got your ass handed to you, huh?

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.786 position:50% align:center
I told you the odds were 0.1.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
Damn it. I hate this guy
so freaking much!

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
So, what now?

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
You got whacked,
fried your console,

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
and still wanna jump back in?

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
There's a word
for people like you.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.550 position:50% align:center
Masochist.
Seriously, get some help.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
Shut your face!

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
Nobody said it was a done deal
that I'm logging back on!

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Lucky for you, I have
kind of a soft spot for freaks.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
Psst. Wanna know a secret?

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
It's possible to restart from
before you got slaughtered.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] It is? For being
ultra-realistic,

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.319 position:50% align:center
this game sure has
a lot of loopholes.

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] All you need to do
is boot up a new console,

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
insert your old cartridge,
and do what I'm

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
about to tell you
within ten seconds.

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
Are you listening?

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hm...?

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Say, "yuute emiya
uokemu kougo riiyo ujitori

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center
mayaa giira pepepepe pepepe pe"

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
at the top of your lungs.
But a little faster.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Once you've done that,
quickly switch out

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
the old cartridge
for a new one.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
Do it correctly, and you
can restart from roughly

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
an hour before
you kicked the bucket.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
Not that this'll do
a numpty like you

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
much good, but who knows!

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll last a
bit longer this time!

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I-I can do this!

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center
Everything I went
through still matters!

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Hello? What's going on?

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you're
having a moment.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] If I get to start over
an hour before I died...

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
There's the tiniest chance
I can save Alicia!

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:05.465 position:50% align:center
All right! Now this is how
you motivate someone!

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Why are you being
so weird all of a sudden?

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:10.929 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Because it's possible
to pick up where I left off!

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
All I have to do is shout,

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
"yuute emiya uokemu kougo riiyo

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
ujitori mayaa giira
pepepepe pepepe pe!"

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.438 position:50% align:center
You sound like you're
having a stroke.

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
I'mma hang up now and
call the paramedics.

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I'm fine! Kamui just had
another trick up his sleeve!

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Okay. Great.
Suppose you restart,

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
face off with Tesla,
and just get massacred again?

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
Does he have a
contingency plan for that?

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.578 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I mean, I have
a pretty visceral memory

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
of how it felt to
activate the trick.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.044 position:50% align:center
But if it didn't help me beat
Tesla the first time,

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
what are the odds now?

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Reona. One month.
Give me one month.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
Before we jump back in,
there's something I need to do.

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:06.609 position:50% align:center
[HIRO panting]

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Am I really gonna go
through all this trouble

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
for a video game?

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
This feels pretty great, though.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I forgot
how much I love to run.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm home.

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you
have the energy

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
to get a run in before school.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] What can I say?
I like the morning air.

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Well, it's better
for you than being holed up

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
in your room all day with that
stupid game, that's for sure.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
Oh. That right?

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
Uh! I-- Whatever, like it takes
that much to be better than

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
a dead full-dive RPG no one's
cared about in ten years.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Don't call it dead.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Eh, fair.

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
It's been objectively past
"dead" for a while now.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
That's not the word.
What do you call something

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
when it's so completely faded
people have forgotten it?

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:00.955 position:50% align:center
Gee, I don't know!

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.999 position:50% align:center
But a perfect word for
you would be "jerk."

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
Look, I get that you're
all about raggin' on

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
what I'm into 24/7, but grow up!

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.090 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Fine. Change of subject.

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Okay, now what?

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Running with a towel
around your neck

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
is a good way to get heatstroke,
so maybe don't.

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:22.018 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna understand
her one of these days.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Man...

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
[YASUOKA]
Still on the fence? Look, son.

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
C'mon, at least settle on
whether it's gonna be college

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
or entering the workforce.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Don't worry.
--Huh?

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
Look. I'm giving
it serious thought.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
I'll have an answer
for you soon!

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
All right. Is it me,
or do you have

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
a more determined look
on your face these days?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
You've been reading the book!

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That's freakin'
hilarious.

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
I'm just trying to
weigh my options.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
Gotta make an informed
decision, ya know?

00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
Damn, dude. Okay.
You really have changed. Crazy.

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
Well, I do try to run
every morning now.

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
It's trimmed me
down quite a bit.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI] No. How you carry
yourself. It's different.

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
What is that supposed to mean?

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
[MISHINA]
Hey, buddy!

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
[TANISHIRO] Is it true
you've been workin' out?

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
Goin' on runs? Bein' all
physically active?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
Um. Basically. Yeah.

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
[TANISHIRO]
That's great and all, but--

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
I gotta tell ya, it makes me
and Mishina sorta nervous.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
Feels like maybe you don't
wanna rely on us anymore.

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
What? No way.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:35.467 position:50% align:center
[TANISHIRO]
So why the fitness craze?

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
No particular reason.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
[TESLA laughing]
The heavens favor Tesla!

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:51.524 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center
Now, then. There's an important
lesson to be learned here.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
About shortsightedness.

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
[yelling] That
self-important psycho!

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
The next time we meet,
I'll put him six feet under!

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
Right after I gouge out his eye!

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
Easy, Hiro!

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
You're not talking
about us, right?

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
I know we're a lot, but eye
gouging seems like overkill.

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
[HIRO growls]

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
[BOTH whimper]

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
Huh? No! Hold on!

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
I was talking
about a video game!

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
Um. Later, dude.

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Don't work too hard.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
[MISHINA]
Whoa, somebody snapped.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Great. Just what I need.
They think I've lost it.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
I don't know, if you ask me,

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
that's exactly what you need
those clowns to think.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
Huh? [laughs]

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI, HIRO laughing]

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
She's officially late now and
I'm not the least bit shocked.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
My own fault for
getting here on time.

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
[HIRO yawns]

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
Martin?

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center
Hey, that you, trash?

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What's your problem, man?

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
Why you always
gotta give me grief?

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Your avatar's
around my age, right?

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:37.589 position:50% align:center
Where do you get off
calling me trash?

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:40.467 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] If you've got a
better word, I'm all ears.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
Tesla skewered you.
Your console blew up.

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
In my book,
that makes you trash.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
Fair enough, I suppose.
Can't argue with that,

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.353 position:50% align:center
but you'll be
interested to know,

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:53.146 position:50% align:center
I'm restarting
using your method.

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Sounds to me like someone

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
doesn't know when to quit.

00:21:57.108 --> 00:21:59.110 position:50% align:center
I wanted to ask you
about that, though,

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:00.362 position:50% align:center
cause the more I think about it,

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.322 position:50% align:center
the weirder it seems
that you of all people

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
would know how to restart.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.704 position:50% align:center
See, I suspect you fried
your own console, too.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:17.754 position:50% align:center
No idea what you're
talking about. [laughs]

00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:25.011 position:50% align:center
Yeah, anyway.

00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:28.932 position:50% align:center
You should come with,
I'll teach ya 'bout real life.

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:32.602 position:50% align:center
Sure. Just dial back
the arrogance, huh?

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.437 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:36.481 position:50% align:center
Were you taking a nap?

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:38.983 position:50% align:center
Wha--? No! I mean, yeah.

00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:41.027 position:50% align:center
You took your
sweet time getting here!

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:43.822 position:50% align:center
Did you just do something
to wake me up?

00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:45.657 position:50% align:center
Cause for a second I
coulda almost sworn

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.243 position:50% align:center
you were trying to
start a pillow fight.

00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:50.245 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Such a sweepy widdle baby.

00:22:50.328 --> 00:22:51.746 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:56.418 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I had to. You were
just too cute not to boop.

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:58.628 position:50% align:center
Say what? The hell
does even that mean?

00:22:58.712 --> 00:23:00.714 position:50% align:center
What kind of "boop" exactly?

00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:02.173 position:50% align:center
It's a secret.

00:23:02.257 --> 00:23:04.259 position:50% align:center
I'm not kidding--
what did you do?

00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:07.345 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure I have
a right to know!

00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:10.348 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Answer me this, Hiro.

00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:12.934 position:50% align:center
You ready to dive back in?

00:23:13.018 --> 00:23:16.438 position:50% align:center
Um. Of course? I should be.

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:23.403 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm stronger than I was before.

00:23:23.486 --> 00:23:27.157 position:50% align:center
I ran fight simulations
for a month.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.452 position:50% align:center
"Prepared" is my middle name.

00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:32.495 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:35.707 position:50% align:center
Let's do this!

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.542 position:50% align:center
Back into the Full Dive RPG

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
that's even shittier
than real life!
