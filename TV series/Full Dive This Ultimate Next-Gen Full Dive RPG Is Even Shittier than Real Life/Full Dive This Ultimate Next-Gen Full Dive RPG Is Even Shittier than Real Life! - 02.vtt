[REONA]
We're talking full-dive VR.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.431 position:50% align:center
An RPG that's the absolute
ultimate in realism.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:15.765 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
She can jiggle all she wants:

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.850 position:50% align:center
I'm demanding a refund.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.393 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
You murdered my brother!

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Oh shit, oh shit, oh
shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Best Friend... killer?

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
Game over!

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.025 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh?

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.914 position:50% align:center
The hell do you mean
"game over?"

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.417 position:50% align:center
And how is "friend killer"
a legit name?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.253 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna lay this out
as politely as possible.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.672 position:50% align:center
For a teenager,
you are real messed up!

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.298 position:50% align:center
Wait, it's not what
you're thinking!

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.259 position:50% align:center
It was an accident!

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:15.719 position:50% align:center
I swear on it!

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.554 position:50% align:center
That's exactly the kind of
thing a murderer would say.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.848 position:50% align:center
Listen to me! All I did
was push the guy!

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.017 position:50% align:center
If anything, he stabbed himself!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.436 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap. You stabbed him?

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.645 position:50% align:center
That's not what I...

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.605 position:50% align:center
Look, just tell me how
to restart the game.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.898 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
I've got news for you, dude.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
That's not how things
work around here.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Real life doesn't come with

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.946 position:50% align:center
a "do-over" option,
last I checked.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center
And real life just happens
to be the basis for realism.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
What is with that look?

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Besides,
<i>Kiwame Quest</i> uses autosave.

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50% align:center
So, for all intents
and purposes,

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
his murder is now baked
into the experience.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.044 position:50% align:center
You're telling me I'm
permanently stuck being known as

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.796 position:50% align:center
someone who killed
his childhood friend?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
And don't think you can just
buy another copy of the game.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50% align:center
Your play history's programmed
into the console.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
So, to start over, you'd have
to pony up for another of those.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.725 position:50% align:center
We're talkin'
90-thousand-yen, minimum.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:06.019 position:50% align:center
I'd have to sell one
of my kidneys.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
We have it for 12-thousand!

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.776 position:50% align:center
Oh! Never mind!
I'll sell an eye!

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
Ugh, just give me my money back!

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
All sales are final.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
The hell?

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Caveat emptor. Sorry.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
No refunds under
any circumstances.

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:24.079 position:50% align:center
Store policy. [laughs]

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah? Well,
I'll complain online!

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
Why cast a shadow over
your otherwise bright future

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
with a lengthy and
expensive legal battle?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
Let's try to think about
this constructively.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
Constructively? What happened
to "game over" a second ago?

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
Um, attitude check.
<i>Kiwame Quest,</i> also known as <i>KQ,</i>

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
was released a decade ago
and exclusively in Japan.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
It performed poorly,
the company went tits up,

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
and the player base
shrunk from abysmal

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
to practically non-existent--
it's a dead game.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.148 position:50% align:center
That said, a small,
dedicated number

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
of players have remained loyal.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
So, in other words, people
are still playing this?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Um, yeah!

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
One of those aforementioned
fans is Ginji.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
Why's everything out of her
mouth feel like an up-sale?

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
[REONA] The two of you
have a lot in common.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
They say he killed
his best friend.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center
Seems like the right
person to ask for help.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.422 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure, I guess.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Then that's the plan.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
But first thing's first:
check your pocket.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Thirty gald.
That's your starter money.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
Let's get you some new clothes.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
[REONA] I have a good idea what
happens next in this storyline.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
Poor kid, it's so tragic.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
I heard he was
stabbed in the throat.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSFOLK C] Who in their right
mind would want to kill Martin?

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
Well, brace yourself:
they say it was Hiro.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
The City Guard is looking
for him as we speak.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
What? A wanted poster? Already?

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Yup. You're a fugitive.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
Have you thought about
plastic surgery?

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on! That's not
really a thing, is it?

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Anyway.
Clothing store's not far,

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
but you'll wanna
keep a low profile.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
Your life depends on you
thinking like a wanted man.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I don't wanna play
this game anymore.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
Almost there!

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center
You really think it's a
good idea to just go on in?

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
What have I told you about this
game's commitment to realism?

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
You're a customer:
if they report you,

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
it'll be long after
they've made the sale.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Are you sure?

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.280 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Of course!

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
If anyone knows the
merchant mindset, it's me!

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] That's not somethin'
to brag about.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
Good morrow.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Perfect. Look!

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hm? Fifteen gald?

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
I'll take this.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
Ah. Ought to shield you
from prying eyes, eh?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
He's gonna snitch!

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.685 position:50% align:center
[REONA laughs]

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
Oh. Don't worry, sir.
Your secret's safe with me.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
I'm a businessman, am I not?

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
Yes, you are!

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
Twenty-five gald.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
[REONA] He saw the advantage
and he took it.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
These NPCs are super smart.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
Cool, right?

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
Sure! 'Cause if there's anything
I'm an absolute stickler for

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
in my RPGs, it's price gouging!

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
All the more reason

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
to find Ginji so we
can pick his brain.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
Let's just get it over
with. Where is he?

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.424 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Hm... Probably
where he's hung out for

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
the past decade.
The old town casino.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Decade?! He have a
gambling problem?

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
Maybe. Or maybe
he's just trash at it.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Whoa! Attitude check!

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
Man. This place is
really sprawled out.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.028 position:50% align:center
And for all the restrictions,
surprisingly affluent.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
When you consider the
town being smack dab

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
in the middle of Alfrev,
it's a wonder

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
the place is so self-sufficient.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.579 position:50% align:center
That's why it's more commonly
known as "The Closed City."

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh...

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
Just so you know,
leaving is a crime.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.877 position:50% align:center
"Egress," they call it
on par with "Exuberance."

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
Someone ought'a nut-punch

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
whoever gave the
name-guy a thesaurus.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Point is, getting out of here

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
is the first step
to beating the game.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
You're gonna need all
the help you can get.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Casino's not too far, I think.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50% align:center
We should be clear.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
That's good. Ugh.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hiro!

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Alicia?

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
There you are.
I looked everywhere.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
I just knew I'd find you.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.503 position:50% align:center
How is that possible?

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.380 position:50% align:center
D'you have any idea
how much this hood cost?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly.
You can't hide from me.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
I could spot that awkward frame
in a crowd from ten leagues off.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:50.970 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
Wow, talk about detail!

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
The childhood friend that R-Evo
has cooked up for you

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
is exceptionally terrifying.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
She displays a
distinct personality,

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
relative freedom, insight...

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.692 position:50% align:center
Could you be
impressed later? Please?

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Now, now. Stop that.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
[HIRO, REONA whimper]

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
Only madmen talk to themselves.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Oh. Right.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
NPCs can't hear or see
Reona in fairy form.

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] A-Alicia! You've gotta
listen! It was an accident!

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah. I know.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
[HIRO whimpers]

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50% align:center
Goodness. How I
screamed and shouted.

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
You must've thought
me hysterical.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center
But note how serene I've become.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Totally.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:34.347 position:50% align:center
My love for you ran
so deep. Still does.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
Deeper than you can
imagine. Forgive me.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Am I-- Am I off the hook?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
Die with me!

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Apparently not!

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
It'll be beautiful.
You go first, then I'll follow.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.487 position:50% align:center
The three of us will be
reunited in heaven!

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
Can't you see it?

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
That's... officially
freaking crazy.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
Join us.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]
Wait. That's the knife.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
It'll be quick. Don't worry.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
After all...
I'm Alicia von Rotarzen.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
The Fruit Slicer from Hell!

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] That is the lamest
nickname I've ever heard!

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
I'll chop you in tiny pieces,

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50% align:center
and drain your blood
like apple cider!

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Careful! Her speed
is set abnormally high.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
Players typically have
her join their party.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.524 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on!

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
Exactly why would I want that?

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50% align:center
Well, old childhood friends
are usually the obvious choice.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
But of course, it's an
open-ended story system,

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
so you can pick
whoever you want.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
Not anymore!

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
Killing someone's brother tends
to narrow your options!

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.790 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] My love,
what are you muttering about?

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
Silly me, of course--
you're reciting prayers

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
of atonement in
preparation for death!

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
How sweet!

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
[HIRO screams]

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Go, go, go, go! Keep
running and don't look back!

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Oh, I won't!

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hiro! Don't you dare!

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
Hard turn coming up
on your right!

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Got it!
--[REONA] Now left!

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Got it!
--[REONA] Right!

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Got it!
--[REONA] Right!

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Got it!
--[REONA] Left!

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Got it!
--[REONA] Right!

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Got it!
--[REONA] Left!

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Got it!

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
[HIRO panting]

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
Damn. You're faster
than you look.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
Um, question.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
How does running in a
video game wear me out?

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
[REONA] All part of
the <i>KQ</i> experience.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center
Fatigue makes it more realistic.

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Thanks, I hate it.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
Did I level up?

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
Huh? "Killer on the Run,
AKA The Fleet-Footed Amicide."

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
Hey, look at you!
Scored yourself another title!

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
So, does it raise my speed
or something cool like that?

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
Not so much. Just something
you collect along the way.

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
Pretty cool, though. Keep it
up and you'll have a ton!

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Sorry. Think I'm
gonna log off for today.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
Really?! In the middle
of all this?!

00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
Some of us have to go to school.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
Come on! Who cares about that?

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
Forget about school and
just enjoy the present!

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] What the hell kind of
responsible adult are you?

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
Recluse is a perfectly
valid lifestyle.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm done
for tonight, okay?

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.674 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Fine, be a baby then.

00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
Just hit save to be sure.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.470 position:50% align:center
[HIRO exhales]

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
The screen's not popping up.
What's wrong?

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
[grunts] KQ doesn't let you
log out during combat!

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
Wait, so...

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
Doesn't look like you're quite
out of the woods after all.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
[rustling]

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
There you are!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
This really feels
like I've been cut!

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
Try not to let it put
you in your head!

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
The pain response is set
lower than in real life!

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
The hell it is!
Tell my hand that!

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Trust me, you could lose a limb

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center
in this game and it wouldn't
feel any worse than taking

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
an itsy-bitsy tumble
down the stairs.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
Nothing to worry about!

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
Not reassuring!

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
I have no clue what
you keep mumbling

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
to yourself, but it's
getting on my nerves!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
This is it. I'm a dead man.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA gasps]
Damn it, my eye!

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Yeah! That's right!
How d'you like that?

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
So wait, she hits things?

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
--[ALICIA] What is happening?
--Go! Run! Now!

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
Right! Good idea!

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] Curse you!
Coward! Run all you like!

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.587 position:50% align:center
I will hunt you down
and eviscerate you!

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Fate will deliver you
to me, it's inevitable!

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
Your flesh will
yield to the blade

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
of The Fruit Slicer from Hell!

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
Jeez!

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
Who is this game's target
audience supposed to be?

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I haven't run like that
since I was in-- Since forever.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunting]

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
You gotta be kidding me.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
[REONA] What do you
say we do a little <i>KQ</i> ?

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
What time does
your school get out?

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
I'm about to log on,
so come find me--

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
even if it kills you, 'kay?

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
Sounds kinda threatening.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI] So, what'cha
think of your new game?

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
Ugh. I got tricked into buying
some random full-dive RPG.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
The developers went all out.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
Even programmed it so you
feel pain. Not a good time.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
So then it's shit?

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI]
Sorry about yesterday.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
Video games are your thing.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have
laid into you like that.

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
You didn't lay into me that bad.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI]
So, we're good?

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
Even though I think they're
essentially digital baby bottle?

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
[HIRO chuckles]

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI] For real, though.
When you gonna man up

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
and get those punks
off your jock?

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
This is so baller.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
Just add it to your cart, bro!

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
You got the cash--
'least you're about to.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
You ain't lyin'.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
[MISHINA laughs]

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
Look, they're not
really a problem.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
Yeah. With love, dude:
when you're a gamer,

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
you might as well have
a target on your back.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well. C'est la vie.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
Wow. Digital baby bottle.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
Oh, and apparently,
I'm a walking target.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Kaede?

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
Huh? Shocking. Said no one.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Oh, I'm not playing
anything right now--

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:56.855 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Could you try
to keep it down this time?

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What?

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
From the way you were
screaming last night,

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
I thought you were dying.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Sorry about that,
it's just my new game.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
Nothing to worry about.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
I wasn't worried:
I was trying to sleep!

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
Get rid of all this crap. Soon.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Come on!

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
Why is it such a big deal
for me to have a hobby?

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] This is not a real
hobby. Track was a hobby.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] That's not
who I am anymore, okay?

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Fine! Whatever
floats your boat!

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
Just do me a favor next time and
before you "log on" or whatever,

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
stuff a gag in your mouth!

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
I'd suffocate!

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE groans]

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Seriously.
What is everyone's problem?

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
[REONA] I'm about to log on,
so come find me--

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
even if it kills you, 'kay?

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What's that mean?

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
Ow! I'm in the same
shape as when I left?

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
I thought the downtime
would've healed me!

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
There was money in my pocket.

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:02.212 position:50% align:center
Come on. Hook me up with
some herbs, or a potion.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
That's what I'm talkin' about!

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Ew. Smells like
roadkill'd skunk ass.

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:17.977 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Huh? In a normal game,
it'd be as easy as...

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
This is where you activate.
Seriously. Go on. Heal me.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.903 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Don't do this.
Just work. Like normal.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
It's stupid a game.
See look! I'm touching you!

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.117 position:50% align:center
Why won't you do
your thing, plant?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.619 position:50% align:center
No! Why's this gotta
be realistic, too?

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're just an herb, then?
Come on! Do I boil you?

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
Eat you raw?

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:43.503 position:50% align:center
I have no clue!
And I'm still bleeding!

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
Son of a slut!

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
[laughing] What do ya know.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
An NPC I've never laid eyes on.

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
Hold up. Excuse me?

00:16:56.349 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Did-- Did this game
just get meta on me, or...?

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Ginji?
--Huh?

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
Wait. How do you know my name?

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
Jackpot! I'm another
player! What's up?

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,
I've been looking for you.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
My situation's kind of screwy.

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
I can see that.
Playin' this at your age?

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
Life must be a
dumpster fire for you.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
I'm talking about
the game, ass clown!

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure you are.
What'cha got there?

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
[GINJI sighs] This takes me
back about ten years.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
[HIRO groans] 'Preciate you.
Does it work fast?

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
Nah. Takes 'bout
three or four days.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
Ah! What? No way! But...
That's not magical at all!

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:44.356 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help
all the same, though.

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
Dead game pals to
the end, right?

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
We gotta stay tight.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
So, you found me: now what?

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center line:10%
Wanna talk or somethin'?
Ah, come inside.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] This is a casino?

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
[GINJI]
Cheers, kid.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:08.463 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Oh, uh, thanks, but I'm
not old enough to drink yet.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Here. Just take a sip.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
It ain't booze.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
'Kay, guess it wouldn't hurt.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Tastes like
really good grape soda.

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
Which makes me wonder how
he's wasted on this stuff.

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
So, what can I do
for ya, m'friend?

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Right! Well, uh...

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
I heard you had an "issue"
with your best friend NPC

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
when you started playing

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
and it sounds a lot
like the mess I'm in.

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
Total accident, by the way.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
You, too? Aw, sick!

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
People have the wrong idea!

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
[GINJI]
Oh-ho! Sure they do.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
No, really--

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
Piss off. I'm tryin' to
have a conversation.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh?

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
Damn it. Look, if I've told
you once then I've told you

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
a thousand times: I don't know.
I've never known. Just move on.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh. Um, what?

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
Okay. This isn't psychotic.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Sorry. These annoying
little turds

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
always show up when
you least expect them.

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
Been hounding my ass
for ten years now.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:09.482 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Who has?

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Don't worry: you'll see
soon enough. Real soon.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
[GINJI laughs]
Where were we?

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
Ah, that's right.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
You were asking me about
how I killed my buddy Enrique.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
Sort of. You said
his name was Enrique?

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
Well, that's strange, in my
game, his name was Martin.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] The naming scheme
is different for everyone.

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
Guess that tracks.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
So, how'd it play out for you?

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
The killing part.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] Eh. Call it
a youthful indiscretion.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
Like gunning down
random townsfolk

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
in a first-person shooter
for the hell of it.

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
We've all been there.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
People actually do that?

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:44.851 position:50% align:center
[GINJI]
What can I say?

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
The old pal shtick got under
my skin after a while.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
So, I strangled him.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Was it really that easy?

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
[GINJI]
I did judo.

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:56.446 position:50% align:center
So sleeper holds were a
cinch 'n the other friend

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
wouldn't quit shrieking, so I
choked her for peace and quiet.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
Even in a game that's
major red flag behavior.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
You mean you came into
this with your judo intact?

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
Doesn't sound like a
very level playing field.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
Part of <i>KQ</i> 's charm
is it reflects

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
your real-life
physical attributes.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center
What? Are you kidding me?
That's bullcrap!

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
I am not hitting the
gym for this game!

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
'Case you hadn't noticed,

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
guiding principle
here's realism.

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
'Less you have some level
of martial arts training

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
or at the very least a
problem-solving mindset,

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
the odds of you getting out of

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
the starter town
are next to nil.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
So, in other words nobody
can beat this thing.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
[GINJI]
Not true.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Crazy hard as the game
is for most mortals,

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
there is actually
one guy who beat it.

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
Ha. Yep. Saw him, too.

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
My recall isn't worth a damn
and even I remember him.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
Sharp as a blade.
Smart as a whip.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
To look at the guy you'd think
he was just some kid, but...

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
He had this aura about him.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:57.007 position:50% align:center
Word is he cleared the
starter town in record time

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
and went on to beat
the game like a pro.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
Kamui, his name was.

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
A.k.a. "The Eternally
Invincible:

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
The Never-Bested Adventurer."

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
What a cool title!

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center
Dude, that's way better
than "Best Friend Killer!"

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
Check out mine.
"Heartless Inhuman Monster."

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
Look at me--45-years-old
and that's what I'm called.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:23.950 position:50% align:center
Worst thing I ever did in real
life was not show up for work.

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
But in here you're a murderer.

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Anyway what am
I supposed to do now?

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
You asking me for help?

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.210 position:50% align:center
Wait. This isn't
your way of saying

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
you'll join my party, is it?

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
Hell no, kid.
I'm too old for that.

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
Only thing left for me is to
sit here night after night

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:41.760 position:50% align:center
and drink away my troubles.

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Then why even log in?

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
[sighs] 'Sides,
I'm ten pounds of crap

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
in a five-pound bag
with a bad case of gout.

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
So, what kind of help
did you mean?

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
Heh. The best kind I can offer.

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:58.026 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:04.324 position:50% align:center
Hey! Look! We got ourselves
a criminal in here!

00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:07.994 position:50% align:center
Tell City Guard it's
the Best Friend Killer!

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:11.456 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
You... You rat bastard!

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.501 position:50% align:center
I see why they call
this chode "Heartless!"

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:49.596 position:50% align:center

Episode 3: "Adult Event Time."
