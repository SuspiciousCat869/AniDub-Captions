00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.473 position:50% align:center
[REONA] I think it's time
I come clean with you.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:18.101 position:50% align:center
You need to know the truth.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
Quick confession.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
If someone besides Kamui
beat the game,

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.067 position:50% align:center
I'd lose all sense of restraint.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
I'm such a simp for winners
I'd probably marry them.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
Please tell me
you remember that.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure. As long as you
tell me it was only a joke.

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.496 position:50% align:center
Well, um. Okay, here's the deal.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
Ten years ago,
I actually ran into Kamui.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
'Course it was in-game.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
But the encounter made
no less of an impact.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.425 position:50% align:center
He was strutting through
town like a lion,

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.635 position:50% align:center
clad in gorgeous black armor.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
I was in high school in
those days, so naturally ,

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.434 position:50% align:center
to say I was smitten would be
like saying water is wet.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:03.104 position:50% align:center
He swaggered toward the city
gates, ready to leave.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.357 position:50% align:center
I couldn't bear to see him go.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.820 position:50% align:center
So I did what anyone would do,
I asked him out.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I'm not into chicks
with the mammary glands

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
of a Holstein heifer.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.246 position:50% align:center
Uh?!

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.124 position:50% align:center
Sometimes too much of a
good thing is well and fine.

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:26.336 position:50% align:center
But in your case, honey,
I'd have to hire a Sherpa.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.838 position:50% align:center
Bye-bye.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
Ugh! I had to look up "Sherpa."

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.720 position:50% align:center
But can you imagine?
First, he says I'm a cow,

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:37.931 position:50% align:center
then compares me to a
treacherous mountain range?

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:40.475 position:50% align:center
And because I have a
soupcon of self-respect,

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.852 position:50% align:center
when the bastard cleared
the unbeatable KQ,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.437 position:50% align:center
I vowed revenge!

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.147 position:50% align:center
Hell hath no fury like me!

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:49.776 position:50% align:center
I made it my mission
to see Kamui dethroned!

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.280 position:50% align:center
Whoever beat him, I'd marry!
Or something.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.326 position:50% align:center
Wait, Is that the whole story?

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.787 position:50% align:center
Indeed! Clear the game, Hiro!

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.163 position:50% align:center
Then propose to me!

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.666 position:50% align:center
The wedding will be
nothing short of spectacular!

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.085 position:50% align:center
We'll send Kamui
an engraved invitation.

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
and then when we kiss,
we'll give him the finger!

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.173 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Well, that was a thing.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
Aren't secrets supposed
to be more profound?

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
Seriously, that had to be the
most anti-climactic reveal ever.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
So much for inspired.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
Now I'm the opposite
of motivated.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
[HIRO exhales]

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Still awake, I see.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Tesla...

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] My apologies
about Amos and Granada.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
No worries.
Honestly not a big deal.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
I'm, uh kinda surprised
to see you up this late.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
I daren't let my
vigilance waver.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
Sneak attack?
Perish the thought.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
The goblins'll make
their move in the morning.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
Er, just a hunch.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] If I try to explain
the walkthrough,

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
he'll have an
existential crisis.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
What a curious fellow
you are, Hiro.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
So, tell me, friend.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
Is my impression that you wish
to leave Ted accurate?

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
No, sir! I mean,
I-If I did, I...

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50% align:center
Calm yourself.
It's perfectly understandable.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50% align:center
If I weren't tethered
to the City Guard,

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
I'd jump at the chance to test
my mettle on the outside.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
Tesla, you and me could always
leave this place together.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
Interesting.
If by the grace of fate

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
we survive what's coming,
a foray with you

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
beyond the city walls
does have its charm.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
I don't see why not.
I'll give it serious thought.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.997 position:50% align:center
We need all the
motivation we can get.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.627 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Um. Not crazy about him talking

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
like someone who's
gonna die, but cool.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
Screw that.
Not on my watch.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
Right, time to consult

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
Mr. Warmth and Snuggles
about what to do.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.310 position:50% align:center
[HIRO sighs]

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Uhh...

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
[HIRO screams]

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.693 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunting]
Kaede? What're doing?

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
Wait, I get it.
You've gone psycho!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
Probably waiting for
the right moment

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
to slap a pillow over my
face and suffocate me!

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
Is that what we've come to?

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
Don't be so dramatic!

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
I've been knocking at your door
for the past ten minutes.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
You didn't answer,
so I started to get anxious.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right. Okay, then.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
Why were you knocking
in the first place?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
Uh. You were acting all weird.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
I need to see this game through
to the very end, please.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
I just thought-- I thought you
might try to do something

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.894 position:50% align:center
really stupid while you
were playing your game.

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
It's not a crime to make
sure that you're okay.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you trying to say
you were worried about me?

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
Uh. No! More like
worried about you

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.404 position:50% align:center
tearing this family apart
by being an idiot!

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure. Whatever you say.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE growls]

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't touch my stuff!

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
You know what, jerk?
I take it back!

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
The sooner you give yourself
a full-dive dirt nap,

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
the sooner our family
can move on!

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
The hell is a full-dive
dirt nap? I--! [growls]

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
Ugh-- Coming in here and
giving me a buncha crap.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.219 position:50% align:center
[HIRO sighs]

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
[keyboard clacking]

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Kamui said he'd
tell me the "trick" to KQ,

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
whatever that means.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] You dead-ass made
it through merc training?

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
Don't lie to me.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
I'll turn your nut sack into
a pincushion if you're lying.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
Coulda done without
that image, thank you.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Prove it.
Enter your current title.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Heh. You earned
"Diabolic Spiteful

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
Best Friend Killer"?
Consider me whelmed.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Uh, wait.
That was a legit strategy?

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.505 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
'Course you had other options,

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
but who's countin', really?

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
Better to backstab than
to bend over, am I right?

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Okey-doke.
Let's get to "The Trick."

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Lay it on me!

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What the--?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] You're still looking?
Listen, cupcake.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
I've told you everything
I'm gonna tell ya.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
You plan on toddling through
life riding my coattails

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
through every little calamity?
I am not your keeper!

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
Starting to think you
made this walkthrough

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
just to trash me for using it.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Drink bleach, shitwad!

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Did the site just close
itself out of spite?

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Fine. I'll figure
it out the hard way.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Huzzah! We've made it!
Okay. Is your sword polished?

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:44.149 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
Great. Have you eaten?

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Yes, but not too much.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.986 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Did you remember to pee?

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] I did.
--[REONA] Number two?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh-huh.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Excellent!
You're fully prepared!

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
Yeah, to binge watch anime,
not do battle.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll just have
to give it my best shot.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.999 position:50% align:center
I have an announcement,
comrades.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
Given the highly dangerous
nature of our enemy,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
we've added to the ranks
two new soldiers.

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Should help fill
the hole left by Granada.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
It may not be much,
but I'm glad for the support--

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
Welcome Inquisitor Mizarisa.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
And Alicia,
the Fruit Slicer from Hell.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
True assets, both.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Never mind! Not glad!

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.941 position:50% align:center
Why's the game gotta
pile it on like this?

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
Goblins are bad enough!

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Hiro!
How've you been?

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
Have you wet your
lovely self today?

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
I'm not a baby! So, I
don't make it habit!

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to serve with you.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA chuckles]

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
The fact they've shown up
in your hour of need

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
is a very good omen.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.883 position:50% align:center
See, in gaming parlance
we would call this a harem.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
Essentially means you're a stud.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
How is this a good omen?
The way things are going,

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
I'll have my limbs hacked off
or sliced into fruit cocktail

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
before the goblins
bother to show!

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
Now, in the interest
of public safety,

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
I've issued an evacuation order.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, many have
chosen to ignore it.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
To make matters worse,

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
sentries report an
increase in crime.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
Your job is to stem
the tide of anarchy.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
--[GUARDS] Sir!
--[HIRO] Hold on.

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
Is the goblin attack not
happening today or something?

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
Uh. Guess there's another event
we have to clear beforehand?

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.166 position:50% align:center
Meh, probably just

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
a straightforward side
quest, nothing major.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
I certainly hope so.

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] Hiro. I'd like you to
patrol the eastern district.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
Sure. Okay.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
Heads up:
that's Ginji's hangout.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
Eh.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50% align:center
Oh, is there some
sort of problem?

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
Problem? Ha!
No, not at all, sir!

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
Fret not. These women
are excellent fighters.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
They'll accompany you.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
Ah! Okay--now I might
have a problem!

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
Us three are gonna be
a phenomenal team.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
I'm rather fond of this dynamic.

00:10:56.781 --> 00:11:00.160 position:50% align:center
You and Mizarisa seem so close.
There's chemistry.

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
'Kay, first of all:
nuh-uh, and second...

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center
You might recall Alicia kinda
sorta maybe probably

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
wants me very, very dead!

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
That's not a very
helpful attitude.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50% align:center
Come, this is a
chance to reconcile.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
I'll have no friction
among my soldiers.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
She'll kill me!

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
I have faith in you.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Please don't do this.

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
So, like are you sure?

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.148 position:50% align:center
With everyone else around,

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
I didn't want to make
a whole scene.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
But me and her?
We've got major bad blood.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
She'd have murdered you
if I hadn't shown up.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
Worse than that even:
she's creepy AF.

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
Says the torturer
obsessed with amputation.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:47.540 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA] I'm just sayin'
if we're smart,

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
we'd steer clear of her.

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center
And if I'm lucky,
you'd steer clear of me.

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
You're cruel!

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
Now, now, Alicia may
have it out for you,

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
but Mizarisa wants
to be friends.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
Her idea of "friend"
is someone who sniffs

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
your piss-soaked sheets
and saws your legs off.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Anyway, how come
things are falling apart

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
around here all of a sudden,
with the goblin siege

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center
just around the corner?

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:09.521 position:50% align:center
Because impending doom
has a strong tendency

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
to unravel the fabric of
social order, you nitwit!

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
I don't see why: chaos evidently
brings out the best in you.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:19.197 position:50% align:center
'Course it might be the other
way around. Perhaps

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
the chaos part-and-parcel
to the human heart

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
makes the specter of
impending doom inevitable.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the philosophical
breakdown, Socrates.

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A screams]
Thief!

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
Help me!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center
Outta the way!

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
[HIRO groans]

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A groans]

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding me!
Girl's got serious move--

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A screaming]

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.441 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
Ah! Perfect! We can snag
good-deed bonus points

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
for returning the handbag!

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Um. Did you have
to call it that?

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
Come on, just do it: might
be worth a premium upgrade!

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
This game's obsessed with limbs!

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't get squeamish.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
Returning it's the
decent thing to do.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
Especially when
a reward's involved.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Ugh. Fine.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A grunts]

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Hey, hi there.
Um, this yours?

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.845 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A screams]

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
Well, that's another
achievement unlocked!

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
Huh. Not even a half-hearted
"Thank you."

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A grunting, gasps]

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
Cretin. Go on. Talk!

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
Why stoop to daylight robbery?

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
What's the point of
playin' by the rules?

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
Goblins'll kill us either way!

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
Ah. So, in other words,

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
you see current events
as an opportunity.

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center
What a spineless worm.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.121 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] How hastily
some people abandon hope.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
Evil endures through everything.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
Whereas the good can
be snuffed out in an instant.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Hiro?

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] That's definitely
a reference to Martin!

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
Please don't kill me! I--
I was only doing as I was told!

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
What?

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
[THIEF A] Strike while
the iron's hot, he says:

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
the City Guard is spread thin.
People are sittin' ducks.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] Huh?
--[MAN A] Thief!

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Help!

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
Stop!

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Now this is chaos.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
And there's an evil
criminal mastermind behind it.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
I'm betting that
he's the event boss.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.990 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Wait. If I beat him,

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
maybe I'll bag a decent
weapon for once.

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
Out with it! Now!
Where do we find this guy?

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
Th-The casino just up the road.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
There're so many of them...

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Rough lookin' bunch.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Let's see...

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
Getting solid crime boss
vibes from that one.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
I have a feeling he's our man.

00:15:00.692 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
I got it, don't worry.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
The only shot you have
at taking him

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
is if he's allergic
to pee-pee boys.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
Uncalled for!

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:10.201 position:50% align:center
I'll keep Cueball occupied
while you free the hostages.

00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a decent plan.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
You'd better pull your
own weight, fruit girl.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hmph.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center

[THUGS]
Hm?

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA] I'm Inquisitor--
Actually, scratch that,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
right now I'm Mizarisa
of the City Guard!

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
Surrender now and
you'll come to no harm!

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
The City Guard?
Really? Oh, no.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
[THUG D]
That's hilarious.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
Show us your stuff, freak.

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
Oh, if you wanna go, I'm more
than happy to oblige you!

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.690 position:50% align:center
[THUGS grunt]

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
Right. This is it.

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be okay.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.617 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Ginji?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
And here I was sure
I'd never see you again.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
If they bothered with you,
these guys mean business.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
You think?

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
Bastards wanna auction
me off like livestock

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
to the highest bidder.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Really?

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:05.215 position:50% align:center
I assume their clients
buy in bulk, then.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA laughing]

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
Well, that was a letdown.

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
Come on, Ginji! Fighting
was never part of the deal!

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center

Stack back!

Either of you move--
I'll snap his neck like a twig!

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
Don't you dare!

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
What the hell is going on?
You're the criminal mastermind?

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] No need to say it like
it's a bad thing, sweetheart.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
This area of town's been going
to hell in a hand basket

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
since the goblins
first showed up.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
I just taught the locals
to be enterprising.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
But you're making
the situation worse!

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
[GINJI]
It is what it is.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
I gotta look out for Number One.

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
Pandemonium means profit.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
So, blend in, manipulate
and make a couple a bucks,

00:16:58.059 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
is that it?

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] More or less the idea,
yeah. All right, ladies!

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
Drop your weapons and skedaddle.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
Resist and he's
going six feet under!

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
Wow. Real talk,

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
Ginji makes a way better villain
than I'd have thought!

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
You're a piece of work.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.077 position:50% align:center
I mean, I wouldn't go far
as to say we're friends,

00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
but I thought we were cool.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sorry. People don't
just magically become

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
besties after whippin'
the snot out of each other

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
in a bar fight. Nah.

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:26.171 position:50% align:center
Hate to burst your
bubble there, kiddo,

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
but we're just strangers
who met in a game.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well at least I'm decent
enough to make an effort!

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
You wanna write me off,
that's your business,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
but I'm not about
to be held hostage

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
by some tub a' lard
with arthritis!

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
I'm through taking
peoples' bullshit!

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
If you walk outta here alive
it'll be a miracle!

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
Show us how it's done, Hiro!

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
Knock his jock
into next Thursday!

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
I can handle it from here.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
No! Hold on.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
Hiro.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
Fall back and stay out of it.
This bastard belongs to me.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
Well, whaddya know?
You finally grew a matching set.

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
This is the stuff of legend!

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
An epic battle
between fated rivals!

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
Things aren't gonna go for you

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
the way they did last time,
piss boy.

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
For starters, I'm better armed.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Please don't be a magic item.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
Daddy's got double
brass knuckles!

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
[GINJI]
You ain't got a prayer.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That's your big secret weapon?

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
More of the same thing?

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
Doesn't stop it from being
doubly effective, short stack.

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
Gimme your best shot!

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
Time to die!

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
Ready when you are! [yells]

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
May the best malcontent win!
Woo-hoo!

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Enough!

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.249 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
[GINJI groaning]

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
Can we please put
an end to this farce?

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Whoa. An NPC just called
the game they're in a farce.

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
I'm-- I'm real sorry.
Thank you for not cutting me.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Huh. That did not go
the way I expected.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
Line 'em up!

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Looks like the event's over.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Yeah.

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
That childhood friend of yours.

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
Talk about a force
to reckon with.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
My gout gave her the
advantage, but still.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
Feels kind of weird
you'd be caught off guard

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
like that since you murdered

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
your own childhood friend
back in the day.

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
Practically a lifetime ago.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
'Sides, I had the
presence of mind

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:27.459 position:50% align:center
to strangle her before
she could transform

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
into The Fruit Slicer
from Hell and come after me.

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
--[PRISONER A moans]
--Huh?

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
[GINJI] That sound always
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
I'd make the same noise
in their situation.

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
Wasting my years locked
away in a dark cell.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
You don't seem bothered.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess not.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
Seriously, why is that?

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
Three square meals
a day, a bed,

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
plus being somewhere the goblins
can't easily reach.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
When you consider
the alternative,

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
prison doesn't really
seem all that terrible.

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
I call that the power
of positive thought!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I call it delusional.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
This also happens
to be a good strategy

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
for some real-life situations.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
What? Committing crimes
with the express

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
purpose of getting
thrown in prison?

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] This dude is
the scum of the earth.

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
Sage advice from
a wise, old man!

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.757 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
He's not Merlin!

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
All right, no dawdling--move!

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
[HIRO exhales]
Hey, man.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
At some point you really
need to reexamine your life.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
What? You gonna lecture me now?

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
You can't teach an old dog
new tricks, kid. Sorry.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Hiro.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
Excellent work capturing
that gang of marauders.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
Oh, I can't take the
credit for this one.

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
Mizarisa and Alicia
did all the work.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
[bell ringing]

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
[MAN C]
The goblins are coming!

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
The storm has broken.

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:56.006 position:50% align:center
Here it is, the moment of truth!

00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
Right. Okay.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
[stomach grumbles]

00:20:58.591 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center

They're at the north gate!

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
--[HIRO] What the...?
--[TESLA] Very well! To arms!

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS]
Yes, sir!

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Not now!

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
What did I tell you about
using the bathroom earlier?

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.229 position:50% align:center
But--I went! I just... Oh man.

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
Unless I'm mistaken, you've
got nervous bowel syndrome.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
See, it's most typical
in teenagers

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
right before a test they
haven't properly studied for.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[REONA] Sound familiar?

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
Sure, in real life.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
But this is just some
random RPG, though!

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
A random RPG that
just so happens to be

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.083 position:50% align:center
the last word in realism, yeah!

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
If you're prone to
it on the outside,

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
you're prone to it here!

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.257 position:50% align:center
Go drop a deuce so you can
get on with this battle!

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunting, groaning]

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:49.225 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Come on, come on!
I don't have time for this!

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:50.435 position:50% align:center
While I'm pinching one off,

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
people are out there
laying down their lives!

00:21:56.858 --> 00:22:01.071 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Ah! That's more like it.
Now to find Tesla!

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
Ah! Why're you watching me
drop the kids off at the pool?
