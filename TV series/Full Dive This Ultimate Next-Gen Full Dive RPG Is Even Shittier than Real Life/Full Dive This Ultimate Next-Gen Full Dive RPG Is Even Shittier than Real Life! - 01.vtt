[NARRATOR]
In the early 21st century,

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.900 position:50% align:center
VRMMO experiences took the
gaming industry by storm,

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
flooding the marketplace
with virtual worlds.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.906 position:50% align:center
From intergalactic vistas
to subterranean hellscapes,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
developers ran wild.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
Soon, there emerged one
revolutionary piece of software.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
Powered by R-Evo, a lightning
fast, general purpose AI,

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
NPCs became indistinguishable
from real people.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.130 position:50% align:center
Individual branches
in the story tree

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.091 position:50% align:center
numbered upwards of ten
to the power of 52.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
All five senses were reproduced
in the player's nervous system.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
Critics hailed the game as
the last word in realism,

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.560 position:50% align:center
its release a tour-de-force.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50% align:center
The gaming community, however,
was not so enthusiastic.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.985 position:50% align:center
Games, they felt, should offer
an escape from everyday life.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.490 position:50% align:center
Real world problems have
no place in recreation.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.451 position:50% align:center
Exhausted and perplexed,
humankind concluded

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
unanimously that, for all
the high-tech dazzle,

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
VRMMO games just aren't fun.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.501 position:50% align:center
From that point forward,
creators decamped

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
from virtual reality, bringing
the phenomenon's

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.422 position:50% align:center
golden age to an untimely close.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.383 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Ha! Nice try, scrub!

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.552 position:50% align:center
Guess whose power gauge
just refilled!

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
[HIRO yelling]

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.435 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Ten years after
the abortive VR revolution,

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:47.440 position:50% align:center
ten years after this game's
release, our story begins.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.084 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Sorry, I'm still on the fence.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.044 position:50% align:center
[YASUOKA] Your last year's
right around the corner.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.629 position:50% align:center
At least decide between college

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.464 position:50% align:center
and going straight
into the workforce.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
Tell you what: let's shelve
all that for now

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.385 position:50% align:center
and have ourselves
an actual talk.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.345 position:50% align:center
Maybe open up
about the track meet?

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.015 position:50% align:center
Uh, well, I'd really rather not.

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
If you want to move forward,
you've got to address

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.810 position:50% align:center
what happened
your freshman year.

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.103 position:50% align:center
There's bound to be a connection

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:28.606 position:50% align:center
with why you're spinnin'
your wheels.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.567 position:50% align:center
Don't be ashamed, Hiroshi!

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center
Pain is just an opportunity for
us to discover our strength!

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]
I can't with this guy...

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:38.366 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
He's giving me life advice
from a book title? Seriously?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.622 position:50% align:center
Things have been rough.
I know how you feel.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.000 position:50% align:center
In your shoes, I probably
couldn't even leave the house.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.544 position:50% align:center
But you? You come
to school every day!

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:50.754 position:50% align:center
That's real strength, kid.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.380 position:50% align:center
You've got what it takes.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Okay...

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.550 position:50% align:center
You may not think it
by lookin' at me,

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
but I've been through
my share of crap.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.096 position:50% align:center
And in all my years of
teaching I've never seen--

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Mr. Yasuoka, please--

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
[YASUOKA] I want you to accept
what happened!

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
If you can't come to grips
with it, I'll accept it for you!

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
Accept it and move on!
It's the only way!

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
You're better than this!
Do you hear me?

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
I believe in you. Okay?
And always remember:

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
Strength is just an opportunity
to find our pain!

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] He said that
completely backwards.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What a prick...

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI]
Hiro!

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
Takafumi.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
How'd it go? Do you feel better?

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.100 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I don't know about "better,"

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.561 position:50% align:center
but I'm definitely feeling
down for a gaming session.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI] Nothing wrong with
that as long as you're,

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
you know,
physically active, too.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI] I'll go to the
gym with you, if you want.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm good, thanks.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
Not much of a point
to it anymore.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.659 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI] Look, man.
Games aren't gonna fix--

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
Tournament's coming
up for you, right?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
School 'em, 'kay?

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Can you believe
it's been two years?

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.127 position:50% align:center
Uh... My bad.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
No worries.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
[TAKAFUMI]
See you tomorrow?

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
'Course.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
The real world... sucks ass.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
[TANISHIRO]
Hey-hey, it's Hiroshi!

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Tanishiro, Mishina, hi.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
[MISHINA] Crazy coincidence
running into you

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
like this, my dude!

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Glad I could help.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
[TANISHIRO]
Heh. Me, too.

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
[MISHINA] Hey, you know
we're always good for it!

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
[TANISHIRO]
Yeah, what he said!

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
And I'll definitely pay you back
this time, probably.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
Anyone givin' my man
a hard time at school,

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
just say the word.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
We'll knock 'em
flat on their ass.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] If you'd just punch
your own lights out,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
that'd be great.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
Thanks, 'preciate you.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
[MISHINA]
Later, bitch! I mean... bestie!

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
[TANISHIRO]
M-bye!

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
See what I mean?

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] To be fair,
things could be worse.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Yeah, I pre-ordered
the new <i>FQ</i> ?

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
One second.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] At long last, it's out.
<i>Finalizing Quest</i> !

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be beyond epic!

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.784 position:50% align:center
That'll be 13,000 yen.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Right.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
How am I a thousand short?

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
I made sure I had enough!

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I gave them the wrong bill!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
Um, I seem to be
just a tiny bit short.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50% align:center
[CLERK A]
Oof. That's unfortunate.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.808 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
So then...

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
[CLERK A]
I'd say... you're screwed.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That tracks.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] They had the
lowest price online.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.945 position:50% align:center
No way I'll find it
cheaper somewhere else.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:05.699 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Yeah. Not a chance.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]
You're kidding me!

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:30.265 position:50% align:center
Oh. It's the one
from three years ago.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I mean, come on:
look at this place.

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.733 position:50% align:center
I knew it was a long shot.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, excuse me.

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
I have kind of an
inventory question?

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.534 position:50% align:center
Sure. How can I help?

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Mm?

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
Um. Sorry, thank you.
I've never been here.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
I was wondering
if you had <i>FQ 22</i> ?

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
Did you say <i>FQ 22</i> ?

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
Yeah. The latest installment
of <i>Finalizing Quest.</i>

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
Just came out.

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
[REONA laughing]

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
Is there a reason
you're laughing?

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.894 position:50% align:center
[REONA] That franchise
is dead. Seriously.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
How many are they
gonna churn out?

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.607 position:50% align:center
C'mon, we're living in
the twenty-first century.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
The game's already at 22?

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
That's more <i>FQ</i> 's
than years in AD!

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
Think it's time to change
the title or what?

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] So, I'm guessing you
don't have any in stock.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
What are you, a leming?

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
You're only buying
the game out of habit.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
It's like getting
into a new manga.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
You start buying 'em
'cause they're good,

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
but then the devs run out
of ideas and you keep

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
coughing up your cash
to satisfy the voice

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
in your head saying, "Hey,
I've already got 20 on my shelf,

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
why stop now?"
Ugh! It's stupid!

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
Yeah, makes sense.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] When I played the first
<i>FQ</i> back in elementary school,

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
it blew my mind. I've been
hooked ever since--

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
just with steadily
diminishing returns,

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.101 position:50% align:center
so I guess she has a point.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
I thought you worked here!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
Why would you try to convince
a customer they have

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.772 position:50% align:center
shitty taste in games? Jeez!

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Truth hurts.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.692 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Just answer
the question, please?

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
You have it in stock or not?

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
Stop pretending like that
would make a difference.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
It does if I'm buying!

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
You know what? Never mind.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Hey, chill.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
I got what you need.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
How much is it?

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
Ten thousand.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Yen?

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Before tax?

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
After... What do you say?

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Um. I say take my money!

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
Gladly!

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
Just give me a second.
Should be right around here.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
Jackpot.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Here you go.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Pleasure doing
business with ya.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Finally! Wait.
What the hell is this?

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh?

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
Wait, give me my
money back! Now!

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
Try the game, nerd.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
It's way better than <i>FQ.</i>
I guarantee.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
We're talking full-dive VR.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
An RPG that's the absolute
ultimate in realism.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's great.
Who gives a damn?

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
You tricked me. Come on!

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
Trust me, you'll love it.
It's very immersive.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
Did I mention it's for
mature audiences only?

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
You mean mature like adults?

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Says right on the label.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] It's rated Double Z?
I've only seen One Z.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
Does that say 20 and up?

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Relax. It's not restricted

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
against guys your age.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
That's just a guideline
for retailers. You're good.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
But I wanted <i>FQ</i> ...

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Look, no offense, but
that kind of stuff is for kids.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
Don't you want something
more advanced?

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
Heh. Go on. Take it.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hey. Wait, I... huh?

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
[REONA] I'm Reona Kisaragi.
Reona to my friends.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
Who're you?

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
H-Hiroshi Yuki.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.925 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well. Just FYI:

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
I spend a lot of time
logged into this one.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
I can teach you
whatever you need to know.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center
I'm very patient with noobs.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.185 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
Did a hot girl really put
her number in my phone?

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Wake up, man!

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
You just let her con you into
buying this stupid game!

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.282 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
It came out ten years ago?

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.206 position:50% align:center
[REONA] S'up?
Can't talk right now. Sorry.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
You know what to do. Talk soon!

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
Son of a--!

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
This cost 10,000 yen.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm home. Ugh, what a day.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
K-Kaede!

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE growls]

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
Oh, gah--uh, sorry!
It was an accident!

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:47.647 position:50% align:center
I swear! I wasn't trying to--!

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
Then close the door, asshole!

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That tracks.

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] The VR NX console is
compatible with pretty much

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
every virtual reality
game ever made.

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
Decade old fossil?
No sweat. Still...

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
If it sucks, she can
jiggle all she wants:

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
I'm demanding a refund.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
[GODDESS A] Hail and well met,
mighty hero!

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
The world of Auberdine
needs your help!

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Okay. Pretty standard
for an RPG so far.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
Nothing too crazy.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
[GODDESS A]
Leave the confines of the city

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
and carve a path
to Castle Flora.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
All right. This is cool.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
The avatar is based on a scan
of the player's real-life body.

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I can feel the wind!
This is something else!

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Good morning.

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Lovely weather, isn't it?

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] They went all out on
the intro. I'll give 'em that!

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
Even the handle feels realistic.
This has potential.

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hiro? You home?

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] They actually
incorporated my username?

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm here. Just a sec--

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That actually hurt.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.508 position:50% align:center
The game reproduces pain?

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
What focus group asked for this?

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hiro?

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]
Ow!

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
No big. I'm good.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
Sorry it took so long.
I got sidetracked.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
The level of detail is amazing.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
For an old game, they sure
didn't skimp on the graphics.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
And not an NPC label in sight.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50% align:center
They're all about
maintaining the illusion.

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
Stop staring, Hiro.
You're gonna make me blush.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Reona wasn't overselling it.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
This game really is
the ultimate in realism.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Cool. Menus mean I'm
definitely still in a game.

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center
Haven't been isekai'd.

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
If you don't talk to me soon,

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
I'll worry I hit
your head too hard.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
Sorry. You are...?

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Alicia, remember?
We've been friends forever!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Right. Got it.
Important backstory.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] I hope you're
not trying to get out of

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
the apple harvest.
You promised to help.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh? Oh, no. I'm in.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's taking you so long?
The apples'll get over-ripe.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Ah. Typical "wholesome"
male character.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] Forgive us, Brother.
Hiro accidentally hit his head.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.343 position:50% align:center
Let's hope the skull's
not cracked. Huh.

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center
Best let your ol' pal
Martin handle this.

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Mm. Amazing.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
It actually smells
like an apple!

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
What does this do?

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN chuckles] Keeps the
doctor away, of course.

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Not for concussions.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN] Excellent quality
this year, don't you agree?

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Delicious.
Wait. I can taste it?

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
My goodness,
you must be starving--

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
you didn't even
bother to cut it.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
There.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I sincerely
can't tell the difference.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
This game is just
like real life.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I should
get on with the mission.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
[GODDESS A]
Leave the confines of the city

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
and carve a path
to Castle Flora.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
Hey. Question: how do I
get to Castle Flora?

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hm... Hm?

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
Are you crazy?
Don't joke about that!

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
There are some things
better left alone!

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
What the hell has
gotten into you, Hiro?

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
I wasn't trying to make a joke.

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
I just need to know the
fastest way out of the city.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:11.786 position:50% align:center
Are you out of your mind?!
Watch what you say!

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
The walls have ears! Suppose
the City Guard overheard?

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
City Guard? What?

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Enough. Stop fooling around.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
The family farm is waiting.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Whoa. Is it me,
or did the mood shift?

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
Tell you what, you guys head
to the farm and I'll catch up.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.432 position:50% align:center
I'll help you pick some apples
after I find my way back.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasping]

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.685 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN]
Oh, no.

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
His skull is cracked.

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
Leaving the city is super
standard stuff for an RPG!

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Whatever. I'm out.
The harvest'll have to wait.

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] This adventure's
gonna be so cool!

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.199 position:50% align:center
I can totally feel it--

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN]
Stop!

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.371 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to
be my "ol' pal!"

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
Pals don't tackle
their best friends!

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
Oh, and for the record:
that hurt!

00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
I did what I had to do.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting you commit
the Crime of Egress!

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
Uh. Crime of what?

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
I knew it.

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
That head injury has
afflicted you with amnesia!

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:12.180 position:50% align:center
What? No, I'm fine.
Really. Least I think so.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.265 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN]
Listen up and listen good!

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
The giant moat surrounding
the town of Ted is specifically

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
designed to protect the
safety of its citizens!

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
Residents are prohibited from
leaving under any circumstances!

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
Likewise, apart from special
envoys on official business,

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
no one is allowed to enter!

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
We are sequestered from
any and all contact

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
with the outside world!

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
Feels kinda like overkill.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
I mean, c'mon: are goblins
gonna take over a whole town?

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
Ah, wait. I get it!
This is the starter town.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to go out
and defeat some

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
low-level enemies first.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
Cool! Be right back!

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
Is this it? Do I...?

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
'Fraid so. There's no other way.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm right here.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN] So be it! I'm doing
this for your own good!

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's what this is about.

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
I get it. I have to beat
the town strongman mano y mano

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
so they'll let me
out of here. Sweet.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
It's like a tutorial.

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
Let's tango.

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
[HIRO groans]

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
I-I-- I'm bleeding!
I have a bloody nose!

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.674 position:50% align:center
Hopefully that drives
the point home.

00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
You crazy son of a bitch!
You hit me! Best friend my ass!

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.888 position:50% align:center
I don't know you from dick!

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare!

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten the oath
we swore to each other

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
on that fateful day?
Under the Kenura tree?

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
[HIRO screams]

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
Who gives a shit about some
fake ass imaginary tree?

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN growls]
Hiro!

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Why does this part
have to be so realistic?

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
Violence isn't the answer!

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Oh, yeah. Sure.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
Bring that up now.
Excellent timing.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
Look at you. You wanna
take on a goblin

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
but you can't even
hold your own in a fight!

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] That's it.
I'm sick of this bullshit.

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
I spent all day, every day
getting dunked on by real life.

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.887 position:50% align:center
I don't need it
in my video games.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
This ends now.

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
Hiroshi Yuki is taking a stand!

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
You're just a stupid NPC!
Screw you!

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN gags]

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Not so tough now, huh?

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Dude. Get up.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Stop playing around.

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.295 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.630 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
No! Martin!

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.010 position:50% align:center
H-He's dead!

00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:58.179 position:50% align:center
Wha...? What're you
talking about?

00:18:58.263 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
You murdered my brother!

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
No! It's gonna be fine!

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
Wh-Where do you keep
the healing herbs?

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
You slayed your best
friend in cold blood!

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
What good are healing
herbs on a corpse?

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right. That tracks.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
What have you done?

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
He was only trying to help.
Why did you do it?

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
It-- It was an accident!
I swear!

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to!

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] My brother's lying
in a pool of his own blood

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
with a knife sticking
through his throat.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
You didn't mean to?

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
I apologize?

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
There must be justice!

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
How will you answer
for this? Tell me!

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] By feeling incredibly
guilty forever!

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA gasps]
You coward! Come back!

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Oh shit, oh shit, oh
shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
What the hell is going on?

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hiro!

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:00.909 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Why is this happening?!

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
Hiro!

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
[HIRO panting]

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
Not sure how I managed
to lose her, but oh well.

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
I totally just killed
an innocent man,

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
like killed as in he
won't be recovering

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
'cause he's dead.
Why am I so upset?

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
This is all just part
of the game.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact,
I can resolve the situation

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
by starting this
whole thing over!

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Hiro.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
[screams] I'm sorry!

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
Uh. Reona?

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
Hey. Sorry I didn't answer
my phone earlier.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
I had just gotten into the bath.

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
Wait, you what?

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
Not right now.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Hm? Something the matter?

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Yeah...
What's up with your avatar?

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
Pretty cute, huh?

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
It's what you might call
an occupational perk.

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
Strictly store employees only.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
Aren't perks supposed
to be for customers?

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
Seems backwards.
But why that outfit?

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
Because I'm a fairy!

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.725 position:50% align:center
The great thing is
it makes me invisible

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
to monsters and NPCs.

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
They can't hear me, either.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
When you get down to it,
I'm here for support.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
Remember that bit about me
being patient with noobs?

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Oh. Right.

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
Taking a pleasure stroll
through the city?

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
I assume that means
you're already done

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
helping your
friends pick apples?

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
Actually, I think I may've sorta
gotten off on the wrong foot.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you
skipped the harvest

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
so you could stay in
and get freaky

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
with your childhood crush?

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
Those aren't the words I'd use.

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Wait. Let me figure it out.

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Huh. Didn't realize
I was wearing this.

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:41.718 position:50% align:center
You like how the creators
opted not to spoil

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
the illusion with status
screens and what not?

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
Still gotta have a way to track
your progress, though, right?

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
Well, that's where the
title system comes in.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
I don't know what that means.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
Simple. Where you
are in the story

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:54.647 position:50% align:center
is indicated by the name
etched on this necklace

00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
at any given time. See? Right
now, they're calling you...

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
Uh. This isn't good.

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center
Your status is now
"Best Friend Killer."

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:06.618 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:14.542 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Game over, man! Game over!

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:49.095 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Episode 2:
"Living in a Dead Game."
