of realism, thanks.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.959 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh?

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] That was close!
I almost broke the seal!

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What am I looking at?

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
A monster?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
No, it's gotta be an NPC.
But I was the only one in here!

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
Hiro...

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:11.194 position:50% align:center
How could you? You fiend.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
Hold on. That physique.
And wait, that voice, too!

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Martin? Is that you?

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.749 position:50% align:center
How's that even...?
I mean, you're totally...

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
That is to say, because I...

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
That's right. It is I.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
Your old friend.
Whom you so mercilessly...

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
...killed!

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:38.179 position:50% align:center
Oh, great! When did this
become a horror game?

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Look. I'm really sorry!
I didn't mean to!

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
The dagger in my throat
tells a different story.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
This was intended. You fiend!

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
--No, no! Hold on!
--[MARTIN]  Yes.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
That's not how it went down,
I swear!

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
You were eating apple slices!

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
One moment I
was helping myself

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
to an apple slice and
then, out of the blue,

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
I'm sprawled on the
floor like carrion.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN] You laugh.
Do you find that funny?

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
No! Sorry! Just--

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
Hiro. Do you remember
our promise?

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
The oath we swore to one another
beneath the Kenura tree?

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
I-- I remember you
saying something about

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
a stupid tree, but that's
all I got, really!

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:33.151 position:50% align:center
Say it! Recite the sacred vow

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
we made under its
branches that fateful day!

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What's he talking about?

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
Is it covered in the manual?

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's dumb.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
Games don't have
manuals in them anymore.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
Go on! What were the exact
words of our promise?

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I don't know!
Hear me out!

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
I know we're supposed to
be old pals and all that,

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
but I only just
started this game!

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
Is that so? Well,
this changes things.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
So, we're on the same page?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Until your memory returns,
I'll haunt you day and night.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50% align:center
Why is that the answer?

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
I can't remember something
I never experienced!

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
I shall call this endeavor...
Martin Time!

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Um, how 'bout we not?

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Wait a minute.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Ginji's haunted by
his best friend, isn't he?

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact,
come to think of it,

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
he implied there
were two ghosts.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]
Uh. What're you doing?

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
[MARTIN]
Such potential. Such promise.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
[HIRO whimpers]

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
Why must I be dead?!

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
[HIRO screams]
Okay! That's it!

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
I'd like to be done now!

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
Reona! What's taking
you so long?

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center
Somebody! Help!
All I wanna do is log off!

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:54.858 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
It's okay. I'm comin'!

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
Reona, 's that you?

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
You sure as heck took your
sweet ass time finding me!

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA] Sorry to disappoint
you, but that's not my name.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
Don't really care!
Just get me out!

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
It's Martin Time!

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
Which evidently means
I'm haunted forever!

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Everything okay?

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
What in the world's
going on in there?

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Well, let's see.

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
I'm caked in blood,
so that freakin' sucks!

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Hate to contradict you, but
there's no blood I can see.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
Just get me out of here!
I'm beggin' ya!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
Fine! Just try to calm down.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
Take a deep breath
and count to ten.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
I believe you're
the one called Hiro?

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.895 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be okay, don't worry.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
Um, so what do I call you?

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
Who, me? Ah...
My name's Mizarisa. Hi.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
Yeah--where are we
going, exactly?

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.242 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
You'll see.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
A bed?

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
'Kay. You lost me.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
Relax. You, my friend,

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
are about to have
the time of your life.

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:13.395 position:50% align:center
Uh? I am? But--

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
"Intense stimulation?" What
is that supposed to mean?

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.860 position:50% align:center
Is-- are we about to get...?

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Is she inviting me
to do the do?

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I mean...

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
If this game is the
ultimate in realism...

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
And I can feel pain.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
Seems only fair that I
can feel other things.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
Wait. No.

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
This isn't the content
I signed up for.

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
I just wanted a pure
and wholesome RPG!

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
Except fully immersive does
mean fully immersive,

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
and if it's integral
to the story...

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
This experience fleshes out
my character arc--literally!

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
Score!

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
Why don't you lay your pretty
little self down on the bed?

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Oh-ho! Yes, ma'am!

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.547 position:50% align:center
Good. Now, close those
beautiful eyes.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] She's getting undressed!
This is really happening!

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
I know this trope.
She's a naughty prison guard.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.187 position:50% align:center
Man, if this is what it
means to do hard time,

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.483 position:50% align:center
give me 13 years without
the possibility of parole!

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:46.905 position:50% align:center
Ah! You know what?
I take it back.

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
Slap my ass with
a life sentence!

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.787 position:50% align:center
Woof. Here it comes!

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.998 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA] Easy.
Keep those eyes closed.

00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
Uh. You got it.

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
Ah. There now, 'kay?

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
Have a look at what's in store.

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.096 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's an interesting look.

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
Um, full disclosure: this may
be a little advanced for--

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA giggles]
Get ready!

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
Today's your lucky day!

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
This is what we like to
call Inquisition Time!

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
Like dirty inquisition?

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
Cool. I can be down with that!

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.838 position:50% align:center
Oh, I have something
a little more traditional

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
in mind for you. Mizarisa the
Inquisitor at your service.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
Ah, sweet! Role play!

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
You know, I've always
been curious about S&amp;M.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
Because my womanly
intuition tells me

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
that's the demon
inside you talking,

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
I'ma kick this lil party off
with a standard exorcism.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
Not sure how that goes,
but cool. Sign me up!

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA] Here's the
deal--break under torture

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
and confess, I take you
back to your cell.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
Hold out past the limits of
endurance, Martin's murder

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
gets blamed on the demon
and you're a free man.

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
Best of luck, Hiro.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
So what kinda
torture we talkin'?

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Hot wax? Whips and chains?

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
My personal favorite.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
Amputation of the arms and legs!

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
Okay, is there a safe word?

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
[screams] Hell no!

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
Ohh! Yes!

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
That's what I like to
hear from my subjects.

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
Keep screaming!
That's so hot!

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
No, no, no, no! Reona!

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
Help me! Another crazy girl
with a sharp object!

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
What is going on?

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
What took you so
long to get here?

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
I logged on hours ago
and it's been hell!

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center
This entire day has sucked ass!

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
I was kind of in the
middle of something.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
No, it's okay.
Don't be sorry.

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
You fended off Alicia for me
like a trooper and I'm sure

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
running the game shop
keeps you super busy.

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:13.218 position:50% align:center
Actually, I just got roped
into watching Miyazaki's

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
<i>Castle in the Sky</i> for the
umpteenth time and lost

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:16.763 position:50% align:center
track of when you messaged me.

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
Come on! Like we don't
all know that movie

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
forward and backwards
by now!

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
A masterpiece yields
fresh discoveries

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
with each subsequent viewing!
That's why it's art!

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
Plus, I was live-tweeting
the broadcast, so, you know.

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Does my present condition
scream "give a damn?"

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
Talking to yourself?

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
Oop. That's not an
encouraging sign, I'm afraid.

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
Methinks the fear is
driving you whacka-do.

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
Don't fall apart now.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
At least wait to lose your mind
till I've broken the skin.

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
[HIRO whimpering]
Reona!

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
That pointy part's getting
uncomfortably close to my bits!

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
I got you! Sparkle! Ah!

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
Hiro, Hiro! He's our man!
If he can't do it, no one can!

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
I know this isn't what you
want to hear, but enduring

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
the torture is surest path to
being cleared of all charges,

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
so I'm encouraging you
as best I can!

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
I will cheer until
my voice breaks!

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.399 position:50% align:center
Dammit, I need saving,
not a pep talk!

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
Well excuse me for not being
able to break shackles!

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
I should've taken my
chances with the ghost!

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
Less babble,
more severed limbs!

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
Ah! Oh, crap, this is happening!
Hey, please don't...

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
I have zero pain tolerance!

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Which leg do I choose?

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
The right leg is
practically begging

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
to be separated
from the rest of you!

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
Don't do this!

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
Um, Hiro? I think you
just peed yourself.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
Is that even a thing
someone your age still does?

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Glorious!

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
Stupendous!
What a gratifying accident!

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
That tracks...
like everything else in life.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
I've been an Inquisitor
for 12 years now

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
and never before have I seen
someone so humiliated!

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
Such luck!

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
Getting to amputate a
thoroughly piss-soaked leg!

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.428 position:50% align:center
Ahh! I love this job!

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
Stay with me, Hiro!
I believe in you!

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
I am done!

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
I give up. Everything
in my life is trash.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
Don't say that.

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
I just... there's
no point anymore.

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
Then what's a little mutilation?

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] Hold it!
The Interrogation's off!

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
[AMOS grunts]
What is that smell?

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
Never mind. You've had your fun.
Put that away!

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
Aw! But I just started!

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:56.381 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] Don't look at me.
I didn't give the order.

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.174 position:50% align:center
Just do as you're told.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
This comes from the head of
the City Guard, Tesla, himself!

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:05.598 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA] Dang it!
I didn't have any fun at all!

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Hm? What's it say?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center
"Nice Shower Best Friend Killer:
Amicide Who Had an 'Accident.'"

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
Awkwardly worded, but accurate.

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.238 position:50% align:center
You know, I don't think you
realize it, but you've managed

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:21.906 position:50% align:center
to do something incredible.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
Y-You've discovered
a new cheat!

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
Quit treating it
like a workaround!

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
But it's an entirely
unknown strategy!

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
No one's ever thought
of it before!

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
You're the first player
in the game's history

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
who soiled himself
to evade torture!

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
[AMOS grunts]
Ugh. Get up already.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunting]

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Wait! What are you doing?

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
You can't log out now!

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
You've made serious progress!
It's about to get super fun!

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
You call this fun?

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.149 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:56.232 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
This is not fun!
It's complete and utter garbage!

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:06.409 position:50% align:center
Screw this game!
And screw all of you!

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.995 position:50% align:center
I am done!

00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:49.471 position:50% align:center
