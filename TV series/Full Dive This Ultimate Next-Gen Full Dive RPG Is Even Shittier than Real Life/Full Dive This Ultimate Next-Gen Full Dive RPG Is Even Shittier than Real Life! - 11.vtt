[HIRO]
Wha--? What the--?

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.723 position:50% align:center
But I just went...

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
Ah! That's more like it.
Now to find Tesla!

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
[screams] Why're you watching me
drop the kids off at the pool?

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.079 position:50% align:center
Reona, help me! Now! Please?

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:05.333 position:50% align:center
This one's way too big
to handle on my own!

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:09.170 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm sure it's fine?
Just remember not to strain.

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
I believe in you!

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:15.343 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] It's gonna rip me
in half! [screams]

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:17.971 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.891 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.769 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness! Are you okay?

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.022 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What the hell?

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:30.900 position:50% align:center
I-- I mean. How'd you
even know I was here?

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.278 position:50% align:center
I followed you. When you
dove into the crap house

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.531 position:50% align:center
it struck me as the perfect
time to observe!

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
I was keen on watching
you in action again,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.746 position:50% align:center
but then all of a sudden
a nasty old goblin

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
went and beat me to the punch!

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:50.378 position:50% align:center
He was too fixated to see
me, so off with his head!

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:51.796 position:50% align:center
Another one for the pile!

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us he was
preoccupied, huh?

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Problematic,
but I suppose I'll take it.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.387 position:50% align:center
Um, thank you, I guess?

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
Hey, no problem, happy to help.
Quick question, though.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
Have you been taking
care of your sword?

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
Don't want it gettin' all
sorts-a rusty on you.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
It's good. No worries.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you think so,
but I'd better have a look.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.696 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.156 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
Uh-- I--

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:25.080 position:50% align:center
[screams] Son of a whore!
Why would you do that?

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I adore how easy it is
to get a reaction out of you!

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
You're every Inquisitor's
dream come true!

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
Oh, Hiro. Fruit girl's MIA.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
We're alone.
Let me see your O face!

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
And by "O," I mean "Ow."

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:46.726 position:50% align:center
No! You're insane. This has
to be your idea of a joke.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
Now, now. It won't be all pain.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
I can do pleasure, too, ya know.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
Forget it, I'm not falling for
the naughty girl act again.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:59.406 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
It's not an act. Here, see?

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
Go ahead. Grab on.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Ugh! Seriously,
18-plus mode kicks in now?

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
Horrible timing!

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
Huh?

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
If you lovebirds
are done being gross,

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
the city of Ted
just happens to be

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
in the middle of a goblin siege.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
So go make 'em a peach cobbler
and stop ruining the moment!

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Hey, why don't I
use your sweetbreads!

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
Bring it, tramp!

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
Oh, honey. You couldn't find my
sweetbreads with a road atlas!

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
Stop! Both of you!
This is ridiculous!

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
We need to track down Tesla!
Get a grip!

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
If the goblins find us here,
we're screwed!

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA] Wait!
Don't just take off during!

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:44.784 position:50% align:center
I haven't finished!

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA]
It's kind of his thing.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Who am I kidding?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
Those two'll skin me
alive before

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
the goblins have
the opportunity!

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
Hell, death by goblin is
probably the better option!

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
Knock it off! Think positive!

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
What the hell, Reona?

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
Didn't you hear me
screaming earlier?

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
Mizarisa stabbed me after
a goblin watched me poop!

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Had a lot to
contend with myself.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
Huh? So, what was
going on with you?

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Look. Do you see this?

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
I have more split ends
than a fork.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.904 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to help me beat
this, not obsess over your hair!

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
[stomach grumbling]

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
Work with me here.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:29.162 position:50% align:center
Come on. No way is
there anything left.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
Uh... The game might be
picking up on your anxiety

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
and generating a situation that
forces you to deal with it.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
Great! And it thinks
this is a good time?

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
Damn it. Ugh.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
I don't need a pipe-bursting
case of nerves again.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
"Again"? What does that mean?

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Forget it, okay?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
No. That isn't healthy.
You need to talk this out.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
But the goblins? Hello?

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
That's the point
I'm trying to make!

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
You can't beat the goblins
if you don't

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
process your trauma! Tell me.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.655 position:50% align:center
Look, I promise
it's not a big deal.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
Hiro, I'm not some stupid brat.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
Whatever your secret,
you can trust me to be mature.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
I won't make fun of you.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] All right, then.
Brace yourself.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
You tripped and peed your pants

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
in front of a stadium
full of people!

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
That's hilarious!

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Oh, yeah! Real mature!

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center
You're the last person
I should've told!

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
KQ doesn't skimp on
the psychological angle.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50% align:center
If a real-life event left
a scar on your psyche,

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
it's gonna have an
in-game counterpart.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
Every time you face
the moment of truth,

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
you'll have to poop.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
I didn't poop myself,
I just peed!

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Potato, potato.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
The specific details really
aren't that important.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
Easy for you to say!
While we're on the subject,

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.330 position:50% align:center
could you please stop talking
about bathroom functions?

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Whatever. You think I'm bad?
Imagine how Kamui would spin it.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
"Boo-hoo. Quit whining and
steer into the skid, IBS boy.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
Gonna run away, might
as well leave a trail. Die."

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
I didn't poop myself--
I just peed!

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
I can't believe we're
having this conversation!

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Hey. How's the tummy?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Hm? Whoa. I think
the spasms are gone.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
[REONA laughs]

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
Wait a second, you...

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
Did you wind me up
like that on purpose?

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
I suppose that depends
on whether it helped.

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. It did.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] There was probably a more
humane way, but whatever.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Ooo! A new title!

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Again with the timing.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
[REONA] "Evacuation Best Friend
Killer: Bowel-Emptying Amicide."

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Ah! How many times
do I have to say

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
I didn't poop myself?

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Never mind.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
Now that waste management
is no longer an issue,

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
let's get to the North Gate.

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
If my hunch is correct,
that's where

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.350 position:50% align:center
Alicia and Mizarisa are headed.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
Right! We, uh...

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
Tesla needs all
the help he can get!

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] Don't lose heart.
Stay focused, men.

Yes, sir!

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Oh, no.
One goblin is bad enough.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:21.376 position:50% align:center
This many can take out
the whole city!

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
Not even Tesla stands a chance!

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
Forward!

Yeah. Try not to be
too impressed,

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center
it's all by the skin

Ah--well okay, then.
They're, uh, seriously strong.

Hmm...

[ALICIA yelling]

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.722 position:50% align:center
Real talk, this is
a phenomenal team.

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
Look at 'em do their thing!

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
You may actually clear
this stage after all!

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
I know, right?
This is incredible!

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Sweet! As long
as Tesla stays alive,

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
the odds of me surviving
are looking pretty good!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
I have news!

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
The goblins have just
breached the southern gate.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
Queen Govern's estate is
under attack as I speak!

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.953 position:50% align:center
What? But how?

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
That gate is reinforced iron!
The guards I stationed there

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
were given strict orders
to hold the line!

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
I know, sir.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center
It seems an especially powerful
goblin managed to push through.

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
The guards were all...

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:36.177 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Oh... One Eye.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
Uh. Is that a name?

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] I'll explain later,
Hiro. To Queen Govern's at once!

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS]
Sir!

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.478 position:50% align:center

[HIRO]
A-Are you guys hurt?

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:53.778 position:50% align:center
We'll be okay.
But Amos and Palù are gone.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's terrible!

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
I wasn't their biggest fan,
but still...

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
When the goblins showed up,
the two of them went AWOL.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
Because of course they did.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
Join Tesla! There aren't
many guards left standing!

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
By the time he gets there,
he'll be fighting alone!

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh-- I'm on it!

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center

[HIRO]
What the hell is that?

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
Behold. The king of the goblins.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
One Eye.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
[ONE-EYE growling]

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] All right.
Guess this guy explains

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
why the odds of
survival are 0.1.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
I've faced him before.
We fought several years ago.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
Goblins were said to be
testing the perimeter.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
I was dispatched to investigate.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
[ONE-EYE groans]

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Though I pierced his eye,

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:12.023 position:50% align:center
it took everything
I had to escape.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
The cage! Have it
brought here at once!

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS]
Sir!

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.406 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Hiro.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
Stand firm. Have heart.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
When One Eye is vanquished,

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
we may venture beyond
the city gate arm-in-arm!

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Why would you say that?

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
Seriously, man!
That's dead guy talk!

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
Harken, foul beast!

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center

you gave you your name!

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay, he's alarmingly fast.

[TESLA grunting]

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:56.401 position:50% align:center

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, love.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
Let the qualified
warriors handle it.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.579 position:50% align:center
Focus on keeping
your pants clean.

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:10.373 position:50% align:center
Could you maybe not joke about
that right now, please?

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Fun and games aside,

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center
you really ought
to sit this one out.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
It's phenomenally dangerous.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm aware, but I--

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
[ALICIA] She's right. Stand back
and let us do our thing.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Alicia? You...

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
Captain Tesla is our
beacon of hope.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
I will not allow him to perish
at the hands of a goblin!

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
Nobly said. Goodness.
For a knife-wielding freakshow,

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
you certainly have a
knack for eloquence.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Did these two
bury the hatchet?

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
Not sure how that happened,
but I'll take it!

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hiro. Did I hear correctly?

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:50.205 position:50% align:center
Tesla barked an order
about some sort of cage?

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Must be important,
'cause he wanted it here fast.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.378 position:50% align:center
Sounds to me like
obvious foreshadowing,

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
unless I'm wrong. But you know,

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
the cage might just signify
that the battle's over,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.134 position:50% align:center
which means if we hold out,
we'll have won!

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:04.761 position:50% align:center
I guess that makes sense.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
Hold fast, Captain Tesla!
Your reinforcements are here!

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA laughing]

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.687 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Come on, Mizarisa!
You can do it!

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA groans]

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
Mizarisa!

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
Probably not as bad as it looks!

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
I think she's just been
knocked unconscious.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
Whew. Well, that's
something at least.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
Sure, she's a total
psychopath, but still.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
What happened exactly?

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
Ugh. That beast kicked
Mizarisa in the abdomen.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
Looks like I'm up.

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Be careful!

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Um. I have no earthly
idea what's going on.

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Yeah. Me neither.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Of course.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
Kinda feels like they cheaped
out on the big climax. I mean,

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50% align:center
shouldn't the protagonist
be able to see the action?

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
Look! We're almost to the end!

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! Sweet!
Bring on the cage!

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
[cries]

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center

Why do we have goblins?

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
[GUARD H] They're all part
of the Captain's plan!

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
When One Eye sees them,
he'll recoil and falter.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
Then the advantage will be ours!

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] Lo! You recognize
your own, do you not? Observe!

Cool! It's working!

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
So, they have intelligence?

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center

It's over now. You're done.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
All right! Safe to say
the tide's finally turned!

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
It really has! You're about to
clear the goblin siege of Ted!

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:16.559 position:50% align:center
Dude! We actually just beat
a 0.1 chance of survival!

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Well, to be fair.

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
Kamui was laying
it on pretty thick.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.362 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Chance of survival, 0.1%. Die.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.447 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hold on. That doesn't track.

00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
Kamui's a jerk, but why
make a walkthrough

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
if it only helps players
figure out you lied about

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.870 position:50% align:center
the game's difficulty?

00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
But once you've cleared it,

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
you'll get at the real mystery
behind the City of Ted.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
Keep your mouth shut,
eyes open, and your mind alert.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Where's the "real" mystery?

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
And keep my mind alert for what?

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
Was he just grandstanding?
Come on, think!

this sound before!

What's the matter with you?
Why would you stay my hand?

I-- Where'd these
guys come from?

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
Were they captured
during the siege?

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
Or have they been here a while?

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
Did you abduct them?

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
Did you hit your head?
Don't get uppity with Tesla!

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
First you can't
control your bowels,

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
now you've lost
your grasp of reality!

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
Do me a quick favor
and stop talking.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Ow!

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.647 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] This isn't the first time
I've heard them crying.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
I noticed the sound
while I was in prison.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
Then again after
I started training.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
They were there as I watched
Ginji being carted off, too.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
Originally, I figured
it had to be someone

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
really dangerous being
kept out of sight,

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't have
been more wrong.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
These poor creatures
were crying out for help!

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
You've had them tucked away

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
since well before
all this began!

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
They're pale.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
They're half blind.

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
Their voices are strained.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
All signs they've
been kept in the dark

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
way longer than the siege
has been going on.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
In fact, I'd say all
things considered,

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
they must've been
here for years!

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
Only one person could
orchestrate that,

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
and that's you!

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
Bravo! Brilliant deduction!

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
Too bad this is an RPG
and not a mystery!

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
Get your head in the game!
Stop overthinking!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
What would conceivably
possess Tesla to--

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
[ONE-EYE growling]

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
[GOBLIN CHILDREN scream]

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Why would you...?

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:54.592 position:50% align:center
Damn it! I told you to hold off!
Have you lost your mind?!

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
You're full of surprises, Hiro.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
And far more clever
than I suspected.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasping]

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] Your surmise is correct.
I kidnapped them.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
Seven years ago, give or take.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
And to make matters
even more interesting,

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
this wretched creature
was their father.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's dark.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
But why, Captain Tesla,

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
how could you do
something so wicked?

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh-oh.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
Queen Govern!

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
Well, then. It appears
you've slayed him.

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
Indeed. I'm afraid
I had no choice.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
No matter. Tis easily remedied.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
Why, the offspring of some
other goblin can be snatched.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
[HIRO whimpering]

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
Majesty. Why sanction
such a heinous act?

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
Because there is
no greater method

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
for keeping our citizenry in
check than fear of the outside.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
You mean, we--

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.339 position:50% align:center
It's all politics.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
[QUEEN GOVERN]
Dear child...

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
We are beyond the control
of every kingdom in Auberdine.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.845 position:50% align:center
For all intents and purposes,

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:23.682 position:50% align:center
a nation state with
complete autonomy.

00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
The pristine City of Ted.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
What's more,

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
goblins are a characteristically
peace-loving species.

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] They are a distinct
culture unto themselves.

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:42.575 position:50% align:center
Unless provoked, they rarely,
if ever, attack human beings.

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
However, their penchant
for ferocity

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
when cornered can be quite
useful when channeled properly.

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
Not only are they an effective
tool for keeping people out,

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
they're absolutely marvelous at
keeping adventuresome fools in.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
Indeed, they're
the perfect means

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
with which to rule
our citizens.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
Thus is the fate of
these pitiful souls

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
at the hands of their betters.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
Quite. You could say

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
they're the foundation
on which the city is built.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
That bastard!

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
I've crushed on him since
I was in high school!

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
Clearly, it's time to reconsider
my taste in hot guys.

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
Kamui should've
been that revelation.

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
You're like a
barometer for jerks.

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
No one asked you!

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
Crap!

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center
[swords clanging]

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS groan]

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
Uh! Tesla! You straight up
murdered your own men!

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
I've no choice when
faced with exposure.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
Ted's secret must be kept safe.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
Anyone unlucky enough
to discover has to die.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
[TESLA] You do realize
of course, you're next.

00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:02.906 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Thundering Tesla, the
toughest NPC in the game...

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:05.283 position:50% align:center
I get it now.

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center
The only way out of here
is by defeating him.

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:13.875 position:50% align:center
That 0.1 chance of survival
suddenly makes a lot more sense.

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:49.304 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
