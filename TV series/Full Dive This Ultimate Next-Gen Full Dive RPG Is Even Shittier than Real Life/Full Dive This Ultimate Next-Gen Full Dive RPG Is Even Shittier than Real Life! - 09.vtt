here with us,

[REONA]
Well, Kamui did say training

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.796 position:50% align:center
might end up breaking you.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.631 position:50% align:center
In my defense, I knew
this wouldn't be easy.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.675 position:50% align:center
But borderline sadistic?

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:17.137 position:50% align:center
How's anyone expected
to push through it?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.596 position:50% align:center
Cheer up, friend!

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.724 position:50% align:center
While you were being
demeaned and humiliated,

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.144 position:50% align:center
I discovered something useful!

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
"Consultation"?

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.857 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Military organizations
tend to attract a rough crowd.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.984 position:50% align:center
Internal conflict

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.777 position:50% align:center
So, naturally soldiers
want someone

they can open up to,
talk it out.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.489 position:50% align:center
This is just what you need!

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
More than likely.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
Way to totally
stick the landing.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Hey, I'm flying by
the seat of my pants here, too.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
Point is this place wouldn't
exist without a good reason.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
Come on, what's therapy
gonna accomplish?

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.961 position:50% align:center
You are being
blatantly extorted!

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
Just because it's happening in
a game does not make it okay!

[HIRO grunting]

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.511 position:50% align:center
[COUNSELOR A] Right.
What seems to be the trouble?

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.931 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Um, well,
I just joined and, uh...

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.809 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm having some
problems with fitting in?

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50% align:center
Could you be more specific?

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.813 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
The instructor brushes me off,

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.733 position:50% align:center
the other recruits
make fun of me.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Don't beat around the bush.
Tell him about the money.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.697 position:50% align:center
And actually, um...
I'm not sure how to say this,

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:21.201 position:50% align:center
but a couple of guys started
shakin' me down for cash.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
Oh? I see.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
Well, all right.
Tell me everything.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
Hmm... I think I understand.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
You-- You do? Really?
That's a relief--

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.590 position:50% align:center
And by my observation,

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.759 position:50% align:center
you deserve a sizable
portion of the blame.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
I do?

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
[COUNSELOR A] You joined
the Guard without a sliver

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
of relevant skill. In what world
does that invite anything

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
but contempt from
your fellow trainees?

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
But Tesla asked me to join.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
And were you not
at liberty to decline?

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
No, I was, technically.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.193 position:50% align:center
Well, then I recommend
that you quit immediately.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
Just move on and make
yourself useful elsewhere.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
Right. Send in the next.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center

I'd have been better off
talking to a wall!

I guess when you get
right down to it,

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
government employees
aren't known

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50% align:center
for patience and sensitivity.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Then why drag me
here in the first place?

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
Hey, didn't it feel good to
talk about your feelings?

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.638 position:50% align:center
Bottle that stuff up and it only
comes back to haunt you.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center

Oh, uh--no, I-- I'm okay.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
Oh, good. Glad to hear it.
I was worried for a second.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.239 position:50% align:center
Thought you might've
gotten yourself injured.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.575 position:50% align:center
This is where they send us
when we get beat up.

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
Why'm I not surprised?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.206 position:50% align:center
You know--not to pry,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
but if you're having
other kinds of problems,

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
there are things
that might help.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
This, for example.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh. Oh, yeah?

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
[CATHY] When I find myself
going through a rough patch,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
I practice gratitude.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
Prayer has always been
a source of comfort.

It's great if Cathy wants
to be religious or whatever.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
No judgment.
I'm just not very spiritual.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't know a quest flag

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
Holy events are standard
issue for an RPG.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center

What should I do?

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
You are in great peril.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
I shall perform a cleansing
ritual without delay.

Please tell me you have
some idea what I'm in for here.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
Uh. It's gotta be
similar to a baptism.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Cool. That I can do.
No problem-o.

There's no more reason
to linger here,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.718 position:50% align:center
so go forth from this church!

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Appreciate it. Thanks.

take a turn for the better?

[HIRO groaning]

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] Hmm... Oh. I see.
As you were, men.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?
With all due respect, sir.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Resume training! All of you!

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.489 position:50% align:center
After all the crap
I've been through,

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
absolutely nothing
is different.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
I saw a counselor.
I got freakin' soaked.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
Hiro, don't.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
Ask yourself this question:

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
would you rather be
dependent on others

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
or do you want to solve
life's problems on your own?

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
You're the genius who pushed me
into asking for help!

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA] I think somebody's
taken one too many on the head.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center
Ha! I think he's
finally lost it.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
Cathy, I didn't mean...

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
There something going on
between you two

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
the rest of us
should know about?

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
No, we're just friends.
Leave it at that.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA]
Friends, sure.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
If you guys are so inseparable,
it's only fair we give

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
your best buddy
the same treatment,

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't wanna leave her out.

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA chuckles]

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
Tell us the truth, Cathy.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
You friends with this loser
or is he just talkin'?

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
Y-You might say that we...

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
Go on, love. Tell us how close
you an' Hiro really are.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.627 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, actually we...

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
I mean.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
We're not friends. I hardly
even know who he is.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
There you go!
That makes way more sense!

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
How stupid you gotta be
to think this girl wants

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
anything to do with you?

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
[REONA laughs]

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
Pointless question,
but are you okay?

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
No! No, I'm not!

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
And don't think I didn't
hear you laughing

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
right along with them!

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Bullied. Battered.
Betrayed by someone with whom

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
you had a connection.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine
how that must sting.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center
I don't hold Cathy responsible.

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
Anyone would've caved
in that situation.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
Whatever. Hey, it is
what it is, am I right?

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
Chin up, kid.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
Least this isn't happening
in your actual life.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
Look on the bright side:

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
you only have to stick
it out for one more day.

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
I have to endure a whole
other day of this?

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
Not to be dramatic,
but I think I'd rather die.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
Don't say that.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
This may be overstepping my role
just a touch, but... So be it.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
The time's come for me
to take action.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
There's nothing you
can really do.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
Now, now.
Downhearted as you are,

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
don't underestimate
the power of a fairy.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA]
Dammit!

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hm?

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
Whoever knows where my boots
are better speak up!

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
Easy, big guy.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50% align:center
You sure you couldn't've just
misplaced 'em somewhere?

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
I'm not an idiot!
They were here!

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
They didn't just walk
off by themselves!

[GUARD D]
Cut us some slack, Granada.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
We've scoured everywhere
we can think to look.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
I-It'll be okay. You can
just wear my backups.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
We'll search again
after training, cool?

Oof.

How the hell did they
end up in the gutter?

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
Um, correct me if I'm wrong,
and I sincerely hope I am,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
but aren't those the boots
your grandmother made

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:57.175 position:50% align:center
by hand to commemorate
your becoming a mercenary?

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
Is this someone's
idea of a joke?

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center

whoever's responsible...

[GRANADA whimpers]

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center

Gross, right? But satisfying.

And all just a prelude

Where's my sword?

Sure, I guess.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center

[HIRO]
Just like with the boots,

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
Granada had us turn
the place upside down.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Nothing.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
And believe me, he had us
looking everywhere.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
This is useless. I'm done.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.
We'll try again tomorrow--

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
it's bound to turn up
eventually, right?

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
[GRANADA]
Leave me alone!

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center

Do I have to spell it
out for you?

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center

Why, the pair of panties
I left in this locker are gone!

They were white as the driven
snow, a signifier of my purity.

Seriously, man! Come on!

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
But this dusty old broad--

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.345 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

If that's how you talk to women,

[GUARD T] Damn right! And real
men don't steal panties!

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:38.438 position:50% align:center
I told you,
it wasn't me! I swear!

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.273 position:50% align:center
[GUARD S] Then how'd they
end up in your bag?

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center

Good question!

You've got to believe me!

Skill doesn't give you

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
Being a City Guard

Don't talk to me like your

[GRANADA sobbing]

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] Well, I just received
word from Granada.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
He's decided to quit
the Guard altogether.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
Personal reasons, apparently.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That's unexpected.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
[AMOS] Which is unfortunate
because none of you lot

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
are worth a stale fart. Anyway,
start running drills! Hop to!

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
Captain Tesla!
Uh, you honor us, sir!

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
I trust you'll forgive
the interruption.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
This letter just
appeared on my desk.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
Ah. Yes. Fascinating,
I'm quite sure.

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center
Fascinating indeed, though its
contents do not auger well.

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
It claims that you
hounded Granada.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
Uhh--

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS gasp]

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho, no, Sir.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
Whoever wrote that is
categorically mistaken!

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
Yet they make a most
compelling case.

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
Evidently, Granada bested
you in a sparring match.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
You in turn were irked enough
to foul his boots and sword.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
Is that the sum of it, Paluù?

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
Eh...

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
Come now.
You wrote this, correct?

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
You conniving, no good rat fink!

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
I had nothing to do
with that letter!

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
Someone's playing a prank!

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.603 position:50% align:center
You lie with every
breath in your body

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
and every stroke of your quill!

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
Alas, I cannot speak to
the letter's authenticity.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
But I know your conduct
leaves much to be desired.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
Your tardiness being
but one example.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
Oh! That! Yes, well.
I can explain.

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
Speak truly, comrades.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center
I ask you: is Amos fit to be
your training instructor?

00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
[BOB] It's a complicated
question, sir.

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
Ha! Ungrateful bunch of...

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
He is decidedly not!

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS gasping]

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
She went there.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.599 position:50% align:center
It's true! Paluù and Granada
were bullying Hiro.

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
He knew. He saw and he
did absolutely nothing!

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
Insolence! From the
moment he set foot here,

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
I've shown him the exact same

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
measure of respect
as the rest of you!

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
Fair enough. It wasn't
just the instructor, sir.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
We've all-- We've all
been horrible to him.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
[cries]

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
I can't deny it.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
She's got us there.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
We treated him like
a piece of dirt.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
And now that you have
the decency to be ashamed

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
of your actions,
you should apologize!

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center
You were easily the worst
offender of the lot!

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
Ho-- You can't talk
that way to me!

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
When's the last time you
actually bothered to teach us?

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
Just admit it: you wanted
Granada out of the picture!

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:00.348 position:50% align:center
You stole his sword!

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
[GUARD AC]
Confess already!

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
We know you're responsible!

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
Why you impudent,
backstabbing cretins!

We deserve better!

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
[GUARD AH]
Get him out of here!

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
Tesla! I beg you! Don't listen!
They're lying! All of them!

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
They despise my authority!

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
With regard to Granada,
the truth is not clear.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
I doubt it shall ever be.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
You're a just leader, sir.

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
[TESLA]
However, of all these soldiers,

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.250 position:50% align:center
not one came to your defense.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
With regard to your
fitness as a teacher...

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:32.672 position:50% align:center
I fear that speaks volumes.

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.800 position:50% align:center
You are forthwith
relieved of your position.

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center

As you were, comrades.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
You'll have a new

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
No! Captain, don't go!

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
This is all a misunderstanding!

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
I can explain! Please,
give me another chance!

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
There's no excuse for what
I did. I'm so terribly sorry.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.824 position:50% align:center
Hey. It's all water
under the bridge.

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
You deserved better from us.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:02.577 position:50% align:center
Way better.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
From now on, we're a team.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
Thanks. But, um,
what about him?

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
[REONA laughs]
Mission successful!

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
Never underestimate a
fairy's power! Right?

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling you were
the one behind all this.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
Um. You mean,
"Gee thanks, Reona."

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
that you have
absolutely no remorse

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
for what you've just put
those people through?

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
Um, excuse me, sir,

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.945 position:50% align:center
are you forgetting what
"those people" did to you?

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
You're a total psychopath.

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly think
I'm validated by the sight

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
of a grown man
bawling his eyes out?

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:44.953 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
That reminds me.

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
Paluù should get his
just desserts, too.

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
You've already done enough!

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
Just please--
leave the guy alone!

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center

Why the hell am I getting
branded with that?

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Because you take responsibility.

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
I'm the support character.

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
You may think it's a cool name,

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
but "wicked" and "devil"
aren't the sort of adjectives

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
a reasonable person
includes on their resume!

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
Relax. It's not that
big  of a deal.

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
In fact, if I were you,
I'd be more focused

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
on tomorrow's goblin siege.

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
You mean the apocalyptic

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
I'm woefully
unprepared for because

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:26.453 position:50% align:center
my stats haven't gone up at
all over the past five days?

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:27.829 position:50% align:center
It's on my mind!

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
So, then. Are you quitting?

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Guess I might as well
see how far I can get

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:38.381 position:50% align:center
since I've been able
to survive this long.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I can't tell if that's
strength or weakness talking,

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
but I love the attitude.

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
That's a weird way to
make me feel better.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50% align:center
Hiro. Your resolve is clear.

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
Thank you for sticking this
through to the very end.

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:55.899 position:50% align:center
I think it's time I
come clean with you.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:58.485 position:50% align:center
You need to know the truth.

00:21:58.568 --> 00:22:00.820 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:02.864 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
I'm gonna be real with you.

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
