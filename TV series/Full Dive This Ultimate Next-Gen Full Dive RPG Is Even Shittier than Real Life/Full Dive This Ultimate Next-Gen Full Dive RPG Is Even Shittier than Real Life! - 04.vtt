that'd make a difference.

[MAN A]
You're saying that's him?

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.448 position:50% align:center
Back in middle school,
the kid could run like hell.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:39.409 position:50% align:center
True. He's the track
team's star runner.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
You've got this. Do your best.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:44.622 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Right. Like I wouldn't.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
Ah. Oh, wow.
Your brother's so cool!

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center

How you doin'? You nervous?

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:02.974 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] It's only district.
What am I, a toddler?

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.185 position:50% align:center
Somebody's feelin' cocky.

You know Moriguchi's

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:11.358 position:50% align:center
You gotta be kidding me.
Tatsuya?

[TAKAFUMI] What did you expect?
Guy's a warhorse.

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center

[HIRO exhales]

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
I'd be scared. Bad enough the

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
are worth getting
their hooks into.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
Kinda important match
when you get down to it.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
Meh. Whatever.
It's all the same. See ya!

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center

Sorry! I should've
recognized you sooner!

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Well,
it's been a few years

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center

This is unreal!

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
Well anyway,

I hear you're something

you've beaten just about every

in the district.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
You know about that?

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
It's what I do, kid.

Promising young athletes

No reason to get in my head.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center

making record time

an article about you.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
You sound more like a ten-
year-old girl being chased

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
by one. "Someone
help me! Oh, no!"

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
Guess what? It's not
your problem anymore!

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center
I'm over it. I quit playing.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.913 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, what?
You quit playing?

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] It's a shitty game and
I'm selling it. That's that.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
Hmph. Way to make excuses.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
You're quitting because you
don't think you can beat it.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What the hell do you know?

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
I know you. You're pathetic.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Well, that's a one-eighty!

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
You wanted me to
quit the damn thing!

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
Because of what you
should be doing instead!

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
Ugh! You quit track,
threw yourself

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
into video games, and now you
can't even stick with that!

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
You're so pathetic! Look at you!

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
Call me pathetic one
more time. Go on!

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
Piss off.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
Bye, hon. Be careful in traffic!

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What's her freaking problem?

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.837 position:50% align:center
[HIRO'S MOTHER]
Sweetie, it's her way of saying

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
she misses how
things used to be.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
Why doesn't she just say that?

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
[HIRO'S MOTHER]
Who knows?

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
But she brags about her
"cool big brother" all the time.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
Maybe a couple years ago.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
[TANISHIRO]
Hiroshi.

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
[MISHINA]
Lookin' sharp, buddy.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
Hey. Gotta a little
favor to ask ya.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Here.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hang on.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
[MISHINA]
We didn't even...

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
Hiro! You can't just
roll over like that--

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
Look. Not your problem.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
Ah! There he is!

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
Let's talk
post-graduation plans.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.185 position:50% align:center
There's no time
like the present!

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
Still workin' on it.
Have to get back to you.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
[YASUOKA]
No rush, but soon, yeah?

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Finally! Ugh!

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
This is like the seventh time
I've tried calling you today!

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I can't answer
my phone at school.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Whatever.
Just come by the shop.

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.672 position:50% align:center
I've got something
really cool to show you.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] 'Kay. I planned
on stopping by anyway.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
I've closed up for the day,
so you can chill

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.182 position:50% align:center
and hang out as long
as you feel like.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
Right, so anyway,
let me show you this--

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec. Here.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
Pretty cool, huh?

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
How much can you give me?

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
You're hilarious.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
This isn't a joke.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
Well, you could've fooled me!

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
I'm selling it!

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
Uh... Okay, then.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
Is there some kind
of issue, or what?

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I'm not dignifying
that with a response.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.831 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
But it was getting so good!

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
"Good"? Seriously?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
You got mammaries
for brains, lady?

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
I was branded as a criminal,
got haunted by a ghost...

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
And the cherry on top?

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
I had an accident.
Not my idea of "good"!

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
[REONA laughs]

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Sorry. "Amicide
Who Had an Accident."

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
Such an awkward title
to get slapped with!

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.357 position:50% align:center
First time I've seen
something like that!

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
Yeah, kind of a
first for me, too!

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't get so bent out of
shape. Hey, if nothing else,

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
at least the Inquisitor
was happy about it!

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:43.990 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Bringing joy to a psychopath

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
is not something
I take pride in!

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
She'd be pretty useful
in your party, though.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
Thanks, that's a hard no for me!

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
This is stupid. I'll take
my business elsewhere!

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
All right. Good luck.
Don't expect anyone to bite.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
What? It's still
in good condition.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
Ever try to sell an old bicycle
with a ton of miles on it?

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
You end up having
to pay someone else

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
just to take it off your hands.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Then where did you get
off charging me full price?

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not at
liberty to discuss that.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center
However...

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
The name Soichiro Kamui.
Heard of it?

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
No. Why would I give a damn?

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
[REONA] He's a member of the
Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
He was also known
as a very skilled

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
full-dive RPG player
back in the day.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
It's a little
embarrassing to admit,

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
but back when I
was in high school,

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
I was pretty obsessed
with VRMMOs.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.255 position:50% align:center
And there was one
game in particular

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
that had an enormous
impact on my life.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
That's a bit surprising.
By all means tell us more.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.681 position:50% align:center
It was a hardcore full-dive
RPG that touted itself

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
as the ultimate in realism.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Soichiro Kamui.

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
His KQ username is just Kamui.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
You're tellin' me...?

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
[GINJI]
Kamui, his name was.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
AKA "The Eternally Invincible:

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
The Never-Bested Adventurer."

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
This is the guy
who's beaten KQ?

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.619 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Yeah. He played
through the whole shitty--

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
H-He knows the game
backwards and forwards.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:15.874 position:50% align:center
What'd you just say?

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
To date, the username
Kamui is the only one

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
to grace the KQ
completion leaderboards.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
I was standing right here! You
just called this game shitty!

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Point is, I'd hoped
you'd clear it on your own,

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
but if you're losing
interest altogether,

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
desperate times call for
desperate measures.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
Clean out your eyes and look.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure you clean out
your ears, but whatever.

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hm? "Auberdine Walkthrough"?

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.274 position:50% align:center
Extraordinary, isn't it?

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
Kamui made this walkthrough
while still in high school.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
Come on now,
you must be curious!

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Why would you think that?

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center
You wanna know what's
in here, don't you?

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
Course you do. I can tell!

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center
Click "Enter!", dummy!

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Okay.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute...

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
So you're telling me some guy
went to all the trouble of

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
creating a walkthrough and
still nobody else has beaten KQ?

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Well, uh...

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
Let's just say getting
through his spiel

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
isn't exactly to
everyone's taste.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
Why? Is the writing style
too difficult or something?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
Text only with a
Flash homepage?

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
That's a late 90s aesthetic.

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Hey, trash!

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Hey, trash!

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
Trash players who need a
guide to win should just die.

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
You know what?
Die. Die right now.

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
U-Uh...

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
See? Not the best
confidence booster.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
So, it's not the complexity.
He's just a prick.

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
Calling him an
insufferable shithead

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center
would be an understatement.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
Best to just bite the bullet
and power through.

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I hate everything about this.

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] What? You think
I'm runnin' a charity?

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
Pay up, asshole!

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:59.019 position:50% align:center
Aw. You can't? You broke bitch.

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.312 position:50% align:center
No worries. We'll do a trade.

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center
I give you the goods,

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
you lick my boots like
the worm you are!

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:08.194 position:50% align:center
Gah, this arrogant mother--!

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] The secret to KQ
is brains and brawn,

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
so put down the cookie sandwich.

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
Firm up. Lose the flab.
Get over yourself.

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
Three sets of 500 pushups a day.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.998 position:50% align:center
Double that for sit-ups.
Four-mile run.

Invest in some weights.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
Hit the gym.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
Screw you, man!

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.504 position:50% align:center
The game reflects my
real-life abilities, I got it.

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
Not that you care, but I need
a walkthrough, not a lecture!

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
All right, trash.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
Which of these
describes your sitch?

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
[HIRO growls]

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.140 position:50% align:center
[REONA gasps] "My childhood
friend is trying to kill me"!

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Th-That's it!

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.187 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Hate to break it
to you, buckaroo,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
but childhood friends usually
don't want us dead.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.859 position:50% align:center
You did something
to deserve this.

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
Look at your life,
look at your choices.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
[growls] Can I punch the screen?

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Pay attention.

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
When she becomes the
Fruit Slicer from Hell,

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
little Miss Stabby
gets insane stat spikes.

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
Unless you have martial
arts expertise like moi,

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
you're toast.
I say let her kill you.

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
You're wasting my time!

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
Give me something
I can actually use!

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Don't feel like dying?

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.218 position:50% align:center
Luckily, there's a trick.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hm?

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Fighting won't do you any good.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
You gotta be clever.
Find another way.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
Think about it. If you were in
her shoes, what's something

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:26.147 position:50% align:center
an old friend might do that
would throw you off?

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
That's all you get
for now, lardass.

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
Well? Get anything out of it?

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
No. Nothing.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
Ah! Looks like he
covers this one, too.

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] "The ghost of my best
friend has my dumb ass

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
at wits end." Ugh. I swear to...

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
If he doesn't walk back
the trash talk...

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI] Dead guy got your
panties in a wad, sweetheart?

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
Man up! What?
You too good for a ghost?

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
Get your head outta your ass.
Bring him along.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
Over and out. Kill yourself.

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
That was about as helpful
as a brain tumor!

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Look at this one...

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
"Weapons"? Yes!

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.230 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
Are you this lame?

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
Have you been trying to fight
bare-handed the whole time?

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
You're no MMA champion, kitten.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
Next time pay attention
to the sword propped up

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
in the corner of your room.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
There is no "next time"
with this game!

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, there was
a sword in my room?

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
I never got a decent look at
the place before I had to run.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
[KAMUI]
And finally. Stock up on items

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
while you're at it. 'Cause
if you think you can just

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
buy them whenever you want,
you're mentally defective.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
Markets fluctuate.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.550 position:50% align:center
Items sell out.
Grab what you need ASAP.

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
Got it? Course you don't.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
For real, though. Die in a fire.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.514 position:50% align:center
Shut your face! Why do basic
items that every player needs

00:19:41.598 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
even sell out in
the first place?

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
Hey. What the--? Why're you...?

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
Isn't this awesome?

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
We have enough info to advance!

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
It'll be a cinch now!

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Wh-Who says I'm logging back in?

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
Quick confession. If someone
besides Kamui beat the game,

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
I'd lose all sense of restraint.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
I'm such a simp for winners,
I'd probably marry them.

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
Who am I kidding?

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
I would marry them.

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
Of course,
there'd be an extensive

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
honeymoon phase beforehand.

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
[HIRO gasps]

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.633 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hiro. Wanna know a secret?

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
I think I might be falling
for you a little bit.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] R-Really? Hold up.
I'm not this lucky.

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Cut the bullcrap!

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
[REONA gasps]

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. Well,
I guess you're not

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
the first man to
find me unattractive.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's not what I...

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
Why you gotta put it
like that? I didn't--

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[REONA]
So, you're in?

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Y-Yeah!

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.417 position:50% align:center
[REONA] Then go home, get
comfortable, and log in, 'kay?

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Great. Naturally I'd start here.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
[AMOS]
Move it!

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
Tesla's not the sort of person
you want to keep waiting.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
Show some hustle!

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
Just stay downwind.

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
[HIRO groans]

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA]
Hiro...

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh?

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Just putting
it out there...

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
We could resume cutting off your
precious limbs sometime soon.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
How 'bout no?!

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
[MIZARISA] Aw. Then be kind
enough to let me keep

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
the sheets as a souvenir.

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
What in the hell for?

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
So, I can bury my face
in them and re-live

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
the agony of my glorious
little bedwetter!

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
Never say that again, please?!

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
Now, now. Don't let her
put you in a mood--let it go.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
Sure! No problem!

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:38.381 position:50% align:center
We need to get going.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
I've wasted a lot of time
persuading you to come back.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]
Wasted?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
[AMOS]
Quit dragging your feet!

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Shut up! I'm going!

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.849 position:50% align:center
[AMOS]
Well, hurry it up, then!

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
We'll see each other
again, my love.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
My glorious little bedwetter.

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:57.734 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Will you stop calling me that!

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:05.533 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I can't believe I'm
still playing this game.

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
Look at me. Kamui was right.

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:11.873 position:50% align:center
That crack about dying in
a fire may be good advice.
