00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.600
[Music]

00:01:56.861 --> 00:01:59.461
I still have
lingering emotions.

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:01.128
Never again...

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:03.228
This is the last time.

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:03.095
Gas expwosion?

00:03:03.128 --> 00:03:06.595
Explosion.

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:08.461
Why would
Mr. Keisei want

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:11.361
to have a gas expwosion
for himself?

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:12.895
I don't know.

00:03:12.928 --> 00:03:14.528
How come?

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.161
I promise you, dear...

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:20.128
I have no idea why he--

00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:22.028
It's your fault, Hina!

00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:25.261
No, it's not!

00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:28.061
I wanna see
Mr. Keisei now!

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:37.995
We should go.

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:40.028
We don't have
to go yet.

00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:42.361
The wake won't
be until tonight.

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:44.928
But it looks like
it's already started.

00:03:44.961 --> 00:03:47.161
Some of the people from his
temple are praying for him

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:49.928
before the actual
ceremony begins.

00:04:37.128 --> 00:04:38.928
Hi, there.

00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:42.828
You're from the Kougon
sect, aren't you?

00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:44.561
Come on inside.

00:04:44.595 --> 00:04:47.295
I'm fine right
where I am.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.228
We'll all be just
fine out here.

00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:51.095
We'll all...? I...

00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.561
Ouri Kagami...

00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:11.128
You and I may have met on
a few other occasions...

00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.995
My name is Rinsen Shirae...

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:17.128
I've been appointed as the Head
Inspector for this district.

00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:19.161
Head Inspector?

00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:21.495
The Inspector's job is
to support soldier monks

00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:24.361
who busy themselves with
the fight on the front lines.

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:26.261
I'm also in charge of the
funeral arrangements for those

00:05:26.295 --> 00:05:28.128
known as martyrs.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.395
I feel it my place to thank
you for your understanding

00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:33.095
with regards to holding our
ceremony before the wake.

00:05:33.128 --> 00:05:34.528
No problem.

00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:37.528
I mean, ultimately it's, well,
it's really just a funeral

00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.561
for my brother's other
identity, right?

00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:44.595
I should tell this to you
before anything else...

00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:47.428
Sho-Sojo Keisei Tagami
was not remotely suited

00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:50.395
to a transformation
into Shikabane Hime.

00:05:52.095 --> 00:05:54.128
And the reason for this is
that he was called to Heaven

00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.328
without becoming a Shikabane.

00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:58.261
You understand
this, don't you?

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:01.328
Because sometimes the
surviving families make a fuss.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:05.161
They ask us to do things like
bring back their lost ones.

00:06:19.628 --> 00:06:21.461
Excuse me...

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:24.061
Hm?

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:26.161
I'm Sougen Takamine...

00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:28.928
Sojo of the Kougon Sect.

00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:30.528
I see.

00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.795
Keisei...

00:06:31.828 --> 00:06:35.895
He was my first disciple, and
he was always special to me...

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:39.328
Like a clumsy son whose heart
is in the right place...

00:06:39.361 --> 00:06:41.195
And to honor him I feel
implored to tell you

00:06:41.228 --> 00:06:43.028
a few things about us...

00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:45.195
You know people die...

00:06:45.228 --> 00:06:48.261
But it's not as simple
as that all the time.

00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:53.228
Deaths affect
individuals, societies,

00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:56.328
and ultimately they influence
the entire world.

00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:58.228
In some ways,
you could say,

00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:00.961
people become a part
of the world by dying.

00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:02.961
They have to die.

00:07:02.995 --> 00:07:05.595
However, in certain
circumstances an existence

00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:08.428
which goes against
that nature is born

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:11.428
when people who died full of
intense regrets and obsessions

00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:14.495
come back to life
as living corpses.

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:17.928
With a will of their own.

00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.128
We call them Shikabane.

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.995
Shikabane have two
major characteristics.

00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:29.295
One is that due to their
nature as corpses,

00:07:29.328 --> 00:07:31.828
they have the ability to
regenerate their bodies,

00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:33.595
which makes them
nearly immortal.

00:07:33.628 --> 00:07:36.295
It's the transformation of
their regrets and obsessions

00:07:36.328 --> 00:07:40.061
into power that changes
these people into monsters.

00:07:40.095 --> 00:07:42.028
The other is even
more sinister.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.561
Although they have a
human consciousness,

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:45.961
they have deep hatred
toward the living.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:48.128
It's a prejudice they act
on at any moment,

00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:50.861
never hesitating to kill.

00:07:55.295 --> 00:07:57.495
Shikabane have
superhuman powers.

00:07:57.528 --> 00:07:59.561
The only ways to defeat them
are to either break them

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:03.095
into so many pieces that
regeneration is impossible,

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:05.261
or destroy the brain.

00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:08.861
And the only ones capable
of that are Shikabane Hime.

00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:09.761
These are the Shikabane

00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:12.361
who accepted the Kougon
Sect's doctrine.

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:14.395
They can fight as a human
against Shikabane

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:17.295
in accordance with the
secret ritual doctrine.

00:08:17.328 --> 00:08:20.261
They are the ultimate weapons
for killing Shikabane.

00:08:20.295 --> 00:08:23.095
A precision instrument
for the job, if you will.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.361
I don't know.

00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:27.228
That might be a
bit of a hyperbole.

00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:35.295
Each Shikabane Hime is
accompanied by a soldier figure

00:08:35.328 --> 00:08:37.428
known as a
contracted monk.

00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.228
His role is to provide
life energy called Rune

00:08:40.261 --> 00:08:42.328
to his Shikabane Hime.

00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:44.028
This is to assist in
keeping the dead girl

00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:45.895
among the living.

00:08:45.928 --> 00:08:49.561
Of course he also supports his
Shikabane Hime during battles.

00:08:54.928 --> 00:08:57.195
The contracted monk and his
Shikabane Hime are connected

00:08:57.228 --> 00:08:59.895
through a very
significant bond.

00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:07.295
There are over a hundred
contracted monks

00:09:07.328 --> 00:09:09.528
currently posted
throughout the country.

00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:11.261
The one who unifies
the contracted monks

00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:13.828
in each district is
called the Guardian.

00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:16.995
Keisei Tagami was the
Guardian in this district.

00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:29.770
The one at the very top of the
Kougon Sect is the Dai-Sojo.

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:34.703
The Gon Dai Sojo handles
administrative tasks.

00:09:35.903 --> 00:09:38.570
Under him, there are six
Sojo who unify followers

00:09:38.603 --> 00:09:39.903
throughout the country...

00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:42.036
I am one of them.

00:09:43.836 --> 00:09:46.770
Below them, there
are Gon-Sojo,...

00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:49.870
Sho-Sojo,
Gon-Sho-Sojo...

00:09:49.903 --> 00:09:51.936
And Dai Sozu...

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.770
This is how the
ranks continue.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.770
Although Keisei
was Sho-Sojo,

00:09:56.803 --> 00:10:00.103
he became Gon-Sojo once he
died in the line of duty.

00:10:00.136 --> 00:10:02.536
We feel what happened
was during a battle,

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.503
although not in
the heat of it.

00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:07.870
When the bond is broken and
Rune is no longer provided,

00:10:07.903 --> 00:10:10.670
most Shikabane Hime
die immediately.

00:10:10.703 --> 00:10:13.203
However, occasionally it has
been known that there are some

00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:15.170
who can survive.

00:10:15.203 --> 00:10:17.736
When this happens, we have no
choice but to deal with them

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.070
as the Shikabane they are.

00:10:20.103 --> 00:10:24.136
However, this type of death for
a Shikabane Hime is very rare.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.970
Every one of them is fighting
in order to get into Heaven.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.136
Destroying
108 Shikabane...

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.603
This is the virtuous deed
that is necessary

00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:02.136
for Shikabane Hime
to complete.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.503
They couldn't accept
death and became defiled.

00:11:05.536 --> 00:11:08.203
This deed is their
way to purification.

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:10.703
When they achieve it,
they will finally be set free

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:13.603
from this world
into the next.

00:11:17.536 --> 00:11:20.136
We're by no means
using them.

00:11:22.236 --> 00:11:25.536
Rather,
we are saving them.

00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:31.670
I understand how
difficult the work is

00:11:31.703 --> 00:11:33.770
that the Kougon
Sect is doing.

00:11:33.803 --> 00:11:35.703
I'll admit that there were
times when I was sure

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:38.236
that those in the Kougon Sect
were forcing Shikabane Hime

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.203
to do awful things...

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:45.570
But even though I don't think
that anymore, I feel lost.

00:11:45.603 --> 00:11:46.870
Let us take some time.

00:11:46.903 --> 00:11:49.103
I will discuss
it with you.

00:12:04.903 --> 00:12:08.170
What do you say we get
right to the point?

00:12:08.203 --> 00:12:10.270
We need to discuss
transferring your contract

00:12:10.303 --> 00:12:12.603
with Shikabane Hime
Makina Hoshimura

00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:14.770
to a new contracted monk.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.170
A new contracted monk?

00:12:19.203 --> 00:12:20.770
Yes...

00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:23.736
Once the Kougon Sect decides
who the new monk will be,

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.936
we will break the bond
between you and Makina.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.003
Hold on just a second.

00:12:28.036 --> 00:12:30.636
My brother entrusted
me with the contract...

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.003
He'd want me to stay
true to my word.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.203
Are you actually telling me
that you'd like to continue on

00:12:38.236 --> 00:12:41.536
with your duties as
her contracted monk?

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.503
Yes.

00:12:43.536 --> 00:12:46.103
Even if you continue,
you can't do anything.

00:12:46.136 --> 00:12:47.303
Have you forgotten?

00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:50.670
You almost died because your
Rune was forcibly absorbed.

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.803
You're lucky
to even be alive.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.636
And let's not
forget the fact

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.170
that you're not even
a monk to begin with...

00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:08.003
You're not one of us.

00:13:09.203 --> 00:13:11.736
There's no way you
could handle this.

00:13:14.803 --> 00:13:16.970
I need to know
where Makina is...

00:13:17.003 --> 00:13:19.836
Is she even going
to come to the wake?

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.936
She's under our
surveillance...

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.136
Shikabane Hime are beings
that go against nature...

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.003
They're defiled
as you know.

00:13:27.036 --> 00:13:28.870
Therefore, they're not allowed
to participate in services

00:13:28.903 --> 00:13:30.670
such as a funeral.

00:13:33.036 --> 00:13:34.870
I get it.

00:13:34.903 --> 00:13:37.503
They're all Shikabane Hime.

00:13:37.536 --> 00:13:39.636
All of those girls.

00:13:53.903 --> 00:13:55.636
Keisei...

00:14:09.036 --> 00:14:11.836
Why'd you leave me...?
Keisei.

00:14:38.242 --> 00:14:40.147
I wasn't really...
his younger brother.

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:49.452
When I was about three,
he found me and took me in.

00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:51.952
I don't have memories
of life before that.

00:14:51.985 --> 00:14:54.452
And what I remember clearer
than everything else

00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:57.452
is the time my kitten
was hit by a car.

00:14:57.485 --> 00:15:00.885
Since that day, death has
been a part of my life.

00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:07.785
It's made me incapable
of fearing death, though.

00:15:07.818 --> 00:15:10.885
For reasons
I can't understand,

00:15:10.918 --> 00:15:14.552
I get this feeling as if death
is something close to me.

00:15:16.518 --> 00:15:19.485
Everything changed
two years ago.

00:15:20.852 --> 00:15:22.852
They took the daughter
of the Hoshimura's

00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:25.718
and turned her into
a Shikabane Hime.

00:15:25.752 --> 00:15:28.485
Brother knew Makina,
he knew the family,

00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:31.552
so he became her
contracted monk.

00:15:31.585 --> 00:15:33.152
To think I was there
the whole time

00:15:33.185 --> 00:15:35.452
and knew none of this
was happening.

00:15:35.485 --> 00:15:37.385
All I seemed to be able
to worry about

00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:38.418
was Brother
always showing up

00:15:38.452 --> 00:15:40.718
with such painful
looking injuries.

00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:44.752
I started getting
involved in the battles

00:15:44.785 --> 00:15:47.752
between the Shikabane Hime
and Shikabane...

00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:50.518
It's like I was
drawn to them.

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:54.018
Even when I, with
my ignorant eyes,

00:15:54.052 --> 00:15:56.718
realized Makina
was a Shikabane Hime,

00:15:56.752 --> 00:16:00.418
a living corpse, I never
felt that it was unnatural.

00:16:00.452 --> 00:16:03.052
She was just an
ordinary girl to me.

00:16:03.085 --> 00:16:06.052
And I remember something
she said about Brother...

00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:11.852
She said something about
him being her comrade...

00:16:11.885 --> 00:16:13.952
He was very
special to her...

00:16:13.985 --> 00:16:15.485
Close.

00:16:15.518 --> 00:16:18.785
And he fought alongside
her valiantly...

00:16:18.818 --> 00:16:20.852
But I always knew
that he was more to her

00:16:20.885 --> 00:16:23.152
than just another
soldier in the field...

00:16:23.185 --> 00:16:26.618
That he was as precious
to her as he was to me.

00:16:31.485 --> 00:16:32.985
The world didn't change.

00:16:33.018 --> 00:16:34.985
Time kept moving forward.

00:16:35.018 --> 00:16:37.085
But when Brother died...

00:16:37.118 --> 00:16:41.118
Makina and I both lost something
of ourselves that day.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:02.418
Are you gonna take
all of those with you?!

00:17:03.818 --> 00:17:04.785
It was you,
wasn't it?!

00:17:04.818 --> 00:17:07.418
You put all these
magazines in with my stuff!

00:17:07.452 --> 00:17:08.318
I don't think so.

00:17:08.352 --> 00:17:10.518
That's your name written
across the front.

00:17:10.552 --> 00:17:13.452
Maybe so, but it's written
in your hand writing!

00:17:17.918 --> 00:17:20.018
What the hell is this?!

00:17:20.052 --> 00:17:22.152
Hey now, settle down!.
Hear me out!

00:17:22.185 --> 00:17:23.885
Consider this the friendly
kick-in-the-pants

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.718
I know you could use.

00:17:25.752 --> 00:17:27.452
Feast your eyes!

00:17:27.485 --> 00:17:29.618
"Moe Warrior
Zenbunose Puchitto!"

00:17:29.652 --> 00:17:32.052
All incredibly rare,
limited edition memorabilia

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:34.152
that you can't find anywhere!

00:17:34.185 --> 00:17:35.752
Then you put 'em up
in your own room...!

00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:37.518
Get outta here!

00:17:37.552 --> 00:17:39.685
Oh! You want
some privacy?

00:17:40.885 --> 00:17:41.752
Say no more.

00:17:41.785 --> 00:17:43.518
I understand, my man,
you want me to go

00:17:43.552 --> 00:17:45.818
so you can enjoy them
all by yourself.

00:17:45.852 --> 00:17:47.852
I'll kick your ass!!!

00:17:50.718 --> 00:17:52.485
The reason we fight?

00:17:52.518 --> 00:17:54.585
Maybe you should sit down.

00:17:56.618 --> 00:18:00.085
Have you ever thought about
what happens when someone dies?

00:18:00.118 --> 00:18:02.718
Do you understand
what I'm asking?

00:18:02.752 --> 00:18:05.652
They can't realize their
death has any meaning...

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:08.018
So they cling to
their past life...

00:18:08.052 --> 00:18:11.418
holding regrets and
obsessions toward this world.

00:18:11.452 --> 00:18:13.918
Becoming monsters
called Shikabane.

00:18:13.952 --> 00:18:16.652
What if something horrible
were to happen to you...?

00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:19.118
What if you died?

00:18:19.152 --> 00:18:21.452
If that does happen...

00:18:21.485 --> 00:18:23.118
burn some incense for me.

00:18:23.152 --> 00:18:26.685
If you're gone, what's gonna
happen to the Dai-Rin House?!

00:18:26.718 --> 00:18:29.452
What are we all
supposed to do...?

00:18:29.485 --> 00:18:31.085
Think about everyone
you'd leave behind

00:18:31.118 --> 00:18:33.052
if you got
yourself killed?!

00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:35.118
I'm sorry, Ouri...

00:18:35.152 --> 00:18:37.818
but quitting is out
of the question.

00:18:37.852 --> 00:18:40.985
I became a contracted
monk for Makina's sake.

00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:45.785
You have to understand
I'm the only one she has.

00:18:54.852 --> 00:18:58.452
Brother entrusted me with the
only thing he left behind...

00:18:58.485 --> 00:18:59.752
Her.

00:19:17.852 --> 00:19:19.585
Yo, Ouri!
Wassup?!

00:19:19.618 --> 00:19:21.085
No!
Cut it out!

00:19:29.785 --> 00:19:31.585
Hello, Manager.

00:19:36.185 --> 00:19:37.785
Why did you
come here?

00:19:37.818 --> 00:19:39.685
And what's with
your clothes?

00:19:39.718 --> 00:19:42.785
I knew your brother...
a little.

00:19:42.818 --> 00:19:45.818
What? Well, I should
invite you inside.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:48.052
Please.
You, too, Akira.

00:19:48.085 --> 00:19:49.652
I think I'll
pass on that.

00:19:49.685 --> 00:19:51.752
Why?

00:19:51.785 --> 00:19:55.685
I'm gonna pass, too.

00:19:55.718 --> 00:19:59.385
Don't tell me...
She's a Shikabane Hime.

00:19:59.418 --> 00:20:00.952
Hey, Manager, just
wanted to let you know

00:20:00.985 --> 00:20:03.918
our part-timer is useless!

00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:06.152
Hello?

00:20:06.185 --> 00:20:08.818
They said one of those
kids came back to life.

00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:12.385
Sorry, guys...
but I was wondering

00:20:12.418 --> 00:20:14.518
if my friend could stay
here for a little while...

00:20:14.552 --> 00:20:15.885
like until later tonight?

00:20:15.918 --> 00:20:18.052
She won't bother you.

00:20:21.552 --> 00:20:22.585
Not again...

00:20:22.618 --> 00:20:25.585
I'm sorry... I think my
mind was kinda wandering.

00:20:25.618 --> 00:20:27.785
Thinking about that
girl again? You know--

00:20:30.852 --> 00:20:33.085
Look, you left her with us,
but she said she had to leave.

00:20:33.118 --> 00:20:35.485
I didn't use my best
judgment and I let her go.

00:20:35.518 --> 00:20:36.918
I'm sorry.

00:20:36.952 --> 00:20:38.952
I'll be fine.

00:20:42.552 --> 00:20:44.985
Guess that makes you
her contracted monk.

00:20:45.018 --> 00:20:47.885
I've already chanted
a Buddhist sutra...

00:20:47.918 --> 00:20:49.818
See you later.

00:20:49.852 --> 00:20:52.018
Please,
you can't go...!

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:53.118
If you're part
of the Kougon Sect,

00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:54.718
would you tell me?

00:20:54.752 --> 00:20:58.385
I want to be a contracted
monk...! No forget that!

00:20:58.418 --> 00:21:01.152
My brother already transferred
the contract to me...!

00:21:01.185 --> 00:21:02.618
And this is a
role that I know

00:21:02.652 --> 00:21:05.585
I have to become
worthy of inhabiting!

00:21:05.618 --> 00:21:08.685
I just can't let...
Don't take her away!

00:21:15.585 --> 00:21:18.552
Have you heard
of Mount Goryo?

00:21:18.585 --> 00:21:20.585
Sadahiro!

00:21:20.618 --> 00:21:23.418
All soldier monks
used to train there.

00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:27.685
I'm really sorry
about Minai, kid.

00:21:27.718 --> 00:21:29.752
Let's go, Akira.

00:21:29.785 --> 00:21:34.785
[Music]

00:23:39.452 --> 00:23:43.052
Once something is broken,
it can't be unbroken.

00:23:43.085 --> 00:23:46.652
But you're struggling,
writhing to get it back...

00:23:46.685 --> 00:23:49.752
You're desperate.
So desperate.

00:23:49.785 --> 00:23:51.885
Can you see the
"Path of Light"?
