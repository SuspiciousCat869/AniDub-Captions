00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.566
[Mew]

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.200
[Mew]

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:22.433
[Music]

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:43.266
[Music]

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.366
You there, brother?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.800
What happened to you?

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:04.066
She's cold!

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:10.500
She's dead...!

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.466
I mean, she's passed on...

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.266
Did she die from some kind
of an accident or something?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.633
And why is she
here all alone?

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:27.266
You must stop this!

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.733
Guardian, please!
You can't!

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:34.400
Guardian, there's nothing
you can do in your condition.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:37.400
The bond has
already been broken.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.533
I recognize that man.

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.166
He's the one who comes from
the head temple sometimes.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.266
His name is
Shirae, I think.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.633
And that other guy was
calling brother 'Guardian?'

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.733
Where did he get
those injuries?

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:51.500
And just who the
heck is that girl?

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.400
Curious, aren't you?

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:55.366
She's Shikabane.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.666
What?!

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.433
Something you will
become fascinated by...

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.466
soon enough.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.400
Guardian Tagami...

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.333
It's my lack of skills

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.533
that caused the bond
to begin to break...

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.433
Still, it's not too late!

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:11.633
You'd be better off
to wait for a new one.

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:14.133
She's not an
object, Honda.

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:34.033
Keisei...

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:35.700
I'm sorry...

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.466
I'm certain that
she was dead.

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:20.438
Hagino... right?

00:04:21.402 --> 00:04:23.669
You know, back at your home,
we found seven corpses

00:04:23.702 --> 00:04:26.469
you tried to hide
inside a closet.

00:04:26.502 --> 00:04:30.302
Those are the women who used
to live with you, aren't they?

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:36.102
What would you cops
do if you found

00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:39.102
that your subordinates got
together and committed a crime?

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:43.769
There's only one answer.
You'd punish them.

00:04:47.335 --> 00:04:48.602
Well, it's the same
for those women.

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:50.802
I just punished them.
That's all.

00:04:50.835 --> 00:04:54.502
Then tell me what crime
those women are guilty of?!

00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:57.435
They disobeyed my
instructions...

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.635
And that's a felony.

00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:08.702
Ah!

00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:10.802
Stop!

00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:12.335
Hey!
He's getting away!

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:21.335
We gather for
this meal today, again,

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:23.635
thanks to the
protection of Buddha.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.635
Hey... What're you
doing, Keisei?!

00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:42.102
Don't call me Keisei, Shouta,
it's Mr. Head Monk to you.

00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:45.335
And it's okay for a
Buddhist monk to steal food?

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:47.402
Listen, kids, this
is a strange world,

00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:49.602
and in it there are many
people who seem respectable

00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:51.702
but in truth are
consumed by evil.

00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:53.269
Don't let anyone's
public appearance

00:05:53.302 --> 00:05:54.669
or personality fool you.

00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:56.335
You must see
through these individuals

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:57.435
to find the truth.

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:01.169
Yet another valuable lesson
taught to you by me...

00:06:05.502 --> 00:06:08.669
What're you trying to teach
them this time, Tagami?

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.802
You see... As the man
in charge of this place,

00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:12.735
I was seeing
to the kids' well being.

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:15.269
The land we're on may
belong to the Sekuu Temple,

00:06:15.302 --> 00:06:18.335
but I am still the director
of this facility...

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:20.869
I want all of you to forget
what he just said, okay?

00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:23.402
Instead, we're going to
divide Tagami's breakfast

00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:24.702
equally amongst
the rest of us!

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:25.835
Come on!!

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.569
Yeah!

00:06:27.602 --> 00:06:29.202
Excuse me, Director,

00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:31.735
but is it okay if I leave
this stuff at the front for now?

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:34.302
You're moving out tonight?

00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:36.502
Yeah, and I'm gonna ask my
friends at school to help me.

00:06:36.535 --> 00:06:38.502
No, Hanagami!

00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:41.569
You can't seriously
be moving out?!

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:44.435
My name's not Hanagami...!
It's Kagami, Kagami!

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.169
No...!
It's Hanagami...!

00:06:46.202 --> 00:06:48.369
Hanagami!!

00:06:56.802 --> 00:06:57.669
Owww.

00:06:57.702 --> 00:07:00.669
Are you gonna take
all those with you?!

00:07:03.769 --> 00:07:04.735
It was you, wasn't it?!

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:07.135
You put all these
magazines in with my stuff!

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.535
I don't think so.

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:10.402
That's your name written
across the front.

00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:13.169
Maybe so, but it's written
in your hand writing!

00:07:13.202 --> 00:07:14.635
I did it out of
parental love.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:16.269
I thought you'd
enjoy them much more

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:17.702
once you started
living by yourself.

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:19.169
I'm fine on my own!

00:07:19.202 --> 00:07:21.669
Besides, you're not
my parent, are you?!

00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:28.235
You're right...

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:32.269
After all, you grew
up here same as I did.

00:07:32.302 --> 00:07:36.702
Look, I'll always think of you
as a brother no matter what.

00:07:36.735 --> 00:07:41.269
I don't understand why
you wanna leave us, Ouri.

00:07:41.302 --> 00:07:42.869
Hey, I'll be close...

00:07:42.902 --> 00:07:45.702
I'll be stopping by for
dinner all the time.

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:48.869
Sure, but
it'll cost ya!

00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:54.669
See ya later!

00:07:57.869 --> 00:08:00.235
Once school is over,
I'll come back.

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:02.402
So just hold on to my
stuff until then, okay?

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:03.635
Thanks!

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:06.835
He said he'll be working
two part time jobs.

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:09.402
He's that age where he needs
to feel independent...

00:08:09.435 --> 00:08:11.435
Let him give it a shot.

00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:13.202
Did you notice...?

00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:15.369
He started saying he wanted
to live by himself

00:08:15.402 --> 00:08:16.669
only when he saw
you laid up

00:08:16.702 --> 00:08:20.169
after that injury you
received last year.

00:08:20.202 --> 00:08:22.102
That's when it started.

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:24.235
I had no idea.

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:28.302
I know how often you vanish
and then reappear all messed up.

00:08:28.335 --> 00:08:32.335
I've gotten used to it
over time, but Ouri hasn't.

00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:19.435
So the Dai-Rin House is
actually closer to the school?

00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:22.835
Yeah, but the rent here can
be higher than you'd imagine.

00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:26.702
Which is why I'm not so crazy
about living by myself.

00:09:26.735 --> 00:09:28.569
The real reason you
bailed is that the cemetery

00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:31.535
behind your house just plain
creeped you out, right?

00:09:31.569 --> 00:09:33.369
I've got enough
respect for the dead...

00:09:33.402 --> 00:09:35.169
not to be scared by them.

00:09:35.202 --> 00:09:37.135
Didn't you tell
me before...

00:09:37.169 --> 00:09:39.369
that sometimes you've
seen dead people?

00:09:39.402 --> 00:09:41.235
Yeah, since
it's a temple...

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:44.602
But it's never
frightened me or anything.

00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:46.835
Which I think is what
the problem is...

00:09:46.869 --> 00:09:49.702
So you guys gonna
help me move, or what?

00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:51.335
Hey! Where are you going?!

00:09:51.369 --> 00:09:52.735
Uh, I forgot, I've
got club activities.

00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:54.602
And I don't wanna
do physical labor.

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:55.702
Oh, crap!
We better hurry!

00:09:55.735 --> 00:09:59.269
I am!

00:09:59.302 --> 00:10:01.335
Inuhiko, hi.

00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:03.769
I told you not to call me
by my first name, right?

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:06.235
I hate it...
Anyway, so did you hear?

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:07.502
Hear what?

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:09.869
You know, about
the harem criminal.

00:10:09.902 --> 00:10:11.669
A Harem...?!

00:10:11.702 --> 00:10:14.769
I'd love to have a harem,
just for one day!

00:10:17.602 --> 00:10:19.769
So... you must be talking
about that guy

00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:22.102
who lived with all of those
women who turned up missing,

00:10:22.135 --> 00:10:23.235
I heard about him.

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:25.602
Of course! It's all they talk
about on the TV news.

00:10:25.635 --> 00:10:27.502
And last night they said
that after the police

00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:29.635
executed a search
warrant on his house,

00:10:29.669 --> 00:10:32.302
they found seven corpses
hidden inside.

00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:34.369
Corpses...

00:10:34.402 --> 00:10:36.269
So he really did
kill some of them!

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.302
Well, at least the police
have him in custody.

00:10:39.335 --> 00:10:41.502
Actually he
slipped away...

00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:43.535
The student council sent
a warning out to all of us,

00:10:43.569 --> 00:10:45.269
since the cops said
it's more than likely

00:10:45.302 --> 00:10:47.769
that he's lurking around
this area of town.

00:10:47.802 --> 00:10:51.269
I guess your window of
opportunity to move has closed.

00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:53.135
But, today's the only day
that I can take off

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:55.269
from either of my jobs.

00:10:55.302 --> 00:10:59.202
This guy's house is near the
next train station, isn't it?

00:10:59.235 --> 00:11:01.402
It just seems so unreal,

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:04.769
those corpses
being so close to us.

00:11:04.802 --> 00:11:06.035
Yeah...

00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:09.102
<i>The suspect is said to have</i>
<i>lived with several women...</i>

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.769
Normally, the Shikabane
of vicious criminals

00:11:10.802 --> 00:11:13.602
like this guy don't appear
in town all that often.

00:11:13.635 --> 00:11:15.802
Even with death row inmates,
when they become Shikabane,

00:11:15.835 --> 00:11:18.735
they're taken care of within
the prison, secretly.

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:20.302
And the whole idea
of them getting shot

00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:22.135
and killed by
the cops is rare enough

00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:23.735
that I can't recall
it ever happening.

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:27.135
Regardless, this guy
became a Shikabane.

00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:29.169
The police're hiding this.

00:11:29.202 --> 00:11:30.769
But it happened...

00:11:30.802 --> 00:11:33.835
He jumped off the 20th floor
of a building yesterday.

00:11:37.202 --> 00:11:38.869
Alive... I'm alive!

00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:40.835
I can't die!

00:11:40.869 --> 00:11:43.602
I am immortal!

00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:46.302
Shikabane are simply
corpses that reanimate,

00:11:46.335 --> 00:11:48.735
due to intense regrets
and obsessions.

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:50.402
Both local police
and the government

00:11:50.435 --> 00:11:52.435
as a whole
deny their existence.

00:11:52.469 --> 00:11:55.802
But this guy
became a Shikabane.

00:11:55.835 --> 00:11:58.602
And Shikabane kill humans.

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.535
Let's not forget that the
Shikabane of vicious criminals

00:12:00.569 --> 00:12:03.635
sometimes have odd powers.

00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:05.569
That's precisely why
we're asking you.

00:12:05.602 --> 00:12:07.669
You're the Guardian.

00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:11.235
I'll be the inspector,
as I always am.

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:13.169
And I'm on my own.

00:12:13.202 --> 00:12:14.469
That's the entire reason

00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:17.202
why we've bothered
to take in someone like you.

00:12:17.235 --> 00:12:19.702
Honda!

00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:23.802
Not like any of your
answers will change my job.

00:12:23.835 --> 00:12:27.069
I'm gonna find this guy
and I'm gonna kill him.

00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:38.885
Did you see that?
Is it a bird?

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:42.226
Mommy! Check it out!

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:45.192
Oh, my goodness!
What was that?!

00:12:47.126 --> 00:12:49.692
Who would rent you
this rickety old thing?

00:12:49.726 --> 00:12:52.326
Rent. This thing was free.

00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:54.959
You know I was watching
the news earlier...

00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:56.559
Yeah. The harem criminal.

00:12:56.592 --> 00:12:58.559
Don't worry.
He's only after women.

00:12:58.592 --> 00:13:01.426
I know.
Just be careful, will you?

00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:04.359
Director... I don't
know what to say...

00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:06.592
You've been so good to me.

00:13:06.626 --> 00:13:08.692
Stop it.

00:13:14.726 --> 00:13:18.092
Well then...
See you guys.

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:40.192
It was a woman from
Hagino's harem?

00:13:40.226 --> 00:13:42.592
Yes, I saw her enter the
building on her own

00:13:42.626 --> 00:13:45.026
a few minutes ago.

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:47.492
I guess Hagino
summoned her here.

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:49.392
The police are also
looking for her,

00:13:49.426 --> 00:13:52.459
so we should hurry before
they catch wind of this.

00:13:57.159 --> 00:14:00.392
What the hell
are you doing?!

00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:03.226
I died and then
I returned to life...

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.526
I have become a
vampire immortal...

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:09.226
the chosen god to
reign over mankind...

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:12.959
Bullshit... You're nothing
but a Shikabane.

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:18.092
But how...?!

00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:20.592
A Shikabane creating
another Shikabane...

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:24.626
I told you, my life
is now that of a vampire.

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:27.492
And these are my
faithful servants.

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:31.726
Are these women
Shikabane, too?

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:34.026
Or is he using some kind
of hypnosis on them?

00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:37.059
Maybe you want
to serve me too!

00:14:38.292 --> 00:14:42.126
Well well... You're not
human, either, are you?

00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:01.159
Makina!

00:15:11.026 --> 00:15:13.059
Dammit...

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:27.059
I gotta find
someone to help...

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.992
But what if everything I own
is stolen while I'm gone...?

00:15:56.337 --> 00:15:57.139
Could it be?

00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:00.992
She looks the same.

00:16:01.025 --> 00:16:03.859
Of course she does...

00:16:03.892 --> 00:16:05.792
Because it's her.

00:16:05.825 --> 00:16:08.825
What happened?

00:16:08.859 --> 00:16:10.225
She's dead...

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:11.759
again!

00:16:11.792 --> 00:16:14.725
But you don't feel yourself
being scared, do you?

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:17.692
Instead, you're
fascinated by her.

00:16:17.725 --> 00:16:20.025
You're unable to feel fear
when it comes to death,

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:22.892
and it scares you
that you're like this.

00:16:22.925 --> 00:16:24.725
What are you doing?

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:27.225
This is what Brother
did when I saw her last.

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:29.192
That's a corpse
you're holding.

00:16:29.225 --> 00:16:30.859
A Shikabane.

00:16:30.892 --> 00:16:33.492
I know that.
I have to try.

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:52.492
Help...

00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:02.559
me...

00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:10.959
What are you doing?

00:17:10.992 --> 00:17:13.925
Your heart wasn't
beating, so I helped.

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:15.859
Forget you saw me.

00:17:15.892 --> 00:17:17.992
Your heart's
still not beating.

00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:21.259
Knowing that... aren't you
scared in the least?

00:17:21.292 --> 00:17:23.759
Not really...
You're alive.

00:17:27.925 --> 00:17:29.959
Hey, hold on!

00:17:29.992 --> 00:17:32.059
Makina!

00:17:42.692 --> 00:17:43.992
How's your body?

00:17:44.025 --> 00:17:45.892
It got revived...

00:17:45.925 --> 00:17:48.259
and you're with me
now, so I'm good.

00:17:48.292 --> 00:17:50.959
Shirae and the others are
watching the Shikabane...

00:17:50.992 --> 00:17:52.225
Can you go?

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:53.059
Yes.

00:17:53.092 --> 00:17:54.792
Just make sure that
whatever you do,

00:17:54.825 --> 00:17:57.525
you don't attack the women.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:00.092
Shikabane can't pass
their condition on.

00:18:00.125 --> 00:18:01.992
We don't think those who
were attacked by Hagino

00:18:02.025 --> 00:18:04.059
necessarily
become Shikabane.

00:18:04.092 --> 00:18:05.859
Then, that means...

00:18:05.892 --> 00:18:07.825
They're either
hypnotized somehow,

00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:10.025
or they've admired Hagino's
charisma from the beginning

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:11.259
and fell prey to that.

00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:12.392
Of course
it's also possible

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:16.059
they convinced themselves
Hagino is an actual vampire.

00:18:16.092 --> 00:18:18.525
Either way, they're alive.

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:20.959
And I don't have the right
to kill living people.

00:18:20.992 --> 00:18:22.525
No one has that right.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:25.025
Not a living person
or a Shikabane!

00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:28.125
What about the seven corpses
found in Hagino's house?

00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:29.925
Do you think he killed
them all by himself?

00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:31.959
I'm unsure.

00:18:31.992 --> 00:18:33.159
It's possible that
he made those women

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:34.592
in the harem
kill each other.

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:36.759
But in any event,
it doesn't matter.

00:18:36.792 --> 00:18:39.925
I know, I know.
Those women are alive.

00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:42.192
And me... I'm dead.

00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:50.992
You fell from twenty floors
up and yet here you are.

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:53.259
So I was right...

00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:55.192
From time to time,
there's a corpse like you

00:18:55.225 --> 00:18:56.625
born in the world...

00:18:56.659 --> 00:18:58.659
You're dead,
but your will remains,

00:18:58.692 --> 00:19:00.825
your body functions,
and you kill humans.

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:02.925
You're called Shikabane.

00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:04.725
There's another
kind of Shikabane.

00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:07.492
With the sole purpose of
killing those like you...

00:19:07.525 --> 00:19:09.892
Out of fear,
pity, or ridicule,

00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:12.825
people like to refer
to us by one name only...

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:15.225
Shikabane Hime!

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:03.525
Didn't you tell me
not to attack them?

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:06.892
All I did was help
them evacuate safely.

00:20:06.925 --> 00:20:09.625
Come over here,
Shikabane Hime.

00:20:09.659 --> 00:20:12.592
You and I are the
same, you know that?

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:16.159
We both feast on humans
and we live forever.

00:20:17.792 --> 00:20:19.959
You and Makina
aren't the same...

00:20:19.992 --> 00:20:22.459
what an absurd statement!

00:20:39.025 --> 00:20:41.792
Wait, Makina!
It's too dangerous!

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:49.125
Dangerous?!

00:20:49.159 --> 00:20:52.459
You should know by
now, I fear nothing!

00:20:57.525 --> 00:20:59.859
There's only one way
to kill a Shikabane...

00:20:59.892 --> 00:21:02.525
You gotta destroy
the brain.

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:05.625
Look at that...
You're scared of me now.

00:21:06.659 --> 00:21:08.892
You lose!

00:21:41.025 --> 00:21:43.792
Looks like...
they had fun.

00:22:01.759 --> 00:22:03.925
I smell Shikabane...

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:11.759
[Music]

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:42.592
People have forgotten that
death lies close to them...

00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:43.925
Because if they
ever remembered it,

00:23:43.959 --> 00:23:46.792
they'd go
completely insane.

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:49.225
But soon they'll remember.

00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:52.825
