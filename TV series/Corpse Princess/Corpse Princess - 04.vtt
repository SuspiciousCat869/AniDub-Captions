Hold it right there buddy.

We know you're working
with the woman upstairs.

No, I'm not, I'm not!

Wussy boy! Wussy boy!

00:11:17.957 --> 00:11:19.357
All right, kids;
that's enough!

Stop annoying Ouri;
you know he doesn't like it.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.023
We can't have any
fun around here!

00:11:25.057 --> 00:11:26.490
So, did you find anything?

00:11:26.523 --> 00:11:29.457
Well, as
I understand it...

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.890
Mr. Hoshimura had some
connection to our temple here.

00:11:32.923 --> 00:11:34.457
What?
The Kougon Sect?

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.090
When my father died,
Mr. Hoshimura visited me

00:11:37.123 --> 00:11:38.323
after the funeral.

00:11:38.357 --> 00:11:40.590
I think he may have
been Keisei's senior?

00:11:40.623 --> 00:11:42.123
I'm not sure.

00:11:42.157 --> 00:11:44.990
But I never heard that
his house had burned down.

00:11:45.023 --> 00:11:47.557
Is there an address,
or landmark I can go by?

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.657
Why don't you ask Keisei?

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.323
Keisei...
can't know about this.

00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:41.157
The temple...

00:12:54.957 --> 00:12:56.457
Hey! What the hell!

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.957
Get her!

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.257
Keisei!

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.590
There she is!

00:13:04.623 --> 00:13:06.923
She's still alive?!

00:13:06.957 --> 00:13:08.490
Hold it!

Hey! C'mon!
Get her!

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.357
Be quiet back there!

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.057
I'm sorry for
all the trouble.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.523
We need Sojo Takamine

00:13:31.557 --> 00:13:33.190
with the prefectural
police to get involved.

00:13:33.223 --> 00:13:34.490
They can take
it from here.

00:13:34.523 --> 00:13:35.923
The prefectural?

00:13:35.957 --> 00:13:37.290
That's right. They're
the only ones allowed

00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:39.390
to know anything
about Shikabane.

00:13:39.423 --> 00:13:41.557

who most frequently deal

We're sworn to protect
and defend you, Sho-Sojo.

Yes, but it doesn't make
things any easier for you.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.123
I know how hard it must be
for you to have to attack

shot her?

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.657
Now they're saying the
hit-man was a woman?!

Kun-chan's alright.

It's true?

It was a massacre,
when we died.

When they burned my
family in the temple.

00:15:14.357 --> 00:15:16.257

A Shikabane Hime is
forbidden to kill humans.

00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:46.623

00:23:46.656 --> 00:23:49.456
his own Shikabane Hime?

00:23:49.489 --> 00:23:51.956
