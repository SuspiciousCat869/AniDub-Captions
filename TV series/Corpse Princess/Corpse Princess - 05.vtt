00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:11.566
[Music]

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.950
I'm leaving.

00:01:58.983 --> 00:02:02.917
Hold on...
I'll take you.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.083
You should probably take
that brother of yours home.

00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:07.850
Oh, no.
I'm fine.

00:02:07.883 --> 00:02:09.217
You're the one
who's hurt...

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.917
Why don't you let
him take you home?

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.483
I've already healed...

00:02:12.517 --> 00:02:15.050
I am a Shikabane after all.

00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:18.983
You two should
have a talk.

00:02:23.183 --> 00:02:24.183
Should we follow--

00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:26.517
She won't listen once
she's made up her mind.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.317
Women like
that are trouble.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.583
What are you
talking about?!

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:44.983
There's
nothing in here.

00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:48.283
So...

00:02:48.317 --> 00:02:50.850
Are you gonna tell
me everything?

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:55.350
Did I say you could
take my stuff?

00:02:57.017 --> 00:03:00.583
Well I can tell you, but
it definitely won't be cheap.

00:03:02.417 --> 00:03:04.883
1,000 for the bust alone;

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.383
2,000 more if you want
the waist and hips.

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:07.583
What?

00:03:07.617 --> 00:03:09.217
After all,
it was a lot of work

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.050
checking her
measurements you know?

00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:13.917
Who said I wanted to know
Makina's measurements?!

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.183
Who said
they were Makina's?

00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:23.017
Well if they're Zenbu Nose's,
I really don't want to know!

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.117
Now tell me!

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.383
The reason
why we fight...?

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:35.483
Maybe you
should sit down.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.550
Listen Ouri...

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:48.617
Have you ever thought about
what happens when someone dies?

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.250
Do you understand
what I'm asking?

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:57.017
There is meaning
in a persons death...

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.183
every death has the potential
to affect individuals,

00:04:00.217 --> 00:04:02.917
society, or even
the world around us.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.850
So you see, death is
by no means a bad thing.

00:04:06.883 --> 00:04:08.617
Yeah but...

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.617
I don't see why-

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.350
Listen...!
There are those...

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:14.983
Who refuse to
accept the truth.

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:17.917
They can't realize their
death has any meaning.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.150
So they cling
to their past life...

00:04:20.183 --> 00:04:23.417
holding regrets and
obsessions toward this world.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.483
Becoming monsters
called Shikabane.

00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:29.317
But how can...

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.150
Something like
that exist?

00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:32.550
There are numerous theories

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.517
as to the reason behind
the transformation...

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.883
But we still don't
have any answers.

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:42.417
The philosophy of salvation
has been passed down

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.983
through the Kougon Sect
since its founder...

00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:47.350
It states that we are to
return all Shikabane to death

00:04:47.383 --> 00:04:50.183
in order to keep
this world safe...

00:04:50.217 --> 00:04:52.417
Do you
understand, Ouri?

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.417
Yes. This my job and
none of it concerns you...

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.450
Can you do me a favor
and stay out of trouble?

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:06.117
Hey, wait up!

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.883
So all of those times
you came home injured?

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:11.317
It wasn't because of
your motorcycle, was it?

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.550
Well...

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.150
Sometimes I did
actually fall...

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:16.950
Then how can I
not be concerned?

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:20.017
Don't sit there and tell
me I shouldn't worry!

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.917
What if something horrible
were to happen to you...

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.850
What if you died.

00:05:25.883 --> 00:05:29.183
If that does happen...
Burn some incense for me.

00:05:29.217 --> 00:05:33.050
If you're gone, what's gonna
happen to the Dai Rin House?!

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.617
What are we all
supposed to do?

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.483
Think about everyone
you'd leave behind

00:05:37.517 --> 00:05:39.383
if you got
yourself killed.

00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:41.483
I'm sorry, Ouri...

00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:44.183
But quitting is out
of the question...

00:05:44.217 --> 00:05:47.017
I became a contracted
monk for Makina's sake.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.150
What?

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:52.483
You have to understand
I'm the only one she has.

00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:11.617
I think this is it...
It looks like the car.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.883
Sweet dude,
it's not beat up at all.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:18.283
Wait a minute,
so whose car is this?

00:06:18.317 --> 00:06:21.283
You don't need to worry
about it, just hop in.

00:06:21.317 --> 00:06:23.517
Please...
It'll be okay.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.883
The rumor's were true...

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.883
Keys are in the ignition.

00:06:29.017 --> 00:06:31.250
I had heard about this rental
company from a friend...

00:06:31.283 --> 00:06:33.183
They do all their business
under the table...

00:06:33.217 --> 00:06:35.050
Renting out cars to people
without a license.

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:36.517
A rental company?

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.417
So... we're paying
for this?

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.417
According to the rumor

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.883
I'm supposed to leave
the money on the dash...

00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:44.183
But I think we can all skip
that part, don't you?

00:06:44.217 --> 00:06:46.850
I'm down, why don't we
just take the car and run?

00:06:46.883 --> 00:06:50.217
Good idea, but apparently
there are consequences.

00:06:53.983 --> 00:06:55.883
That's enough!
What are you doing?!

00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:56.883
Nothing...

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:58.550
I'm not steering!

00:07:02.383 --> 00:07:05.450
What the...
is this a joke?

00:07:33.883 --> 00:07:35.550
Our Kun-chan is dead...

00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:37.217
why?!

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.450
It's not like
you knew her.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:40.417
I think she must have
been pushing herself

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.150
too hard yesterday
by trying to go on

00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:43.550
with the live
performance.

00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:46.483
Oh, she really loved her fans,
why did she have to die?!

00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:48.183
A couple of friends
were saying

00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:50.150
that she was
connected to Yakuza.

00:07:50.183 --> 00:07:52.383
You shut your face
about Kun-Chan!

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:55.083
Hey Ouri...
why are you so quiet?

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:57.483
All right...

00:07:57.517 --> 00:08:00.417
I know you deliver papers
in the morning but seriously.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.550
Settle, today
I would like your help

00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:20.517
in welcoming a new student
to our classroom.

00:08:23.317 --> 00:08:24.950
Her name is Itsuki...

00:08:24.983 --> 00:08:27.217
Yamagami.

00:08:29.017 --> 00:08:30.617
Ouri she's an angel...!

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.017
A freakin' angel
is in our classroom!

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.550
I thought you were
in love with Kun Osaki?

00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:37.117
Hey...
look over here.

00:08:48.183 --> 00:08:50.417
Ouri!

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.283
Tell me...
how did you do it?

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.150
Hey there.

00:09:02.183 --> 00:09:04.217
You're Ouri Kagami,
aren't you?

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.250
Yeah.

00:09:05.283 --> 00:09:06.950
Sorry about earlier.

00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:09.183
You remind me of a dog I used
to have a long time ago.

00:09:09.217 --> 00:09:10.850
So I waved
on accident.

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:13.350
Oh... I see.

00:09:13.383 --> 00:09:16.050
But... Maybe it was fate
that made me wave to you.

00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:18.217
What do you say
we be friends?

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.450
Sure.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.583
Why should you care...?

00:09:27.617 --> 00:09:29.217
So what if she happens
to know Ouri?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.950
It's just
unbelievable!

00:09:30.983 --> 00:09:32.450
I find it hard to believe

00:09:32.483 --> 00:09:34.850
that a girl would smile
at a guy like Ouri before...

00:09:34.883 --> 00:09:36.417
She'd smile at me!

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.517
Listen dude...
It's nothing against Ouri,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.350
I just think that
spunk is a commodity

00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:42.017
that the girls in
our class tend to lack,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.950
and when you
find a gal...

00:09:46.283 --> 00:09:49.383
Ladies, there's enough
Ushi for everyone.

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:52.583
I guess
the word is out.

00:09:52.617 --> 00:09:55.350
The new health teacher
must be starting today.

00:09:57.017 --> 00:09:58.283
You think
he's good looking?

00:09:58.317 --> 00:09:59.317
I guess
he must be.

00:10:15.617 --> 00:10:17.850
And that ends
our demonstration.

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:19.283
There may not be much
I can teach you,

00:10:19.317 --> 00:10:21.950
but I promise
to do my very best.

00:10:21.983 --> 00:10:24.083
It was nice
to meet you all.

00:10:31.014 --> 00:10:31.803
I don't understand...

00:10:32.104 --> 00:10:36.671
Are you telling me that I will
no longer be the guardian?

00:10:36.704 --> 00:10:37.771
That's not what
Sojo's saying.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.537
You're taking it
the wrong way.

00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:41.637
Look, the Kougon
Sect is well aware of

00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:43.471
how I came
to take in Ouri.

00:10:43.504 --> 00:10:45.537
That's not the... uh?

00:10:47.437 --> 00:10:49.471
Now, it was my understanding
that your brother

00:10:49.504 --> 00:10:52.704
was never to know of your
work as a contracted monk.

00:10:52.737 --> 00:10:55.637
That was the condition
we agreed on, wasn't it?

00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:56.771
It was.

00:10:56.804 --> 00:10:58.437
We'll follow the head
temple's orders

00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.137
as to how we deal
with Ouri Kagami...

00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:02.704
Got that?

00:11:02.737 --> 00:11:06.604
Until further notice, you are
to cease all duties as guardian.

00:11:06.637 --> 00:11:09.171
[Disconnect tone]

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.837
Thank you very much, Sir.

00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:14.671
Was it you,
Inspector Honda,

00:11:14.704 --> 00:11:16.871
who went through all the
trouble of letting His Grace,

00:11:16.904 --> 00:11:19.871
Gon Dai Sojo,
know about this incident?

00:11:19.904 --> 00:11:23.104
Yes. I do believe that it was
well within my jurisdiction.

00:11:23.137 --> 00:11:25.871
So tell me, do you really think
we can't trust this boy...?

00:11:25.904 --> 00:11:27.271
Honestly.

00:11:27.304 --> 00:11:29.204
I am suspicious
of everyone.

00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:32.171
It's one of the more difficult
parts of being an Inspector...

00:11:32.204 --> 00:11:33.837
No exceptions.

00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:36.637
In my personal opinion there
are times when Keisei Tagami

00:11:36.671 --> 00:11:39.871
treats his Shikabane Hime
as if she were human.

00:11:39.904 --> 00:11:41.604
Well...

00:11:41.637 --> 00:11:45.804
Makina is the only surviving
member of the Hoshimura Family.

00:11:45.837 --> 00:11:49.837
Treating defiled corpses as
human is against our philosophy.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:54.404
I see...

00:11:54.437 --> 00:11:56.737
But it could become very
dangerous if a Shikabane

00:11:56.771 --> 00:12:00.104
were to attack while
Keisei is still off duty.

00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:01.704
I'll go there
if I'm needed...

00:12:01.737 --> 00:12:03.771
I know the district isn't
too far from the head temple.

00:12:03.804 --> 00:12:06.104
I don't think it's necessary
to send the strongest

00:12:06.137 --> 00:12:08.571
of the Shikabane Hime,
do you?

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:09.804
It's taken care of...

00:12:09.837 --> 00:12:12.837
I have already spoken to Genpaku
about picking up the slack.

00:12:12.871 --> 00:12:13.704
Very well...

00:12:13.737 --> 00:12:15.804
I believe that I've
heard of him...

00:12:15.837 --> 00:12:17.204
Are you sure?

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.737
I am certain.

00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:21.337
He is the youngest to become
a contracted monk in the history

00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:23.437
of the Kougon Sect.

00:12:30.904 --> 00:12:32.671
What do you think?

00:12:32.704 --> 00:12:34.237
You know
as well as I,

00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.504
contracted monks are to tell
no one about their job,

00:12:36.537 --> 00:12:37.637
not even their family.

00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:40.637
The less people who know
of the Shikabane's existence.

00:12:40.671 --> 00:12:43.637
The better off this world
will be for it, Kamika.

00:12:43.671 --> 00:12:46.371
I don't think that's
the only thing Honda's after.

00:12:46.404 --> 00:12:47.704
I have to agree...

00:12:47.737 --> 00:12:50.104
They seem to think Keisei
has some connection

00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:51.837
to the traitor monk.

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.204
But I've already...

00:12:53.237 --> 00:12:55.437
I've already
investigated it.

00:12:55.471 --> 00:12:58.237
There are rumors about
an unlicensed rental car.

00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:00.704
And I can't find
anyone who's rented it.

00:13:00.737 --> 00:13:02.671
Well to be precise,
I can't find anyone

00:13:02.704 --> 00:13:04.804
who's still alive
after renting it.

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:07.137
Trapped by a Shikabane...

00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:09.737
But I've been ordered
not to work by the temple.

00:13:09.771 --> 00:13:11.571
Isn't it our duty
to protect...?

00:13:11.604 --> 00:13:13.604
To prevent even
a single human life

00:13:13.637 --> 00:13:15.771
from falling victim
to this world?

00:13:15.804 --> 00:13:19.437
You and I have made a
mistake by telling Ouri.

00:13:19.471 --> 00:13:21.704
The head temple is
already suspicious

00:13:21.737 --> 00:13:24.571
that he's somehow connected to
the recent Shikabane attacks.

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:25.737
Why?

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:29.404
Let it go, besides we have
plenty of time to relax now.

00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:33.204
Going for a drive?

00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:35.837
Yeah, I was asked out but...

00:13:35.871 --> 00:13:38.204
It was so sudden
and I'm kinda scared.

00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:41.504
You mean of the guy
who asked you out?

00:13:41.537 --> 00:13:44.737
He said there's this rental
car company renting out to kids.

00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:48.471
Could you come along...?
It would really mean a lot.

00:13:52.404 --> 00:13:53.437
I would...

00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:56.204
But I...
I gotta work tonight.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.304
Please Ouri...

00:14:02.637 --> 00:14:04.337
Later.

00:14:11.204 --> 00:14:13.571
Why is it you...?
Why couldn't it be me?

00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:15.637
I think I've heard of this
unlicensed car company

00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:16.871
renting out to kids.

00:14:16.904 --> 00:14:18.504
Rumor says...

00:14:18.537 --> 00:14:20.371
Anyone who rents a car from
them, ends up disappearing

00:14:20.404 --> 00:14:22.737
without a trace
of evidence.

00:14:27.904 --> 00:14:29.837
Do you think
he'll show?

00:14:29.871 --> 00:14:33.404
What man in his right mind
would turn down a girl like you?

00:14:35.737 --> 00:14:38.604
No man except
for you, right?

00:14:38.637 --> 00:14:40.771
Now that just
isn't true...

00:14:40.804 --> 00:14:42.771
Remember to be careful.

00:14:54.671 --> 00:14:56.671
Makina.

00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:09.137
A shady rental company
where people disappear...?

00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:11.504
Sounds like
Shikabane to me.

00:15:11.537 --> 00:15:15.137
Brother told me...
I shouldn't get involved.

00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:19.071
But Ouri...
You're already involved.

00:15:21.704 --> 00:15:25.071
I finished taking out the trash,
so I'm gonna head out.

00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:37.392
Oh good you came...

00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:39.974
I was so afraid
you wouldn't.

00:15:40.008 --> 00:15:42.008
Hey listen to me Itsuki...

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:43.208
Someone told me...

00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:45.741
About this rental
company and it's cars.

00:15:45.774 --> 00:15:47.674
They're involved in
some pretty shady stuff.

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.774
What are you doing here?!

00:15:59.641 --> 00:16:02.274
I knew it.

00:16:02.308 --> 00:16:04.074
You two know
each other...?

00:16:04.108 --> 00:16:07.208
Great... Why don't we all
go out for a drive together?

00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:16.608
Um, hey there,
Itsuki?

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:18.241
You do have...

00:16:18.274 --> 00:16:21.174
A driver's license
don't you?

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:23.174
Can't say
that I do.

00:16:25.008 --> 00:16:28.574
So what's up with that
guy who asked you out.

00:16:28.608 --> 00:16:29.841
The truth is I lied...

00:16:29.874 --> 00:16:33.574
I just really wanted to spend
some time getting to know you.

00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:37.808
But if...

00:16:37.841 --> 00:16:40.241
You have a girlfriend,
I guess it's a bad idea.

00:16:40.274 --> 00:16:43.141
She thinks I'm
your girlfriend?

00:16:43.174 --> 00:16:46.074
So you aren't then...?
That's good to know.

00:16:46.108 --> 00:16:47.274
Yeah...
Go right on ahead.

00:16:47.308 --> 00:16:48.974
I'm not gonna
put up a fight.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:51.808
Very funny!

00:16:51.841 --> 00:16:53.208
Why are you here?

00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:54.941
I figured I'd
see you again...

00:16:54.974 --> 00:16:57.741
As long as I kept
following strange events.

00:16:57.774 --> 00:16:59.674
Thought you were told
to stay out of it?

00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:00.908
I can't just
stay out of it.

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:03.674
Not as long as my
brother's in danger.

00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:07.574
Don't you get it?
You're a liability.

00:17:07.608 --> 00:17:09.308
Your presence here puts your
brother in more danger

00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:10.941
than you fail
to realize...

00:17:10.974 --> 00:17:13.741
If you really want to help,
don't get involved.

00:17:13.774 --> 00:17:16.108
I hope you know he
became a contracted monk

00:17:16.141 --> 00:17:18.274
for your sake
and not his own.

00:17:19.808 --> 00:17:21.641
Hey, Itsuki,
watch out!

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:23.808
You're going a little fast,
don't you think? Slow down.

00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:27.874
But... I'm not the one in
control of the wheel anymore.

00:17:27.908 --> 00:17:30.674
What about the breaks?

00:17:30.708 --> 00:17:32.541
It's not working.

00:17:49.708 --> 00:17:51.674
One Passenger?

00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:54.208
What in the world is this?

00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.908
It wants us
to kill each other?

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:57.541
What're you
talking about?

00:17:57.574 --> 00:17:59.074
That's what it wants,
isn't it?

00:17:59.108 --> 00:18:00.808
We kill each other here.

00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:02.574
It won't stop until there's
only one of us left,

00:18:02.608 --> 00:18:04.074
that person lives.

00:18:04.108 --> 00:18:05.741
We'll find
another way out.

00:18:05.774 --> 00:18:07.941
No. We won't...

00:18:07.974 --> 00:18:09.874
I don't want to die.

00:18:09.908 --> 00:18:11.708
Regrets!

00:18:11.741 --> 00:18:13.908
If people were forced
to kill each other...

00:18:13.941 --> 00:18:16.274
They would most likely leave
this world with regret.

00:18:16.308 --> 00:18:18.541
So a person who
dies in this car,

00:18:18.574 --> 00:18:20.608
has a greater chance
of becoming a Shikabane.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:23.641
Then... the car was made
to create Shikabane?

00:18:23.674 --> 00:18:25.208
What are you saying...?

00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:28.774
There's, no other way
out of this car.

00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:30.108
Makina, wait!

00:18:30.141 --> 00:18:32.741
That's not fair.

00:18:32.774 --> 00:18:35.274
Humans tend to struggle more
when they don't wanna die...

00:18:35.308 --> 00:18:36.941
Like it or not,
it's gonna happen...

00:18:36.974 --> 00:18:38.741
Remember that!

00:18:42.908 --> 00:18:45.774
Quite an impressive disguise,
you've been hiding behind...

00:18:45.808 --> 00:18:48.741
but it's not them who will
be doing the killing tonight.

00:18:48.774 --> 00:18:50.008
It'll be me.

00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:52.208
Time to die,
Shikabane.

00:19:09.874 --> 00:19:10.941
Makina!

00:19:10.974 --> 00:19:12.974
You get out too!

00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:41.741
Tell me does your friend
always look so angry

00:19:41.774 --> 00:19:44.141
or is this just one
of those nights?

00:19:47.274 --> 00:19:51.308
Do you see him too...?
What's the matter?

00:19:51.341 --> 00:19:53.841
Ouri...
Stay away from him.

00:19:53.874 --> 00:19:55.274
Now, now...

00:19:55.308 --> 00:19:58.641
I don't appreciate having
my conversation interrupted.

00:20:00.108 --> 00:20:02.074
Tell me
who you are.

00:20:02.108 --> 00:20:04.274
Aren't we
the curious one...?

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:06.274
They call me
the traitor monk...

00:20:06.308 --> 00:20:08.274
I turned my back
on the Kougon Sect...

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:09.241
My time
is now spent

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:11.541
destroying all the
pathetic little puppets

00:20:11.574 --> 00:20:14.041
they've created to
protect themselves.

00:20:14.074 --> 00:20:17.174
Do you mean...
The Shikabane Hime?

00:20:17.208 --> 00:20:19.841
I must admit
I'm curious...

00:20:19.874 --> 00:20:21.808
do you know what
they truly are?

00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:24.774
They're the...

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:28.241
Good Shikabane.

00:20:28.274 --> 00:20:31.274
They kill other
Shikabane for a humans sake...

00:20:31.308 --> 00:20:33.908
And that makes them
the good Shikabane?

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.774
Let me enlighten you...

00:20:35.808 --> 00:20:39.074
They fight only
to fulfill a contract.

00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:43.608
If they succeed in
destroying 108 Shikabane...

00:20:43.641 --> 00:20:46.274
they can make it
into heaven.

00:20:46.308 --> 00:20:49.274
Into heaven?

00:20:49.308 --> 00:20:51.874
Shikabane Hime are those
who became Shikabane

00:20:51.908 --> 00:20:54.641
without ever wishing it
upon themselves.

00:20:54.674 --> 00:20:57.074
They quite simply don't
know how to die...

00:20:57.108 --> 00:20:58.541
And the Kougan
sect uses them

00:20:58.574 --> 00:21:01.941
as if they were nothing
more... than puppets.

00:21:06.074 --> 00:21:09.008
Itsuki,
you're all right!

00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:10.708
So...

00:21:10.741 --> 00:21:13.874
It was you who was trying to
make Shikabane this entire time?

00:21:13.908 --> 00:21:16.974
I create Shikabane.

00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:19.008
This is just the first
of many necessary steps

00:21:19.041 --> 00:21:20.741
if I'm to
achieve my goal.

00:21:20.774 --> 00:21:22.974
I don't give a damn
about your goal...

00:21:23.008 --> 00:21:24.841
C'mon!!!

00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:34.708
Itsuki, no...
You too?

00:21:34.741 --> 00:21:36.674
You see now
don't you...?

00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:38.741
They're given a false life
for making a contract

00:21:38.774 --> 00:21:40.908
with the Kougon Sect,
agreeing to destroy

00:21:40.941 --> 00:21:43.741
one-hundred and eight Shikabane
for there own entry to Heaven!

00:21:43.774 --> 00:21:46.508
She murders her own kind.

00:21:57.141 --> 00:22:00.308
I am Takamasa Sougi,
Genpaku.

00:22:00.341 --> 00:22:04.508
I am a contracted monk...
Don't move!

[Music]

00:23:39.274 --> 00:23:41.208
You start running...

00:23:41.241 --> 00:23:44.241
With the belief that
something good lies ahead.

00:23:44.274 --> 00:23:46.541
But don't fool
yourself...

00:23:46.574 --> 00:23:49.708
You're about to find
a new kind of despair

00:23:49.741 --> 00:23:52.574
"At the End of
the Dangerous Run."
