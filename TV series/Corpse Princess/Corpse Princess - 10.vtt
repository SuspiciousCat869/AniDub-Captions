[Music]

00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:45.983
Please bless this food.

00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:53.267
What are you saying?

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:56.422
You don't really think
I'd give you bad food?

00:01:56.455 --> 00:01:58.088
Both the miso
and seaweed were...

00:01:58.122 --> 00:02:00.455
Is that Ouri?
I wanna talk!

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:01.388
<i>But the taste</i>
<i>just isn't right...!</i>

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:03.355
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it should be this salty.</i>

00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:04.955
Salty...?

00:02:04.988 --> 00:02:07.055
Um... Ouri...

00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:09.422
You rinsed off
the seaweed, didn't you?

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:11.322
Rinsed off?

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:12.922
But...
I thought...

00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:15.955
Isn't this the same stuff
Brother used to use?

00:02:15.988 --> 00:02:19.922
Yes, and Keisei always rinsed
the excess salt off first.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:22.788
He actually paid attention
to things like that?

00:02:22.822 --> 00:02:24.855
Well, not originally,
I'll admit,

00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:29.122
but once you came here to stay,
he most certainly did.

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:32.988
You know, you really haven't
come by to visit for a while...

00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:34.455
Hey,Hanagami...!

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.788
Who are you trying to kid,
you can't cook!

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.488
Says you!

00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:41.488
Did you and Keisei
have a fight?

00:02:41.522 --> 00:02:44.388
I don't want you to fight,
it's not nice!

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:47.322
I, uh... I know,
you're right...

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:55.822
Senior Tagami, please!

00:02:55.855 --> 00:02:57.422
You can't just
walk out...

00:02:57.455 --> 00:02:59.355
They- They haven't
finished your tests.

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.155
Please get back in bed!

00:03:01.188 --> 00:03:03.088
That old man stuck me in here
without even bothering to listen

00:03:03.122 --> 00:03:04.355
to my side
of the story!

00:03:04.388 --> 00:03:07.288
Would you please...
cut it out!

00:03:07.322 --> 00:03:09.422
Eh? What's that...?
"Saki,...

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:10.988
Will you do
that again?"...

00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:11.988
Got it!

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:14.322
No, Saki,
I said no such thing!

00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:16.755
What is all
this fuss about?

00:03:16.788 --> 00:03:18.855
Shikabane Hime Minai...

00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:20.322
An Inspector went through
the appropriate channels

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:22.222
in dealing with Minai.

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:27.422
My little brother must
have seen what happened.

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:29.755
No harm was done
to your brother.

00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:32.788
Your idea of harm might
differ from mine...

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:35.222
None of this is making
any sense to me...

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:36.788
How could an
inspector have...

00:03:36.822 --> 00:03:38.355
Makina and the others
didn't have enough time

00:03:38.388 --> 00:03:39.788
to locate her...

00:03:39.822 --> 00:03:42.088
Who could have gotten
to Minai so quickly?

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:47.155
I see you don't have
an answer for me then...

00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:49.988
Well, perhaps I'll
find someone who does.

00:03:57.355 --> 00:03:58.388
How could he get
so worked up

00:03:58.422 --> 00:04:00.822
about his stupid
brother like that?

00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:03.388
I'm so jealous!

00:04:03.422 --> 00:04:05.522
Hey... She
did it, not me...

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:07.988
I wouldn't have said
something like that!

00:04:11.322 --> 00:04:12.488
Please, Guardian!

00:04:12.522 --> 00:04:13.522
It's not allowed!

00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:14.788
You must go back!

00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:17.155
Please!

00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:18.488
Guardian Tagami...

00:04:18.522 --> 00:04:21.088
You are interrupting
His Grace, Gon-Dai-Sojo.

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:22.322
I'm aware of that.

00:04:22.355 --> 00:04:24.322
I beg your pardon,
Your Grace...

00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:25.955
But there was a
Shikabane Hime

00:04:25.988 --> 00:04:28.455
who was killed by
an inspector the other day...

00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:30.222
It is not permitted,
Guardian...

00:04:30.255 --> 00:04:32.988
To speak of defiled
ones before His Grace.

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:35.222
Defiled,
you call them...?

00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:38.755
I think
I must disagree...

00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:40.755
I am aware that you
of the Shujou faction

00:04:40.788 --> 00:04:42.155
tend to think
of them that way...

00:04:42.188 --> 00:04:43.922
However...

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:46.455
for the Kougon Sect they
are absolutely essential...

00:04:46.488 --> 00:04:48.522
the very instrument
of our philosophy!

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:50.255
Guardian Tagami!

00:04:50.288 --> 00:04:53.388
Gon-Dai-Sojo...
Minai was-...

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:56.522
You should probably
stop right there...

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:58.455
Sho-Sojo Tagami.

00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:03.022
I cannot oppose
a Shikabane Hime.

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:09.255
It's...
The D ai-Sojo...

00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:11.388
He is here.

00:05:17.288 --> 00:05:21.155
The Kougon Sect's number one and
number two are here together.

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:23.822
Dai-Sojo was meditating
close by here...

00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:25.455
You have disturbed him!

00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:35.988
Sho-Sojo Tagami...
Your work...

00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:38.455
as a Guardian...
is appreciated.

00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:40.855
Know that Sho-Sojo Isaki...

00:05:40.888 --> 00:05:44.255
And his Shikabane Hime
will never be forgotten...

00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:45.855
Tell me this...

00:05:45.888 --> 00:05:47.188
Wasn't it your
younger brother

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:50.788
who led Minai right into
the hands of the Inspector?

00:05:53.488 --> 00:05:55.922
Yes, it is true,
Your Grace.

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:57.988
Peace be with you.

00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:11.055
Ahhhhhh!

00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:13.288
You're looking a lot
less pale than before...

00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:14.288
Ouri.

00:06:14.322 --> 00:06:15.955
Is that right?

00:06:15.988 --> 00:06:17.522
Did something
good happen?

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:20.955
No, something totally
AWESOME happened...

00:06:20.988 --> 00:06:22.488
Isn't that right,
Ouri!

00:06:22.522 --> 00:06:24.155
I don't know
what you mean.

00:06:24.188 --> 00:06:26.488
Ouri!

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:28.288
Breast Goddess!

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:29.755
Nozomi...

00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:32.022
I really need
to ask you something...

00:06:32.055 --> 00:06:33.122
Got a minute?

00:06:33.155 --> 00:06:35.022
Sure.

00:06:38.855 --> 00:06:40.355
What's going on...?

00:06:40.388 --> 00:06:43.055
Are you and Ouri
dating or something?

00:06:43.088 --> 00:06:46.022
No, we're not.

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:49.988
I thought everyone knew that
Ouri was in love with Makina.

00:06:50.022 --> 00:06:50.888
What...?
No, I...

00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:52.488
With Makina?

00:06:52.522 --> 00:06:54.955
Really? First time
we've heard about that.

00:06:54.988 --> 00:06:56.855
I can't stand it,
I can't stand it!!

00:06:56.888 --> 00:06:58.822
How are
you doing this?!

00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:00.755
You must be releasing special
pheromones or something

00:07:00.788 --> 00:07:02.188
to attract
all these women!

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:03.255
That's it,
isn't it?

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:04.422
Some secret cologne?

00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:05.422
Where'd you get it?!

00:07:05.455 --> 00:07:06.355
Mail order?
Internet?

00:07:06.388 --> 00:07:09.155
Free sample in the back
of some magazine?

00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:11.122
Ouri!
Come back here!

00:07:11.155 --> 00:07:13.188
I have to know!!

00:07:17.955 --> 00:07:20.288
Here it is.
Look at this.

00:07:27.422 --> 00:07:29.822
I hear that this is really
becoming a popular religion

00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:32.922
with a lot of celebrities
and rich people.

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:35.222
Ahhh... You know magazines...
they'll print anything.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:36.955
You should really
read this article.

00:07:36.988 --> 00:07:39.022
I think
you'd like it.

00:07:39.055 --> 00:07:42.155
"Devout followers witness
this extraordinary ritual,

00:07:42.188 --> 00:07:44.055
in which a young monk
walks deliberately

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:46.855
into the center
of a raging inferno."

00:07:46.888 --> 00:07:49.288
"Flames completely
engulf the monk's body...

00:07:49.322 --> 00:07:52.122
Though it seems impossible
for him to survive...

00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:54.288
In a matter of minutes
his burns disappear...

00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:56.788
And he stands
alive and unhurt."

00:07:56.822 --> 00:07:58.988
"Founder Ooyatsuka
calls this...

00:07:59.022 --> 00:08:02.022
'the Power
of Immortality."

00:08:02.055 --> 00:08:04.188
Dying, and then
coming back to life...

00:08:04.222 --> 00:08:06.755
Doesn't that
sound like Makina?

00:08:07.555 --> 00:08:09.055
Shikabane...

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:10.088
What?

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.155
Uh... nothing...

00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:13.122
Why are you
showing me this?

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:15.788
If I could join
this religion...

00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:18.288
They might have a way
to make me just like Makina...

00:08:18.322 --> 00:08:19.888
Right?

00:08:21.088 --> 00:08:23.922
Hey, Ouri...
Wanna join them with me?

00:08:23.955 --> 00:08:25.388
Join them...?

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.355
You're not
serious, are you?

00:08:27.388 --> 00:08:30.788
Somehow I thought you
might understand... Guess not.

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:32.788
Why don't you
forget about her...?

00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:34.255
Let it go and move on.

00:08:34.288 --> 00:08:36.055
I know I should...

00:08:36.088 --> 00:08:39.455
But I...
I can't do it.

00:08:39.488 --> 00:08:42.155
No one seems to want
to talk about this stuff...

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.822
That life doesn't last,
we could all die tomorrow.

00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:48.788
When I think about all
of these strange things...

00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:51.955
I can't seem to stop myself
from wondering about Makina.

00:08:53.488 --> 00:08:56.355
I wouldn't worry...
If you ask me...

00:08:56.388 --> 00:08:59.188
I think you're way
too beautiful to die, Nozomi!

00:09:04.555 --> 00:09:06.955
Damn you, Ouri!

00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:09.455
He's having a good time
with Breast Goddess...!

00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:11.922
I'm so jealous!

00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:20.235
I can't stop thinking
about that article...

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:22.435
What if Ooyatsuka's religion
really did find a way

00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:24.469
to save Shikabane...?

00:09:24.502 --> 00:09:26.069
Maybe it's something
that the Kougon Sect

00:09:26.102 --> 00:09:28.169
just doesn't know about...

00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:30.769
It could save Makina
and all the others.

00:09:31.969 --> 00:09:34.135
Um, Mr. Sougi?

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:43.102
I'm sorry I caused
problems for you, Genpaku.

00:09:43.135 --> 00:09:46.369
I must admit I did
enjoy school life.

00:09:47.969 --> 00:09:50.435
You've been released from your
temporary Guardian assignment.

00:09:50.469 --> 00:09:51.869
Where will you go?

00:09:51.902 --> 00:09:54.402
I'm thinking about
going to Mount Goryo.

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:56.102
Goryo?

00:09:56.135 --> 00:09:58.335
Up in the Kougon
mountains?

00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:01.169
Monks have trained there
for hundreds of years...

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:04.035
And now I would like
to retrain myself...

00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:07.302
I need to work on perfecting
my own zadan technique.

00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:11.035
I guess great minds
really do think alike.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.269
Aren't those
zadan scrolls?

00:10:13.302 --> 00:10:16.369
I stole them from old
man Takamine's office...

00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:18.135
But being that I've never
been seriously trained

00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:20.169
in the zadan technique...

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:22.335
It'll just be a quick fix.

00:10:22.369 --> 00:10:25.735
Then... You think the
traitor monk will show up again?

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:27.869
I think this mass
outbreak of Shikabane

00:10:27.902 --> 00:10:31.002
is only the beginning...
Don't you?

00:10:33.202 --> 00:10:35.202
Don't you want to see
Ouri before you leave?

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:38.302
No... I'm going to the
cafe where he works.

00:10:38.335 --> 00:10:39.435
A cafe?

00:10:39.469 --> 00:10:43.035
Ouri told Makina that he
tried to hide Minai someplace.

00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:44.135
I don't think
he could have known

00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:48.035
that many other places
besides the CafÃ© Parthenon.

00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:49.802
Some place the Inspector
was able to reach

00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:51.369
before anyone else...

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:55.102
The Inspector had probably been
watching Ouri for some time.

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.302
Where is she?!

00:11:10.335 --> 00:11:12.269
There's supposed
to be a daughter.

00:11:12.302 --> 00:11:13.435
Where did she go?!

00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:15.769
We can't find her!

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:45.135
We found her!

00:11:45.169 --> 00:11:47.169
Please...!

00:12:29.502 --> 00:12:31.902
Beautiful Life...

00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:34.302
Eternal Life...

00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:37.269
It radiates
like this fire...

00:12:37.302 --> 00:12:40.802
And yet it can
never be consumed.

00:12:46.035 --> 00:12:49.135
Isn't it beautiful...?
Not scary at all.

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:51.035
There, you see?

00:12:56.902 --> 00:12:59.102
A beautiful life is
the true miracle...

00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:02.035
Even more precious
than gold.

00:13:06.169 --> 00:13:07.735
Gold!

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:10.969
The Founder's sweat
turned into gold!

00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:16.235
Isn't it wonderful...?

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:19.969
You'll live for eternity...
and be rich forever.

00:13:20.002 --> 00:13:22.069
If you were to
become a member...

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:25.102
One day soon you would feel
that same kind of power!

00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:27.769
You do want to join,
don't you?

00:13:27.802 --> 00:13:31.469
Ahhh... could I meet
the Founder before I decide?

00:13:31.502 --> 00:13:34.869
Oh, the Founder rarely
appears in person,

00:13:34.902 --> 00:13:36.469
but if you join,
of course...

00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:39.035
Oh, yes! If you
become a member...

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.835
Uh... I'll have
to think about it.

00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:53.069
Interesting little
religion you've got here...

00:13:53.102 --> 00:13:55.302
Seems familiar somehow...

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.702
Shikabane...
You can burn them...

00:13:57.735 --> 00:14:00.269
beat them to death...
and they come right back.

00:14:00.302 --> 00:14:02.902
That's pretty handy for
an immortality cult...

00:14:02.935 --> 00:14:05.169
Pretty lucrative as well.

00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:07.269
Poor little puppet.

00:14:09.402 --> 00:14:12.369
The show is over.

00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:16.435
Fire...!
Flame high!!

00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:19.302
Trees!
Trees take them!!

00:14:23.435 --> 00:14:25.735
It's a curse,
isn't it?

00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:30.902
Fools...! You thought
I was a mere human...?

00:14:30.935 --> 00:14:34.002
I am a Shikabane...!
And I have a curse

00:14:34.035 --> 00:14:37.935
that causes anything
I say to come true instantly!

00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:39.835
It was the perfect
choice for me,

00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:41.469
since I never
said anything true

00:14:41.502 --> 00:14:43.902
while I was still
among the living.

00:14:43.935 --> 00:14:46.069
Your obsession is
with words, huh...?

00:14:46.102 --> 00:14:47.769
Fascinating.

00:14:47.802 --> 00:14:49.302
I see...

00:14:49.335 --> 00:14:52.035
Your curse must be how you've
been controlling this Shikabane.

00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:54.769
I am well aware of
who you people are...

00:14:54.802 --> 00:14:56.935
You're with the
Kougon Sect...

00:14:56.969 --> 00:14:58.035
Don't you realize

00:14:58.069 --> 00:15:00.369
that Shikabane are the
earthly equivalent of gods,

00:15:00.402 --> 00:15:02.202
humans don't
even come close!

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.335
[Laughter]

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:04.935
What's so amusing?

00:15:04.969 --> 00:15:07.035
He thinks we're
the Kougon Sect!

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:10.802
I can't say for certain that
the Shikabane are gods...

00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:13.169
but I do know
they're made for killing,

00:15:13.202 --> 00:15:16.269
for following the obsessions
they had when they were alive.

00:15:16.302 --> 00:15:19.202
I also know that pretending to
be human in order to make money

00:15:19.235 --> 00:15:20.802
is the ultimate folly.

00:15:20.835 --> 00:15:22.135
Not to mention
that you would take

00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:25.035
another Shikabane's
freedom away from them.

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:26.735
Who are you?

00:15:38.614 --> 00:15:40.752
It just... Wasn't what
I thought it would be...

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.723
So vulgar somehow...

00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:47.657
Do you think there are
any Shikabane here?

00:16:10.723 --> 00:16:11.957
Now die!

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.823
By the power of my curse
I'm commanding you!

00:16:14.857 --> 00:16:16.757
Be dead!!

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.723
Such a pity...
Since we're already dead...

00:16:19.757 --> 00:16:21.790
that command is
rather useless!

00:16:21.823 --> 00:16:24.790
All of you are...
Shikabane?

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.123
Well that
was overkill...

00:16:48.157 --> 00:16:50.023
It was necessary.

00:16:50.057 --> 00:16:53.423
If we're going to make our name
known and feared once again,

00:16:53.457 --> 00:16:55.390
people must know
that Shikabane

00:16:55.423 --> 00:16:58.390
are more than just regrets
and obsessions ...

00:16:58.423 --> 00:17:02.157
that indeed,
we are Death itself.

00:17:19.823 --> 00:17:22.123
Hello?
Anyone there...?

00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:23.890
I'm a relative
of Ouri Kagami.

00:17:23.923 --> 00:17:26.090
He works
at this cafe.

00:17:26.123 --> 00:17:28.790
Sorry, pal...
We're not open.

00:17:32.157 --> 00:17:35.690
Your voice...
I believe I recognize it...

00:17:37.157 --> 00:17:41.290
I was under the impression that
you'd gone missing overseas.

00:17:41.323 --> 00:17:43.290
I said we're closed.

00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:45.423
It is you, isn't it...?

00:17:45.457 --> 00:17:48.190
Please listen to me...

00:17:48.223 --> 00:17:51.990
When I became a Contracted
Monk, I swore two sacred oaths.

00:17:52.023 --> 00:17:54.290
One was to dedicate my life
to fighting evil

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:56.890
at the side of a
Shikabane Hime...

00:17:56.923 --> 00:17:58.757
And the other...

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.190
Was to keep my brother
Ouri far, far away

00:18:01.223 --> 00:18:04.690
from the work I had
chosen for myself...

00:18:04.723 --> 00:18:07.223
I know now that they
contradict one another.

00:18:09.723 --> 00:18:11.390
Even so... Maybe?

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.223
I'll keep it in mind.

00:18:15.257 --> 00:18:17.690
Thank you.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.257
Wasn't that...
Keisei Tagami?

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.290
Start packing up.

00:18:27.323 --> 00:18:28.857
What?

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.357
Contracted monks aren't
supposed to know about us.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.990
Remember? It's time
for us to go.

00:18:35.023 --> 00:18:38.257
Awww! Just when things were
getting pretty interesting.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.190
High time if you ask me.

00:18:40.223 --> 00:18:42.057
We still have to find
that traitor monk.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.857
Oh... What should we
do about our employee?

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.023
We have no choice...

00:18:46.057 --> 00:18:49.357
The kid just worked without
pay this week, that's all.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.190
Cheapskate.

00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:13.757
What a pleasant surprise.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.290
To think that you would
appear before us...

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:18.223
Better yet...

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:20.290
That you would
appear before me.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.757
So tell us...

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.190
What do we get in return
if we sign on with you, monk?

00:19:26.223 --> 00:19:27.890
You're Shikabane...

00:19:27.923 --> 00:19:31.757
Acting on your desires is all
that you know how to do...

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.323
However... There are those that
would deny their true nature.

00:19:35.357 --> 00:19:38.023
You mean Shikabane Hime,
don't you?

00:19:38.057 --> 00:19:39.790
Precisely...

00:19:39.823 --> 00:19:43.690
I desire to erase every last
one of them from this world!

00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:46.857
Well... I think we might be
able to come to an arrangement

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.090
as long as we can agree
to annihilate the Kougon Sect...

00:19:50.123 --> 00:19:51.857
We'll join you.

00:19:54.223 --> 00:19:56.090
This here is Hokuto...

00:19:56.123 --> 00:19:58.957
The brightest sun
of the Seven Stars.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.857
I thought you were the leader
of the Seven Stars, Hazama.

00:20:03.923 --> 00:20:08.357
The Seven Stars only exist
to allow her light to shine...

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.023
Hokuto is Shikabane itself,

00:20:11.057 --> 00:20:14.257
and the very embodiment
of the world's nature.

00:20:15.323 --> 00:20:17.290
Hokuto...

00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:24.157
So you went
to work today and...

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.990
It was freakin' closed...!

00:20:26.023 --> 00:20:26.890
They just closed the place

00:20:26.923 --> 00:20:28.857
without saying a
freakin' word to me...!

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.423
And I was supposed to get
freakin' paid today!

00:20:31.457 --> 00:20:33.957
How unfair...!

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.823
Here, you need
some more.

00:20:35.857 --> 00:20:37.990
[Phone ringing]

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.123
Oh... Yes, the Order
of Eternal Life Research.

00:20:43.157 --> 00:20:46.057
We knew that Founder
Ooyatsuka was a Shikabane...

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.223
but under pressure from
a certain political party,

00:20:48.257 --> 00:20:51.123
we'd done nothing so far
but keep an eye on them...

00:20:51.157 --> 00:20:52.957
but now...

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.290
Who did it?

00:20:54.323 --> 00:20:56.723
It was seven Shikabane.

00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:59.290
The security cameras
captured them perfectly.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.357
Seven Shikabane...

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.723
Are you saying...

00:21:05.757 --> 00:21:07.823
it was the Seven Stars?

00:21:12.757 --> 00:21:13.923
I call her arms!

00:21:13.957 --> 00:21:16.323
Legs!

00:21:16.357 --> 00:21:18.990
Please! Why are
you doing this?

00:21:19.023 --> 00:21:21.323
I haven't done
anything to you!

00:21:21.357 --> 00:21:23.857
Please don't hurt me!

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.790
Please don't hurt me!!

00:21:24.823 --> 00:21:28.290
How ungraceful...
daughter of Hoshimura...!

00:21:28.323 --> 00:21:31.457
What a poor little
pathetic human...!

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.423
I'm afraid this is
the end of the line!

00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:04.357
Seven Stars...

00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:14.023
[Music]

00:23:38.823 --> 00:23:41.123
Happy Birthday, Ouri...

00:23:41.157 --> 00:23:43.790
I have a wonderful
birthday present for you...

00:23:43.823 --> 00:23:45.923
It's a story...

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:48.690
But it's also
a very sad story...

00:23:48.723 --> 00:23:50.957
a story all about
what happened...

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.323
"One Night."
