[Music]

[Panting]

00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:07.270
Why are you just
sitting there, Minai?!

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.470
It's your job
to destroy the Shikabane!

00:02:11.504 --> 00:02:14.204
As Deputy Guardian,
I demand you carry out your job

00:02:14.237 --> 00:02:16.337
as Shikabane Hime!

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.104
If I allow a Shikabane Hime

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.804
in the process of regenerating
her body to assist us,

00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:23.470
then Guardian Tagami
will have my hide.

00:02:23.504 --> 00:02:26.937
Besides... all your actions
here are forbidden...

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.437
a Shikabane Hime cannot
destroy a Shikabane

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.937
without her contracted
monk present.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.404
Minai...

00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:36.137
There's no way you can hold
your own against that thing!

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.504
Don't do it!

00:02:37.537 --> 00:02:38.770
If I can break
his concentration,

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:42.437
I can take him down before he
has a chance to use the curse.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.237
And I'm not doing this
because I was ordered to.

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:14.470
Minai!

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.270
You're just a monster...
but I am justice...

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:27.404
Do you hear me...?
I am justice!

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:30.037
It's time to die!!

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.137
Mitsu... Yoshi?

00:03:35.237 --> 00:03:37.004
Mitsuyoshi,
are you there?

00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:39.137
I had no idea you knew Ouri,
but thank goodness you do.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.237
I'm so relieved.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.437
How are you?

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.437
You know I've been reading
your blog lately

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.870
and it got me
kinda worried.

00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:47.804
You need to answer your phone
once in a while, mister.

00:03:47.837 --> 00:03:49.870
At least for your friends.

00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:52.437
Sho Men!

00:04:00.904 --> 00:04:02.804
Sumitori...

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.070
Hello?

00:04:13.104 --> 00:04:15.370
Mitsuyoshi,
can you hear me?

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:17.270
Are you practicing
kendo anymore?

00:04:17.304 --> 00:04:19.204
You should.
You were good at it.

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:21.237
It's been too long, man,

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.037
why don't we get together and
check out the new Kendo Dojo?

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.237
Sumitori...

00:04:41.037 --> 00:04:43.104
Are you even there?

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:45.470
Mitsuyoshi,
can you hear me?

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:46.470
Guess not.

00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:48.737
Ouri?
Our--...

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.937
Sumi...
I'm sorry.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.870
If you don't wanna feel
the way you're feeling...

00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:57.470
you shouldn't get involved
in the first place.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.770
Are you okay,
Minai?!

00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:06.037
He acts like you two
are long lost friends.

00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:13.170
Minai...
we're going back...!

00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:16.304
Right now!

00:05:16.337 --> 00:05:18.237
I'm gonna be fine...

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.270
And I think I'm done with
considering the wounds

00:05:20.304 --> 00:05:21.804
on my body as punishment.

00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:23.004
Punishment?

00:05:23.037 --> 00:05:26.204
I'm not human...
I'm Shikabane Hime...

00:05:26.237 --> 00:05:28.070
I know now
why I fight...

00:05:28.104 --> 00:05:30.204
Even if it means that
I could get injured...

00:05:30.237 --> 00:05:31.370
I promise that
I will do everything

00:05:31.404 --> 00:05:33.770
I can to protect people.

00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:36.170
I... I can do this...

00:05:36.204 --> 00:05:39.704
I can take pride in myself
even though I'm not human.

00:06:00.937 --> 00:06:03.104
Thanks for coming
all this way.

00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:04.370
Don't even mention it...

00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:06.270
I hope your wounds
are healing properly.

00:06:06.304 --> 00:06:10.104
And also... if you need anything
at all, don't hesita-...

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:12.437
And if you didn't know it,
bending over and licking my feet

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.437
will heal
you up just fine.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.904
Would you stop talking
like a streetwalker?!

00:06:16.937 --> 00:06:17.970
If that's how
you want it,

00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:20.304
then I'll keep all of your
true feelings to myself.

00:06:20.337 --> 00:06:23.237
Those are certainly
not my true feelings!

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.937
Senior, what do you
think you're doing?!

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.237
Self healing...

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.804
I'm in pretty
bad shape, you know.

00:06:28.837 --> 00:06:31.004
Go on, let the poor
guy lick your feet.

00:06:31.037 --> 00:06:31.937
Thank you very much.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.770
Would you stop that?!

00:06:33.804 --> 00:06:38.270
It's disgusting and you're
really creeping me out!

00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:40.070
Sorry for serving
what you brought,

00:06:40.104 --> 00:06:41.237
but this is
all we have.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.737
I knew you didn't
have anything here,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.504
so I picked out
what I wanted to eat.

00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:48.104
I reported the traitor monk's
case to old man Takamine.

00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:49.837
It's his
decision now...

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.404
I'm assuming that you came
here for the other case today.

00:06:52.437 --> 00:06:53.470
That's right...

00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:55.737
And I wanted to talk to
you about your brother.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.204
He's just been sticking his
nose where it doesn't belong.

00:06:58.237 --> 00:07:00.170
He's your brother,
why don't you just have him play

00:07:00.204 --> 00:07:02.237
'follow the leader' and
join you in the Kougon Sect

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.337
as another contracted monk?

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.070
It could be fun for you.

00:07:05.104 --> 00:07:07.937
Minai could work with him after
she cuts her bond with Isaki.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.370
No...
I won't do it...

00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:14.170
I can't let him get
any closer to our side.

00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:15.270
Nice idea...

00:07:15.304 --> 00:07:18.870
But you're a contracted
monk attached to Makina...

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:21.270
Keeping him away will be hard
with your attention divided.

00:07:21.304 --> 00:07:24.370
True. But I've
made up my mind.

00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:26.337
I'm going to keep my
promise to Makina...

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.037
But what I won't do...

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.304
is allow Ouri any closer...

00:07:30.337 --> 00:07:32.504
They're both important to me
and that's the best I can do.

00:07:32.537 --> 00:07:34.470
Sure...
Mr. Cool Sunglasses

00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:36.304
Indoors guy
has some feelings...!

00:07:36.337 --> 00:07:38.737
More like, you screw up
again and you're toast...

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.904
At least that's
what you told me...

00:07:39.937 --> 00:07:42.037
Right, Rika?

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.104
She's crazy! I didn't
say anything like that!

00:07:46.404 --> 00:07:49.170
Ouri!

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:51.170
You never told me what happened
with you and Mitsuyoshi.

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.237
Oh, yeah...
But... it's...

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.337
a little hard to
explain right now.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.870
Any word on how
he's doing?

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.204
Gotta run... I'll fill you
in the next time I see you!

00:08:07.804 --> 00:08:09.104
I guess you will...

00:08:09.137 --> 00:08:12.204
I just hope
Mitsuyoshi is okay.

00:08:15.237 --> 00:08:16.904
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

00:08:16.937 --> 00:08:18.770
Because you accessed
that Shikabane blog

00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:20.137
using your cell phone...

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.770
I'm going to have
to confiscate it

00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:23.437
as evidence in a
Shikabane case file.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.470
Isn't that an
inspector's job? .

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:28.170
I mean, why did you come all
the way here by yourself?

00:08:28.204 --> 00:08:30.337
I thought it was
an urgent matter...

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.804
I also had some business
to attend to in the area.

00:08:35.904 --> 00:08:38.237
I really don't mind
you taking my phone...

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.037
but I'm out of luck if I need
to call or text someone.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.204
Don't worry. We'll
get you a new one.

00:08:43.237 --> 00:08:44.437
I'll even pay for it.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.204
If it's okay with you,
of course.

00:08:46.237 --> 00:08:48.070
See you after school?

00:08:52.437 --> 00:08:54.937
Hey, Ouri!

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.004
Can I help you,
Mr. Sougi?

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.737
I don't say this
as your teacher...

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.170
but as a colleague of
your brother, Keisei.

00:09:01.204 --> 00:09:02.870
I probably don't need
to tell you this,

00:09:02.904 --> 00:09:05.370
but Shikabane Hime are
not human in any way...

00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:09.770
No matter how cute they may
seem, they're dead flesh.

00:09:09.804 --> 00:09:11.504
You didn't have
to put it like that.

00:09:11.537 --> 00:09:17.104
[Phone ringing]

00:09:17.137 --> 00:09:21.004
Dammit, Minai,
where are you?

00:09:21.037 --> 00:09:22.037
[Phone ringing]

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.070
I'm not like
those others!

00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:28.704
[Phone ringing]

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.070
Ah...!

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.070
Stop!

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.237
It's you!
I remember you!

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.704
Let me go!

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.070
It's all yours now.
The new one works fine...

00:10:03.104 --> 00:10:05.370
Thanks for coming here
to get me a new one.

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.104
Sure.

00:10:07.137 --> 00:10:09.104
What about you?
Do you have a cell phone?

00:10:09.137 --> 00:10:10.337
Of course...

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.970
I have to use it to keep in
touch with my contracted monk.

00:10:13.004 --> 00:10:15.870
You think you could
give me your number?

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.204
It's just... Makina isn't
the easiest person to talk to,

00:10:21.237 --> 00:10:24.170
especially when it comes
to my brother, you know?

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.237
I think that'd be great.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.304
Do you want to put it
into your new phone?

00:10:51.437 --> 00:10:53.170
Minai!

00:11:00.504 --> 00:11:04.270
Minai...
What's wrong with you?

00:11:04.304 --> 00:11:07.004
What is it?

00:11:07.037 --> 00:11:08.870
Please tell me
you're okay.

00:11:08.904 --> 00:11:11.337
I can't...
Can't be...

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.737
But I am...

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:24.912
So it's true.

00:11:24.945 --> 00:11:27.845
Inspector Honda has just
arrived at the site.

00:11:29.312 --> 00:11:31.312
He confirmed
that this afternoon

00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:33.512
Shuuji Isaki has
passed this life.

00:11:33.545 --> 00:11:37.245
He's joining the other holy
monks in the spirit realm.

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.445
The witnesses said
that he was arguing

00:11:39.479 --> 00:11:42.112
with two young men around
this area earlier today...

00:11:42.145 --> 00:11:44.779
Then he showed up
here stabbed to death.

00:11:47.312 --> 00:11:50.879
There are bad
people everywhere.

00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:53.079
No matter who asks,
we're classifying this death

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.545
as 'in the line of duty.'

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:56.312
Now bring in
the burial cloth.

00:11:56.345 --> 00:11:58.045
Yes, sir.

00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:02.545
So, where's
Isaki's puppet?

00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:03.545
Puppet?

00:12:03.579 --> 00:12:06.245
His Shikabane Hime.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.179
She shouldn't have
been too far away.

00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:19.012
Saki?

00:12:19.045 --> 00:12:21.179
Itsuki's coming...
and I'm sure he'll be alone.

00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:22.279
Alone?

00:12:22.312 --> 00:12:23.512
We can't show anyone...

00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:26.845
what the two of us
are about to do...

00:12:28.445 --> 00:12:30.912
Contracted monks are tied
to their Shikabane Hime

00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:32.079
through a bond
stronger than those

00:12:32.112 --> 00:12:34.145
you know in the
physical world...

00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:36.512
and a contracted monk's death
directly leads to the death

00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:38.312
of his Shikabane Hime.

00:12:38.345 --> 00:12:40.012
However,
if that doesn't happen

00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:43.045
and she continues to live
on past the monk's death,

00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:46.079
she becomes just
another Shikabane.

00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:49.279
That's why...
on this day...

00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:52.979
Shikabane Hime must
kill one of their own.

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:54.279
Makina!

00:12:54.312 --> 00:12:55.579
No time like
the present...

00:12:55.612 --> 00:12:58.212
A Shikabane Hime
is about to die.

00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:11.179
Why?

00:13:11.212 --> 00:13:14.012
Minai, slow down.
What's going on with you?!

00:13:14.045 --> 00:13:16.045
Just tell me what's the matter.
You can talk to me!

00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:17.945
Shut up!

00:13:21.212 --> 00:13:22.479
Oh, Ouri...

00:13:22.512 --> 00:13:23.479
I'm sorry...

00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:24.479
I'm sorry...

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:25.579
Minai...
I'm sorry...

00:13:25.612 --> 00:13:26.812
Don't worry about it...

00:13:26.845 --> 00:13:27.812
It's okay.

00:13:27.845 --> 00:13:29.479
No, it's not!

00:13:45.412 --> 00:13:46.479
Stop...!
You might think

00:13:46.512 --> 00:13:49.812
I'm nothing more than
an irritating 10 year old...

00:13:49.845 --> 00:13:52.979
But... my contracted
monk is Rika Aragami,

00:13:53.012 --> 00:13:55.945
a member of the
Great Holy Families!

00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:01.279
Descendants of the ten
senior disciples...

00:14:01.312 --> 00:14:03.279
are obligated to become
con-tracted monks

00:14:03.312 --> 00:14:06.012
to Shikabane Hime.

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:08.879
No Shikabane Hime
can beat me!

00:14:08.912 --> 00:14:10.279
Please, no...

00:14:12.512 --> 00:14:13.912
You know it.

00:14:13.945 --> 00:14:15.579
You felt it
when it happened.

00:14:15.612 --> 00:14:18.379
Your contracted
monk is dead!

00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:22.879
It's true... They said
it was an accident.

00:14:22.912 --> 00:14:24.312
Well, Minai...

00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:27.112
You followed up murdering
somebody by killing yourself.

00:14:27.145 --> 00:14:29.012
You thought your job
as a Shikabane Hime

00:14:29.045 --> 00:14:30.979
was a way of atoning
for your sins.

00:14:31.012 --> 00:14:33.179
But it's over now!

00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:52.212
How'd she stop it?!

00:14:52.245 --> 00:14:55.545
Why are the Shikabane
Hime fighting each other?

00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:59.079
Whenever a contracted monk dies,
the bond is severed...

00:14:59.112 --> 00:15:01.312
Unless his
Shikabane Hime dies...

00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:04.945
She becomes...
just another Shikabane.

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:10.279
I don't wanna die... please.
Are you stupid...?!

00:15:10.312 --> 00:15:12.512
We're not alive.
We're already dead!

00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:15.945
But he thanked me...
He thanked me!

00:15:17.512 --> 00:15:19.779
So thank you.

00:15:24.045 --> 00:15:26.045
I thought what I was
doing was just atonement.

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:28.212
But things are
different now.

00:15:28.245 --> 00:15:31.379
I'm changed, and I understand
now that being a Shikabane Hime

00:15:31.412 --> 00:15:33.079
wasn't punishment.

00:15:33.112 --> 00:15:35.545
And I wasn't some
kind of monster!

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:38.412
I can save people...
I can help!

00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:40.345
I've never felt
this way before.

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:44.312
But I finally figured out what
it is I'm supposed to do...

00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:46.912
Shut... up!!

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:05.945
I can't do it.

00:16:13.945 --> 00:16:15.979
We're getting
out of here!

00:16:16.012 --> 00:16:18.345
No, Ouri...! Minai is
already a Shikabane!

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:21.579
There's nothing
you can do!

00:16:21.612 --> 00:16:23.879
Come on!

00:16:23.912 --> 00:16:25.479
Ouri, stop!

00:16:25.512 --> 00:16:27.912
He's such a jackass!

00:16:33.412 --> 00:16:35.412
Makina...

00:16:40.151 --> 00:16:42.717
I mean the Shikabane Hime
are mostly just a shield

00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.317
for contracted monks.

00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:48.117
So they're usually dead
well before the monks croak.

00:16:49.684 --> 00:16:51.884
Sounds like one hell
of a crappy life.

00:16:51.917 --> 00:16:54.684
I suppose things like this
happen every once in a while.

00:16:54.717 --> 00:16:56.751
But I gotta say,
I think it's the first time

00:16:56.784 --> 00:16:59.684
I've heard of a monk
being killed by punks.

00:17:02.084 --> 00:17:04.151
We don't have
to go, do we?

00:17:04.184 --> 00:17:05.651
They're not our targets.

00:17:05.684 --> 00:17:07.051
If we run into
them by accident,

00:17:07.084 --> 00:17:10.017
in town or something,
we'll do what we have to do.

00:17:10.051 --> 00:17:12.151
But honestly, I want
to stay out of this mess

00:17:12.184 --> 00:17:14.151
as much as possible.

00:17:15.984 --> 00:17:19.084
I couldn't agree
with you more.

00:17:19.117 --> 00:17:20.151
Sorry, guys...

00:17:20.184 --> 00:17:22.051
but I was wondering
if my friend could stay here

00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:23.284
for a little while...

00:17:23.317 --> 00:17:24.917
like until later tonight?

00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:27.151
She won't bother you.

00:17:29.684 --> 00:17:31.251
They're not the nicest
people in the world,

00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:33.851
but I think
you'll be safe here.

00:17:41.084 --> 00:17:43.184
Where's Minai?

00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:49.051
I don't think so!

00:17:50.617 --> 00:17:52.017
You've hid her,
now what...?

00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:54.117
You gonna be her
decoy forever...?

00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:55.751
What a hero.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.151
I don't get it...

00:17:57.184 --> 00:17:59.351
Why do you have
to kill her?

00:17:59.384 --> 00:18:01.684
Because a Shikabane Hime
who lost her monk...

00:18:01.717 --> 00:18:03.151
Is just a Shikabane.

00:18:03.184 --> 00:18:05.017
Are you sure...?

00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:06.784
Because she said she
wanted to help people.

00:18:06.817 --> 00:18:09.651
You think that's her
acting righteous...?!

00:18:09.684 --> 00:18:13.051
It's an obsession
driving the Shikabane.

00:18:13.084 --> 00:18:14.884
If she wants
to help people...

00:18:14.917 --> 00:18:17.351
She's already
exhibiting regret...

00:18:17.384 --> 00:18:19.151
This is what a
Shikabane does, Ouri.

00:18:19.184 --> 00:18:20.717
They obsess...

00:18:20.751 --> 00:18:22.951
Like it or not, Minai
isn't someone worth saving.

00:18:22.984 --> 00:18:24.251
Do you understand?

00:18:24.284 --> 00:18:25.817
I just don't think
that's right.

00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:28.151
There's no right or
wrong to any of this...

00:18:28.184 --> 00:18:30.117
If she's obsessed
with anything...

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.017
she's no different
from a Shikabane.

00:18:33.051 --> 00:18:35.317
Now where is she?

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.051
You should probably know
that Shikabane Hime

00:18:40.084 --> 00:18:42.051
can sense
their own kind...

00:18:42.084 --> 00:18:44.251
we'll find her
sooner or later...

00:18:44.284 --> 00:18:46.851
So it's no use
hiding her.

00:18:54.284 --> 00:18:55.884
Why does it
matter to you?!

00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:57.817
What are you
fighting for?!

00:18:57.851 --> 00:18:59.784
You don't have a reason,
do you...?!

00:18:59.817 --> 00:19:03.051
I know...
But at least Minai does...

00:19:08.084 --> 00:19:10.251
I didn't know that
you knew about us.

00:19:10.284 --> 00:19:12.317
Just a little.

00:19:16.284 --> 00:19:17.751
They're secret
and imperfect,

00:19:17.784 --> 00:19:20.817
but the Kougon Sect
has a few ideas on this...

00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:24.251
The chance of success
is small but we can try.

00:19:24.284 --> 00:19:27.217
First thing we gotta do is
find a monk to replace Isaki.

00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:29.017
And we have to do
that like now...

00:19:29.051 --> 00:19:30.951
If you can sever the
bond you have with him...

00:19:30.984 --> 00:19:32.017
And tie
as strong a bond

00:19:32.051 --> 00:19:34.351
to whoever we find
to replace him...

00:19:34.384 --> 00:19:38.017
we might be able to keep
you as a Shikabane Hime.

00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:39.651
The big question is

00:19:39.684 --> 00:19:41.984
"can you find this kind of
contracted monk in time?"...

00:19:42.017 --> 00:19:43.717
One who already
has a certain level

00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:46.251
of spiritual ties
to this plane...

00:19:46.284 --> 00:19:48.117
Who already
has ties to you.

00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:50.684
Ouri is Keisei's brother,
why not him...?

00:19:50.717 --> 00:19:53.651
I mean I've never seen the kid
more worried about anything...

00:19:53.684 --> 00:19:55.851
so he's already connecting
to you in the way you'd want.

00:19:55.884 --> 00:19:57.017
No...!
He's just a kid!

00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:59.684
He isn't even in
the Kougon Sect.

00:19:59.717 --> 00:20:01.684
I know that, but I can skip
that whole process

00:20:01.717 --> 00:20:04.884
if I mediate the contract
between them myself.

00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:12.217
Thank you...
Thank you so very much.

00:20:12.251 --> 00:20:13.817
Yo, Ouri.
Check this out.

00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:14.851
It's just crazy, man!

00:20:14.884 --> 00:20:16.051
What happened?

00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:18.017
Someone said that a monk
was stabbed to death

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.984
in that parking lot
over there...

00:20:20.017 --> 00:20:23.251
They also said the killers
are the same age as us.

00:20:23.284 --> 00:20:24.784
Sumi thinks he might've
went to middle school

00:20:24.817 --> 00:20:27.051
with a couple
of those guys.

00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:29.317
A monk was
stabbed...

00:20:29.351 --> 00:20:30.884
Oh, no...

00:20:35.117 --> 00:20:36.817
Ouri!
Chill, man!

00:20:36.851 --> 00:20:37.851
What's your
freaking deal?!

00:20:37.884 --> 00:20:38.651
Cut it out!

00:20:38.684 --> 00:20:40.751
Ouri?!

00:20:45.184 --> 00:20:49.884
I am... the Shikabane Hime
of Shuuji Isaki.

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:51.617
Well done...

00:20:51.651 --> 00:20:53.251
Did you sustain
any injuries?

00:20:53.284 --> 00:20:54.117
Not at all.

00:20:54.151 --> 00:20:56.984
Then I guess,
we can transfer her now.

00:21:00.317 --> 00:21:03.117
Hold up... What about
the burial cloth?

00:21:03.151 --> 00:21:05.817
The cloth is for monks above
the Gon-Sho-Sojo level

00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:08.251
or those who died in
the line of duty...

00:21:08.284 --> 00:21:09.984
So, of course,
we didn't bring one.

00:21:10.017 --> 00:21:12.151
But she died in the
line of duty, right?

00:21:12.184 --> 00:21:14.817
And for the sake
of the doctrine.

00:21:19.651 --> 00:21:22.051
You actually brought
one with you?

00:21:22.084 --> 00:21:24.751
Yes... Senior Tagami said
the same thing earlier,

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.251
so I thought I
should be prepared.

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:27.984
Alright...

00:21:34.951 --> 00:21:36.751
She might've survived
if you'd have made Ouri

00:21:36.784 --> 00:21:40.684
her contracted monk like
you said you would...

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:44.684
She didn't have to be loyal
to Isaki to the death.

00:21:44.717 --> 00:21:54.751
[Phone ringing]

00:21:54.751 --> 00:22:06.617
[Phone ringing]

00:22:08.851 --> 00:22:13.851
[Music]

00:23:40.317 --> 00:23:42.617
Suddenly, you want
to die for no reason.

00:23:42.651 --> 00:23:45.184
Time will stop forever.
Because youth is beauty.

00:23:45.217 --> 00:23:48.084
And once you become an
adult, you're defiled.

00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:52.084
"Set Your Heart Aflutter."
