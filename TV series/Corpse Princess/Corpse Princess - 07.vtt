00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:11.566
[Music]

00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:54.456
[Laughter]

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:55.160
Stop distracting me!

00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:57.659
What're you doing?

00:01:57.693 --> 00:01:58.959
You play that stupid game,
it annoys everyone around you.

00:01:58.993 --> 00:01:59.959
Including me.

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:01.859
Whatever!

00:02:01.893 --> 00:02:03.759
You're such a pain,
dude. Seriously.

00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:05.893
I'm a pain?
Okay then, give it to me!

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:07.059
Shut up!

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.359
Hey!
Huh?

00:02:08.393 --> 00:02:10.959
Dude,
I'm so bored.

00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:14.393
Then you'll just have to
see me later, sweetheart.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:25.059
What the hell
stinks so bad?

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.626
Get the hell away
from me, man!

00:02:51.093 --> 00:02:53.459
Walk much...?
What's your deal, bro?

00:02:57.426 --> 00:03:01.026
Hey... Don't I know you
from somewhere?

00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:05.059
What's funny?!

00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:07.359
Transform!

00:03:56.826 --> 00:03:59.326
How is Senior
Tagami doing?

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.893
From what I've heard,
he's unable to move at all.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.026
Its capabilities as a catalyst
have been greatly increased,

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:18.859
just as
you asked for.

00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:20.026
Thank you
very much...

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.426
for doing this yourself,
Gon-Sojo Aragami.

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.926
I'm sure you can
understand your request

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:28.393
for a new catalyst
has raised my suspicions.

00:04:28.426 --> 00:04:29.926
My intention is...

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:32.826
to open my zadan
in the next battle.

00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:35.993
Itsuki and
Senior Tagami...

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:39.493
were injured because of me
and my lack of experience.

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:45.726
Senior Tagami destroyed
the traitor monk's catalyst

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.926
and in doing so,
received its curse...

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.726
This concerns me.

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.693
Isaki shall be assigned
as the deputy Guardian

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:52.693
in that district.

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:53.959
However,
we will continue

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:56.693
to have Sho Sojo Sougi
work there as well.

00:04:56.726 --> 00:04:58.759
At least
for the time being.

00:04:58.793 --> 00:05:00.526
Very well,
Takamine...

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.993
His Grace, the Dai-Sojo shares
my opinion on this matter.

00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:07.359
According to witnesses,
Gon Dai Sojo...

00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:09.893
Akasha was defeated
by a sniper unknown to us...

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:13.526
And we're having difficulty
identifying who they are.

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.559
For many years now, rumors and
whispers have circulated...

00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:18.493
It is believed that
within the Kougon Sect,

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:21.759
there are those that not only
kill Shikabane, but humans, too.

00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:23.693
Regardless of what
you've heard...

00:05:23.726 --> 00:05:26.726
Our teachings don't
include killing people.

00:05:32.393 --> 00:05:36.326
It happened...
five years ago.

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:40.359
One day, a group led by a
powerful Shikabane appeared.

00:05:40.393 --> 00:05:44.493
This resulted in the formation
of a suppression unit.

00:05:44.526 --> 00:05:46.893
Akasha was
in that unit.

00:05:49.826 --> 00:05:53.326
All who knew of them believed
that they were impeccable.

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:55.493
However, this all changed when
the unit was suddenly unable

00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:57.326
to be reached.

00:06:01.893 --> 00:06:04.026
Along with an
inspection team,

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.993
additional contracted monks
rushed there in quite a hurry.

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:09.859
They weren't prepared
for what they witnessed.

00:06:12.693 --> 00:06:14.793
Every contracted monk
had been annihilated,

00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:16.759
as well as
their Shikabane Hime,

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.593
with one exception.

00:06:19.626 --> 00:06:22.359
His Shikabane Hime
had been torn in two.

00:06:22.393 --> 00:06:25.326
He stood there, just
holding her body together.

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:27.759
Carrying the depths
of hell in his eyes,

00:06:27.793 --> 00:06:30.759
Akasha was
the soul survivor.

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:41.593
Even after investigating,
we still couldn't figure out

00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:42.926
what the hell
had happened.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.693
Before I knew it,
I was forced to resign

00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:47.393
from the inspection team.

00:06:47.426 --> 00:06:48.926
However...

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:54.426
A week later...

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:56.859
while he was in the process
of restoring her body,

00:06:56.893 --> 00:06:59.759
he killed his own
Shikabane Hime.

00:06:59.793 --> 00:07:01.759
Many monks were
killed that night.

00:07:01.793 --> 00:07:05.826
Akasha also stole secret ritual
scriptures before he ran off.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:08.593
When I found out...
I wasn't really...

00:07:08.626 --> 00:07:11.726
shocked by the any of it,
strangely enough.

00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:15.326
Are you telling me you
sympathize with a man

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:17.793
who murdered his
Shikabane Hime?

00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:26.926
[Phone ringing]

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:29.326
Hello.
This is Parthenon.

00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:30.693
Hey there,
boss...

00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:32.493
Oh, hey, Ouri.
What's going on?

00:07:32.526 --> 00:07:33.893
I hate to do this to you,

00:07:33.926 --> 00:07:35.359
but my brother
has the flu or something.

00:07:35.393 --> 00:07:36.793
Would it be cool
if I took the day off

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:37.926
so I could
take care of him?

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.859
I don't see why not.
Its not like we have customers.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.026
No problem.

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:44.893
I hope that your brother's
injuries aren't too serious.

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.026
Something wrong?
Are you okay?

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:49.693
Everything is fine.

00:07:49.726 --> 00:07:51.726
Tell your brother
to get well soon.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.559
[Disconnect tone]

00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:55.626
I don't think I told him
that Brother got hurt.

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:57.559
Did somebody
get hurt, Ouri?

00:07:57.593 --> 00:07:59.659
Uh... yeah,
Brother did.

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:02.393
Anyway, what is this thing
you wanted to show me?

00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:05.559
Good job,
Einstein.

00:08:05.593 --> 00:08:07.726
Out of all the places,
the ribs?!

00:08:09.426 --> 00:08:10.393
A blog?

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:11.393
Yeah.

00:08:11.426 --> 00:08:12.659
In middle school,

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:15.926
the both of us were in
the kendo club together.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:18.026
You got hurt again?

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:21.926
Oh, yeah... I fell off my
bike doing my paper route.

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:28.326
So... is this page loaded up,
the blog you're talking about?

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:29.693
Uh... yeah.

00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:31.426
In the middle
of 8th grade,

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:33.559
he just started blowing off
assignments and then he just...

00:08:33.593 --> 00:08:34.726
stopped showing up.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:35.726
He ditched?

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:37.026
There was this 9th grader

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.559
who teased the crap out
of the lower graders.

00:08:39.593 --> 00:08:40.759
I see...

00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:50.626
Well... This looks
more like an epic poem...

00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:51.959
Than a blog.

00:08:51.993 --> 00:08:53.926
He used to just talk
about playing video games

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:56.426
and watching shows before.

00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:57.559
But now,
he's completely obsessed

00:08:57.593 --> 00:08:59.826
with constantly
updating it.

00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:02.659
Here's where all this
starts to get weird.

00:09:02.693 --> 00:09:04.826
"My birth"...

00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:07.859
"It's just natural that those
in school and the kendo club,

00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:09.693
as well as my parents
and relatives,

00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:11.926
couldn't understand me."

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:13.559
"Now that things
have come to this,

00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:16.593
I can't help but
feel pity for them."

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:19.393
"They did not get chosen."

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:23.093
"I will use this power
to better the world."

00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:24.626
The other day,

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:27.059
one of the seniors in our
kendo club passed away.

00:09:27.093 --> 00:09:30.059
What...? It was the bully you
were talking about, wasn't it?

00:09:30.093 --> 00:09:32.093
I heard that he
was run-over by a train...

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:35.359
But I'm sure that was
just a coincidence.

00:09:35.393 --> 00:09:38.859
I called... Mitsuyoshi a couple
of times to tell him about it...

00:09:38.893 --> 00:09:41.359
but nobody answered.

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:44.626
Why are you telling me...
about all of this stuff?

00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:48.059
Ouri... do you remember
when Inuhiko was telling us

00:09:48.093 --> 00:09:49.726
about Shikabane?

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.793
According to the rumors,
a person that dies,

00:09:51.826 --> 00:09:55.059
but can't move on will become
a monster called a Shikabane.

00:09:55.093 --> 00:09:56.993
From what I can tell,
it's just an urban legend.

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:58.959
But have you ever heard
of something like that?

00:09:58.993 --> 00:10:00.559
Can't say that I have...

00:10:00.593 --> 00:10:03.759
You should just give
it a rest, sounds dumb.

00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:04.826
You're right.

00:10:04.859 --> 00:10:08.626
Besides, there's no way
Mitsuyoshi could be dead.

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:19.006
From what it sounds like,
the guy writing the blog

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.839
got killed by some
sort of electric shock

00:10:20.873 --> 00:10:22.973
and became a Shikabane.

00:10:23.006 --> 00:10:25.906
But he hasn't realized
that he's different yet.

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:29.039
Why are you lying
to those around you?

00:10:30.939 --> 00:10:32.439
I lied...

00:10:32.473 --> 00:10:35.739
About my injury...
and Shikabane...

00:10:35.773 --> 00:10:38.139
I lied in the same way
that Brother did to me.

00:10:38.173 --> 00:10:40.339
But I only did it
to protect Sumitori.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:43.806
Perhaps he's not the only
one that needs protecting.

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:46.873
I know to leave the Shikabane
to Brother and Makina,

00:10:46.906 --> 00:10:50.473
that's what
they're here to do.

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:52.339
I can't help them
in any way.

00:10:52.373 --> 00:10:54.306
There's nothing for me.

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:07.139
I know what you
said is true.

00:11:07.173 --> 00:11:09.006
Keisei is being dragged
into something

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:11.373
that has nothing
to do with him.

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:17.173
It's too late
to change things.

00:11:17.206 --> 00:11:19.206
Is this all because you
want to get into heaven

00:11:19.239 --> 00:11:21.306
or is it something else?

00:11:25.239 --> 00:11:28.039
I'm not sure what all
Keisei has told you...

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.773
But I'm looking for the
Shikabane responsible

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:37.139
for the death
of my family.

00:11:37.173 --> 00:11:40.406
My reason for being is simply
to kill those that killed me.

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:46.339
So don't get
the wrong idea.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:49.173
We're not heroes or
champions out for justice!

00:11:49.206 --> 00:11:51.873
Keep following me
around and you'll die.

00:11:57.439 --> 00:11:59.806
And Keisei will die, too.

00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:04.273
There's just...

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:10.173
I've been meaning to ask you
this particular question.

00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:13.739
Are you and my brother,
uh... well...

00:12:13.773 --> 00:12:15.273
are you two dating?

00:12:17.973 --> 00:12:20.906
Wow, I was not
expecting that.

00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:25.939
Makina definitely isn't one for
holding back when she's upset.

00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:27.873
I couldn't have talked
about that blog right now.

00:12:27.906 --> 00:12:30.173
Not with everything
else going on.

00:12:52.073 --> 00:12:54.906
Are you dead?

00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:01.906
Mitsuyoshi?

00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:04.006
Now that you mention it,
I think I've seen him.

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:06.139
I haven't seen you.
You interested, baby?

00:13:06.173 --> 00:13:08.439
No... I want information
on Mitsuyoshi.

00:13:08.473 --> 00:13:11.006
You don't seem
sure about that.

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.306
What is it, monk?

00:13:12.339 --> 00:13:14.239
Looking for your
collection plate, dude?

00:13:17.373 --> 00:13:19.306
You lousy simpletons.
How dare you!

00:13:19.339 --> 00:13:21.106
Bastard!

00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:25.406
Isaki! Be careful,
it's dangerous.

00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:27.373
Don't give me an order.

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:29.173
Let them live
their idle lives,

00:13:29.206 --> 00:13:32.006
while we continue
to surpass them.

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:42.239
Isaki...

00:13:42.273 --> 00:13:43.239
It's Deputy Guardian.

00:13:43.273 --> 00:13:44.439
What?

00:13:44.473 --> 00:13:46.073
Until Senior Tagami
has recovered,

00:13:46.106 --> 00:13:48.906
I am acting
as the Deputy Guardian.

00:13:48.939 --> 00:13:51.406
Understand? This is
my chance to be promoted.

00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:54.373
Deputy Guardian... Yes.

00:14:02.473 --> 00:14:04.939
You taste sweet.

00:14:06.873 --> 00:14:10.106
Some idiot left a comment
in Mitsuyoshi's blog.

00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:13.373
Destroying the Shikabane should
be easier than we thought.

00:14:13.406 --> 00:14:16.673
We will need to kill at
least three more this month.

00:14:23.373 --> 00:14:26.139
What did you mean?

00:14:29.973 --> 00:14:32.006
I wasn't sure you'd show.

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:35.739
You're Mitsuyoshi, right?

00:14:38.939 --> 00:14:41.906
Why did you ask
me if I am dead?

00:14:43.439 --> 00:14:46.473
No one else will
show up, we're alone.

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:48.073
I'm not trying
to cause any trouble,

00:14:48.106 --> 00:14:50.339
but I need you
to listen to me.

00:14:54.373 --> 00:14:56.173
If I'm not
mistaken, he's-...

00:14:56.206 --> 00:14:57.773
Senior Tagami's brother.

00:14:57.806 --> 00:15:00.206
He can't stay off our radar
and out of our business.

00:15:00.239 --> 00:15:02.806
The head temple still hasn't
cleared their suspicion of him.

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:05.173
This is a good opportunity to
see how things will play out.

00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:07.039
But he...

00:15:10.373 --> 00:15:13.039
You know Sumitori...
don't you?

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:18.073
Sumi... tori...

00:15:18.106 --> 00:15:19.739
He talks to me...

00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:21.773
He's really
worried about you...

00:15:21.806 --> 00:15:23.173
Because...

00:15:23.206 --> 00:15:24.873
Of all the strange things
you've written on your blog.

00:15:24.906 --> 00:15:26.939
There's no way he
would worry about me.

00:15:26.973 --> 00:15:28.206
Sumitori wasn't
any different.

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:31.306
He ignored me like
all the others did.

00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:33.673
No, Mitsuyoshi.

00:15:37.306 --> 00:15:38.873
You said...

00:15:38.906 --> 00:15:42.273
that you were a hero, if you
were telling the truth...

00:15:42.306 --> 00:15:43.739
There has to be
another way for you

00:15:43.773 --> 00:15:47.473
to carry out
what needs to be done.

00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:57.739
[Screaming]

00:15:57.773 --> 00:15:58.739
Mitsuyoshi!

00:15:58.773 --> 00:16:00.173
I...

00:16:00.206 --> 00:16:01.839
I... I...

00:16:01.873 --> 00:16:02.906
Mitsuyoshi!

00:16:02.939 --> 00:16:04.773
Transform!

00:16:06.373 --> 00:16:08.406
Shikabane!

00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:15.806
And who do we have here?

00:16:17.073 --> 00:16:20.106
I kill corpses whose regrets
keep them from dying.

00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:22.106
I'm Shikabane Hime!

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:23.773
You, too?

00:16:27.939 --> 00:16:31.273
So in other words,
you're pure evil.

00:16:31.306 --> 00:16:32.973
Evil?

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:37.973
I'm not... what you
call a Shikabane.

00:16:38.006 --> 00:16:39.739
I gained this new life

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:41.939
and became a hero in order
to do what is necessary.

00:16:41.973 --> 00:16:43.306
Minai!

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:44.339
What are you doing?!

00:16:44.373 --> 00:16:47.073
Hurry and
attack it already!

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:49.239
Yes, Deputy Guardian.

00:16:49.273 --> 00:16:51.339
I will not forgive evil.

00:16:51.373 --> 00:16:54.073
I will not forgive those
who make people suffer.

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:57.073
And you dare turn your
fist toward me in anger...

00:16:57.106 --> 00:16:58.073
Evil!

00:16:58.106 --> 00:16:59.473
The Shikabane...

00:16:59.506 --> 00:17:02.839
Are contrary to all that
is good in the world!

00:17:02.873 --> 00:17:06.773
I am different...
I am justice!

00:17:15.373 --> 00:17:16.543
Minai!

00:17:20.744 --> 00:17:22.439
He must be cursed.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.187
Cursed?

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.020
When he became
a Shikabane,

00:17:27.054 --> 00:17:29.120
his body wasn't the
only thing that changed.

00:17:29.154 --> 00:17:31.420
His curse functions beyond
the laws of physics.

00:17:31.454 --> 00:17:33.154
This is proving to be...

00:17:33.187 --> 00:17:36.320
More difficult than I
originally thought it would.

00:17:36.354 --> 00:17:39.154
The two of you know...
My brother?

00:17:39.187 --> 00:17:40.554
Out of my way.

00:17:40.587 --> 00:17:41.620
What's the matter, Minai?

00:17:41.654 --> 00:17:42.987
Please give her a minute!

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.120
She's taken on
a lot of damage.

00:17:44.154 --> 00:17:45.254
At the rate she's
going, she could...

00:17:45.287 --> 00:17:46.587
Silence!

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.254
If you had just kept his
attention long enough,

00:17:48.287 --> 00:17:50.220
she would have killed
him with one hit...

00:17:50.254 --> 00:17:52.320
Damn layman!

00:17:52.354 --> 00:17:53.487
Get up, Minai!

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.254
Please!

00:18:20.354 --> 00:18:22.120
What's the matter...?

00:18:22.154 --> 00:18:24.387
Why don't you attack me?

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.987
Not a single one
of your attacks

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.020
has even the
slightest effect on me!

00:18:29.054 --> 00:18:33.087
I am immortal!
You are pure evil!

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.654
That's it!

00:18:34.687 --> 00:18:37.187
Cursed or not,
I'll kill him!

00:18:48.487 --> 00:18:50.287
I think I understand.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.420
He can return all the
damage to the same place

00:18:52.454 --> 00:18:54.287
on his attacker's body.

00:18:56.387 --> 00:18:58.420
So that's the curse!

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.454
Minai!

00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:16.554
Don't get
the wrong idea.

00:19:16.587 --> 00:19:19.154
We're not heroes or
champions out for justice!

00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:22.454
Keep following me around...
And you'll die.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.454
That was reckless, Ouri.

00:19:46.687 --> 00:19:47.887
Please stay out of sight.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.320
Try and hide in
here for a while.

00:19:50.354 --> 00:19:51.954
Isaki and I...

00:19:51.987 --> 00:19:53.920
We'll take care
of everything.

00:19:53.954 --> 00:19:56.487
Why do you listen
to someone like him?

00:19:59.054 --> 00:20:01.987
Because this is how my
atonement is achieved.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.887
What?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.587
Before I died...

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.454
I murdered someone
close to me.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.220
I was going to die
with him...

00:20:16.254 --> 00:20:17.454
But to my surprise...

00:20:17.487 --> 00:20:20.554
I didn't die...
I couldn't.

00:20:24.054 --> 00:20:25.320
That's why
I have been sentenced

00:20:25.354 --> 00:20:27.287
to live this
hollow existence.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.387
You think being a Shikabane
Hime is a punishment?

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.987
What that Shikabane
said could be the truth.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.187
Maybe he's
really justice...

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.454
And we are the evil
ones here after all...

00:20:40.487 --> 00:20:42.220
I don't believe that...

00:20:42.254 --> 00:20:44.487
No way.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.120
That guy tried to use
me as a decoy...

00:20:47.154 --> 00:20:48.320
But you rescued me.

00:20:48.354 --> 00:20:52.354
Well I couldn't just stand
there and watch you get hurt.

00:20:52.387 --> 00:20:54.387
So thank you.

00:20:58.087 --> 00:21:00.487
Hiding is pointless.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.454

Makina!

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.954
Since I'm missing
my right arm,

00:21:22.987 --> 00:21:25.487
I had no damage
when I attacked his.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.020

first time I'm happy

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:30.654
that my body
is still regenerating.

How did you find us?

00:21:32.987 --> 00:21:35.154

with some questions

00:21:35.187 --> 00:21:36.654
about your cell phone...

00:21:36.687 --> 00:21:38.954
They said that Isaki
was investigating...

00:21:38.987 --> 00:21:40.887
Why do you still keep
getting involved?

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.120
You weren't worried
about me, were you?

00:21:43.154 --> 00:21:44.920
What?

00:21:44.954 --> 00:21:46.587
You saved us.
You're my hero.

those tears for?

From this world, one of
the defiled has departed...

What more do you
need to know?

It's time to celebrate...
her "Serenity."
