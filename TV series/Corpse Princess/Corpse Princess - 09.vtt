[Music]

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.719
Emi, I think it's
time we headed back.

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.325
You're still
chickening out?

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:25.425
We're already here, so there's
nothing you can do about it.

00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:34.191
Nozomi, stop dragging
behind, would you?

00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:37.091
Ah, I'm sorry.

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.358
It happened about
two months ago...

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.158
A friend of mine from
middle school talked me

00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:42.491
into going out
to this old building

00:02:42.525 --> 00:02:45.491
that everyone believed
to be haunted...

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:47.591
And that's
when I met her.

00:02:58.058 --> 00:02:59.558
Hey, Takatoo...

00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:01.258
Yeah?

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:04.958
Is this place really haunted
or is it just an empty building?

00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.058
This place is
haunted all right...

00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.258
I have it on good authority
that 3 years ago,

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:12.891
a gang of bank robbers used
this place as a hideout.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.958
But when the cops were
catching up with them,

00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:18.558
one of the members freaked out,
thinking they were done for.

00:03:25.358 --> 00:03:27.591
The fire spread
in an instant.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.091
And they weren't the
only people here.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.891
Some people were
burned to death.

00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:32.391
Others died jumping
from the windows,

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:34.391
trying to escape
the blaze.

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:36.158
Not too long
after that,

00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:37.858
a strange rumor
started going around

00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:39.925
that some kids who went
to play in the scorched ruins

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.258
never came out.

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.958
And when some adults
went in to look for them,

00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:44.391
they didn't
come out, either.

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:46.458
Everyone vanished.

00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:48.425
Soon, companies started
turning down orders

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:50.291
to demolish
what was left.

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:52.458
After a while, some people
gave the building a name

00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:54.391
they thought it deserved.

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:57.058
They call it "the
man-eating building."

00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:59.025
[Screeming]

00:03:59.058 --> 00:04:00.958
You guys have
to be careful.

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.458
I'm used to being
in this kind of environment,

00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:04.558
but it can be
dangerous in here.

00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:05.425
Okay.

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:07.558
Hey, man. I'm guessing
this is the room

00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:10.625
where the bank robbers hid
and ended up biting the dust?

00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:13.225
Yeah... You can
feel it, can't you?

00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:14.191
Such incredible energy.

00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:15.191
Really?

00:04:15.225 --> 00:04:16.925
Yeah, really.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.325
You should be leaving now.

00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:23.325
This place is dangerous.

00:04:23.358 --> 00:04:24.958
I'll just stick
with you...

00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.358
Wait up!

00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:33.591
No...

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:35.558
What's wrong?

00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.991
I thought I saw
a dead body right there.

00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:39.158
No you didn't...

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:42.091
They cleaned all
that out a long time ago.

00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:45.358
Well, look at that...

00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:46.558
It's just a dummy.

00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:49.258
Must be some kind
of practical joke.

00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:50.858
I'm not a spiritual guy,

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:53.258
but this has gotta be
disrespectful to the dead.

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.358
That looks like
real cash, man.

00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.058
Who would joke
with real money?

00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:57.958
It's fake.

00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:00.125
Don't!

00:05:00.158 --> 00:05:03.425
Put the money back and
step away from there!

00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:05.291
Hey, you're that chick.

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:08.091
Give it back...

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:09.958
Give it back...

00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:11.125
It's mine...

00:05:11.158 --> 00:05:12.925
My money...

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.158
Give it back...

00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:15.491
Give it back...

00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:17.425
Give it back!

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:24.191
What're you doing?!
Get outta here!

00:05:24.225 --> 00:05:25.925
Just keep running to
the end of the hallway!

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.258
It'll get you
outside...! Go!

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.458
The bastards
stole my money...

00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:34.091
And I'm gonna
kill them...

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.358
Hold on to me!

00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.925
We gotta hurry.

00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.358
This is my money!

00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:51.258
What happened...?!
Are you okay?

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:52.491
She's dead?

00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:55.425
Oh, no!
She's dead!

00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.091
I'm gonna kill you all.

00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:06.858
You're not getting away!

00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:25.358
And now you die
like the rest!

00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:39.858
When someone dies with strong
regrets, they become Shikabane.

00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:41.525
They're corpses
who curse living people

00:06:41.558 --> 00:06:43.891
and set their sights
on killing them.

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:45.325
I've heard talk
that there are people

00:06:45.358 --> 00:06:48.358
who want to get rid of us
using other Shikabane.

00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:51.425
Which must be what you are!

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:54.391
One who tries
to kill immortals?!

00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:57.191
Damn you...!
If I knew you weren't human,

00:06:57.225 --> 00:06:59.258
I would've skipped
those other worthless kids

00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:01.158
and killed
your ass first!

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:05.858
In that moment,
I was calmly amazed

00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:08.458
that it wasn't fear
or surprise filling my heart.

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:10.191
I was captivated.

00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:13.525
Held tight in the wake of beauty
left behind that fighting girl.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.958
People have said from the
beginning of humanity

00:07:15.991 --> 00:07:18.558
that death is something
of which to be frightened.

00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:21.558
I've thought that perhaps
that's not entirely true.

00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:24.425
Because death releases
people from this world.

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:27.458
And yes, her beauty
is the beauty of death.

00:07:27.491 --> 00:07:29.591
The beauty of release.

00:07:54.425 --> 00:07:56.191
Since that day,
I've wanted more than anything

00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:59.158
to see her
just one more time.

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:01.358
I wonder why.

00:08:06.325 --> 00:08:07.558
No matter
how hard I searched,

00:08:07.591 --> 00:08:10.358
I could never
find a Shikabane.

00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:13.325
More importantly,
I could never find her.

00:08:25.325 --> 00:08:27.858
I can't believe it!
It's her!

00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:31.591
I've told you
over and over again... .

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:34.591
Do not get
involved with us!

00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:36.191
I know
what you've said...

00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:38.358
But I have to know
where Minai was taken...

00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:40.991
Why can't you
just tell me that?

00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:42.591
Minai...?
Who's that?

00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:45.358
Come on... You know
who I'm talking about!

00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:47.525
Actually,
Ouri, I don't.

00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:51.458
Did you kill her?!

00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:57.391
I don't know anything because
we didn't do anything.

00:08:57.425 --> 00:09:00.291
Keisei said it was resolved,
which is good enough for me.

00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:02.325
It should be good
enough for you, too.

00:09:02.358 --> 00:09:04.625
Don't lie to me...!
Where did she go?!

00:09:04.658 --> 00:09:06.825
Give me
a straight answer!

00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:15.358
Thanks...

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.925
I think
I remember him...

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.191
Hi there.

00:09:22.225 --> 00:09:23.991
Are you a
friend of Ouri's?

00:09:24.025 --> 00:09:25.458
Um... Well...

00:09:25.491 --> 00:09:27.425
I guess you
could say that...

00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.025
Bye!

00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:33.325
What a weird girl.

00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:37.858
I don't know, Ouri.

00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:39.258
Maybe you'll know what
I'm talking about

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:41.925
when I tell you this.

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.591
But when I heard about the
senior dying in a strange way

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:47.325
and another stabbing
someone, I felt...

00:09:47.358 --> 00:09:49.491
sorry...

00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:51.225
For them.

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:54.091
Yo! What's with the
gloomy faces, losers?!

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:55.858
I wonder what's
gonna happen

00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:58.358
to the Student Council's
assistants... Now?

00:09:58.391 --> 00:10:00.958
You're the only member
of the student council.

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.358
But I let you guys
help me, don't I?!

00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:05.991
For I, Mizuki Inuhiko,
manage the 10th grade

00:10:06.025 --> 00:10:08.258
and you're positioned
beneath me; learning, growing.

00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:10.425
But next year,
I'll be the president

00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:12.058
and you will
all be my staff.

00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:14.191
We'll carry out
glorious reformations!

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:17.091
We alone will craft a golden
era for Ikai High School...

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:19.491
Hey...! Pay attention
when I'm talking to you!

00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:20.558
While it looks like you

00:10:20.591 --> 00:10:23.058
two suckers are busy
riding the depression train,

00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:24.391
I'm gonna show
you something today

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:27.591
that will instantly make all of
your problems a distant memory.

00:10:31.391 --> 00:10:34.258
Okay...
That's just Kasuga.

00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:36.058
So what...?
She's not that hot.

00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:37.925
What do you
mean so what...?!

00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.891
It should be obvious.
That woman is a Breast Goddess!

00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:43.225
Breast Goddess?

00:10:43.258 --> 00:10:46.158
See? I mean,
would you look at that!

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:53.925
There's nothing wrong with
focusing our infatuations

00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.525
on hot models or TV stars
or anime voice actors

00:10:56.558 --> 00:10:57.658
or even transfer students.

00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:00.258
But I thought I'd go back
to when it all began for me.

00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:01.891
The goddess who's
drawn my attention

00:11:01.925 --> 00:11:03.491
since I started
high school.

00:11:03.525 --> 00:11:05.291
And she's bigger than
that transfer student!

00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:06.925
Isn't she hot?
Don't you feel better?

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.191
Aren't your
worries gone?

00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:16.201
It's him.

00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:20.462
So... have you
talked with Ouri

00:11:20.495 --> 00:11:22.690
since everything
happened the other day?

00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:25.321
No...
How about you?

00:11:25.354 --> 00:11:29.354
Nope... He's completely avoided
any kind of contact with me.

00:11:29.387 --> 00:11:33.254
I heard that the Inspector
took care of Minai.

00:11:33.287 --> 00:11:34.954
But as far as Ouri
is concerned,

00:11:34.987 --> 00:11:36.621
he thinks
we killed her.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.021
Right. But if he stays
away because of this,

00:11:38.054 --> 00:11:39.454
things will work out...

00:11:39.487 --> 00:11:41.821
Don't you think?

00:11:41.854 --> 00:11:43.521
They should.

00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:49.954
I wonder what's gonna happen
between him and Makina.

00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:52.587
He'll probably avoid
her the most...

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:54.354
He seems to think,
for whatever reason,

00:11:54.387 --> 00:11:57.554
that Makina is his
brother's girlfriend.

00:11:57.587 --> 00:11:59.921
Would he be close to
the truth on that?

00:11:59.954 --> 00:12:02.754
No, not a chance...

00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:06.454
although I don't know how
Makina feels about it.

00:12:07.687 --> 00:12:10.854
She's a Shikabane Hime.
She knows.

00:12:10.887 --> 00:12:13.287
Yeah, I guess...

00:12:15.387 --> 00:12:17.421
Ouri...

00:12:17.454 --> 00:12:19.654
Ouri...

00:12:19.687 --> 00:12:21.287
What's wrong with you?!

00:12:21.321 --> 00:12:23.021
Hello.

00:12:23.054 --> 00:12:24.921
Ouri, I would like
to introduce you

00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:26.854
to my lovely
breast goddess.

00:12:26.887 --> 00:12:28.921
Breast, what?

00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:33.021
I'm sorry to spring
this on you...

00:12:33.054 --> 00:12:35.387
Don't worry about it.
What's going on?

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.621
When I asked Ushijima,

00:12:36.654 --> 00:12:38.287
he said the two of you
were good friends,

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:39.487
so I thought...

00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:41.254
We're friends...
I don't know how--

00:12:41.287 --> 00:12:42.887
It doesn't matter. Just let
me get right to the point,

00:12:42.921 --> 00:12:43.987
if you don't mind.

00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:45.621
Of course.

00:12:45.654 --> 00:12:48.321
I want you to give up on that
girl you've been chasing.

00:12:48.354 --> 00:12:49.721
What girl do you mean?

00:12:49.754 --> 00:12:51.487
You were waiting for her
in front of a temple.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.287
She has long hair.
She's beautiful.

00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:58.287
She's talking about that
Shikabane Hime, Makina.

00:12:58.321 --> 00:13:00.354
Makina Hoshimura?

00:13:00.387 --> 00:13:01.354
Really,
that's her name?

00:13:01.387 --> 00:13:03.287
Makina?
Makina Hoshimura!

00:13:03.321 --> 00:13:04.387
It's simply beautiful!

00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:05.787
Yeah...

00:13:05.821 --> 00:13:08.554
but I think it'd be better
if you stay away from her.

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:10.354
I don't understand. Why?

00:13:10.387 --> 00:13:13.287
It's complicated...
Because...

00:13:13.321 --> 00:13:16.854
Shikabane Hime attract
those who admire death.

00:13:16.887 --> 00:13:20.787
I wonder if this woman is
also fascinated by death...

00:13:20.821 --> 00:13:23.421
Just like you.

00:13:23.454 --> 00:13:26.254
Uh... is something wrong?

00:13:26.287 --> 00:13:28.454
It's nothing, sorry.

00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:30.554
In the same way
you're drawn to death,

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:33.954
you're also drawn
to Shikabane Hime.

00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:36.821
You can no longer
get out of it.

00:13:36.854 --> 00:13:38.854
Shut up!

00:13:43.821 --> 00:13:46.621
Uh...

00:13:46.654 --> 00:13:49.721
Oh, no... I was just
trying to catch...

00:13:49.754 --> 00:13:51.687
a... cat.

00:13:55.954 --> 00:13:58.987
You pervert! There's not
a cat anywhere around us!

00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:00.954
I swear there was a cat...

00:14:00.987 --> 00:14:02.254
You don't know anything!

00:14:02.287 --> 00:14:04.954
You're just chasing her around
like every other brainless man!

00:14:04.987 --> 00:14:08.587
How dare you lie to me just to
fulfill your dirty fantasies!

00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:10.521
I only said that because
I'm concerned about you.

00:14:10.554 --> 00:14:11.821
I'm not some jerk.

00:14:11.854 --> 00:14:14.321
I'm going to make sure
Makina never has to deal

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.654
with this kind
of crap from you!

00:14:20.421 --> 00:14:22.754
No one else
can see me...

00:14:22.787 --> 00:14:25.321
Because I am you...

00:14:29.854 --> 00:14:31.921
Here, I'm finished.

00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:37.687
If you can do this
kind of work...

00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:39.921
your arm has
regenerated well.

00:14:39.954 --> 00:14:41.421
Isn't there a better
way for you to test

00:14:41.454 --> 00:14:44.354
if my arm's up to speed?

00:14:44.387 --> 00:14:45.954
I want you to know that
if Ouri comes to see me,

00:14:45.987 --> 00:14:47.354
I'll ask him to help.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.921
But it looks like
he's pretty mad.

00:14:49.954 --> 00:14:53.254
Who is Ouri anyway?

00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:56.454
You said you found him
one day and took him in...

00:14:56.487 --> 00:14:59.487
But it seems like the Inspectors
know a lot more than that...

00:14:59.521 --> 00:15:02.021
So what kind
of child was he?

00:15:02.054 --> 00:15:03.721
He was an ordinary kid.

00:15:03.754 --> 00:15:05.321
You're wrong.

00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:07.554
He's always been
a strange one.

00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:08.987
I mean, when he knew
my heart wasn't beating,

00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:10.354
it didn't faze him.

00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.687
Almost like
he expected it.

00:15:12.721 --> 00:15:14.021
And even with Minai.

00:15:14.054 --> 00:15:16.354
He knew she was
a Shikabane Hime,

00:15:16.387 --> 00:15:19.787
but he treated her as if
she was an regular girl.

00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:21.021
I find it hard to believe

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:22.787
that there's an
ordinary kid anywhere

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:26.254
who could do all of that.

00:15:26.287 --> 00:15:28.387
If I remember correctly...

00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:30.987
he was about three
when he came here.

00:15:31.021 --> 00:15:34.287
Such a sad
and useless child.

00:15:34.321 --> 00:15:37.621
He didn't know how to put on
clothes, how to use tableware.

00:15:37.654 --> 00:15:39.587
The kid didn't even know
how to use the toilet.

00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:43.954
Nothing. Forget about any
emotional understanding.

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:47.721
But one day,
something in him changed.

00:15:47.754 --> 00:15:50.287
He was different.

00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:54.387
What do you mean
you adopted him?

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.387
Well, he was on the
riverside, crying.

00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:57.521
I had to do something.

00:15:57.554 --> 00:16:00.521
And bringing him
home was the answer?

00:16:00.554 --> 00:16:02.921
Don't listen to him.
I think it's great...

00:16:02.954 --> 00:16:05.687
He's your
friend now, right?

00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:06.987
Ouri had never
shown any interest

00:16:07.021 --> 00:16:09.321
towards other
kids up until then.

00:16:09.354 --> 00:16:11.321
Or anything for
that matter.

00:16:11.354 --> 00:16:12.687
And the very
first thing in this world

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:15.754
that caught his attention
was a small, helpless life.

00:16:15.787 --> 00:16:17.521
You couldn't say he
was a good caretaker.

00:16:17.554 --> 00:16:19.954
He was much too clumsy
and short-sighted.

00:16:19.987 --> 00:16:23.554
But it seemed the kid was coming
back to life little by little.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.821
The poor thing.

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:31.421
We'll hold a memorial
service for him.

00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:32.921
Riko, would you mind
grabbing a set of work gloves

00:16:32.954 --> 00:16:34.354
and some incense?

00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:36.387
I'll get the shovel.

00:16:36.421 --> 00:16:38.754
Ouri stared for
hours at that cat,

00:16:38.787 --> 00:16:42.487
marveling at how it changed
from a life into an object.

00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:48.221
Ouri...

00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:56.487
Why did you bring him
to a place like this?

00:16:57.721 --> 00:16:59.421
This is where I found him.

00:16:59.454 --> 00:17:02.854
I know he'll start crying
again if he's here.

00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:08.354
I know he will!

00:17:09.554 --> 00:17:10.721
Ouri...

00:17:10.754 --> 00:17:12.387
The best thing
we can do for the dead

00:17:12.421 --> 00:17:13.954
is remember them
for who they were

00:17:13.987 --> 00:17:17.654
and shed tears
for the loss.

00:17:17.687 --> 00:17:20.654
A monk's obligation isn't to
put the dead on a pedestal...

00:17:20.687 --> 00:17:24.487
but to help guide the tears
of those who are left behind.

00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:26.287
So, Ouri...

00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:27.754
It's okay...

00:17:27.787 --> 00:17:30.487
You can cry now.

00:17:37.587 --> 00:17:39.621
I think that was the first
time he ever experienced

00:17:39.654 --> 00:17:42.287
a real emotion.

00:17:43.454 --> 00:17:46.021
In everyday life, people
forget about death...

00:17:46.054 --> 00:17:47.787
And when they're reminded

00:17:47.821 --> 00:17:50.854
because someone close to them
died, they soon forget again...

00:17:50.887 --> 00:17:52.554
But I think it's harder

00:17:52.587 --> 00:17:55.387
for Ouri than it is for
everyone else out there...

00:17:55.421 --> 00:17:57.587
For some reason he thinks
he shouldn't forget.

00:17:57.621 --> 00:17:59.021
But why...?

00:17:59.054 --> 00:18:01.787
It'll just make him suffer
more than he already does...

00:18:01.821 --> 00:18:03.021
There's nothing
to gain there.

00:18:03.054 --> 00:18:04.354
It's time...

00:18:04.387 --> 00:18:06.887
I should be leaving now.

00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:08.687
Where're you going?

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:12.254
I gotta show my face at the
head temple once in a while.

00:18:21.723 --> 00:18:23.420
Ouri...

00:18:25.183 --> 00:18:26.950
Ouri...

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.717
Ouri...

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.917
Ouri...

00:18:32.117 --> 00:18:32.626
Ouri...

00:18:33.264 --> 00:18:35.964
Have you already
forgotten?

00:18:38.797 --> 00:18:41.730
About little ol' me...?

00:18:41.764 --> 00:18:44.897
But you...
You're dead.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.064
Ouri, what's
going on in here?

00:18:47.097 --> 00:18:49.397
It's the cat...

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.897
I know you're sad,
but stop crying...

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.130
Go to sleep.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.964
What's wrong?

00:18:58.997 --> 00:19:01.464
I'm only visible to you...

00:19:01.497 --> 00:19:04.197
Because I am you.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.930
Have you forgotten
about me...?

00:19:06.964 --> 00:19:09.064
About us...?

00:19:12.064 --> 00:19:13.430
Not again...

00:19:13.464 --> 00:19:16.464
I'm sorry... I think my
mind was kinda wandering.

00:19:16.497 --> 00:19:18.297
Thinking about
that girl again?

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.930
You know--

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.130
Look, you left
her with us,

00:19:23.164 --> 00:19:24.830
but she said
she had to leave.

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:26.697
I didn't use my best
judgement and I let her go.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.664
I'm sorry.

00:19:27.697 --> 00:19:30.064
You still don't know
where she is, do you?

00:19:30.097 --> 00:19:33.697
I'll be fine. I gotta
clean this mess up now.

00:19:40.864 --> 00:19:42.397
Excuse me...

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.830
Is your name Makina?

00:19:44.864 --> 00:19:46.464
Depends on who's asking.

00:19:46.497 --> 00:19:50.864
I'm Nozomi Kasuga, you saved
me from that man-eating monster.

00:19:50.897 --> 00:19:54.364
I came by because wanted to say
thank you for saving my life--

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.797
For the good of you and
everything you care about...

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.397
you should forget about
that night and me.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.064
But Makina, there's
no way I could.

00:20:04.097 --> 00:20:05.164
Go home, kid.

00:20:05.197 --> 00:20:06.830
I don't want to...

00:20:06.864 --> 00:20:08.364
Ouri couldn't possibly
understand you

00:20:08.397 --> 00:20:11.397
or what you are
the way I can.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.697
He's no good for you and he
doesn't get any of this...

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.964
He doesn't understand
anything about you or death.

00:20:16.997 --> 00:20:18.164
Death?

00:20:18.197 --> 00:20:19.730
Death is forever
and it's something

00:20:19.764 --> 00:20:22.230
only the chosen can
approach without fear...

00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:23.897
Death is beautiful...

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.897
That's why I'm drawn
to you... I get it.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.830
You get nothing.
Death is death.

00:20:28.864 --> 00:20:30.064
It's as simple as that.

00:20:30.097 --> 00:20:31.264
But...

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:33.864
You don't know
anything about Ouri.

00:20:33.897 --> 00:20:36.297
You're not familiar
with death at all.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.364
He is.

00:20:38.397 --> 00:20:40.297
And with you, too?

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.397
Sorry about that.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.497
I don't know
how it happened,

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.797
but she seems to have gotten
the wrong idea about me.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.797
So what...? I thought you
were gonna stop coming here.

00:21:04.964 --> 00:21:07.864
I only see him with
you some of the time...

00:21:07.897 --> 00:21:09.697
Do they not allow
cats at your place?

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.997
What?

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.697
Wait, you can see him?

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.397
It's not so dark that I can't
see a cat in front of me...

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.897
And if you're here
to see Keisei,

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.330
he's at the
head temple.

00:21:20.364 --> 00:21:23.264
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

00:21:23.297 --> 00:21:25.064
Is it about Minai?

00:21:25.097 --> 00:21:28.230
Yeah... Whenever I try
to think about her...

00:21:28.264 --> 00:21:30.930
I realize that I don't
really know that much.

00:21:30.964 --> 00:21:33.064
Would you mind telling me a
couple of things about her?

00:21:33.097 --> 00:21:35.364
What was she like?

00:21:35.397 --> 00:21:37.864
All we can do for the
dead is remember them...

00:21:37.897 --> 00:21:40.964
And cry for the loss
when they're gone.

00:21:40.997 --> 00:21:43.064
Brother told me something
along those lines

00:21:43.097 --> 00:21:44.764
when I was younger...

00:21:44.797 --> 00:21:46.897
But with Minai...

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.230
I don't know enough about
her to remember who she was.

00:21:53.497 --> 00:21:54.964
All I have
to drink is tea.

00:21:54.997 --> 00:21:57.364
Huh?

00:21:57.397 --> 00:21:59.330
Thank you.

00:22:08.964 --> 00:22:13.964
[Music]

00:23:39.364 --> 00:23:42.330
Stars shine in the sky while
people writhe and struggle

00:23:42.364 --> 00:23:43.897
on the ground.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.164
But in this backwater place
where the living and dead

00:23:46.197 --> 00:23:48.197
have seemed
to switch places,

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.030
even "Stars on the Ground"
can begin to twinkle.
