00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.400
[Music]

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.986
The Seven Stars...

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.092
You're familiar
with them, correct?

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:03.270
If I'm not mistaken,

00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:05.570
it's a group consisting
of several Shikabane.

00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:08.470
Shikabane exist because of the
regrets and obsessions people

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.470
have as they die...

00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:11.970
They stay here to act
on their desires, right?

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.503
But these Shikabane
decided to start a club?

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:15.936
Saki!

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.970
I understand that
this seems impossible.

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.670
Regardless of how
unlikely the case,

00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:21.770
these Shikabane have
banned together.

00:02:21.803 --> 00:02:23.936
Here's what we
know so far...

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.503
Each member has seven stars
carved into their skin...

00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:29.270
Their plans don't
necessarily include

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:31.370
just killing
human beings...

00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:33.703
They also have been known
to target other Shikabane

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.636
that cross their path.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.903
I don't get it.

00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:38.203
If they're not just
in it for the kill,

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:40.370
what else could they
be trying to do?

00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:42.636
I don't know,
but we'll figure it out.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.936
Make sure to give these
pictures to Keisei.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.703
Yes, sir...
May I ask why?

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:49.603
Now is not the
time to explain...

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.336
He will understand
what needs to be done

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.236
once he receives them.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.270
Kamika!

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:56.603
I'll just be
a moment, sir.

00:02:56.636 --> 00:02:59.203
A few scriptures appear
to be unaccounted for.

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:00.236
See to it later.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.970
Right now, the Seven Stars
pose a bigger threat

00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:04.936
than missing scriptures.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.903
There's Shuhou and Shujou
factions of the sect?

00:03:13.936 --> 00:03:15.070
Yes.

00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:18.236
These factions have been
created within the Kougon Sect.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.236
The second in command,
the Gon Dai Sojo,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.803
is part of the
Shujou faction.

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:23.303
He has an opposition
to the manner

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.503
in which Shikabane Hime
are implemented.

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:27.303
Does he really think
they stand a chance

00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:29.803
without the help of their
indentured corpses?

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.803
He thinks they are capable of
creating a world without regret.

00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:36.270
[Laughter]

00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:38.770
Let me see if I'm
understanding this correctly...

00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:40.836
The Shujou is about
to assume the lead.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.336
With the Shuhou
losing control,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.803
Shikabane Hime will
no longer be a threat?

00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:46.703
Our focus should be on
targeting contracted monks

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:48.303
and their Shikabane Hime.

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:50.236
The Shuhou faction
will suffer.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.870
You seem to have
done your homework...

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:53.903
Better than expected
of a traitor.

00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:55.603
Being that you lost
your precious casket,

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.803
what else do you
have to offer us?

00:03:57.836 --> 00:03:59.703
I can create
another casket.

00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:01.803
We have one condition.

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.836
Not only do we know little
of your true intentions,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.336
but you're a human...

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.436
We have no reason to
believe we can trust you.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.736
What can I do?

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.770
You must prove yourself...

00:04:11.803 --> 00:04:15.570
Convince us that you have
abandoned your trivial emotions.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.503
What is this...?
This water drop?

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.670
Hands off!

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.236
You're not worthy...

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.870
To touch Hokuto
of the Seven Stars.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.236
I'll show all of you
what a mere human can do...

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.603
All that remains of my
emotions is the desire

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.370
to annihilate
the Kougon Sect!

00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:47.436
[Laughter]

00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:02.436
He's here!
Let's go!

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.703
Ouri's here...!
Hurry up and hide it!

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.170
Oh, there
he is! Run!

00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:26.203
So it looks like the kids
don't like me anymore.

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:28.403
Nothing could be further
from the truth, Ouri.

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:29.603
Yeah, right.

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:47.803
Did you think we'd
forget your birthday?

00:05:49.336 --> 00:05:51.770
Oh... Yeah,
I see.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.970
Incredible.

00:05:59.003 --> 00:06:01.303
It's a zadan technique.

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:03.336
Being that I never
practiced it seriously...

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.470
I'm not sure if
this is any good.

00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:07.370
You can get a pretty good
defense with Shikimi

00:06:07.403 --> 00:06:08.936
and spirit threads.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.803
Overall, the scriptures appear
to be woven in superb accuracy.

00:06:11.836 --> 00:06:14.336
Looks good enough to
rival a Level 3...

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.303
Maybe even a Level 2
class Buddhist instrument.

00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:18.303
Good to know.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.570
Isn't the traitor monk's
casket pretty strong...?

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:23.370
Wouldn't it work
just as well as this?

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:26.203
Where did you find all
of these scriptures?

00:06:28.003 --> 00:06:31.403
Please don't tell me you took
Sojo Takamine's scriptures!

00:06:31.436 --> 00:06:33.470
I may have pilfered
through them the other day.

00:06:33.503 --> 00:06:35.603
Senior! That place
holds scriptures,

00:06:35.636 --> 00:06:37.903
some of which are
known to be priceless!

00:06:39.903 --> 00:06:41.936
For the most part,
I selected them at random.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.936
Just a few might be
considered national treasures.

00:06:46.836 --> 00:06:47.736
I assume...

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.403
You're planning to use
this as a catalyst

00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:51.203
for your zadan technique?

00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:54.603
Actually... Can you hold
on to it for a while?

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.970
It's insurance...
Just in case.

00:06:59.003 --> 00:07:00.736
Senior...

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.470
Saki...
Aragami.

00:07:04.503 --> 00:07:06.503
Oh, great...
She's here.

00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:07.970
I asked her
to come here...

00:07:08.003 --> 00:07:10.903
I thought it was best if the
two of us saw them together.

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:20.670
Okay... Here's the medicine
for the spiritual trauma.

00:07:20.703 --> 00:07:22.303
Take this one
before eating...

00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:23.570
After meals...

00:07:23.603 --> 00:07:24.870
And this one
before bed.

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:27.603
Great...
Thanks.

00:07:27.636 --> 00:07:29.636
Takamine said you'd know
what to do with these.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.670
Are you sure it's them?

00:07:36.703 --> 00:07:40.203
Keisei... Are they
the next assignment?

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:42.270
Yeah... Probably.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.636
So...

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.603
I've been waiting
for you, Seven Stars.

00:08:05.636 --> 00:08:07.703
Still pretending you're
not getting involved?

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:10.236
I'm not... All I was
going to say is that

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.436
I remember seeing that
girl the other day.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.703
You saw her...? Where?

00:08:14.736 --> 00:08:17.436
At that Order of Eternal
Life Research place.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.203
Why would you go
to such a place...?

00:08:19.236 --> 00:08:21.436
It's a front for some
kind of religious cult.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.403
I was just curious
about it...

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:24.903
I thought another religion
might have a way

00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:27.503
to save people like you.

00:08:27.536 --> 00:08:29.570
What are you talking about?

00:08:29.603 --> 00:08:32.270
I know you could have
become a Shikabane...

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:35.603
Working as a Shikabane Hime was
the only alternative for you...

00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:38.770
But that's just led you
down the path of despair.

00:08:38.803 --> 00:08:41.336
Despair...?
Far from it...

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.736
This wasn't forced on me,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.570
I asked to become
a Shikabane Hime.

00:08:49.603 --> 00:08:51.436
You okay?

00:09:03.865 --> 00:09:06.032
I think you're putting more
than enough meat in that...

00:09:06.065 --> 00:09:07.499
Don't you?

00:09:07.532 --> 00:09:10.065
Think I got this big and strong
by being a vegetarian...?

00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:12.832
Meat is good...
And good for you.

00:09:14.132 --> 00:09:16.499
What about
all those spices?

00:09:16.532 --> 00:09:19.032
Why are you
using so many?

00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:21.232
A long time ago, I got into
the habit of experimenting

00:09:21.265 --> 00:09:24.099
with all kinds of
spices and seasonings.

00:09:24.132 --> 00:09:26.032
Didn't really
have a choice.

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.065
Someone was very
picky about food.

00:09:28.099 --> 00:09:31.232
Are you talking...
about me?

00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:33.199
Now let me think.

00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:36.799
I believe I've told you
that I was very young

00:09:36.832 --> 00:09:39.332
when my parents died.

00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:41.832
There were people who helped
me out during that time...

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:44.232
They were the head family,
the Hoshimuras.

00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:46.065
Hoshimura?

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:18.999
Once I completed my training
at the head temple...

00:10:19.032 --> 00:10:21.765
I left the
Hoshimuras' house.

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:23.299
After leaving...

00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:25.432
I only went back there
every once in a while.

00:10:25.465 --> 00:10:33.499
[Music]

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:36.032
I was soon sent to
the Sekuu Temple...

00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:38.732
Where I met Riko
and her mother.

00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:40.232
The temple...

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:44.165
And the Dai-Rin House were in
pretty terrible shape then.

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:46.065
Restorations...

00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:49.299
Took quite a lot
of time and money.

00:10:49.332 --> 00:10:51.799
Soon, you entered
into our lives.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.499
For ten years,

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:59.932
it seemed as though everything
was how it should be.

00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:01.499
That all changed
when I received news

00:11:01.532 --> 00:11:03.899
that Shikabane murdered
the Hoshimura family.

00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:13.265
The ones responsible were
a group of Shikabane.

00:11:13.299 --> 00:11:16.499
We realized soon after that
it was the Seven Stars.

00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:19.199
Are they the ones I saw
in the pictures earlier?

00:11:30.432 --> 00:11:31.999
Keisei...

00:11:32.032 --> 00:11:34.032
Old man... Why?

00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:36.432
The daughter of Hoshimura
possesses the talent.

00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:40.365
You're to become her
contracted monk immediately.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.532
She's out of control.

00:11:41.565 --> 00:11:44.499
Her experiences have left
her full of anger and hatred.

00:11:44.532 --> 00:11:46.732
We have her restrained,
it's the only way to stop her

00:11:46.765 --> 00:11:48.932
from becoming a Shikabane.

00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:50.865
If we do not create
the contract now...

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:53.265
All that she was
will cease to exist.

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:55.732
Wait... I can't!

00:11:55.765 --> 00:11:58.365
There's already a connection
between the two of you...

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:00.799
A contract with you
is the only way.

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:08.232
Makina, I...

00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:11.965
Keisei... Please...!
Make a contract with me!

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:13.899
Do you completely
understand...

00:12:13.932 --> 00:12:16.065
What becoming a
Shikabane Hime means?

00:12:16.099 --> 00:12:17.799
I'll do anything...

00:12:17.832 --> 00:12:20.332
Keisei, I need you
to fight by my side.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:22.165
The monsters that
did this must pay...

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.199
Avenge my family and me!

00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:35.299
Before, you told me that Makina
didn't become a Shikabane Hime

00:12:35.332 --> 00:12:38.232
in order to earn
her way into heaven.

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:41.099
The Seven Stars aren't
your average Shikabane.

00:12:41.132 --> 00:12:43.432
Try not to get
involved in this one.

00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:46.499
But... You're involved.

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:49.199
I made her a promise...

00:12:49.232 --> 00:12:51.932
To fight by her side.

00:12:59.832 --> 00:13:01.499
I understand now,
Brother.

00:13:01.532 --> 00:13:04.132
When I first found out,
I just wanted to stay mad at you

00:13:04.165 --> 00:13:05.999
for keeping
such a big secret...

00:13:06.032 --> 00:13:08.299
But that was before I really
knew about this world...

00:13:08.332 --> 00:13:09.399
You know?

00:13:09.432 --> 00:13:10.965
Yeah.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.099
I know the Kougon
Sect killed Minai.

00:13:13.132 --> 00:13:14.832
Trusting them is impossible...

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:16.365
But you're different.

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:18.099
You're still
the exact same person

00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:20.465
I've known all these years
and I can trust you.

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:23.399
You told me monks are here
to protect the living...

00:13:23.432 --> 00:13:28.165
And that their purpose isn't to
try and save those already dead.

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:29.732
Sorry.

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:34.499
Hearing that really
makes me happy.

00:13:34.532 --> 00:13:37.232
Ouri... I'll make sure
you get a very special gift

00:13:37.265 --> 00:13:39.332
for your birthday tomorrow.

00:13:39.365 --> 00:13:43.365
A limited edition Zenbunose
Puchitoo life-sized figure!

00:13:55.265 --> 00:13:56.865
Tomorrow.

00:14:03.232 --> 00:14:05.732
Sorry, sir!

00:14:05.765 --> 00:14:08.265
Here you go.

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:10.832
Thank you
so much, mister!

00:14:13.365 --> 00:14:15.365
You're really sweet!

00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:22.132
I'd say Ena is quite the
theatrical performer.

00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:24.932
Once he reveals his true nature,
he's rather intolerable.

00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:26.899
My god, Regardless, he
was able to create a bond

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:28.765
between himself and Ouri.

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:31.265
Now all we have to do
is wait for nightfall.

00:14:31.299 --> 00:14:33.765
Yes.

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:36.065
Now... This
is going to be fun.

00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:13.999
Keisei...

00:15:14.032 --> 00:15:15.832
Keisei.

00:15:15.865 --> 00:15:17.199
Everyone in the
area is asleep.

00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:18.965
Doesn't that seem
a little odd?

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:20.765
Must be a
Shikabane's curse...

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:21.832
But you'd think
they'd realize

00:15:21.865 --> 00:15:24.432
that it won't have an effect
on either one of us.

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:25.932
They do know.

00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:27.899
It's a challenge,
they're calling us out.

00:15:27.932 --> 00:15:30.399
Looks like they wanted
minimal distractions.

00:15:30.432 --> 00:15:32.265
Job well done.

00:15:42.065 --> 00:15:43.799
[Mew]

00:15:46.365 --> 00:15:47.932
Crap!

00:15:51.132 --> 00:15:53.432
[Mew]

00:15:58.365 --> 00:15:59.799
What is it?

00:15:59.832 --> 00:16:02.865
What do you
want from me?

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:05.399
Are those...
Bruises?

00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:39.865
And to think that
Shikabane have the guts

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:42.365
to attack us directly.

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:44.132
It just shows you the
level of intelligence

00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:45.732
we're working with.

00:16:45.765 --> 00:16:47.399
The Seven Stars.

00:16:47.432 --> 00:16:50.274
Or... The traitor monk.

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.231
Would the two of you like
to venture another guess...?

00:16:55.462 --> 00:16:57.362
You're both so close.

00:17:04.762 --> 00:17:06.696
The Incredible
Lotus Flower.

00:17:15.662 --> 00:17:17.696
Is that the Hoshimuras'
little girl...?

00:17:17.729 --> 00:17:19.429
How time flies.

00:17:20.662 --> 00:17:23.629
You really do have a knack
for making foolish choices...

00:17:23.662 --> 00:17:25.796
I see that your arms and
legs have grown back.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.729
Remember how you begged and
pleaded for your life

00:17:27.762 --> 00:17:29.829
with those bloody stumps?

00:17:29.862 --> 00:17:31.929
It was so cute.

00:17:31.962 --> 00:17:33.962
Seven Stars.

00:17:33.996 --> 00:17:35.929
I am Kowaku!

00:17:37.862 --> 00:17:39.596
Akasha...

00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:42.362
Has your desperation really led
you to consort with Shikabane?

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.796
I would hardly call this
an act of desperation,

00:17:44.829 --> 00:17:46.562
my dear old friend.

00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:48.896
What's your purpose here?

00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:50.362
To rid the world
of the Kougon Sect

00:17:50.396 --> 00:17:52.329
and their pitiful
Shikabane Hime.

00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:54.729
I figured I'd start off
with the two of you.

00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:57.329
You and I grew up together,
we studied at the same temple...

00:17:57.362 --> 00:17:58.796
We were friends.

00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:02.529
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

00:18:02.562 --> 00:18:04.496
I'm a different
person now, Senior.

00:18:04.529 --> 00:18:07.396
Our history doesn't
concern me in the least...

00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:09.062
I may have walked
in your shadow then,

00:18:09.096 --> 00:18:10.896
but that's all
in the past.

00:18:10.929 --> 00:18:13.562
You hadn't even the
slightest indecision.

00:18:13.596 --> 00:18:14.929
We are not
to seek death...

00:18:14.962 --> 00:18:16.896
Nor are we to fear it.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:20.062
That is the only way to save
the distraught masses.

00:18:31.662 --> 00:18:33.829
You have become a great
contracted monk.

00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:35.329
The two of you
should really think

00:18:35.362 --> 00:18:37.396
about becoming
contracted monks also.

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:39.896
Having a powerful Shikabane
Hime to fight alongside

00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:42.562
doesn't seem
like a bad idea.

00:18:42.596 --> 00:18:44.629
The second the
opportunity comes around,

00:18:44.662 --> 00:18:47.362
I'm going to make
a contract with one.

00:18:47.396 --> 00:18:50.029
Making a contract is
serious business...

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:53.796
I don't think I have
the stomach for it.

00:18:53.829 --> 00:18:55.862
Why is that?
It takes a lot to ask

00:18:55.896 --> 00:18:58.662
these little girls to put
their lives on the line.

00:18:58.696 --> 00:19:02.429
Besides... I'm better off
fighting alone for a while.

00:19:02.462 --> 00:19:03.996
Perhaps someday...

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:06.429
I might be willing
to risk it.

00:19:11.129 --> 00:19:14.429
I believed what you
said that day...

00:19:14.462 --> 00:19:18.329
Deep down a part of me
felt you were right.

00:19:18.362 --> 00:19:21.696
Which is why...
When I learned the truth...

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:24.696
I simply couldn't
accept it.

00:19:24.729 --> 00:19:27.062
Accept what...?
The truth?

00:19:27.096 --> 00:19:29.429
I must shed my last
threads of humanity.

00:19:29.462 --> 00:19:32.096
My transformation will be
signified by your dying breath.

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:33.829
I shall be reborn...

00:19:33.862 --> 00:19:38.529
I will subsist by
accepting death.

00:19:38.562 --> 00:19:41.462
I find it very amusing
how much human beings rely

00:19:41.496 --> 00:19:42.696
on conversation.

00:19:42.729 --> 00:19:44.062
Your outfit...

00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:46.662
You were a monk before
you became a Shikabane?

00:19:46.696 --> 00:19:48.062
How perceptive...

00:19:48.096 --> 00:19:49.862
That is how I know...

00:19:49.896 --> 00:19:52.362
Monks are just humans
who want to play heroes...

00:19:52.396 --> 00:19:56.029
But the thing is they
can't save anybody.

00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:59.029
Admit it. You're trying to
rescue your damsel in distress.

00:19:59.062 --> 00:20:01.729
All you're doing is taking
her from one hell to another.

00:20:01.762 --> 00:20:04.329
Monks are nothing more
than cheap illusionists.

00:20:04.362 --> 00:20:05.929
Though I'm sure you try
to convince yourselves

00:20:05.962 --> 00:20:07.562
that you're
making a difference.

00:20:07.596 --> 00:20:08.962
Do you ever shut up?

00:20:26.562 --> 00:20:28.962
Just as I expected...

00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:30.562
You haven't had the chance
to perfect this casket

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:31.729
as your catalyst.

00:20:35.096 --> 00:20:36.062
He couldn't have captured

00:20:36.096 --> 00:20:39.062
another hundred and eight
regrets so quickly.

00:20:39.096 --> 00:20:40.362
If I use my zadan technique,
I should be able.

00:20:40.396 --> 00:20:44.362
First thing you learn in battle
is to hide your weaknesses...

00:20:44.396 --> 00:20:47.762
Fortunately, I'm familiar
with your Achilles heel.

00:20:47.796 --> 00:20:49.829
Your reason for leaving
the safety of the building

00:20:49.862 --> 00:20:52.429
and coming out into
the open is simple.

00:20:52.462 --> 00:20:54.762
People that you made an oath
to protect lie asleep

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.696
within those walls.

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:01.662
What are you
waiting for? Go!

00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:02.696
You may need me.

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:04.062
Don't worry about me.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.529
I finally found
myself a decent fight.

00:21:06.562 --> 00:21:08.396
You can't let
him get inside!

00:21:10.996 --> 00:21:13.862
Looks like it's
just the two of us.

00:21:13.896 --> 00:21:15.662
Die, Kowaku!

00:21:22.629 --> 00:21:25.729
The barrier
is still intact.

00:21:25.762 --> 00:21:27.562
I made it.

00:21:39.496 --> 00:21:40.362
Ouri?

00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:44.396
Brother... There's
something happening.

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:48.462
Yes... Never mind that...
why are you here?

00:21:48.496 --> 00:21:51.829
You should
have fallen asleep.

00:21:51.862 --> 00:21:54.962
Falling asleep...
isn't an option...

00:21:59.729 --> 00:22:01.562
Tonight...

00:22:01.596 --> 00:22:03.329
Just got
very interesting.

00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:13.529
[Music]

00:23:39.562 --> 00:23:43.429
The long night that
seems to go on forever...

00:23:43.462 --> 00:23:47.329
The tears you thought had
dried up begin pouring out...

00:23:47.362 --> 00:23:48.796
Go ahead and cry.

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:51.529
The dawn is still in
the distant future.
