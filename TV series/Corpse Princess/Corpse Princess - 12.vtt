00:01:41.324 --> 00:01:42.009
Ouri?

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.508
Brother...

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:46.075
There's something
happening.

00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:47.541
Yes...

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:50.141
Never mind that...
why are you here?

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:53.508
You should have...
fallen asleep.

00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:56.875
Falling asleep...
isn't an option.

00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:02.475
Tonight...

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:05.008
Just got very...
Interesting.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:15.075

[Music]

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:37.508
Something's wrong...
Keisei's rune.

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.141
How long does it take
to break a bond?

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:44.008
I've heard that
a Shikabane Hime

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:46.375
is connected to her
contracted monk by a bond...

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:48.808
I'm dying to know
if this is the truth.

00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:50.575
So tell me, can you feel
your monk's life slipping

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:52.975
through the cracks?

00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:54.175
It's not true!

00:02:57.275 --> 00:02:59.075
His body...
I can't get a shot.

00:02:59.108 --> 00:03:02.041
The monks have had their fun,
now it's my turn...

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:05.941
It'll be just like
the good old days.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.241
It would appear that
the founder, Ooyatsuka,

00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:10.375
was a Shikabane himself.

00:03:10.408 --> 00:03:13.408
And to think that the Seven
Stars were a step ahead of us.

00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:16.108
The first to arrive on the scene
were killed almost instantly...

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:17.975
Even the followers.

00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:20.575
Looks like they made a point not
to leave even a single survivor.

00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:23.008
Sojo!
Come quickly...

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:24.541
Outside!

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:28.908
What is this?

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.175
This is a trench.

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:33.108
This is the curse
of a Shikabane...

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:35.541
A dimension used to
capture their prey.

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:36.575
But not to worry.

00:03:36.608 --> 00:03:39.008
A trench of this immensity
isn't strong enough

00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.175
to confine us
for very long.

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:44.541
Our enemy is conveying that
they don't want us to interfere.

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:46.575
Which means we
aren't their target.

00:03:46.608 --> 00:03:49.275
Senior Tagami
and Makina!

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:55.408
Trapping them was
entirely too easy.

00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:57.908
Perhaps we should
kill them now.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.141
My apologies,
big brother...

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:07.508
I had intended on killing
you with a single stab.

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.008
It's hard to control a
body I'm not familiar with.

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:15.275
He's possessed...
The Seven Stars did this.

00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:18.875
However. If at first
you don't succeed...

00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:23.908
I'd be careful
if I were you.

00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:26.141
You wouldn't want to
hurt your little brother.

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:27.141
No, I wouldn't.

00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:29.508
Which is why I won't...

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.841
Allow you to turn
Ouri into a murderer!

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:37.041
Katsu!

00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:38.308
Bastard!
Brother.

00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:39.508
Don't resist!

00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:41.375
What ha-...?
No!

00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:54.441
Just as I thought,

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:57.808
the spirit of a living being
can put up quite a fight.

00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:01.508
I can't wait to see
what happens next.

00:05:06.508 --> 00:05:07.341
Brother!

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:11.041
Welcome back...
You had me worried.

00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:12.541
You're hurt.

00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:15.541
Then I wasn't dreaming
earlier, it really happened.

00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:18.575
I can't believe
I actually stabbed you.

00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:21.008
I don't know
what to say.

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:22.841
You don't have to
say anything, Ouri.

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:25.508
The stab wound won't
affect me in the slightest.

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.075
Not while I have
the Souma elixir.

00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:31.275
Senior.

00:05:31.308 --> 00:05:33.541
Hope I'm not
interrupting.

00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:36.575
Ouri, get back!

00:05:36.608 --> 00:05:38.308
Ouri!

00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:40.308
I knew it...
You're weak.

00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:54.441
It would seem...

00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:57.141
To be the end
of the line, old friend.

00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.475
That's it...
I've had enough!

00:06:07.141 --> 00:06:08.308
What would you
like me to do, sir?

00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:10.975
Educate...
Teach them a lesson...

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:13.375
Show them why we call
you the Sword Princess.

00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:15.308
All right...

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.041
Will do.

00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:37.808
The strongest Shikabane Hime
within the Kougon Sect.

00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:40.341
The trench won't
last much longer.

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:43.041
However... It was
more than enough time.

00:06:50.308 --> 00:06:52.141
I'm surprised you
still have the energy

00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:54.075
to continue this
pointless charade.

00:06:54.108 --> 00:06:56.008
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not complaining.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:59.341
I've always enjoyed
your company.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:01.841
Your monk must be putting up
one hell of a fight.

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:02.875
Not that it
really matters.

00:07:02.908 --> 00:07:05.541
Do you think you'll cry
when the bastard dies?

00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.575
You don't seem to be
getting it, sweetheart.

00:07:16.608 --> 00:07:19.808
I'm not your average Shikabane,
I'm different...

00:07:19.841 --> 00:07:23.175
How do you plan to kill...
what you can't shoot?

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:25.341
I don't have a body to break
into pieces or a brain

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:26.841
that you can destroy.

00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:28.375
Being a member of the
Seven Stars allows me

00:07:28.408 --> 00:07:31.141
to take the form
of whatever I choose!

00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:43.975
I can go anywhere
I please.

00:07:44.008 --> 00:07:45.541
Did I neglect to mention
that I can freely change

00:07:45.575 --> 00:07:47.841
the properties
of my body, too?

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:50.175
You don't
stand a chance.

00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:52.875
I am an
unstoppable force.

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:57.241
All this time
I've wanted...

00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:00.375
To kill every
last one of you.

00:08:00.408 --> 00:08:04.941
That obsession...
Made me become a Shikabane.

00:08:04.975 --> 00:08:07.241
It isn't...
Enough...

00:08:07.275 --> 00:08:10.141
My obsession
isn't enough!

00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:19.175
Great idea! Let's add
more flames to the fire!

00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:25.841
Keisei.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.149
The eye of a contracted
monk is one thing...

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.996
But being exposed

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.363
to the contents of my
casket is another.

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.996
It makes this eye
incredibly valuable,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.930
more powerful than
the blood of dozens.

00:08:57.063 --> 00:08:59.863
You're not worthy
to touch me.

00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:10.296
No...

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.363
Keisei... Get up!

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:13.963
The lost little
girl routine

00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:16.663
doesn't seem to suit
you all that well.

00:09:16.696 --> 00:09:19.430
Maybe if you were a human
instead of a Shikabane.

00:09:19.463 --> 00:09:20.930
Your contracted monk
should see

00:09:20.963 --> 00:09:25.096
what you really are
before he leaves this world.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.930
Tagami...!
Impossible!

00:09:28.963 --> 00:09:29.796
Keisei.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.163
So here's where
you've been hiding!

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:35.363
We're not finished yet!

00:09:35.396 --> 00:09:36.830
Makina!

00:09:36.863 --> 00:09:40.096
Let's see how you do
when you can't breathe!

00:09:47.863 --> 00:09:49.896
What's...
Happening?

00:09:52.963 --> 00:09:55.230
How did...
What'd you do to me?

00:09:55.263 --> 00:09:56.130
Shikimi is a poison

00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:58.430
that circulates
through your whole body.

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:00.430
You fool...! By putting
that in your mouth,

00:10:00.463 --> 00:10:02.663
you've just sealed
your own fate!

00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:05.230
I've had more than enough
of your nonsense...!

00:10:05.263 --> 00:10:06.996
Instead of talking...

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.996
Perhaps you should
have realized...

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.896
That the both of you
are well with my range!

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.263
Open now, my zadan!

00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:17.996
Those are scriptures!

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.663
He can hurt Shikabane.

00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:23.396
But at the risk of
sacrificing himself.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.230
His eye...!

00:10:25.263 --> 00:10:27.896
That's the eye of someone
who's accepted their own death!

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.963
Keisei... What are
you doing...?

00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:33.963
Keisei. What's
happening to me?

00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:40.696
Senior, wait!

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.696
Stop and I'll tell
you the truth...

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:43.696
Don't you
want to know?

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.363
Save your breath!
Senior!

00:10:45.396 --> 00:10:47.263
Your kind of truth leads
to the death and destruction

00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:48.363
of innocent people...!

00:10:48.396 --> 00:10:51.930
And it caused you to murder
your own Shikabane Hime!

00:10:51.963 --> 00:10:53.963
I don't ever
need to know!

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.663
No!

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:06.830
Keisei.

00:11:06.863 --> 00:11:10.796
That was stupid,
Keisei.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.330
This is all
your fault.

00:11:12.363 --> 00:11:15.763
I'm sorry... This is all
my fault... If I hadn't-...

00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:17.896
Shut your mouth!

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.696
Don't tell me
you're sorry...

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.796
If you do...

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.996
I'll kill you
where you stand.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.763
Keisei knew what
he was doing...

00:11:25.796 --> 00:11:28.263
None of this
is your fault.

00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:30.696
He fought for those
that he swore to protect...

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.263
And his family.

00:11:32.296 --> 00:11:34.396
This was
never about you!

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.830
Makina... I never intended
to screw things up so badly.

00:11:38.863 --> 00:11:42.630
Ouri... I have
a favor to ask.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.396
I need you to help...

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.230
Makina and the
others in my place.

00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:52.363
I don't...
understand.

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:56.396
You can't... You can't transfer
the contract... You promised.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.030
I know.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.696
I refuse to...
I won't let you do this.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.196
You'll always be...

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.396
My one and only
contracted monk.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.863
I'm sorry, Makina.

00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:17.196
I can't continue on...

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.396
Deep down...
I know you understand.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.363
I wish I had time
to explain...

00:12:22.396 --> 00:12:26.063
To give you a reason to accept
what I'm asking of you.

00:12:26.096 --> 00:12:28.163
You may even resent me.

00:12:28.196 --> 00:12:32.063
But you saw what
happened... to Minai.

00:12:32.096 --> 00:12:34.196
A Shikabane Hime without
her contracted monk

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.696
either dies instantly or
becomes just another Shikabane.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.430
I don't wish that
to happen to Makina.

00:12:40.463 --> 00:12:43.163
I don't care what
happens to me!

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:45.296
What does it matter
if I die...?

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.196
I'm dead already.

00:12:49.163 --> 00:12:51.930
Okay... I'll do it.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.896
Mantra...

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.063
Even if my body
is destroyed...

00:13:03.096 --> 00:13:05.330
The wisdom it
carried is not.

00:13:05.363 --> 00:13:07.930
My palm holds
my philosophy.

00:13:07.963 --> 00:13:10.696
Spirit... of great
awakening and power.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.330
I implore you to shine
your graceful light upon him

00:13:13.363 --> 00:13:15.163
as you did me.

00:13:20.463 --> 00:13:24.296
Flesh...!
I must have flesh...!

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.996
You have to give
me your Shikabane!

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.196
Yes... It's yours.

00:13:34.863 --> 00:13:37.130
Every last
one of them...

00:13:37.163 --> 00:13:40.696
Will die at the
hands of Kowaku!

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.196
When he comes to,
the transfer will be complete.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.230
Get Ouri
to a safe place.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.663
Don't take me...
Take Ouri.

00:13:54.696 --> 00:13:56.363
I'll contact
the head temple...

00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:58.230
And get you
to a hospital.

00:13:58.263 --> 00:13:59.763
Makina.

00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:03.863
I can't do this...
I just can't do it.

00:14:03.896 --> 00:14:06.063
I can't just
leave you here...

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.830
To die.

00:14:07.863 --> 00:14:09.163
You don't have
a choice in the matter.

00:14:09.196 --> 00:14:11.296
Your place is at
Ouri's side now.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.296
No, it's not.
I belong with you, Keisei.

00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:24.396
I'm sorry... Makina.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.296
I couldn't...
Keep my promise.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.163
Your promise?

00:14:30.196 --> 00:14:32.996
I promised that together
we would fight.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.230
I don't care...

00:14:34.263 --> 00:14:36.896
That promise means
nothing to me now!

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.330
You have to live...
I need you to live.

00:14:40.363 --> 00:14:42.863
You won't have to fight
anymore... Understand?

00:14:42.896 --> 00:14:44.363
Thank you, Makina.

00:14:44.396 --> 00:14:46.230
Spending my days
fighting alongside

00:14:46.263 --> 00:14:47.996
you means
everything to me.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.430
The impact we made
is worth all of this...

00:14:50.463 --> 00:14:52.030
And more.

00:14:52.063 --> 00:14:54.296
Please don't cry.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.130
In my last moments,
I want to see you smile.

00:14:57.163 --> 00:14:58.896
Kei...

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.196
Smile for me... Makina.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.130
If you smile...

00:15:04.163 --> 00:15:06.330
I'll feel as though
I was able save you

00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:08.196
from this hellish place...

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.163
Even if it's a lie.

00:15:11.196 --> 00:15:12.763
Obsessions...

00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:15.030
Regrets right
before death.

00:15:15.063 --> 00:15:16.963
Dwelling on a regret...

00:15:16.996 --> 00:15:19.996
Would force Keisei
to turn into a Shikabane.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.130
Even so...

00:15:23.163 --> 00:15:25.763
At least he'd
still be alive.

00:15:30.457 --> 00:15:32.174
Keisei.

00:15:32.627 --> 00:15:34.560
Look at me.

00:15:40.594 --> 00:15:50.827
[Music]

00:15:50.827 --> 00:16:19.194
[Music]

00:16:19.227 --> 00:16:21.060
Keisei...

00:16:21.094 --> 00:16:23.294
No.

00:16:23.327 --> 00:16:26.060
We have to get to Senior
Tagami immediately!

00:16:26.094 --> 00:16:28.227
No time to waste!

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.460
You feel it,
don't you?

00:16:43.427 --> 00:16:46.360
Sadahiro... I thought
you went to bed already.

00:16:46.394 --> 00:16:47.527
We're heading back.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.260
What...? If Keisei Tagami
finds out we're still in town,

00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:51.527
there's gonna be trouble.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.827
Well... Something tells me we
won't need to worry about him.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.394
Not anymore.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.394
Where is she?

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:09.960
Where is his
Shikabane Hime hiding...?

00:17:09.994 --> 00:17:10.960
Answer me!

00:17:10.994 --> 00:17:12.860
Over here!

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:28.327
[Music]

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.327
I will destroy you...

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.394
And every other
Shikabane...

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:34.260
I'll kill every
last one of you!

00:17:34.294 --> 00:17:36.494
Don't be too sure,
brat...!

00:17:36.527 --> 00:17:39.860
I'm even
stronger than before!

00:17:39.894 --> 00:17:44.194
[Music]

00:17:44.227 --> 00:17:46.160
Disappear...

00:17:46.194 --> 00:17:48.027
Get out
of my sight...

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.060
And out of my memories...

00:17:50.094 --> 00:17:52.060
Leave this world!

00:17:52.094 --> 00:17:54.260
Where could she be getting
this kind of power...?

00:17:54.294 --> 00:17:56.460
She's acting like a
completely different person!

00:17:56.494 --> 00:17:57.494
Wait a minute!

00:17:57.527 --> 00:17:59.094
I can't tell...

00:17:59.127 --> 00:18:01.027
If the girl standing
before me...

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.560
Is really Makina.

00:18:22.627 --> 00:18:24.894
She's performing a curse.

00:18:24.927 --> 00:18:26.394
Even though she's
a Shikabane Hime,

00:18:26.427 --> 00:18:30.194
she still has the ability
to curse like normal Shikabane.

00:18:30.227 --> 00:18:33.094
Damning all Shikabane
of the world is her curse.

00:18:33.127 --> 00:18:34.360
However.

00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:36.327
It's her all right.

00:18:39.194 --> 00:18:42.060
My hands...
They're burning...

00:18:42.094 --> 00:18:44.460
Its feels like
I'm on fire.

00:18:59.527 --> 00:19:02.127
The power is
overwhelming him.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.827
Keisei.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.327
It was foolish to make
this impulsive decision...

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.360
Your Shikabane Hime

00:19:07.394 --> 00:19:09.927
is shortening her new
contracted monk's life...

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.860
And turning it into power.

00:19:11.894 --> 00:19:13.260
There's no way anyone
without the proper training

00:19:13.294 --> 00:19:15.527
could bear this burden.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.927
Soon...
He'll die.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.427
Makina...

00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:25.427
Is this everything
you'd hoped for, Ouri?

00:19:31.027 --> 00:19:33.394
Take your hands
off of me!

00:19:33.427 --> 00:19:35.894
Seems you have a
brain after all.

00:19:35.927 --> 00:19:38.527
It's just in a different
form than others.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.060
Stop... Please...
I'll do anything!

00:19:42.094 --> 00:19:45.227
I want to keep living...!
It doesn't matter in what form,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.860
I want to live!

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:49.127
Allow me to repeat what
you said two years ago

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.227
before you killed me.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.394
How ungraceful.

00:20:04.194 --> 00:20:07.827
Wait... You're... planning
on keeping the kid?

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.227
My temple... has
a child welfare center.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.527
You want to raise him?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.494
I don't have a choice...
Besides...

00:20:14.527 --> 00:20:17.327
I've come
to care for him.

00:20:43.294 --> 00:20:46.327
I still have
lingering emotions.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.494
Never again...
This is the last time.

00:21:15.127 --> 00:21:18.827
The day dawned.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.427
The morning of my
16th birthday...

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.394
The long night's
madness had ended.

00:21:23.427 --> 00:21:26.094
I lost... my father...
My brother...

00:21:26.127 --> 00:21:29.194
And my best friend
all in one night.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.094
And became
a contracted monk.

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:13.827
[Music]

00:23:39.494 --> 00:23:41.894
It's been said
that funeral services

00:23:41.927 --> 00:23:45.294
are like banquets
to Shikabane Hime.

00:23:45.327 --> 00:23:49.260
The world unknown
anticipates your arrival.

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:52.127
"Funeral Program
for a Contracted Monk."
