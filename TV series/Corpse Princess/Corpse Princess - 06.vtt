00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.600
[Music]

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.810
I must admit
I'm curious,

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:48.376
do you know
what they truly are?

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.310
They fight only to
fulfill a contract.

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:55.710
If they succeed in
destroying 108 Shikabane...

00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:58.876
they can make it
into heaven.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.110
Into heaven?

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:07.776
Itsuki,
you're all right!

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.310
C'mon!

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:21.543
Itsuki, no...
You too?

00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:24.376
She murders
her own kind.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.143
I am Takamasa
Sougi, Genpaku...

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.610
I am a contracted monk.

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:40.710
Don't move.

00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:45.876
Umehara's
favorite disciple

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.743
is the new Genpaku
if I'm not mistaken.

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:50.876
For generations,
those in the Sougi family

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.176
that have become Genpaku have
proven to be fierce warriors.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.143
According to tradition, Takamine
belongs to the Shuhou faction.

00:02:58.176 --> 00:02:59.810
However, Umehara doesn't
work for the Shuhou

00:02:59.843 --> 00:03:02.276
or the Shujou faction.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.343
So he was the one sent in
to investigate Keisei, huh?

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:08.310
If that's the case, we
can just leave everything else

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:11.243
up to Genpaku and
see what happens.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:13.376
We're aware of the fact
that Ouri Kagami...

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.876
has appeared during several of
the last Shikabane encounters.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.843
I don't get it.

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:21.176
What about
the traitor monk?

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:25.476
Akasha Shishidou has
been sighted in the area.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.210
If Sho-Sojo Tagami has anything
to do with the traitor monk...

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:32.143
The actions of his brother
may mean something.

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:34.276
According to our
extensive research...

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.776
Akasha shared a room with
Sho-Sojo Tagami years ago.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.343
Your research
is misleading.

00:03:39.376 --> 00:03:40.910
Tagami wasn't his
only roommate.

00:03:40.943 --> 00:03:42.876
I shared
that room as well.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.276
I am aware of that.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.176
I see then...
I gotta find Akasha now.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.176
If Keisei and Ouri
are working with him...

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.910
I'll take care of
both of them as well.

00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:57.310
Although there are nearly
100 Shikabane Hime...

00:03:57.343 --> 00:03:59.610
Yours remains to be
the only one permitted

00:03:59.643 --> 00:04:02.843
to terminate human beings
as well as Shikabane.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.543
I'm counting on you.

00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:17.643
Have things really
come down to this?

00:04:17.676 --> 00:04:19.810
What are
you talking about?

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.276
As of right now,
Sho-Sojo Mee-bu might have to...

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.476
If he is to discover that they
have been in communications

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.876
with the traitor monk...

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.310
More than likely, he will
neutralize Sho-Sojo Tagami.

00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:34.243
Everything... Is for the
survival of the Kougon Sect.

00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:48.876
From what
I know about Ouri,

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.876
he doesn't seem like the type
to get mixed up with Akasha.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.476
But you'll kill him,
won't you?

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.243
You ready?

00:04:59.643 --> 00:05:02.443
Itsuki is a
Shikabane Hime?

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:05.243
More than one Shikabane
Hime can exist?

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:06.376
Well...

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.410
I think there are more of us
than you think there are,

00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:10.376
does that make sense?

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.176
What's that
teacher doing here?

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.676
I guess you could say...
He's like an added bonus.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.476
Or a babysitter!

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.543
He's a contracted monk.

00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:22.576
You didn't think your big
brother was the only one?

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.843
How the hell do you
know my brother?

00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:27.276
We have a history...

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.443
He was even there
on the day...

00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:32.476
Don't try to
interfere in this...

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.710
I have to...

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:37.243
Did you just
pistol whip me?

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:39.310
I'm not the
one interfering!

00:05:39.343 --> 00:05:40.343
What?

00:05:40.376 --> 00:05:41.710
The rental car...

00:05:41.743 --> 00:05:43.843
He used it to gather all
of those people together...

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:46.676
Forcing them to
kill one another.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.476
And do you
wanna know why?

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.510
To produce Shikabane!

00:05:51.543 --> 00:05:53.843
The two of us can
take this guy down...

00:05:53.876 --> 00:05:56.210
There's nothing you can do,
so stay out of it!

00:05:56.243 --> 00:05:58.343
Run, Ouri! Get the
hell out of here...!

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:00.143
Go!

00:06:09.343 --> 00:06:10.810
Such a shame...

00:06:10.843 --> 00:06:14.143
Things were just starting
to get a little interesting.

00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:17.176
At least, now we know he
isn't working with you.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.243
Finding a way to handle it is
a problem for the Kougon Sect.

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:21.576
I've heard of you...

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.476
The monk who betrayed
his calling...

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.610
attacked the head temple,
stole ritual scriptures...

00:06:26.643 --> 00:06:28.643
And murdered his
own Shikabane Hime.

00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:30.576
Stop,
I'm blushing...

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.710
Looks like my reputation
has proceeded me.

00:06:32.743 --> 00:06:34.843
Allow me to
introduce myself...

00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:36.876
Former head of
Gon-Sho-Sojos...

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.143
I am Akasha Shishidou.

00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:40.676
I just have to know...

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.343
Why would you kill your
own Shikabane Hime?

00:06:43.376 --> 00:06:46.576
And why on earth would you be
trying to create Shikabane?

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.710
Well... I would hope
you were smart enough

00:06:48.743 --> 00:06:50.510
to figure it out
on your own.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.610
Then again... Your brain
is probably just as dead

00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:55.543
as the rest of your
walking corpse.

00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:00.576
I may not be the hero of
this story, sweetheart.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.310
But that doesn't
make me a Shikabane.

00:07:03.343 --> 00:07:05.543
Can you, a simple
little Shikabane Hime,

00:07:05.576 --> 00:07:07.576
really take a human life?

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.843
I find it hard
to believe

00:07:08.876 --> 00:07:10.776
that the Kougon Sect
would allow such a thing.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.743
She will do whatever
she needs to do

00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:15.843
in order to bring you to
the head temple, Akasha.

00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:19.843
Defiled.

00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:21.776
You gonna cry?

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.610
How dare you touch me with
those cold, dead hands of yours.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.843
What's that?

00:07:30.843 --> 00:07:34.643
It's a shame to waste this
on someone like you...

00:07:34.676 --> 00:07:36.876
But you must
learn a lesson...

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.576
For laying a hand on me.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.776
Open...
My zadan technique!

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.610
No, a zadan
technique?

00:07:47.643 --> 00:07:49.810
On-Jiri-Chei-Sowaka...

00:07:51.743 --> 00:07:54.110
Itsuki!
Move away!

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:58.610
I can't!

00:07:58.643 --> 00:08:00.610
Lotus Flower!

00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:14.643
There's nothing you can do,
so stay out of it!

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:17.810
Stay out of it...
Heard that before.

00:08:17.843 --> 00:08:20.810
If you really want to help,
don't get involved.

00:08:39.476 --> 00:08:42.543
What the hell
am I doing here?

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.643
I can't see the
Shikabane's brain.

00:09:22.476 --> 00:09:25.210
If you don't
wanna die, beat it!

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:29.243
That girl said
the same thing.

00:09:29.276 --> 00:09:30.543
Itsuki?

00:09:30.576 --> 00:09:32.210
You know her,
don't you...?

00:09:32.243 --> 00:09:34.276
Because you're both
Shikabane Hime?

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.643
I've seen her
around before...

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:37.143
That's all you
need to know.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.810
Why were you
with her?

00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:41.210
You... Said if
I got involved

00:09:41.243 --> 00:09:42.810
that it would end up
hurting my brother.

00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:44.676
What did you
mean by that?

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.543
Not sure if you'd
noticed, Ouri...

00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:48.143
But this really
isn't the best time...

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:50.743
Answer the question!

00:09:50.776 --> 00:09:53.543
When someone has a duty
to protect a person...

00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:56.376
They can exert an unusual
amount of strength...

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.510
Years ago...
A monk ended up dying

00:09:58.543 --> 00:09:59.710
because he was
betrayed by someone

00:09:59.743 --> 00:10:01.643
he was trying
to protect.

00:10:01.676 --> 00:10:02.810
Are you saying that
Brother might die

00:10:02.843 --> 00:10:05.543
if I keep
getting involved?

00:10:05.576 --> 00:10:07.343
If you were
to step in,.

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:10.443
the scar inside Keisei's heart
would be larger than ever.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.910
Do you understand...?

00:10:12.943 --> 00:10:15.543
That's why I don't want you
to come closer to our side.

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.243
It's not for
Brother's sake...

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:19.443
It's for your own,
isn't it?

00:10:19.476 --> 00:10:21.710
Killing 108 Shikabane,...

00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:24.743
Gets you into heaven,
isn't that right?

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.476
You're right... That's
the contract I agreed to.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.276
Do you care about
anything else...?

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.276
Or is earning
your wings it?

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.576
If you wanna die,
go right ahead and die...!

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.576
But don't take my
Brother with you!

00:10:40.343 --> 00:10:41.610
I do care.

00:10:41.643 --> 00:10:43.676
Makina!

00:10:45.376 --> 00:10:47.243
It's gone!

00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:18.986
Keisei...

00:11:40.653 --> 00:11:42.386
Do it!

00:11:51.886 --> 00:11:53.353
Brother!

00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:55.386
What're you doing?!

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.286
I made a promise.

00:12:02.319 --> 00:12:03.553
What do you
mean a promise...?

00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:06.319
A promise that puts your life
on the line for some girl...?

00:12:06.353 --> 00:12:10.419
And makes it okay for you
to chop her arm off?

00:12:10.453 --> 00:12:11.519
Please tell me,
what kind of promise

00:12:11.553 --> 00:12:13.386
could be worth
all of this?

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:15.386
She doesn't do
this for rewards...

00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:18.086
Not even for Heaven.

00:12:22.653 --> 00:12:25.153
From the moment she was
resurrected as a Shikabane...

00:12:25.186 --> 00:12:27.419
She has
only two choices.

00:12:27.453 --> 00:12:29.319
She can either violate
the world of the living,

00:12:29.353 --> 00:12:31.853
acting on her regrets
as a Shikabane.

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:33.586
Or attempt
to keep her humanity

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:37.119
by being a Shikabane Hime
and kill all Shikabane.

00:12:37.153 --> 00:12:39.419
The price tag on either
of them is too great!

00:12:39.453 --> 00:12:42.519
True... but she lives
with her choice.

00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:45.153
My choice...
my promise...

00:12:45.186 --> 00:12:47.719
is to stay by her side.

00:13:23.653 --> 00:13:25.319
Keisei...

00:13:33.786 --> 00:13:36.353
There it is.

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:52.486
I trust everyone else

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:54.819
in the rental car
made it out all right?

00:13:54.853 --> 00:13:57.653
There was one other person,
but I haven't seen her.

00:14:01.286 --> 00:14:03.786
Now, you're sure he called
himself the traitor monk?

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:07.353
I'm sure... he knew
about you as well as me.

00:14:07.386 --> 00:14:08.819
Akasha...

00:14:08.853 --> 00:14:10.753
Who is that,
Keisei?

00:14:12.253 --> 00:14:15.153
Wait, don't!

00:14:15.186 --> 00:14:17.219
Just an ordinary Souma...

00:14:17.253 --> 00:14:19.619
The Kougon Sect's
special elixir.

00:14:19.653 --> 00:14:20.686
If it really is him...

00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:22.153
But what about...

00:14:22.186 --> 00:14:23.853
Doesn't it have a
strong side effect?

00:14:23.886 --> 00:14:25.719
I'll be fine.

00:14:25.753 --> 00:14:28.786
Brother...
Makina...

00:14:28.819 --> 00:14:31.553
I understand why your promise
is so important now...

00:14:31.586 --> 00:14:33.319
I'm sorry.

00:14:33.353 --> 00:14:34.419
Brother...

00:14:34.453 --> 00:14:37.553
All I need is for you to
promise me this one thing...

00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:40.353
Promise me you won't die.

00:14:40.386 --> 00:14:42.119
Do not seek death...

00:14:42.153 --> 00:14:44.519
but do not
fear it either...

00:14:44.553 --> 00:14:46.253
There cannot be
life without death.

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:48.219
It is inescapable.

00:14:50.253 --> 00:14:53.619
I'm sorry, little brother...
I can't promise that.

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:13.419
Itsuki...

00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:17.753
Genpaku...

00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:21.153
When did you become
in charge of this district?

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:25.286
Senior Tagami...
I'm sorry, I was sent here.

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:29.419
I see... You're here
investigating Ouri and me.

00:15:29.453 --> 00:15:31.219
Akasha...

00:15:31.253 --> 00:15:34.786
Its been a long time,
Senior... Hasn't it?

00:15:34.819 --> 00:15:36.219
Makina!

00:15:36.253 --> 00:15:38.253
You can't do anything
with your wounds.

00:15:38.286 --> 00:15:41.286
He's using
a zadan technique.

00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:43.586
A zadan technique?

00:15:43.619 --> 00:15:45.553
Just like
Shikabane Hime...

00:15:45.586 --> 00:15:46.819
Zadan is a technique
that's meant

00:15:46.853 --> 00:15:50.153
to symbolize
the Kougon Sect.

00:15:50.186 --> 00:15:52.786
You make yourself head monk
within the ceremonial altar...

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:55.453
Open a scripture using
a holy instrument...

00:15:55.486 --> 00:15:57.686
This causes a miracle with
the help of the stars...

00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:00.153
and infinite power.

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:02.453
That's a miracle?

00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:03.553
Five years ago...

00:16:03.586 --> 00:16:06.186
Sadahiro and I were the
only ones with the ability

00:16:06.219 --> 00:16:08.553
to perform the
zadan technique.

00:16:08.586 --> 00:16:12.186
This is the first time you
or that vestigial Genpaku...

00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:15.419
have seen such an
advanced zadan, isn't it?

00:16:15.453 --> 00:16:17.853
They are...
Shikabane.

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:20.786
Yes... I gave
their lives purpose.

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:22.553
They were fortunate enough
to become Shikabane

00:16:22.586 --> 00:16:24.719
after killing one another
in the rental car...

00:16:24.753 --> 00:16:26.586
I trapped them
in my zadan.

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:30.353
Their regrets... He's using the
Shikabane like a damn battery!

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:41.219
How is this any different
from the Kougon Sect

00:16:41.253 --> 00:16:44.486
using the power
of Shikabane Hime?

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:47.719
I don't allow my Shikabane to
keep their pathetic feelings...

00:16:47.753 --> 00:16:49.653
They're used
simply for power.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:51.219
Take it from me,

00:16:51.253 --> 00:16:53.686
they suffer much less in
such an unenlightened state.

00:16:53.719 --> 00:16:55.619
You're wrong!

00:16:55.653 --> 00:16:58.286
You murdered those kids,
not once but twice.

00:16:58.319 --> 00:17:00.253
Making them kill each
other off in cold blood

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:01.419
to create Shikabane.

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:02.753
And the second
they resurrected,

00:17:02.786 --> 00:17:05.753
you used them to create
that forsaken zadan.

00:17:05.786 --> 00:17:09.353
You always had a soft spot
for the young ones, Senior...

00:17:09.386 --> 00:17:12.119
If you love your walking
corpse this much...

00:17:12.153 --> 00:17:15.553
it's only a matter of time
before you love Shikabane, too.

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:17.598
Makina!

00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:22.844
In order to open a zadan
of that level,...

00:17:23.714 --> 00:17:25.214
he'd need a powerful
holy instrument.

00:17:25.247 --> 00:17:26.880
I don't know if it's
a holy instrument...

00:17:26.914 --> 00:17:28.980
But he put out
a dark-red box.

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:31.247
We're gonna have to cut
nap time short, princess.

00:17:35.014 --> 00:17:38.247
Makina, were you able to
patch things up with Ouri?

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.947
You're hilarious...

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.180
Stop kidding around and help
me break this zadan technique!

00:17:43.447 --> 00:17:45.247
Don't try
to order me around.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.914
Your bullets are useless.

00:17:49.714 --> 00:17:52.614
Guns aren't necessarily
used for shooting.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.214
That's it.

00:18:11.247 --> 00:18:13.814
Brother!

00:18:13.847 --> 00:18:15.247
Senior!

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.647
Keisei!

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.014
If you don't have
the mediation...

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.647
Going after the mediation
was a wise decision.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.014
As you can see, this casket
is no ordinary instrument.

00:18:41.047 --> 00:18:45.214
It's the blood of 108 people
at the end of their lives.

00:18:45.247 --> 00:18:47.847
Brother!

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.847
Even just one person's regrets
can have great power

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.047
when they transform
into Shikabane.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.014
And he said 108 people.

00:18:55.047 --> 00:18:57.247
Simply touching the box
would cause spiritual trauma.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.780
Any average person

00:18:58.814 --> 00:19:02.114
would have been knocked
immediately unconscious.

00:19:02.147 --> 00:19:03.814
Come on, Senior...

00:19:03.847 --> 00:19:05.414
You must have known that
this was bound to happen

00:19:05.447 --> 00:19:09.647
because of your
love for her.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.380
You would know better
than I about a love

00:19:11.414 --> 00:19:14.647
for Shikabane Hime,
Akasha.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.880
Is that why...?

00:19:16.914 --> 00:19:19.214
You betrayed everyone
within the Kougon Sect?

00:19:19.247 --> 00:19:21.414
Because you couldn't stand
to look your Shikabane Hime

00:19:21.447 --> 00:19:23.914
in the eyes
for one more second?

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:27.180
Know this, Senior...

00:19:27.214 --> 00:19:28.280
With everything
that I have done,

00:19:28.314 --> 00:19:31.214
I never betrayed
the Kougon Sect.

00:19:31.247 --> 00:19:32.214
They are the deceivers.

00:19:32.247 --> 00:19:34.914
The Kougon Sect
betrayed me.

00:19:44.847 --> 00:19:47.314
He couldn't
have moved!

00:19:51.114 --> 00:19:52.647
Souma!

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.047
Idiot...! Do you realize
what you've done?

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.114
The blood inside
will flow out!

00:19:57.147 --> 00:19:59.414
Resulting in the regrets
and obsessions of 108 people

00:19:59.447 --> 00:20:01.180
to fall on us.

00:20:01.214 --> 00:20:02.680
If you suffer
a spiritual trauma,

00:20:02.714 --> 00:20:05.314
your body is going
to be greatly affected too.

00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:06.347
What can I say?

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.414
It seemed like a
good idea...

00:20:08.447 --> 00:20:10.080
Sorry.

00:20:15.014 --> 00:20:16.914
My trauma
doesn't compare...

00:20:16.947 --> 00:20:20.347
The pain and suffering will be
much worse for you, old friend.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.980
What...? That was
no ordinary bullet...

00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:35.414
It had a zadan technique!

00:20:35.447 --> 00:20:36.747
Of course.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.214
Do you have
to stand so close?

00:20:38.247 --> 00:20:40.680
Not much choice
in the matter...

00:20:40.714 --> 00:20:42.680
I need to be this close
in order to use my zadan

00:20:42.714 --> 00:20:44.214
with your bullets.

00:20:44.247 --> 00:20:46.347
Sadahiro.

00:20:48.147 --> 00:20:50.880
This is far
from over, Senior.

00:20:50.914 --> 00:20:55.147
My Shikabane will triumph in
annihilating the Kougon Sect...

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.314
Until next time.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.347
Is he okay?

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.180
Keisei used Akasha's mediation
as some sort of shield,

00:21:15.214 --> 00:21:17.914
he knew that he would
suffer spiritual trauma.

00:21:17.947 --> 00:21:19.714
At least, now we know
he isn't in alliance

00:21:19.747 --> 00:21:21.980
with the traitor monk.

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:24.180
Are you relieved?

00:21:24.214 --> 00:21:26.180
Then... There's no problem

00:21:26.214 --> 00:21:29.414
reinstating Keisei Tagami's
position as Guardian?

00:21:29.447 --> 00:21:31.314
Yes.

00:21:35.147 --> 00:21:37.647
And as for, Akasha...

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.347
Will he...
be okay?

00:21:44.347 --> 00:21:46.280
Since Keisei
refuses to do so,

00:21:46.314 --> 00:21:50.047
I'll make the promise
in his place.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.380
I won't let Keisei die...

00:21:52.414 --> 00:21:55.880
I will always protect
him, no matter what.

00:22:08.947 --> 00:22:13.947
[Music]

00:23:40.347 --> 00:23:43.947
Humans can understand each
other because they use words?

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.847
What a joke.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.947
Humans always get confused
by their meanings.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.247
They're controlled by

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.280
"The False Power of Words."
