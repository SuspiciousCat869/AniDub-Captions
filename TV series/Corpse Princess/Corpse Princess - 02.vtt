00:01:48.638 --> 00:01:49.882
What the hell
happened up there?

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:15.578
This girl right here...

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:18.278
She didn't live very
far away from us.

00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:21.378
Used to stop by all the time
to play with the other kids.

00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:25.178
She looks familiar,
I may have seen her.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:28.044
I don't think that any parent
would want their children

00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:31.978
spending their free time hanging
around a place like this.

00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:36.011
But Hikaru still dropped
by here as much as she could.

00:02:36.044 --> 00:02:38.811
Looks like Shouta's
pretty upset about it.

00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:41.011
He chased her
all the time.

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:44.144
To think the poor thing died
in an accident like that...

00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:45.211
We're orphans.

00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:47.478
When people are nice to us,
it means the world,

00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.378
which could be
how he saw her.

00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:53.944
See... It's kinda like how
I've always thought of you

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:56.111
as my mother.

00:02:56.144 --> 00:02:57.844
Thank you.

00:03:03.278 --> 00:03:06.211
Hikaru's wake
is tomorrow.

00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:09.244
Do you wanna
go with me?

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:11.011
We should say goodbye.

00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:12.178
Idiot.

00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:13.078
What did you call me?!

00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:14.378
It's a big story!

00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:17.411
The place'll be crawling
with news crews!

00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:19.344
But you want us to
show up as her friends

00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:20.878
so the whole
world can see

00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:24.178
that Hikaru hung around
with loser orphans!

00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:26.544
I don't want her to be
remembered that way...

00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:28.378
I'm not like you.

00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:30.478
I can see the
bigger picture.

00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:32.011
But...

00:03:46.344 --> 00:03:48.444
Ouri, you stopped by!

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.444
Perfect timing.

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:55.378
I found these ZENBU NOSE figures
if you wanted to take some.

00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:58.244
Who would ever
want that junk?!

00:03:58.278 --> 00:04:00.444
Oh you know you like
that sorta thing.

Even the sky is
shedding tears today

00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:15.211
for this young life
lost too soon.

What happened to Hikaru?

00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:23.344
Hello... Have I reached
the Kougon Sect...?

00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:24.811
My name is Nakamura.

00:05:24.844 --> 00:05:27.078
I'm connected with
the Shinko Temple.

00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:29.411
Call an ambulance!

00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:36.344
And here we go again...

How anyone can turn a
simple Bunsen burner

00:05:38.444 --> 00:05:41.478
into a flame thrower
is beyond me.

00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:43.911
Sorry I've never
used one of these.

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:45.578
Yeah, that's
the problem...

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.144
Hey, manager, just
wanted to let you know

00:05:47.178 --> 00:05:50.111
our part-timer's useless!

00:05:50.144 --> 00:05:52.278
Hello?

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:53.411
TV said that one
of those kids

00:05:53.444 --> 00:05:56.311
who died in that accident
last week came back to life.

00:05:56.344 --> 00:05:57.311
What?!

00:05:57.344 --> 00:05:58.911

<i>has come to life again.</i>

00:06:04.144 --> 00:06:05.178
Well... at least
the miracle happened

00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:07.244
to one of the pretty girls
and not one of the dogs.

00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:08.944
Jerk!

00:06:08.978 --> 00:06:10.211
I'll stop.

00:06:13.044 --> 00:06:15.378
I'm heading home,
good night.

00:06:31.244 --> 00:06:33.044
Are you sure you
don't have to go?

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:34.444
Nah.

00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:36.478
If someone supposedly dies
but then appears at a wake

00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:38.844
or a funeral, the
incident report is made

00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:41.544
to the Kougon Sect regardless
of the sect or religion.

00:06:41.578 --> 00:06:43.011
It's kind of an
understood rule.

00:06:43.044 --> 00:06:44.444
Been like that
for a while.

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:46.311
So, I'm sure whoever's
in charge of this area's

00:06:46.344 --> 00:06:48.478
already started
investigating.

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:50.044
I doubt that they're
gonna have to call

00:06:50.078 --> 00:06:52.344
on a reserve
unit like us.

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:55.244
This area's managed
by Keisei Tagami.

00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:57.578
Yep... But I bet
you didn't know

00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:00.978
that our part-timer just
happens to be Keisei's brother.

00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:05.578
What...? But I thought
his last name was Kagami.

00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:08.244
Well, the kid was actually
taken in by Keisei.

00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:10.544
If he was given the last name
Tagami he'd be obligated

00:07:10.578 --> 00:07:14.378
to follow the rules
of the Kougon Sect.

00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:17.178
So his name's different
by one character.

00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:18.544
Wait.

00:07:18.578 --> 00:07:21.944
Does Keisei know that Ouri
is here, working with us?

00:07:21.978 --> 00:07:23.944
Why would he?

00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:25.444
I mean, come on, the
guy's clueless that

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:31.144
you and I are on his
turf right now.

00:07:31.178 --> 00:07:34.111
Pretty much the story
of our lives, isn't it?

00:07:38.178 --> 00:07:40.344
Come on, hurry, get
the camera ready!

00:07:40.378 --> 00:07:42.278
What are they
doing now...?

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:44.878
Why don't they
just leave her alone?

00:08:06.244 --> 00:08:09.511
What's the matter?
Come on!

00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:13.378
I really just need to leave
this with a nurse or somebody...

00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:15.511
Where are you taking me?

00:08:15.544 --> 00:08:17.211
Where are you?

00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:24.478
That's her.

00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:27.878
That's the girl I saw
Brother bring back to life.

00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:32.878
She's the same as Hikaru.

00:09:01.978 --> 00:09:04.078
Well, there's no need
for confirmation.

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.311
It's already on the move.

00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:07.811
Yeah, alright...

00:09:07.844 --> 00:09:10.011
You gonna be
okay by yourself?

00:09:10.044 --> 00:09:11.878
I'll be fine...
What about you?

00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:13.544
Where are you stuck?

00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:21.411
Who's she talking to?

00:09:21.444 --> 00:09:23.811
I'm sure it'll
wrap up tightly...

00:09:23.844 --> 00:09:25.111
Just try to take care
of your end of this

00:09:25.144 --> 00:09:26.778
as quickly as you can.

00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:33.244
Very well...
This way, please.

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:40.244
It's hard isn't it...
When it's a child.

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:41.811
How's Makina
by the way?

00:09:41.844 --> 00:09:43.878
Don't talk like you
know everything.

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.326
Our little game of hide
and seek is over.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.080
And are you sure that's the
form you wanna take right now...

00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:50.980
I swear, you kids...
no sense of style.

00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:11.047
I'm about to wake you up
from the nightmare you're in!

00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:20.880
Don't shoot me!

00:11:23.347 --> 00:11:24.613
What are you doing here?

00:11:24.647 --> 00:11:25.947
You again!

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.413
Yeah, that's right...

00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:29.513
And you're the girl from
the woods the other day.

00:11:29.547 --> 00:11:31.047
Get out of here!

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.247
What's going on?

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.547
Get out of here now!!

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.247
Please help me!

00:11:41.513 --> 00:11:43.313
Help me...!

00:11:43.347 --> 00:11:44.480
We have to go now!

00:11:44.513 --> 00:11:46.013
But, uh...

00:11:46.047 --> 00:11:47.147
Okay...

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.847
Hurry!

00:11:53.647 --> 00:11:55.247
Yeah.

00:12:14.113 --> 00:12:16.180
What do you mean,
the others?

00:12:16.213 --> 00:12:17.547
The others who died
in the accident.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.780
The other kids.

00:12:18.813 --> 00:12:21.247
We've heard that two more of
their bodies have disappeared.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.080
But unlike with Hikaru,
there weren't any witnesses.

00:12:24.113 --> 00:12:26.547
They became Shikabane and
slipped out of their coffins...

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.113
probably waited
until after dark.

00:12:29.147 --> 00:12:32.247
I've never heard of so many
coming back at the same time.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.947
It took a while to
persuade the families

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.013
to keep quiet about
this, but it's done.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.447
We can meet back up now.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.180
You go after the
other Shikabane.

00:12:40.213 --> 00:12:42.247
What happened at the
hospital's on my shoulders.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.613
I'll go after this one.

00:12:43.647 --> 00:12:45.280
But you're hurt.

00:12:45.313 --> 00:12:47.213
Makina, you know unless the
contracted monk is with you,

00:12:47.247 --> 00:12:48.213
there's nothing you can-

00:12:48.247 --> 00:12:49.980
The wound isn't
that bad...

00:12:50.013 --> 00:12:51.980
It's already
healed, anyway.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.913
Ouch! Oh, there's
the ground.

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:01.580
Uh...

00:13:13.413 --> 00:13:15.447
He's so high,
so high!

00:13:32.347 --> 00:13:34.313
Don't you have
to go home?

00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:35.580
I can't.

00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:38.147
I can't go home anymore.

00:13:40.047 --> 00:13:43.247
You're right... That girl
might come after you again.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.480
This way.

00:13:52.513 --> 00:13:54.480
Where do you wanna go?

00:13:56.647 --> 00:13:57.547
The newspaper said

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.347
she had broken bones
and ruptured organs.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.913
How could...

00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:04.213
Come on.

00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:09.880
What do you
think that means?

00:14:09.913 --> 00:14:12.147
Often, the regrets that
drive a child Shikabane

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.880
are grounded in
the simple desire

00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:23.947
to keep playing and remain
on Earth forever.

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:34.147
to keep playing and remain
on Earth forever.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.913
Play nice...

00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:17.013
Let me go.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.380
What's wrong with you?

00:15:27.413 --> 00:15:28.547
They're Shikabane.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.113
Shikabane?

00:15:30.147 --> 00:15:32.613
Someone who dies full of
intense regrets can gain

00:15:32.647 --> 00:15:36.180
an immortal body and turn
back into an active being.

00:15:36.213 --> 00:15:39.280
They're called Shikabane.

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:42.080
She died in that accident
that was all over the TV,

00:15:42.113 --> 00:15:44.147
but she doesn't have
one scratch on her.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.513
You telling me you didn't
think that was strange?

00:15:46.547 --> 00:15:49.513
Yeah, but I've watched you
go from dead back to life

00:15:49.547 --> 00:15:50.947
and then get up and talk.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.113
Does that mean
you're Shikabane?

00:15:53.147 --> 00:15:55.147
A Shikabane is
death itself.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.380
That's why they bring
death upon others.

00:15:58.413 --> 00:16:00.580
I'm someone who fights
against that death...

00:16:00.613 --> 00:16:02.547
An immortal who
kills the immortal...

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.580
Shikabane Hime!

00:16:05.613 --> 00:16:06.647
We're gonna play...

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.013
We're gonna play...

00:16:08.047 --> 00:16:09.180
We're gonna play...

00:16:09.213 --> 00:16:10.347
We're gonna play...

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.313
We're gonna play!

00:16:19.513 --> 00:16:22.147
And Shikabane...

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.047
They won't die until
their brains are destroyed

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.080
or their bodies are
completely shredded...

00:16:26.113 --> 00:16:28.313
So are you ready for it?

00:16:32.947 --> 00:16:34.880
We're gonna play!

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.147
This is it...?

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.180
This is what
they call playing?

00:17:05.647 --> 00:17:08.180
My doll...
I'm gonna play...

00:17:08.213 --> 00:17:09.447
I'm gonna play
with my pretty...

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.013
I see...
I get it now...

00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:13.980
why three kids who
died in the same accident

00:17:14.013 --> 00:17:16.480
became Shikabane...

00:17:16.513 --> 00:17:18.480
All three of you
had the same regret.

00:17:18.513 --> 00:17:19.980
You wanted to play more.

00:17:20.013 --> 00:17:21.547
That's what any
kid would want.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.147
So you found a way to keep
playing with your friends.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.480
The three of you were one
Shikabane from the start.

00:17:26.513 --> 00:17:28.647
Hikaru, stop!

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.013
Why don't you
just play with me!

00:17:34.547 --> 00:17:37.213
There's something
I wanna give you!

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.280
What're you doing...?
You puttin' on a show?

00:17:55.313 --> 00:17:58.313
You can pretend to be
a baby all you want...

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.613
Nothing will stop me
from finishing this!

00:18:23.413 --> 00:18:26.447
Good.
Nice work Minai.

00:18:29.362 --> 00:18:31.962
Makina, are you alright?

00:18:31.995 --> 00:18:34.262
I'll finish off the rest.

00:18:41.562 --> 00:18:44.862
Hikaru...
It's yours...

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:52.929
Hand the Shikabane over.

00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:59.862
Did you not see
what just happened?

00:18:59.895 --> 00:19:01.529
She's a monster.

00:19:01.562 --> 00:19:03.995
Aren't you
a monster, too?

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:07.495
Yeah, I am.

00:19:07.529 --> 00:19:09.929
Now let me have her.

00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:37.295
Thanks, Makina.

00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:43.895
So what is that you have
in your hand... a letter?

00:19:43.929 --> 00:19:47.395
A friend of hers asked me
to put this in her coffin.

00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:50.095
I just wanted to
do the right thing.

00:19:50.129 --> 00:19:52.162
When the Shikabane sensed
what you had there,

00:19:52.195 --> 00:19:54.062
it stopped moving...

00:19:54.095 --> 00:19:55.729
What is that?

00:20:17.262 --> 00:20:19.062
Follow the boy, Minai...

00:20:19.095 --> 00:20:21.929
He knows too much, we're
going to have to watch him.

00:20:21.962 --> 00:20:23.962
That won't be necessary.

00:20:23.995 --> 00:20:26.795
But we can't simply
leave him alone.

00:20:26.829 --> 00:20:29.495
He's not alone...
He's my brother.

00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:35.829
You mean you didn't
know about that?

00:20:35.862 --> 00:20:39.195
Then why did you try
so hard to protect him?

00:20:42.062 --> 00:20:45.362
Because he's
a regular kid.

00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:47.229
Yeah, he is...

00:20:47.262 --> 00:20:49.895
Well, anyway, I'll keep
a close watch on him...

00:20:49.929 --> 00:20:51.862
After all, I know almost
everything about the boy,

00:20:51.895 --> 00:20:54.495
even what pinup girl
poses he's fond of.

00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:55.962
There's this one...

00:20:55.995 --> 00:20:57.162
And this.

00:20:57.195 --> 00:20:59.429
Then he's all yours.

00:21:08.095 --> 00:21:09.462
Thank you...

00:21:09.495 --> 00:21:11.395
You don't have
to say that.

00:21:11.429 --> 00:21:14.495
It's just that... Your
brother thanked me...

00:21:14.529 --> 00:21:18.129
After I had finished
off the Shikabane...

00:21:18.162 --> 00:21:19.995
I wonder why...

00:21:21.495 --> 00:21:23.062
Maybe because
you had the gun

00:21:23.095 --> 00:21:26.129
when you told him to hand
the little girl over to you.

00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:27.829
You were a threat.

00:21:27.862 --> 00:21:29.362
If you hadn't had
that kind of authority,

00:21:29.395 --> 00:21:31.995
that kind of a
presence over him,

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:35.429
he probably wouldn't
have given her to you.

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:37.262
Even though he knew
she was a monster,

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:39.429
he couldn't have.

00:21:39.462 --> 00:21:41.962
He still saw her as...

00:21:41.995 --> 00:21:43.429
a little girl.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.962
That's why he
thanked you.

00:21:46.995 --> 00:21:49.162
For giving him
a way out.

00:21:49.195 --> 00:21:51.795
He's just that
kind of guy.

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:19.062
[Music]

00:22:19.062 --> 00:23:36.929
[Music]

00:23:39.162 --> 00:23:43.129
Ouri... You just can't forget
about that woman, can you?

00:23:43.162 --> 00:23:45.829
Her eyes...
her lips...

00:23:45.862 --> 00:23:48.529
Or is it the sour scent
of death that she wears...

00:23:48.562 --> 00:23:50.229
Now...

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:53.129
let the "voice of night"
draw us out...
