[Baby crying]

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:52.228
What's wrong?

00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:54.382
You're not
scared are you?

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:56.282
Did you just hear
a baby crying?

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.616
No...

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.416
[Baby crying]

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:02.482
Okay...
I heard it then.

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:03.949
It's more than
a little creepy

00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:06.616
to hear a baby crying
out here at night.

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.482
Did you see it?

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:30.816
Who are you?
What was that thing?

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.549
It has nothing to do
with either of you,

00:02:32.582 --> 00:02:35.382
so just forget
what you saw.

00:02:43.382 --> 00:02:45.482
Dammit, Shikabane,
where are you...?

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:48.382
Makina!

00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:50.682
Looks like it
did it again...

00:02:52.582 --> 00:02:54.916
It always leaves
only one victim...

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:58.249
then the Shikabane vanishes,
no trace of it...

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:06.349
Say, Ouri...

00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:09.482
You ever heard about
a story like this one?

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:11.616
Huh?
Like what one?

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:12.982
I was getting there.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:14.782
The one where the high
school girl has a kid

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:16.816
but abandons
the baby.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.582
Why is it always "high school
girls" in your stories?

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:20.782
Just cuz...

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:23.916
Anyway, so the baby's cursed
and its cry is heard every--

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.782
Come on, girls these
days won't be scared

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:27.816
by a goofy story
like that.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.249
But it's
not a story!

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:31.949
The whole thing really
happened, like I said!

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:32.949
Ouri?

00:03:32.982 --> 00:03:36.816
Sorry... I'm kinda not
feeling all that well...

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.516
Ouri, buddy, tell me you
didn't do anything so dumb

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.449
that you'd get
cursed by a baby?

00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:42.449
You didn't, right?

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:43.549
Please tell me
you didn't!

00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:45.582
You and I were supposed to
stay pure forever, right?

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:46.582
Forever!

Ow!! What is with you,
you dumb cow?!

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.916
Geez!

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:03.016
Hey... We got you rice balls,
porridge, tea and honey,

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.882
and a bunch of other stuff,
to help you along.

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:07.249
You should've just told
us you caught a cold.

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:08.816
Sorry.

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:12.549
So it was the
Sekuu Temple?

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:14.316
Should we let
them know?

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.849
I don't think so...

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:20.382
I have to do everything on my
own now, that's the deal.

00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:23.716
Well... Just do what
you think is right.

00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:26.549
We're leaving!

00:04:26.582 --> 00:04:30.682
Hm? Do we have to?

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:32.016

be able to sleep

around, so yeah.

You have to.

on your food, uh, I mean you.

Why do I keep hearing
it all the time?

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.249
I don't remember doing
anything to get cursed...

[Mew]

It's calling you...

But why me?

00:06:14.516 --> 00:06:17.949
It's calling you...
for help.

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:23.416
I take refuge in the Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:24.682
Until I attain
enlightenment.

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:26.282
By the merit
I have accumulated

00:06:26.316 --> 00:06:29.249
from practising generosity
and the other perfections.

00:06:29.282 --> 00:06:30.816
Enough.

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.282
I need you to confirm the
investigation of the corpse.

00:06:35.316 --> 00:06:37.216
Got that?

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:42.582
Uh... And can I have
some of your baklava?

00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:45.949
I found
the Shikabane.

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:49.582
Don't lose it like last time,
you good-for-nothing!

00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:56.949
I can feel it! It's moving
closer to me by the second!

00:06:56.982 --> 00:06:58.416
Minai has
her eye on it.

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:59.982
We've got the
thing cornered.

00:07:17.549 --> 00:07:18.949
I didn't lose it
for even one second.

00:07:18.982 --> 00:07:22.716
I swear I didn't.
It got another victim...

00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:26.249
And we lost another round.

00:07:26.282 --> 00:07:27.416
It's not win or lose...

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:28.949
Then how
should we put it?

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:30.582
'Cause it seems to me
that each time we lose,

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.816
someone gets killed.

00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:44.849
[Mew]

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:53.449
I think we all agree

00:07:53.482 --> 00:07:55.816
that this one cannot be
a transparent Shikabane.

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:57.716
So, how much more time
do you plan to waste

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:00.949
in pursuit of it,
Sho-Sojo Tagami?

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:04.616
The Shikabane appearance rate
here is abnormally high.

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:06.716
I myself killed
5 this month.

00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:09.716
Tagami killed
almost 10.

00:08:11.382 --> 00:08:14.616
Like many clinics these days,
this one is short on doctors.

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:16.849
So short that it offers
only one service--

00:08:16.882 --> 00:08:19.416
that of an ob-gyn.

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:21.482
And seeing that all the
victims were young females,

00:08:21.516 --> 00:08:22.882
and some were
pregnant...

00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:25.249
it's worth an
investigation.

00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:26.516
The crying baby...

00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:29.016
Do you think a stillborn child
there came back as a Shikabane

00:08:29.049 --> 00:08:32.716
and began to attack
the patients?

00:08:32.749 --> 00:08:35.282
I really don't believe
that an infant born deceased

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:38.682
could have a strong enough
obsession to become a Shikabane.

00:08:38.716 --> 00:08:41.516
The ones we took care of
the other day were children.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.916
Have you received any word
on the corpse's tissue analysis

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:45.282
that I requested?

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.749
They don't have
the results yet.

00:08:46.782 --> 00:08:49.882
In the meantime, you should
investigate this clinic.

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:53.249
Makina...

00:09:17.482 --> 00:09:19.382
Why do I have
to do this?

00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:21.816
Probably because you're
a softy who'd follow me

00:09:21.849 --> 00:09:23.582
without many questions.

00:09:23.616 --> 00:09:26.416
What do you
want me to do?

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:30.749
[Mew]

00:09:30.782 --> 00:09:34.582
Oh, no... I'm getting
all dizzy again...

00:09:36.416 --> 00:09:38.416
[Baby crying]

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:39.916
There...

00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:42.516
there...

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:43.849
now.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:30.832
Sorry, dear,

00:10:31.483 --> 00:10:33.983
but the nurse had an unexpected
matter to attend to,

00:10:34.016 --> 00:10:36.516
so I'm the only one
here right now.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.650
Please, you have
to help me.

00:10:37.683 --> 00:10:39.450
My boyfriend
doesn't care about me

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:40.483
and I don't
have anybody.

00:10:40.516 --> 00:10:42.050
I don't know
what to do.

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:45.150
It happens to a lot of
young people these days -

00:10:45.183 --> 00:10:48.116
just a bit short sighted
with their actions.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.950
Don't cry, dear,
I'll take good care of you.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.850
Oh, you're awake,
young man, good.

00:10:55.883 --> 00:10:58.983
I found him lying out
on the street last night.

00:10:59.016 --> 00:11:00.516
... obviously got
a bad cold...

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.983
And he didn't
understand

00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:04.083
we don't practice
that kind of medicine...

00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:07.050
...so I just gave him an
IV to keep him hydrated.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.916
So, are you
feeling better?

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.450
Ah, yeah I am,
thanks.

00:11:11.483 --> 00:11:14.450
No problem whatsoever,
young man.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.583
Excuse me,
where's the restroom?

00:11:17.616 --> 00:11:19.983
Ah... it's
down there...

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:23.050
I'll go and make the necessary
preparations for you.

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:24.783
Okay.

00:11:35.683 --> 00:11:37.650
What the hell
are you doing?

00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:38.883
Me? What
about you...?

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:41.916
You're the one who came here
'cause she got herself pregnant.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.950
This can't be some kind
of coincidence, right...?

00:11:43.983 --> 00:11:45.616
This is the third time...

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.583
three times I've run into
you while chasing Shikabane.

00:11:47.616 --> 00:11:48.916
Who's feeding you info?

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.916
Like a person?

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.116
Forget it.
There's no time.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.483
Uh... wait!

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.650
Hey!

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.516
Would you hold
on a second?!

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.916
Stop following me!

00:12:11.483 --> 00:12:12.616
What's your real name,

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.450
Shikabane Hime
or Makina Hoshimura?

00:12:15.483 --> 00:12:19.416
Shikabane Hime is a title
for those who kill Shikabane.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.850
Then I guess I'll call you
Makina, if that's alright.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.683
Get out of the way.

00:12:48.716 --> 00:12:51.016
What do you think
you're doing?!

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.983
Five women have been brutally
murdered by a Shikabane...

00:12:54.016 --> 00:12:57.483
and at each murder site,
a baby's cry was heard.

00:12:57.516 --> 00:12:59.050
It's possible that those
murdered women were patients

00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:01.483
of this clinic.

00:13:01.516 --> 00:13:04.550
That's why you think
this baby's a Shikabane?

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.850
Look at that baby.
Carefully.

00:13:06.883 --> 00:13:08.416
It's not a newborn.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.650
He looks to be at least
three months old.

00:13:10.683 --> 00:13:14.516
Why would he be sleeping
alone in a place like this?

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.050
I'll tell you
that doctor,

00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:19.383
he's also gotta be under
the Shikabane's control.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.616
I need to ask...
for your assistance.

00:13:27.916 --> 00:13:30.416
I don't care,
this baby's no monster!

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.850
It's pretending
to be human...

00:13:32.883 --> 00:13:34.850
Now move!

00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:36.883
Cut it out!

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.450
Sorry...

00:13:42.483 --> 00:13:44.750
See...?
You get it now...?

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.750
This is the smell
of Shikabane...

00:13:46.783 --> 00:13:50.450
I'm dead Ouri... the body
is incapable of lying.

00:13:50.483 --> 00:13:52.583
And so is that baby.

00:13:52.616 --> 00:13:54.383
He should smell
just like me.

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.716
The same stale,
sour aroma.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.616
Smell him!

00:14:01.683 --> 00:14:03.616
He smells like
every other baby...

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.083
Like a combination
of milk and diapers.

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:08.916
Liar...!
Forget it then!

00:14:16.816 --> 00:14:19.383
You'd better let
that baby go!

00:14:19.416 --> 00:14:21.383
I'm taking
him with me.

00:14:21.416 --> 00:14:23.083
That child isn't
a Shikabane!

00:14:23.116 --> 00:14:26.850
Yeah? I guess we'll see
about that, won't we?

00:14:26.883 --> 00:14:28.883
Makina!

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.016
Makina!

00:14:53.683 --> 00:14:55.583
Shikabane cells?
Really?

00:14:55.616 --> 00:14:58.550
Yes. In the bodies
of those five victims

00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:00.816
we found quite a
few foreign cells

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.650
we suspect are
from a Shikabane.

00:15:03.683 --> 00:15:05.716
That means someone planted
the Shikabane tissue

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.516
into these humans
which turned them

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.083
into a kind of
quasi-Shikabane...

00:15:10.116 --> 00:15:11.850
What Makina and the
others have been seeking

00:15:11.883 --> 00:15:15.550
were victims themselves
who became quasi-Shikabane...

00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:17.450
No wonder we
couldn't find them...

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.383
And then the victims returned
to their old dead selves,

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:20.516
I guess...

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.650
Is that possible?

00:15:22.683 --> 00:15:24.516
I don't know,
but it's happening...

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.683
In all honesty,
we should just admit that

00:15:26.716 --> 00:15:29.383
we really know practically
nothing about Shikabane.

00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:32.116
Who's doing this?

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.816
Maybe the Shikabane are trying
to increase their population...?

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.416
Or it could be some sort
of experiment I suppose...

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.816
Senior Tagami, I've heard
how the number of Shikabane

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.683
in this district
has been increasing...

00:15:43.716 --> 00:15:45.383
I think you should stop
doing field work

00:15:45.416 --> 00:15:46.683
so you can spend
more time here

00:15:46.716 --> 00:15:49.050
being a mentor to those
of us who need it.

00:15:49.083 --> 00:15:51.083
Come on, Rika,
what are you talking about...?

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:52.950
I'm a perennial
Sho-Sojo.

00:15:52.983 --> 00:15:54.716
I'm not a
Gon-Sojo like you.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.850
You know that,
don't you?

00:15:56.883 --> 00:15:59.916
I only got this promotion
because my name is Aragami...

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.783
But still...

00:16:00.816 --> 00:16:03.416
Still I'll fight
Shikabane with Makina...

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.550
because that is the
promise I made long ago.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.516
Makina...

00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:23.083
There, there...
That's it sweetheart...

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:26.483
Everything's fine...
It'll be alright...

00:16:26.516 --> 00:16:27.850
there we go.

00:16:27.883 --> 00:16:29.450
Never thought
I'd see that,

00:16:29.483 --> 00:16:31.683
a Shikabane listening
to a human.

00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:33.983
It's not so odd...

00:16:34.016 --> 00:16:35.416
That baby
is her child.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.716
Poor thing passed
away during labor.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.450
It was a heart attack.

00:16:39.483 --> 00:16:41.716
I did everything
I could to stop it,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.150
but I had to make the
choice to save the child.

00:16:44.183 --> 00:16:46.650
She became a Shikabane.

00:16:46.683 --> 00:16:49.650
She probably understands
by now that if I'm gone,

00:16:49.683 --> 00:16:52.583
there is no one left to
take care of her baby.

00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:55.416
I assume that's why
she listens to me.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.750
It can't be...

00:16:58.783 --> 00:17:00.650
Shikabane, huh...?

00:17:00.683 --> 00:17:02.950
I've heard rumors about this
among my fellow doctors

00:17:02.983 --> 00:17:04.716
for some time now.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.683
A dead person comes back to
life and becomes immortal...

00:17:07.716 --> 00:17:11.050
But to think of it actually
happening was something else...

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.716
Wouldn't it be
a wonderful gift

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.616
if we could share immortality
with all humans, everywhere?

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.716
You put that
into people?

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.850
Even if you do that, it's not
gonna make them immortal...!

00:17:22.883 --> 00:17:26.483
I get it... You did
that to all those women!

00:17:26.516 --> 00:17:29.650
Some day it will succeed.

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:33.150
I knew someone like
you would come...

00:17:33.183 --> 00:17:36.816

warned about it.

Hoshimura...
I remember that name.

00:17:40.716 --> 00:17:42.816
That was the name of a
family killed in a fire

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.950
a few years back.

00:17:43.983 --> 00:17:45.450
Did you know them?

00:17:45.483 --> 00:17:48.150
Were you related
to them or something?

00:17:48.183 --> 00:17:50.550
Oh, interesting.

00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:52.650
You're not becoming a
monster like the others.

00:17:52.683 --> 00:17:56.083
I wonder if it was changing
the distribution of blood.

I'm the daughter of the family
that died in the fire...

00:18:13.083 --> 00:18:14.816
But it wasn't the
fire that killed them.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.450
And since I've
already died...

It's truly sad that you
didn't cast away

your human heart once
you became a Shikabane.

It would've been
easier on you.

You think you haven't
become a monster?

you place on being human,

it won't matter.
