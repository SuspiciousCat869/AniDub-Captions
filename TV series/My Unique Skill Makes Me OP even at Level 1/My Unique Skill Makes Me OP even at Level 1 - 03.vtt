[RYOTA]
Before I was reincarnated,

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.719 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was a miserable salary man
at a toxic company.

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:19.219 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now I'm in a crazy world

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:21.556 position:13% line:83% align:start
where everything's an item
drop from monsters.

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.058 position:13% line:83% align:start
In this new life, I'm stuck
at level 1, but lucky for me,

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:29.597 position:10% line:83% align:start
my unique skill has maxed out
all my drop stats to rank S.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:32.734 position:33% line:83% align:start
Today, I face
a whole new challenge.

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
A super scary monster
with freaky eyes and...

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:38.238 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait. Emily?

Is that you, Ryota?

00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:24.979 position:24% line:83% align:start
Never underestimate
my unique skill!

Game, set, match.

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:39.627 position:27% line:89% align:start
You did it, Yota!

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:42.130 position:19% line:83% align:start
Gotta be the cheekiest
low level ever.

[MALE TOWNSPERSON 1]
That was unreal!

Incredible!

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:46.466 position:19% line:83% align:start

What a man!

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:47.669 position:21% line:83% align:start

We owe you everything!

[sighs]

00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:59.714 position:7% line:83% align:start
If strays are a type of monster
that never drop anything,

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:01.983 position:13% line:83% align:start
then that means this weapon
shouldn't even exist

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:03.450 position:30% line:89% align:start
in this world.

[RYOTA]
I may be stuck at level 1,

00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:14.529 position:13% line:83% align:start
but thanks to the OP seeds
I've been finding,

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:17.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
my stats are getting better
all the time.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:22.870 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.404 position:30% line:89% align:start
Alrighty, then.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's see if this thing
is as cool as it looks.

[gun shots]

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.561 position:41% line:83% align:start
Score!
It's definitely a real gun.

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:49.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
Made total mincemeat
out of that zombie.

[rattles]

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:09.617 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wonder how I can get
more bullets for this.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.723 position:16% line:83% align:start
Maybe the ammo will drop
from strays like the gun did?

00:04:15.857 --> 00:04:18.559 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll have to use it sparingly
until I find out.

Thanks, Yoda!

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:39.446 position:21% line:83% align:start
That weapon of yours,
sure is amazing!

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.116 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've never seen anything
like it.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.618 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Nice, right?

00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:45.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thanks to this baby,
my strength is now B rank.

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:46.988 position:24% line:83% align:start
You and I should go
and check out

00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.321 position:21% line:89% align:start
the next level later.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.557 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sounds fun!

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.958 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
As my stats increase,

00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:53.027 position:24% line:83% align:start
so does the number
of levels we can explore.

00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:55.797 position:21% line:83% align:start
Feels good being able
to contribute like that!

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.734 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.906 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No, Eve.
-I noticed, too.

00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:08.543 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well. Guess she must have had
somewhere else to be.

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:11.112 position:7% line:83% align:start
We can't expect her to join us
for lunch every day.

00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:13.114 position:10% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] True, but we'll save
these carrots for her

00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:14.381 position:33% line:89% align:start
just in case.

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:15.716 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, good call.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.552 position:30% line:83% align:start
She might swing
by the house later.

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:20.855 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what?

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.825 position:16% line:83% align:start
You make the best lunches
in this world and the next!

[chuckles]

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.135 position:24% line:83% align:start
Here, don't forget
to drink your tea.

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:35.402 position:27% line:89% align:start
Perfect, thanks.

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:40.407 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have never felt so...

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:42.677 position:35% line:89% align:start
So relaxed.

00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.416 position:7% line:83% align:start

to this level before?

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.152 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
No, I haven't.

00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:53.554 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I can tell you
which monsters hang out here

00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:54.989 position:16% line:89% align:start
and what items they drop.

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.325 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll be encountering
cockroslimes

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.261 position:7% line:83% align:start
and getting some nice pumpkins
off them!

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:01.829 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Not more slime time.

00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:04.932 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, well, it'll be worth it
for the pumpkin drops.

Gross!
Cockroslimes are freakin' nasty!

00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:17.612 position:7% line:83% align:start
I bet they make girls run away
screaming bloody murder.

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:20.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
They look just like

to hit that hard.

[EMILY]
Sorry Yoda, of course I did.

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:35.730 position:10% line:89% align:start
The tragedy will only spread

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:37.999 position:21% line:83% align:start
if I don't destroy it
completely!

00:06:38.132 --> 00:06:39.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't be scary!

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:42.837 position:30% line:83% align:start
Every last one
must be eradicated.

00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:03.224 position:19% line:89% align:start

Sweet Yoda. Forgive me.

In my whole entire life

have I ever concentrated
so intently on any task?

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.792 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's a no.

00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:13.794 position:30% line:89% align:start
They're so big!

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:15.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
Looks like another
great haul for us!

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.201 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Too bad we can't possibly
carry all of these.

00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:24.839 position:19% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] The infestation
will return if we stay here.

Ready for more death?

00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:29.143 position:30% line:83% align:start

wonderful haul!

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:58.706 position:10% line:83% align:start

trips before we're done.

Great! I'll be waiting.

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:12.286 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the heck?

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.056 position:21% line:83% align:start

animal had a feast.

I have lived my entire life

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:35.876 position:24% line:83% align:start

reckoning.

00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:18.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry about that.

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:20.121 position:16% line:83% align:start
Those things just give me
the heebie-jeebies,

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:22.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
so I go a little crazy
when they're around.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.359 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't you worry.

[ERZA]
Huh, you really didn't know?

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:44.245 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's what always happens
when you leave dropped items

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:46.046 position:24% line:83% align:start
where there aren't
any people around.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
It causes awful monsters
to spawn in the area.

00:10:49.717 --> 00:10:51.785 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I guess Emily mentioned
something about that

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
when the gorilla
stray showed up.

00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:55.856 position:10% line:89% align:start
Still, it wasn't on my radar.

00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:00.294 position:13% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, those jerks
ruined the last of our pumpkins.

00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:03.197 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sorry. I know you were
waiting for them.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.568 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh. Please don't worry
about that one bit.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
We hadn't closed up yet, anyway.

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.505 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Wait a minute.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:13.542 position:10% line:83% align:start
If it's technically possible
to force strays to spawn...

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:15.142 position:27% line:89% align:start
...that means...

00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:17.512 position:13% line:83% align:start
What would you think about
maybe going out to dinner

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:19.280 position:21% line:89% align:start
with me this evening?

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:23.117 position:5% line:83% align:start
I found a great new restaurant,
and I thought, if you wanted--

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.588 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Thanks, Erza! Bye!

What was that?

00:11:32.393 --> 00:11:36.697 position:5% line:83% align:start

I have to act on it right away.

00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:39.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
I got this carrot
in Telulu earlier.

00:11:39.934 --> 00:11:41.402 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hope it works.

[munches]

00:11:51.546 --> 00:11:52.846 position:10% line:89% align:start
Stop it! That carrot is not--

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.983 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is a rabbit carrot
if I ever saw one!

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:58.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
The skies could come
crashing down on all of us

00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:00.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I still wouldn't give
this precious jewel back!

00:12:00.522 --> 00:12:02.990 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's by far the longest
sentence you've ever said,

00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:04.925 position:21% line:89% align:start
and it was for that?

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:06.661 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Back to square one.

00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:09.296 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a good thing I thought
to bring so many.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.465 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
she rabbited away

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
with nine out of ten, though.

00:12:16.638 --> 00:12:17.639 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go!

The other adventurers
can't get a drop from a stray.

But I can.

00:12:40.729 --> 00:12:41.730 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.438 position:24% line:89% align:start
what would happen?

With the power

back without consuming them.

What the...

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.932 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
That sounds about right.

00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:27.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
Monsters will disappear
if they leave a dungeon.

00:14:27.569 --> 00:14:29.269 position:33% line:83% align:start
Just imagine
how many strays we'd have

00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:31.506 position:30% line:83% align:start
running rampant
if that weren't the case.

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:33.040 position:19% line:89% align:start
So that's how it works.

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:34.475 position:19% line:89% align:start
Even within a dungeon,

00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:36.243 position:30% line:83% align:start
they disappear
if they enter a different level.

00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:38.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
You must have noticed
there's only one type of monster

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.815 position:13% line:89% align:start
on each floor. That's why.

00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:42.684 position:16% line:89% align:start
Right. That makes sense.

00:14:42.817 --> 00:14:43.984 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's surprising.

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:45.720 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're such a talented
adventurer,

00:14:45.854 --> 00:14:48.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
yet somehow there's still
so much you don't know.

00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:51.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
I personally think
that contrast,

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:55.329 position:16% line:83% align:start
um, is kind of charming.
That is to say.

turns out to be true.

00:15:12.714 --> 00:15:14.649 position:16% line:89% align:start

I only have a split second
before it disappears.

00:15:25.527 --> 00:15:27.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I can kill it before
that moment passes.

[gun shots]

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:33.635 position:35% line:89% align:start
It worked!

00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.370 position:10% line:89% align:start
I offed it outside its level,

00:15:36.504 --> 00:15:38.640 position:13% line:83% align:start
so that baddie should count
as a stray!

00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:41.341 position:16% line:83% align:start
[WOMAN 2] Ryota acquired

There's so much potential

this new ammo!

We just freeze our foe

and then slam attack
it's face off.

00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:32.025 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's a common combo in gaming.

It seems to work
in this world too!

[EMILY] Hey, Yoda!
That was cool! But, uh...

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:40.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
What kind of ammo
was that, exactly?

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.536 position:24% line:89% align:start
A freezing bullet.

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:44.639 position:16% line:83% align:start
It turns whatever I shoot
at into ice.

00:16:44.772 --> 00:16:47.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
It takes some time to grind
for those, though.

00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:49.309 position:5% line:89% align:start
So I have to use them carefully.

00:16:50.077 --> 00:16:52.045 position:13% line:89% align:start
They sound quite valuable.

00:16:52.814 --> 00:16:54.114 position:44% line:89% align:start
True.

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:55.148 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why I'll stick
with regular bullets

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:56.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
unless it's an emergency.

00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:59.119 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's up to you to finish
the job if I miss.

00:16:59.253 --> 00:17:00.722 position:13% line:89% align:start
Think you can handle that?

00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:02.524 position:21% line:89% align:start
You can count on me!

00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:05.492 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:17:06.661 --> 00:17:09.496 position:41% line:89% align:start
[rains]

00:17:21.843 --> 00:17:24.311 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Looks like we dodged
an epic downpour.

00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:26.046 position:27% line:89% align:start
Watch your step.

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:27.582 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
You be careful as well!

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:28.950 position:44% line:89% align:start
Deal.

00:17:29.684 --> 00:17:31.986 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MALE MERCHANT]
Get it up here already!

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE MERCHANT]
You're out of your mind!

00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:34.756 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:36.156 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are they fighting?

00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:38.392 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE MERCHANT]
What did you call me?

00:17:38.526 --> 00:17:41.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
Excuse us. We just need to sneak
by you real quick.

00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:46.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah! It's my lucky day.
Bring that cargo up here for me!

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:48.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
This fool will pay you
for the effort.

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:50.404 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:51.773 position:38% line:89% align:start
Awkward.

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.440 position:24% line:89% align:start
What kind of cargo?

00:17:53.575 --> 00:17:56.911 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:00.582 position:19% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] You can't mean
that thing way down there?

00:18:02.584 --> 00:18:05.452 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] That's not an easy favor
you're asking of us.

00:18:05.587 --> 00:18:06.921 position:21% line:83% align:start
If someone could drop
a rope down,

00:18:07.055 --> 00:18:09.089 position:13% line:89% align:start
I could maybe pull it off.

00:18:09.222 --> 00:18:10.692 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't do it!

00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:13.561 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's not safe because it's been
down there far too long.

00:18:13.695 --> 00:18:14.829 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:17.599 position:10% line:83% align:start
So it could turn into a stray
any second!

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:20.835 position:24% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE ADVENTURER]
That thing's loaded with drops

00:18:20.969 --> 00:18:23.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
from some truly
troublesome monsters.

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:26.406 position:24% line:83% align:start
We must burn it all
with magic while we can.

00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:28.910 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not a chance!

00:18:29.043 --> 00:18:30.277 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.479 position:21% line:83% align:start
That perfume is worth
a hefty fortune!

00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:35.282 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your tiny brain can't begin
to fathom how many adventurers

00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:38.452 position:10% line:83% align:start
I had to hire to get my hands
on that much of it!

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:40.454 position:10% line:89% align:start
You think I care about that?

00:18:40.588 --> 00:18:43.223 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're the one who dropped
it in the first place!

00:18:43.357 --> 00:18:45.392 position:24% line:83% align:start
The rain made you
lose your footing.

00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:47.394 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, guess what, fool?

00:18:47.528 --> 00:18:49.496 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MALE MERCHANT]
You're fired!

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:52.567 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.402 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's one very powerful
old man!

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.372 position:13% line:89% align:start
Damn. Guess I was too late.

00:18:59.107 --> 00:19:00.474 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
What's that?

00:19:00.608 --> 00:19:01.943 position:24% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE ADVENTURER]
A monster called a femini.

00:19:02.076 --> 00:19:05.580 position:27% line:83% align:start
It lacks a body.
That's why it possesses humans,

00:19:05.713 --> 00:19:07.381 position:33% line:89% align:start
to propagate.

00:19:07.515 --> 00:19:11.218 position:24% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Disgusting.
Let's try this instead!

00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:14.589 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gun shots]

00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:17.625 position:41% line:89% align:start
[moans]

00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:23.798 position:30% line:89% align:start
Done and done!

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:27.401 position:24% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE ADVENTURER]
Take him and run!

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:30.738 position:35% line:83% align:start
Whoa there!
What do you think you are doing?

00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:32.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
[FEMALE ADVENTURER]
I have to stop this.

00:19:32.674 --> 00:19:35.543 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I don't, more femini
will keep spawning!

00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:39.212 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to go down there
and let one possess me.

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:40.615 position:10% line:89% align:start
That will buy you some time.

00:19:40.748 --> 00:19:43.216 position:13% line:83% align:start
Go into town and come back
with an army.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.053 position:38% line:83% align:start
If we do,
what will happen to you?

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.021 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nothing that I don't deserve.

00:19:47.155 --> 00:19:48.656 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was the escort
for this mission.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.358 position:24% line:83% align:start
The responsibility
is mine alone.

00:19:55.163 --> 00:19:56.430 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MALE BOSS]
Uh-oh.

00:19:56.564 --> 00:19:59.332 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've really done it now.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:02.369 position:21% line:83% align:start
The client is utterly
furious with you.

00:20:02.503 --> 00:20:05.673 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KOHAI]
I'm sorry. So sorry. Very sorry.

00:20:05.807 --> 00:20:08.743 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MALE BOSS] Gotta start
all over now, don't you?

00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:12.814 position:5% line:83% align:start
Say goodbye to sleep for a week.
Have fun with that!

00:20:12.947 --> 00:20:14.214 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KOHAI]
Yes, sir.

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:17.484 position:35% line:83% align:start

Man. I'd rather die than be him!

00:20:19.252 --> 00:20:21.155 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Hey. Can I...

00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:23.157 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KOHAI]
It was my mistake,

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
so the responsibility
is mine alone.

00:20:25.693 --> 00:20:29.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have your own work
to worry about, Sato. It's okay.

00:20:29.197 --> 00:20:30.031 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:34.802 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] My heart was screaming
at me to help him out.

00:20:34.936 --> 00:20:36.104 position:30% line:89% align:start
But in the end,

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.372 position:19% line:83% align:start
all I could think about
was my own sorry self.

00:20:42.643 --> 00:20:44.244 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no time.
You have to run!

00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:49.717 position:7% line:83% align:start
No! I'm going to stay and help!
I'm different now. Better.

00:20:49.851 --> 00:20:53.821 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:20:53.955 --> 00:20:56.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] The whole reason
I'm working hard to power up

00:20:56.724 --> 00:20:59.060 position:19% line:83% align:start
is for difficult times
like these!

Emily! Are you okay?

[sighs]

00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:27.054 position:19% line:83% align:start
Practice makes perfect!
You can count on me, Yoda!

00:21:27.188 --> 00:21:28.689 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:33.861 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thank you. You saved us.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.135 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
You leveled up like crazy!

00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:42.503 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
I sure did!

00:21:42.637 --> 00:21:44.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
I could feel myself
getting stronger!

00:21:44.337 --> 00:21:47.440 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Femini are incredibly
powerful monsters.

00:21:48.543 --> 00:21:50.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you took out quite
a few in one go.

00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:53.014 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm not surprised
your level went up.

00:21:53.147 --> 00:21:55.049 position:19% line:83% align:start
I couldn't have done it
without you!

00:21:55.183 --> 00:21:57.819 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was such a very lucky day
for me when we met,

00:21:57.952 --> 00:22:00.955 position:7% line:83% align:start
and I have a feeling it's going
to keep getting luckier!

00:22:01.088 --> 00:22:03.825 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're wrong
about just one thing.

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.260 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
I'm the one who's lucky.

00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:08.796 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Oh! You really think so?

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.665 position:27% line:89% align:start
We feel the same!
