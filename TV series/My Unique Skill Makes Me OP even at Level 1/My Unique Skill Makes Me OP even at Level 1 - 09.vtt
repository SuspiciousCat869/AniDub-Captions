by the shop

to find some information

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:47.895 position:7% line:89% align:start
regarding the harvest festival.

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Excellent!
Way to be on top of it, Celeste!

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.899 position:24% line:89% align:start
First, the obvious,

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:54.535 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's a festival that
is held annually here in Secro.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.137 position:27% line:83% align:start
The draw is that
you can see goods

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.972 position:19% line:83% align:start
found in local dungeons
on display

00:03:58.106 --> 00:03:59.439 position:10% line:89% align:start

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:03.177 position:41% line:83% align:start

are they for sale or something?

-They're for killing.
-Huh?

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:06.881 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CELESTE]
They're placed in an arena,

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.416 position:16% line:83% align:start
allowed to become strays,
and then killed.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.519 position:16% line:83% align:start
The point is to show off
the goods first

00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:13.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then the monsters
that spawn from them.
