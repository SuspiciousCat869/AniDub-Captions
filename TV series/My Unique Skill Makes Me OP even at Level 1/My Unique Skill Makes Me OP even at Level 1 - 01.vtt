What's that sound effect?

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is someone gaming or something?

So sleepy. Just a
few more minutes.

Wait, are you a human?

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.898 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, that's silly,
you're a drop, so...

Oh, I know!

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
Must be some weird
human-shaped meat.

Hey! You didn't have
to scare me like that!

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.144 position:13% line:83% align:start
So I guess you're a human
and not human-shaped meat?

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you really still
questioning my humanity?

00:00:46.614 --> 00:00:48.382 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I've
never seen a slime

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:50.183 position:7% line:89% align:start
drop a human like that before.

[RYOTA]
A slime? Drop?

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.888 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is so confusing!

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:55.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
They normally drop bean sprouts

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I'm almost certain
you're not a bean sprout!

about slime drops?

or are you just insane?

really don't know?

that clear by now?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.038 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] Hm... Wait, watch
a minute and I'll show you.

Whoa! Be careful!

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.345 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.148 position:7% line:89% align:start

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.150 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Whoa!

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.220 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
It turned into bean sprouts!

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:29.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
The slimes in this area
always drop bean sprouts.

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:33.160 position:33% line:83% align:start
Like, always.
Everybody knows that.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.530 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh, nobody I know knows that.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.566 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Where on earth am I?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
What's with the
bean-sprout chick?

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
And what in the freaking
hell is going on here?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
So, I'm no farmer,

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:23.738 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I didn't know that's
where bean sprouts came from.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.472 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not just sprouts.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:28.609 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everything. That's where
it all comes from.

00:03:28.743 --> 00:03:29.777 position:27% line:89% align:start
What? Seriously?

00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:32.013 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't think of anything
that isn't a drop

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:34.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
left by monsters in
dungeons like this one.

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:37.719 position:19% line:83% align:start
How is it possible you
don't know this stuff?

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.121 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Hey.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.189 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Yes?

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.957 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're not in Japan now, are we?

00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:44.559 position:33% line:89% align:start
Where's that?

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.761 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are we on Earth, at least?

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:48.162 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's an Earth?

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.698 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Must not panic.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:55.235 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.305 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know I'm a drop you just met,

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
but it seems like all
you do is kill slimes.

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.777 position:19% line:83% align:start
Aren't there any other
kinds of monsters?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.114 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid that it's only slimes
here on level one of Telulu.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] So why not just
go to a different area?

00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:10.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not strong enough for that.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.485 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're handling
yourself pretty well

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.154 position:16% line:89% align:start
from where I'm standing.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.589 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, thanks for saying so.

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:17.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I level up some,
maybe I'll try level two.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:20.061 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Level up? You can level up?

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:21.394 position:30% line:89% align:start
If I work hard.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
Here. Let me show you
where I'm at now.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.298 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ta-dah!

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.634 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
What's that?

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:28.636 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
It's called a status board.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.341 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
And this is my current status.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.811 position:24% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] It's like a
videogame in real life.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.647 position:27% line:83% align:start
Her HP is B rank,
and her strength is a C.

00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:41.849 position:19% line:89% align:start
As for the rest... Hmm.

00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:44.585 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, she seems like your
typical power-based build.

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.155 position:30% line:83% align:start
Huh? Looks like
there's a second page?

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.923 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
There sure is!

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:52.093 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's the page that shows
how my drop stats are ranked.

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:54.529 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] What do those
particular stats do?

00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:56.964 position:19% line:83% align:start
High drop stats make it
easier to get good drops.

00:04:57.098 --> 00:04:59.066 position:30% line:83% align:start
And to get them
more often, as well.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.836 position:13% line:83% align:start
As you can see, my highest
drop stat is for plants.

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.639 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why I always get
tons of bean sprouts here.

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:06.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I wouldn't call
that plant stat "high."

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:09.677 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's just barely above
the other ones.

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:11.478 position:5% line:89% align:start
You wanna take a peek at yours?

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:14.381 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sure. So do I just touch
that green thing?

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:15.850 position:35% line:89% align:start
You got it.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.588 position:33% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA gasps]
Oh...

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:22.590 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Oh, they're all shockingly low.

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:24.457 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Level one out of one.

00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:26.127 position:27% line:83% align:start
That doesn't mean
level one is the highest

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.662 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can ever reach, does it?

00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:29.664 position:24% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] Um, that's
exactly what it means.

00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:31.833 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Dude, not cool.

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:35.603 position:30% line:83% align:start
Your drop stats
are kinda sad, too.

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:39.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ugh. So basically I'm
a pathetic piece of work.

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:40.473 position:35% line:89% align:start
That right?

00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:41.642 position:41% line:83% align:start

Huh?

00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:51.853 position:19% line:83% align:start

this low, I'd be surprised

00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:53.788 position:30% line:83% align:start
if you even got
any drops at all.

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Wait a minute!
You sure S rank is low?

00:05:56.724 --> 00:05:58.759 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Huh? Pretty sure.

00:05:58.893 --> 00:06:01.295 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] No way. If gaming
has taught me one thing,

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:03.331 position:27% line:83% align:start
it's that S rank
is the highest.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.266 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe that's different here?

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.068 position:16% line:89% align:start
Only one way to find out.

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.070 position:21% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] What are you
looking around for?

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:16.537 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's have a bite.

00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:18.572 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your tummy sounds hungry!

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.109 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Go on. Eat your fill.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.514 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thanks so much.
Can't wait to dig in.

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:31.319 position:38% line:89% align:start
So good!

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.120 position:30% line:83% align:start
The subtle spice
of the chili oil.

00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:35.623 position:16% line:83% align:start
It perfectly complements
the refreshing crispness

00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:37.291 position:21% line:89% align:start
of the bean sprouts.

00:07:38.192 --> 00:07:41.028 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah! All we need now is
a nice beer to go with it.

00:07:41.162 --> 00:07:42.296 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh, you think so?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] What, do you
not drink or something?

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:45.833 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't afford to.

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:49.270 position:16% line:83% align:start
Liquor's very expensive,
and I need to save all I can.

00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:50.705 position:19% line:89% align:start
Try some of this, too.

00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:52.506 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
All right, thanks.

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:56.644 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Wow.

00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:58.846 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? [gasps]

00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:04.452 position:7% line:89% align:start
[yelps] Wh-Why are you crying?

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:06.554 position:5% line:89% align:start
Does it really taste that awful?

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:09.056 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
No. That's not it at all.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.558 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been so long.

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:14.462 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can't remember the last time
I sat down to a nice, warm meal.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:17.732 position:5% line:89% align:start
With someone to keep me company.

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:19.567 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
I left early every morning

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.969 position:30% line:83% align:start
and stayed late
doing unpaid overtime.

00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:23.704 position:27% line:83% align:start
And then I'd just
wolf down something cold

00:08:23.838 --> 00:08:27.308 position:13% line:89% align:start
from the convenience store.

00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.277 position:13% line:83% align:start
That life wrecked my health
until I was hospitalized.

00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:33.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then I felt obligated
to make up for lost time.

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:35.583 position:16% line:89% align:start
I missed the last train.

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:38.219 position:24% line:83% align:start
So I took a little
nap at my desk.

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:43.924 position:19% line:83% align:start
The next thing I knew,
I was dropped by a slime.

00:08:44.058 --> 00:08:47.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nothing I did ever
paid off in any way.

00:08:47.495 --> 00:08:49.630 position:10% line:89% align:start
Every day was a living hell.

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:55.469 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've heard that one's efforts
always pay off in the end.

00:08:55.603 --> 00:08:58.739 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe this is your big chance
to actually experience that.

00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:02.109 position:21% line:83% align:start
It may happen quickly
or it may take some patience.

00:09:02.243 --> 00:09:03.210 position:27% line:89% align:start
But wait and see.

00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:05.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those who work hard
will be rewarded.

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:07.014 position:33% line:89% align:start
Even better.

00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:09.518 position:19% line:83% align:start
The longer you work hard
without seeking a reward,

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.120 position:10% line:83% align:start
the sweeter that reward will
be when it finally arrives.

00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:15.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like the tension in your
fingers before a flick.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.259 position:16% line:83% align:start
The greater the tension,
the greater the force,

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:21.162 position:33% line:83% align:start
and the more
satisfying the results.

00:09:21.295 --> 00:09:23.664 position:19% line:83% align:start
So it's pretty amazing
what happened.

00:09:23.798 --> 00:09:25.699 position:27% line:83% align:start
You stayed strong
your whole life

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:28.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
and now your reward is
waiting in this new life.

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:31.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
You worked so diligently
all those long, hard years,

00:09:32.073 --> 00:09:36.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
and now, here you are.
It's your turn to be rewarded.

00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:42.683 position:30% line:89% align:start
[RYOTA crying]

00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:45.619 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Thank you.

00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:49.623 position:30% line:83% align:start
I guess my next
order of business

00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:51.192 position:13% line:89% align:start
is to find a place to stay.

00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:52.726 position:27% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.328 position:19% line:83% align:start
Luckily there's a town
right outside the dungeon.

00:09:54.462 --> 00:09:56.730 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should be able
to find lodging there.

00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:59.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
I should get some shuteye
pretty soon as well.

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.335 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Wha--? In the dungeon?

00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:02.403 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:04.338 position:5% line:89% align:start
My drops are not too impressive.

00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:06.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
So I don't have much
in the way of money.

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:09.310 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I dream of renting
an apartment one day.

00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:13.647 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Uh... Ah, I see.

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:16.250 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Oh! Here.

00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:17.418 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't forget your weapon!

00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:19.753 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Huh? Are you sure?

00:10:19.887 --> 00:10:22.089 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's dangerous to
walk around unarmed.

00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:24.559 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thanks for this,
but it's on loan.

00:10:24.692 --> 00:10:25.826 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll return it someday.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.361 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Sure!

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:28.896 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you ever want to,
you can always find me here

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:30.664 position:19% line:89% align:start
on level one of Telulu.

00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:32.800 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh. Hey, what's your name?

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:35.636 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's Emily Brown.
Nice to meet you!

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:37.471 position:35% line:89% align:start
Emily, huh?

00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:39.574 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, my name's Ryota Sato.

00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:41.742 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hi! Yoda?

00:10:41.876 --> 00:10:44.245 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Not Yoda. Ryota!

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:47.815 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I've never heard
such a peculiar name before.

00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.886 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I think I'm getting
a feel for things now.

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:54.088 position:10% line:89% align:start
The currency here is "pilos."

00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:56.490 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those bean sprouts
are worth 200 pilos.

00:10:56.625 --> 00:11:00.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
A room costs 2,000 pilos,
and that's just for one night.

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:03.731 position:19% line:83% align:start
A bowl of their ramen
stand-in is 500 pilos.

00:11:03.864 --> 00:11:06.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've verified the prices
of the things I want.

00:11:06.734 --> 00:11:08.836 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now it's time to make bank.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.276 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] When I found out
I was stuck at level one,

00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:17.512 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought I was in for just
another brand of hell,

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:20.649 position:16% line:83% align:start
where all my efforts were
doomed to be in vain.

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:22.216 position:10% line:89% align:start
But with this fully OP skill

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.553 position:30% line:83% align:start
that maxes out
all of my drop stats,

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:27.021 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can make this work!

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:31.626 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Huh? Where are we?

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:32.826 position:38% line:89% align:start
A rental.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.161 position:27% line:83% align:start
Got it with three
days of earnings.

00:11:34.295 --> 00:11:37.364 position:30% line:83% align:start
In three days?
You're amazing, Yoda!

00:11:37.498 --> 00:11:38.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't know about that.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:39.934 position:10% line:89% align:start
I mean, it's just a run-down,

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:41.869 position:19% line:83% align:start
87-year-old apartment,
after all.

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:44.271 position:27% line:83% align:start
There wasn't even
a deposit or key money.

00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:46.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it was the best I
could do on short notice.

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:50.010 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's still amazing to me.
How much does it cost?

00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:52.112 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Twenty thousand a month.

00:11:52.246 --> 00:11:53.314 position:35% line:89% align:start
That much?

00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:57.484 position:21% line:83% align:start
How impressive. Wow!
And it's all yours!

00:11:57.619 --> 00:11:59.753 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, not exactly.

00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:03.757 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
What's this?

00:12:05.993 --> 00:12:06.794 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
The key.

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:07.861 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Huh?

00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:09.396 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why are you giving it to me?

00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:11.932 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're gonna need that
to live here from now on.

00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:13.867 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
To do what now?

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:15.570 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Live here.

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:17.371 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:20.107 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I'll cover the rent,
so nothing to worry about there.

00:12:20.241 --> 00:12:22.677 position:30% line:83% align:start
But... I can't
possibly accept this!

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.212 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
It's for the soup.

00:12:25.346 --> 00:12:27.881 position:24% line:83% align:start
It meant more to me
than you could ever know.

00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:30.117 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was warm and comforting.

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:33.153 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
This is to thank you.

00:12:33.287 --> 00:12:38.058 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wish it was a nicer place,
but please live here.

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:39.594 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Thank you so much.

00:12:39.728 --> 00:12:43.063 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sure. Now I'll be on my way.

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:46.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] Your hands.
They're covered in blisters.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.102 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Oh, that reminds me.

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:50.572 position:10% line:83% align:start
I might have gotten a little
bit of blood on that spear

00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:52.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
you were nice enough to lend me,

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:53.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I'll clean it up
good as new, I promise.

00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] And you have
bags under your eyes.

00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:59.413 position:7% line:83% align:start
[laughs] Once I get some sleep,
I'll be unstoppable.

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:02.149 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll make you some soup.

00:13:02.283 --> 00:13:04.519 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sure. Thanks. Yeah.
Just one bowl and I'll--

00:13:04.653 --> 00:13:07.589 position:27% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] Not one!
I'll make you soup forever!

00:13:07.722 --> 00:13:09.691 position:24% line:89% align:start
So please don't go!

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:12.793 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait, um, does that mean...?

00:13:14.696 --> 00:13:17.498 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Is she asking me
to live here with her?

00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:19.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can I do that?

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:22.269 position:44% line:89% align:start
'Kay?

00:13:23.337 --> 00:13:25.105 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Oh. Goodness.

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:29.977 position:27% line:89% align:start
[RYOTA grunting]

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.146 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
It's heavier than it looks.

00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:43.157 position:5% line:89% align:start
Brought more goods for ya, Erza.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.224 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
Sure thing.

00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:47.061 position:13% line:89% align:start
One little moment, please.

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:49.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hi, uh. Ricotta Sato, wasn't it?

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.533 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
It's Ryota!

00:13:51.666 --> 00:13:53.233 position:21% line:89% align:start
Er. Sorry 'bout that.

00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:57.706 position:13% line:83% align:start
But you've gotta admit your
name's a bit of a mouthful.

00:13:57.838 --> 00:14:01.442 position:19% line:89% align:start
Today's total is 1,967.

00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:03.177 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll tell you what.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.112 position:7% line:83% align:start
Since you always bring in such
large amounts, I'll round up.

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.615 position:5% line:89% align:start
How does 2,000 pilos sound, eh?

00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:09.116 position:27% line:89% align:start
It sounds great.

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:10.951 position:13% line:83% align:start
But at the end of the day,
sprouts are sprouts.

00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:12.920 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can only make
so much with 'em.

00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:15.456 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe level two of
Telulu is calling to me.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.493 position:16% line:83% align:start
The monsters in that area
drop tasty, crunchy carrots.

00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:22.530 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
That's ridiculous! Absurd, even!

00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:24.766 position:30% line:83% align:start
But, it appears
that's how things work

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:27.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
in this weird, wild world.

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:28.837 position:13% line:89% align:start
Say. Did you hear the news?

00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:31.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's a brand-new dungeon that
showed up not too long ago!

00:14:31.806 --> 00:14:34.809 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Huh? Dungeons can
just show up out of nowhere?

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:36.110 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well, yeah.

00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:37.779 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just every now
and then, of course.

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.179 position:27% line:83% align:start
But this one has
one of those names

00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:41.081 position:21% line:83% align:start
that's too impossible
to pronounce.

00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:43.050 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nibo--uh. No, hold on.

00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:45.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think it's actually
something like "Nihonium"?

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.889 position:30% line:83% align:start
Nihonium, huh?
That's easy enough.

00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:50.224 position:30% line:89% align:start
For you, maybe.

00:14:50.357 --> 00:14:52.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anyway, the Neptune's
investigating.

00:14:52.393 --> 00:14:54.294 position:24% line:83% align:start
So they'll find out
what the drops are there.

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:56.230 position:5% line:89% align:start
We should know before too long.

00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:58.132 position:19% line:89% align:start
Um, what's the Neptune?

00:14:58.265 --> 00:14:59.734 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
You haven't heard about them?

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:02.436 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're the most powerful
organization in all of Secro.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.303 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:15:03.437 --> 00:15:04.839 position:10% line:89% align:start
[CUSTOMER 01A clears throat]

00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:07.908 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh-- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to linger.

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:09.076 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll be on my way now.

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.779 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
No, wait!

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.045 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's a new little shop

00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:13.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
right around the
corner from here.

00:15:13.648 --> 00:15:16.116 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're known for their
cold and delicious beer!

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.484 position:7% line:89% align:start
Um. I was thinking we could go

00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:19.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
and grab some drinks
together later?

00:15:19.854 --> 00:15:22.055 position:30% line:89% align:start
Beer, you say?

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:24.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thanks, but think I'll
have to pass this time.

00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:25.926 position:41% line:89% align:start
Later!

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:28.328 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sure. That's fine. See ya.

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:31.432 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ooh, ice cold! Poor rejectee.

00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:34.101 position:21% line:83% align:start
What? You don't know
what you're talking about!

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:37.037 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] It's been years
since I returned to a home

00:15:37.171 --> 00:15:38.706 position:27% line:83% align:start
where someone was
waiting for me.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.911 position:24% line:83% align:start
What should I say?
It's gotta be perfect.

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:45.747 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey. Emily, I'm home. Oh.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.882 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yay, I'm so happy to see you!

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:49.283 position:24% line:89% align:start
Um, yeah, you, too.

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:51.586 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come in. I'm sure
it's been a long day.

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:56.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Is it me, or is this
place sparkling clean now?

00:15:56.858 --> 00:15:59.126 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sure is! I cleaned
every nook and cranny!

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.662 position:5% line:89% align:start
This goes way beyond "cleaning."

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:03.030 position:21% line:83% align:start
You didn't have to go
all out like that.

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:04.766 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did I go overboard?

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:08.101 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, it was my first time
cleaning up our beautiful home.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:10.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
I couldn't help but do my best!

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:13.641 position:30% line:83% align:start
For you, Yoda.
A nice, hot towel!

00:16:13.775 --> 00:16:16.243 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, man. This is heaven!

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:18.445 position:10% line:89% align:start
And that makes you an angel!

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.013 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
I also brewed some tea.

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:21.950 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
You made me special tea, too?

00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:23.417 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course!

00:16:23.551 --> 00:16:25.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please have a seat,
and I'll be right back.

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:27.254 position:27% line:83% align:start
You don't have to
go to all this trouble.

00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:28.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why not stop and
take a little break?

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.626 position:21% line:89% align:start
You must be worn out.

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.895 position:24% line:83% align:start
But being able to do
things around my home

00:16:34.027 --> 00:16:35.530 position:10% line:89% align:start
is a dream come true for me.

00:16:35.663 --> 00:16:37.632 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm so happy and
not tired at all!

00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:39.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay, if you say so.

00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:45.874 position:13% line:83% align:start
By the way, I heard a rumor
that a new dungeon showed up.

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.275 position:16% line:89% align:start
A place called Nihonium.

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:50.010 position:16% line:89% align:start
I heard about that, too.

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:52.079 position:30% line:83% align:start
Apparently it's
pretty useless, Yoda.

00:16:52.212 --> 00:16:54.014 position:7% line:89% align:start
They say nothing drops at all.

00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:57.351 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could there be
no drops whatsoever?

00:16:57.484 --> 00:17:00.822 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] In a world where every
single thing is a dungeon drop,

00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:04.792 position:10% line:83% align:start
the idea of one with no drops
is way too intriguing.

00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:07.127 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Not a living soul.

00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:08.428 position:24% line:89% align:start
It feels abandoned.

00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:10.765 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe there really
is nothing here.

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:14.134 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:17:15.703 --> 00:17:16.704 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:19.007 --> 00:17:20.775 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.280 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
I'm dead meat!

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:36.658 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:39.794 position:33% line:89% align:start
[RYOTA yells]

00:17:42.797 --> 00:17:45.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] That's the extent
of my level one power?

00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:48.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
Am I really stuck being so weak?

00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:53.575 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
What's that? Looks like a seed.

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:58.913 position:24% line:83% align:start
[DUNGEON VOICE 01A]
Ryota's max HP increased by one.

00:17:59.047 --> 00:18:00.314 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:04.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
[screams] You're still
maxed out at Level one,

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:08.121 position:16% line:83% align:start
but somehow you managed
to increase your max HP!

00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:09.657 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
It's true.

00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:13.126 position:16% line:83% align:start
Somehow that little seed
really did increase my stat.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.929 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
After that discovery,

00:18:15.063 --> 00:18:16.998 position:10% line:89% align:start
I got cozy killing skeletons.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.600 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then Emily joined me,

00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:21.368 position:13% line:83% align:start
so we did some experiments
and learned a few things.

00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:23.337 position:30% line:83% align:start
Whenever Emily
killed a skeleton,

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.573 position:13% line:89% align:start
that OP seed never dropped.

00:18:25.707 --> 00:18:27.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
When she tries picking up
one of them up,

00:18:27.609 --> 00:18:31.311 position:5% line:83% align:start
her hand passes right through it
no matter how hard she tries.

00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:33.581 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that voice:
it seems I'm the only one

00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:34.949 position:27% line:89% align:start
who can hear it.

00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:37.451 position:24% line:83% align:start
[DUNGEON VOICE 01A]
Ryota's max HP increased by 1.

00:18:37.585 --> 00:18:40.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I can't believe it.
How is this possible?

00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:41.656 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
It shouldn't be.

00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:43.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
In this world, having drops
that only certain people

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:47.461 position:7% line:83% align:start
can touch wrecks the balance.
It's not how things work here.

00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:51.799 position:16% line:83% align:start
A place like this dungeon
shouldn't even exist.

00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:54.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
And yet, somehow it does.

00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:55.703 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
You're so special!

00:18:55.837 --> 00:18:57.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've never heard
of anyone anywhere

00:18:57.772 --> 00:18:59.540 position:27% line:83% align:start
getting stronger
without leveling up!

00:18:59.674 --> 00:19:01.976 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] In other words...
Nihonium here

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:07.147 position:7% line:83% align:start
is a stat-increasing wonderland
reserved for S-ranks like me!

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.250 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Mm! So yummy!

00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:12.987 position:21% line:83% align:start
Emily's house is the
best place in the world!

00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:15.957 position:13% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] So. Will you be out
late again tonight, Ryota?

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.160 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yep! I've been busting my buns
in Nihonium a lot lately

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:22.162 position:27% line:83% align:start
and my max HP has
finally reached

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:24.331 position:13% line:89% align:start
the highly coveted S-rank!

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:26.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna check out
level two of Telulu.

00:19:26.668 --> 00:19:29.804 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wanna see how much stronger
I've gotten through all this.

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:32.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, uh, what's with
that look on your face?

00:19:32.874 --> 00:19:35.475 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please promise you won't
be too reckless out there.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.911 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Huh?

00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:38.880 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have a tendency to
face challenges head-on.

00:19:39.013 --> 00:19:40.782 position:24% line:83% align:start
I remember how you
ran yourself ragged

00:19:40.915 --> 00:19:43.316 position:24% line:83% align:start
back when you first
rented this apartment.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.687 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you've been out late
every night recently,

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.058 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I'd prefer it if you
came home before it gets dark.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.425 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Back then,

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:54.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
no one gave a damn
about my well-being.

00:19:55.129 --> 00:19:57.230 position:35% line:89% align:start
But now...

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:58.432 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sure, you got it.

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.635 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll be back home
before nightfall.

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:01.936 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:10.144 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wait. That didn't
actually hurt at all.

00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:11.546 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:14.749 position:21% line:83% align:start
This must be because
of my new S-rank HP!

00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:19.352 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:26.794 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
It really did drop a carrot!

00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:28.462 position:24% line:89% align:start
And it's enormous.

00:20:37.605 --> 00:20:39.439 position:24% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] That one's
way smaller than mine.

00:20:39.574 --> 00:20:41.609 position:27% line:83% align:start
[ADVENTURER 01A]
What're you standing around for?

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:45.412 position:13% line:83% align:start
You think a newbie like you
can really hack it on level two?

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:47.849 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hold on, I'll check
out his stats.

00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:49.550 position:24% line:83% align:start
[DUNGEON VOICE 01A]
Easy Scan.

00:20:49.684 --> 00:20:51.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ADVENTURER 01C chuckles]
Level one.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:54.122 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH laugh]

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.523 position:7% line:89% align:start
Better crawl back to level one

00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:58.358 position:30% line:83% align:start
unless you wanna
die, wittle baby.

00:20:58.492 --> 00:21:00.128 position:19% line:89% align:start
That was uncalled for.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.596 position:35% line:89% align:start
Jerk wads.

00:21:03.798 --> 00:21:04.799 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh--

00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:13.074 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are those ears natural?

00:21:13.207 --> 00:21:14.642 position:27% line:89% align:start
Level one, is it?

00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:19.180 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh. You talking about me?
Ha! Yeah, guilty as charged.

00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:21.281 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're trash! For shame!

00:21:21.414 --> 00:21:22.449 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:24.685 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh. You finished?

00:21:26.521 --> 00:21:30.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? What the heck was that?

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:34.228 position:27% line:83% align:start
What big, lovely
carrots you got us!

00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:37.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
They must love their carrot cake
at the Swallow's Gratitude.

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:39.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
They bought the whole
bunch for 8,000 pilos!

00:21:39.901 --> 00:21:43.538 position:21% line:83% align:start
Eight thousand pilos
in one day? Wow.

00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.840 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
That's 240,000 pilos a month.

00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:48.709 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's way more than I was
making at my old job!

00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:50.343 position:33% line:83% align:start
I kept a few
for us to eat, too.

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:51.779 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thought you'd like that.

00:21:51.913 --> 00:21:53.781 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll make something
extra tasty with them!

00:21:53.915 --> 00:21:54.882 position:35% line:89% align:start
[knocking]

00:21:55.016 --> 00:21:58.252 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hello?

00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:00.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
The bunny girl from before.

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:04.324 position:10% line:89% align:start
I hate your kind. Low Levels.

00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:05.827 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right, but...

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.095 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did you have to come to
my house to tell me that?

00:22:08.229 --> 00:22:11.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have something else to say?

00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:14.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
That I wuv you.

00:22:14.502 --> 00:22:16.771 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Huh?!
