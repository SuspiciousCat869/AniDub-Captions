Before I was reincarnated,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.148 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was a miserable salaryman
at a toxic company.

Now I'm in a crazy world

from monsters.

In this new life,
I'm stuck at level 1.

But lucky for me,
my unique skill has maxed out

all my drop stats to rank S.

00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:30.264 position:38% line:83% align:start
And today
I'm being hugged by a mummy,

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
practically stalked
by some pretty boy

hell to find them!

Wait.

00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:51.999 position:38% line:89% align:start

[EMILY]
Yota, what are you doing here?

00:09:10.151 --> 00:09:11.485 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh! Hey, Emily.

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:14.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hello. Getting in some shooting?

00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:15.723 position:33% line:89% align:start

Ryota acquired a fire bullet.

00:09:40.815 --> 00:09:44.519 position:35% line:83% align:start
Have I now?
Then fire comes after ice!

00:09:45.152 --> 00:09:48.489 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, what's this one
our mummy friend left behind?

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:49.990 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[WOMAN] Ryota acquired...
-Yota?

00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:51.892 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[WOMAN] a healing bullet.
-What just happened?

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:54.228 position:19% line:89% align:start
How are you doing that?

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:55.996 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hold on, so these...?

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is awesome!
I gotta get more!

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:01.035 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:02.736 position:24% line:83% align:start
Check out all these
special bullets I scored!

-[RYOTA] Right?

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:06.474 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll show you
the last thing I learned.

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.709 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:10.644 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:10:10.778 --> 00:10:13.447 position:30% line:83% align:start
Um, I just felt
a really powerful chill.

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:14.715 position:38% line:89% align:start
A chill?

00:10:14.849 --> 00:10:17.718 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh! That's what I forgot!

00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:19.653 position:35% line:83% align:start
I came here
to warn you about it!

00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:21.122 position:35% line:89% align:start
About what?

00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:24.024 position:27% line:83% align:start
The magic storm.
There's one on its way now!

00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:25.893 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't like the sound of that.

00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:28.829 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ryota groans]

00:10:29.564 --> 00:10:32.500 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:36.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ERZA] So, um,
is Emily not with you today?

00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:39.206 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] No, unfortunately.
She had some shopping to do,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.742 position:27% line:83% align:start
so we're working
separately this time.

00:10:41.876 --> 00:10:43.677 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh. That make sense.

00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:45.779 position:44% line:83% align:start
What,
with the storm coming and all.

00:10:45.913 --> 00:10:48.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? So, is there
some kind of connection

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:50.251 position:21% line:83% align:start
between these storms
and shopping?

00:10:50.384 --> 00:10:53.654 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, sort of. That's an odd way
to put it, though.

00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:55.356 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hold on a minute.

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:58.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you saying you've never
heard of a magic storm before?

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:02.496 position:27% line:83% align:start
Actually, I have.
I mean, Emily told me a little.

00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:05.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
But she didn't know
much about them either.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.834 position:35% line:89% align:start
I give up.

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.769 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why don't you enlighten me?
I'd like to know more.

00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:12.039 position:35% line:83% align:start
Absolutely!
I'm always happy to help!

00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:14.742 position:33% line:83% align:start
Magic storms
are a natural phenomenon.

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:17.978 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
they tend to happen very rarely.

00:11:18.112 --> 00:11:19.514 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's basically a time

00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:22.216 position:10% line:83% align:start
when everyone's magic skills
are suddenly restricted.

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.653 position:33% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Like,
they can't use magic at all?

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:27.788 position:7% line:83% align:start
[ERZA] Right. And depending on
how big the storms are,

00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:29.390 position:21% line:83% align:start
the effects can reach
beyond the town

00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:30.891 position:16% line:89% align:start
to the dungeons as well.

00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:33.394 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Wow, that's kinda scary.

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:35.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
The storm that's coming
is one of those.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
The kind that reaches
the dungeons.

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:39.266 position:7% line:89% align:start
You can't be caught off guard.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.302 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's why
everyone who uses magic

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.605 position:21% line:83% align:start
is taking the day off
to prepare.

00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:47.074 position:30% line:83% align:start
But that leads
to reduced availability of drops

00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:49.410 position:21% line:83% align:start
from dungeons people
are supposed to receive.

00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:50.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
They have less currency in hand,

00:11:50.844 --> 00:11:52.713 position:30% line:83% align:start
and it affects
the way they shop.

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:54.415 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
I can see that.

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:56.618 position:41% line:83% align:start
[REYES]
Someone please! I need help!

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.952 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:11:58.687 --> 00:11:59.987 position:38% line:89% align:start
Help me!

00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:02.122 position:41% line:89% align:start
Anyone?

00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:05.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
My partner Rosa has been
left behind back in Silicon!

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.261 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.164 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's Reyes!

00:12:11.332 --> 00:12:12.601 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's Silicon?

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:16.070 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's one of the dungeons
that's intended for magic users.

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:19.106 position:7% line:83% align:start
What? Didn't you say all magic
users were taking the day off?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.009 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ERZA] Reyes and Rosa
just came to Secro recently.

00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:23.844 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm guessing
they must have found out

00:12:23.978 --> 00:12:26.180 position:21% line:83% align:start
about the magic storm
a little too late.

00:12:26.313 --> 00:12:29.016 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

[indistinct chatter]

00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:36.591 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, why won't they help?

00:12:36.725 --> 00:12:38.225 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NEPTUNE]
Tragic, isn't it?

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:40.861 position:44% line:83% align:start
Whoa!
You can't sneak up like that!

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:42.564 position:5% line:89% align:start
What're you doing here, anyway?

00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:45.933 position:19% line:83% align:start
I came to see if maybe
you'd changed your mind.

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:49.136 position:30% line:83% align:start
-No, I haven't.
-Well, that's a shame.

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:51.105 position:41% line:89% align:start
Anyway.

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:54.041 position:30% line:83% align:start
Of all places,
it had to be Silicon.

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:56.511 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why? What do you mean by that?

00:12:56.645 --> 00:13:00.347 position:24% line:83% align:start
The monsters there,
they're seriously difficult.

00:13:00.481 --> 00:13:03.484 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even I'm staying
as far away as I can.

00:13:03.618 --> 00:13:04.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
Even you, huh?

00:13:05.052 --> 00:13:07.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
The thing is that monsters
in Silicon

00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:10.357 position:19% line:83% align:start
take nearly zero damage
from non-magical attacks.

00:13:10.491 --> 00:13:13.360 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right.
So, they have my condolences,

00:13:13.494 --> 00:13:15.462 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I can't put my life
on the line.

00:13:15.597 --> 00:13:18.132 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not for a complete stranger.

00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:21.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I'm proud of you!
You're a hero, Yota!

Hey.

00:13:31.546 --> 00:13:32.980 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll help you.

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:35.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just tell me what I need to do.

Go to level three.

00:13:58.105 --> 00:14:00.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should be able
to find Rosa down there.

working during the magic storm!

be able to save her!

Wait.
What's Yota's cart doing here?
