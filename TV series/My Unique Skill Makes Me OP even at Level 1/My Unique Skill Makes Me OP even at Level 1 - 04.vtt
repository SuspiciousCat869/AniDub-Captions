[RYOTA]
Before I was reincarnated,

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:17.084 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was a miserable salary man
at a toxic company.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.485 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now I'm in a crazy world

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.088 position:5% line:83% align:start
where everything is an item drop
from monsters.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.490 position:27% line:83% align:start
In this new life,
I'm stuck at level 1.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:26.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
But lucky for me,
my unique skill has maxed out

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.596 position:10% line:89% align:start
all my drop stats to rank S.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.700 position:16% line:83% align:start
Today, I'll be facing off
against a rare monster!

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had no idea drops
from monsters

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:37.104 position:16% line:89% align:start
could be used like that!

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:43.377 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.803 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screeches]

00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:21.141 position:7% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] You see it, don't you?
It's a rare monster!

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.044 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
What?

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.612 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, come back!

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:27.515 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gun shots]

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:31.586 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is this?

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
No idea! I've never seen a rare
monster drop something before!

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:36.624 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait a sec.

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:38.325 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.727 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a necklace.

00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:42.630 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I think maybe
you should try it on.

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:43.731 position:35% line:89% align:start
[exclaims]

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:45.867 position:21% line:89% align:start
But what does it do?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.936 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] C'mon, Emily.
I want you to have it.

00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:53.508 position:10% line:83% align:start
You mean it's like a present?
That means so much to me!

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.909 position:41% line:89% align:start
Me too!

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:57.545 position:19% line:83% align:start
You deserve to collect
all the goods for both of us!

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.848 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait, are you talking
about item drops?

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:03.216 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'm surprised
you didn't hear it.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.419 position:5% line:89% align:start
Must be all the seeds and stuff.

00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:07.855 position:30% line:83% align:start
I heard a voice
when I picked that thing up.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
Turns out that item drops
are doubled

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:12.160 position:19% line:89% align:start
when you're wearing it!

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.062 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're a little late, Yota.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.362 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
What do you mean?

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:16.998 position:19% line:83% align:start
I really could've used
that information

00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:18.465 position:24% line:89% align:start
before I put it on!

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.135 position:35% line:83% align:start
Uh, somehow
that's not making sense to me.

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:23.270 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screeches]

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:25.773 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:29.443 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wow! Look how many there are!

00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:33.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're double drops?
'Cause they are everything!

00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:36.684 position:41% line:89% align:start
[hums]

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:42.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you need help with anything?

00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:45.560 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, I got this.
I'll be finished in no time.

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:50.397 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Man, cooking in such
a small space must suck.

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:54.535 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, I was thinking, maybe
we should go somewhere new.

00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:56.771 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:59.040 position:30% line:83% align:start
Like a vacation
or like you wanna move?

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:00.675 position:44% line:89% align:start
Move.

00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:02.510 position:13% line:83% align:start
With what we're making now,
it feels like a good time

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.377 position:27% line:83% align:start
to start looking
for a bigger place.

00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:07.247 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh. If that's what you want.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.984 position:24% line:83% align:start
What kind of place
would you prefer to live?

00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:13.721 position:10% line:83% align:start
No. That should be something
you choose on your own.

00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:14.989 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:17.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait, are you saying
that I can go with you?

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:18.559 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, obviously.

00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:21.562 position:16% line:83% align:start
But we should definitely
save a little more money

00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:22.930 position:16% line:89% align:start
before we start looking.

00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:24.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I have no problem
working for it.

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.001 position:24% line:83% align:start
As long as we don't
exhaust ourselves.

00:04:27.135 --> 00:04:28.503 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know what you mean.

00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:30.805 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll sell some more
bamboo shoots tomorrow.

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.305 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's it. Okay?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.741 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:41.082 position:38% line:89% align:start
Is that?

00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:45.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ERZA] Sorry, these are
a little hard to appraise.

00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:48.790 position:27% line:83% align:start
[ERIC] Pardon me!
Are those bamboo shoots I see?

00:04:48.923 --> 00:04:51.759 position:5% line:83% align:start
If so, I'd love to take them off
your hands.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:59.499 position:7% line:83% align:start
I mean, I can't just give them
to you, but you can have one.

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:02.435 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, thank you.
One of these, please!

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.709 position:38% line:89% align:start
[slashes]

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.146 position:30% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Sweet!

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.282 position:35% line:89% align:start
[inaudible]

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.584 position:41% line:89% align:start
[bites]

00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:18.820 position:38% line:89% align:start
[humming]

00:05:18.953 --> 00:05:21.321 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, no!
Do they really taste that awful?

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.391 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can't believe it's not bitter
even though it's raw!

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.393 position:7% line:89% align:start
Or I might even call it sweet!

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:29.130 position:21% line:83% align:start
Never have I ever had
a bamboo shoot like this!

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:31.431 position:16% line:89% align:start
I mean. It's like, whoa!

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:35.002 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's like a rare flavor monster!

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:36.704 position:21% line:89% align:start
Who the heck is she?

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:38.673 position:33% line:83% align:start
These bamboo
shoots are just divine.

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:40.942 position:10% line:89% align:start
How 'bout I buy all of them?

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:43.778 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh, I don't know.
We were about to...

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:45.213 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, I don't mind!

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.480 position:7% line:83% align:start
If she wants to buy all of them
from me, she totally can!

00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:50.350 position:19% line:83% align:start
Okay. Then sounds like
they're yours now.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:51.953 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, if you're sure!

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:53.921 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't know
how to put a price

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:57.325 position:19% line:83% align:start
on the greatest flavor
I've ever tasted.

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:59.994 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please accept this token
of my thanks!

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:01.963 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
The way she's talking.

00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:04.799 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope she just handed me
a small fortune.

00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ERIC] Thank you so much!
Best of luck, bamboo shoot boy!

00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.578 position:41% line:83% align:start
20,000,
that's a good deal. Right?

00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:18.813 position:16% line:89% align:start
I mean, it's a lot to pay

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:20.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
for some bamboo shoots,
isn't it?

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:23.284 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, only a total jerk
would feel slighted.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.485 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you have any idea
who that was?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.954 position:19% line:89% align:start
No. Someone important?

00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:29.056 position:16% line:83% align:start
"Important" doesn't begin
to cover it!

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.993 position:24% line:83% align:start
That was Eric Macy,
the epicurean!

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:34.262 position:27% line:83% align:start
Any food she says
she likes instantly results

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.198 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the highest demand
among the gourmet foodie crowd!

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:38.833 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's cool.

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:41.802 position:35% line:83% align:start
Listen up.
Let's skip the formalities.

00:06:41.936 --> 00:06:44.305 position:19% line:83% align:start
Would you like to sign
an exclusive deal with us?

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:45.740 position:35% line:89% align:start
Exclusive?

00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:47.675 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your bamboo shoots
are about to become

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:50.544 position:24% line:83% align:start
the hottest produce
in all of Secro.

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:52.847 position:16% line:83% align:start
As soon as that happens,
I want to have the rights

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.782 position:33% line:83% align:start
to sell them
as a branded product.

00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:57.919 position:24% line:83% align:start
Their official name
will be Ryota's Bamboo Shoots!

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.087 position:24% line:89% align:start
A branded product?

00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:01.822 position:10% line:83% align:start
Obviously that would be great
for me,

00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:04.025 position:7% line:89% align:start
but are they really worth it--

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:06.894 position:16% line:83% align:start
Absolutely! I'll pay you
a signing bonus, okay?

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:08.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's on top of the cost
of the shoots!

00:07:08.963 --> 00:07:10.064 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'll do it.

00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:11.464 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:12.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
I trust that you know
what you're doing.

00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:15.435 position:5% line:89% align:start
Happy to partner with you, Erza.

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:16.504 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:18.339 position:38% line:89% align:start
Likewise!

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.408 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Okay, I still gotta focus

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.777 position:19% line:83% align:start
on raising my strength
stats today.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.880 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll be a S rank
if I keep working...

00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:27.715 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who's that?

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:29.216 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.351 position:38% line:89% align:start
Look out!

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.585 position:38% line:89% align:start
Go, now!

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:32.820 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Right!

00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:35.423 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:37.959 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.732 position:16% line:89% align:start
What was that all about?

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:47.168 position:30% line:83% align:start
Excuse me, sir.
You're in our way.

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.402 position:21% line:89% align:start
Our Princess Margaret

00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:50.237 position:24% line:83% align:start
has important work
she needs to do.

00:07:50.371 --> 00:07:51.539 position:38% line:89% align:start
Princess?

00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:55.176 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both chuckle]

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:56.844 position:10% line:89% align:start
You have a princess too, huh?

00:07:56.978 --> 00:07:59.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
This world just keeps getting
better and better!

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.615 position:33% line:83% align:start
She's working
with an air box right now.

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:03.351 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's an air box?

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.619 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm sure you've seen that
when you kill the monsters,

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:07.888 position:30% line:83% align:start
they sometimes
don't drop anything, right?

00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:08.923 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:10.424 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, I've heard
that most people

00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:12.460 position:13% line:83% align:start
have that experience here,
anyway.

00:08:13.094 --> 00:08:14.929 position:35% line:83% align:start
Apparently,
it's pretty useless, Yota.

00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:16.831 position:7% line:89% align:start
They say nothing drops at all.

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:19.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
Turns out, according
to our research,

00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:22.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
when the monsters are defeated,
they are actually dropping air.

00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:23.304 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way?

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:24.939 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BUTLER]
Oh, yes!

00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:27.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
So we decided to put the dropped
air in a box and sell it.

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:29.744 position:13% line:83% align:start
Keep in mind that this air
has been hand-picked

00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:31.879 position:35% line:83% align:start
and rescued
by Princess Margaret!

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:34.715 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm impressed that you had
the idea to sell people air.

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:37.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah! It's our best-selling item
to date!

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:40.721 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] For real? I guess
it's the princess effect.

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:42.890 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is that a magic cart I see?

00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:46.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. That's how we carry
a bunch of air boxes at once.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.230 position:7% line:83% align:start
Can't have the princess running
in and out of the dungeon

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:50.631 position:19% line:89% align:start
too many times, can we?

00:08:50.765 --> 00:08:52.833 position:10% line:89% align:start
I feel you. That's so smart.

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:56.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't imagine how much
more efficient this way must be.

00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:59.340 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Man, I've wanted
a magic cart for ages,

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.742 position:5% line:89% align:start
but those things are not cheap.

00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:04.278 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm going to need to talk
this over with Emily.

00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:07.314 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
So yeah, I'm conflicted.

00:09:07.448 --> 00:09:08.716 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do I buy a new house first,

00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:10.918 position:30% line:83% align:start
or a magic cart
while they're accessible?

00:09:11.052 --> 00:09:12.953 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think a magic cart
makes sense.

00:09:13.087 --> 00:09:14.855 position:13% line:83% align:start
We could use it to enhance
our business

00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:16.690 position:13% line:83% align:start
and make money even faster
to save up

00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:18.259 position:7% line:89% align:start
for the kind of place we want.

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:19.760 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's a good point,

00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:21.862 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it means that
we'd have to put off moving

00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:23.998 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I feel bad
for keeping you here longer.

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:27.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh I'm perfectly fine here!
I mean, it!

00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:29.570 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been enjoying my life
with you.

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:31.806 position:16% line:83% align:start
I find this little house
so cozy!

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:34.408 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you sure?

00:09:34.543 --> 00:09:36.077 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, all right!

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.745 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Then I guess it's you
and me in this tiny house

00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:39.280 position:13% line:89% align:start
for a little while longer.

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:41.115 position:35% line:83% align:start
-I like it!
-Me too.

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:43.918 position:16% line:83% align:start
We should go to the magic
cart shop tomorrow, then!

00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.020 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, I really hope the owner's
sweet little girl,

00:09:46.153 --> 00:09:47.922 position:5% line:89% align:start
Olga, will be there again, too!

00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:51.392 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[crying]
-Do you hear that?

00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:53.260 position:13% line:89% align:start
It sounds like Olga crying!

00:09:53.394 --> 00:09:55.229 position:41% line:89% align:start
[pants]

00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:57.965 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:02.002 position:27% line:89% align:start
Daddy. My Daddy.

00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:04.171 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did something happen
to your daddy?

00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:07.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you, do you know
when Daddy will be home?

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:09.743 position:33% line:83% align:start
No, we don't.
When did he leave here?

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:12.313 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did he happen to tell you
where he was going?

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:13.914 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nah-uh.

00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:16.617 position:13% line:83% align:start
All he said was that he was
gonna pick some flowers.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.685 position:38% line:89% align:start
Flowers?

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:19.720 position:5% line:89% align:start
He was looking for flower drops.

00:10:19.854 --> 00:10:21.489 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only place near here
that has them

00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:23.124 position:10% line:89% align:start
is a dungeon called Arsenic.

00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:25.893 position:16% line:83% align:start
So there's a good chance
that he's still there, right?

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:27.128 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:10:27.562 --> 00:10:30.231 position:5% line:89% align:start
You ready? Let's go to Arsenic!

00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:31.499 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:34.768 position:27% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I wonder
how many of them there are.

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:37.271 position:35% line:83% align:start
Never mind!
I shouldn't have asked!

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:40.674 position:41% line:83% align:start
[OLGA]
My daddy's feet smell bad!

00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:42.577 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ew! Gross!

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.778 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
So, this is Arsenic.

00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:48.583 position:21% line:89% align:start
They won't hurt you.

00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:50.117 position:30% line:83% align:start
Those monsters
are called danderocks

00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:52.386 position:16% line:83% align:start
and they won't ever move
or attack you at all.

00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:55.322 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see. Then we can easily...

00:10:56.724 --> 00:10:58.659 position:16% line:89% align:start
Never mind. I was wrong.

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:00.728 position:13% line:83% align:start
Guess we have to kill them.
I'm sorry.

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:02.463 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gun shots]

00:11:02.597 --> 00:11:03.931 position:21% line:89% align:start
It bounced right off!

00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:07.001 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
I have an idea! Stand back!

00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:10.204 position:38% line:89% align:start
[attacks]

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:11.305 position:35% line:89% align:start
Brilliant!

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:12.673 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, combining
your increased power

00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:13.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
and the strength of that hammer

00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:15.409 position:19% line:83% align:start
is the perfect solution
for this!

00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:17.278 position:27% line:89% align:start
Way to go, Emily!

00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:19.246 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.115 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not bad, huh?

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:27.288 position:41% line:89% align:start
[pants]

00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:30.024 position:33% line:83% align:start
There he is!
I can see Olga's father!

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:32.426 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:33.595 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:11:33.727 --> 00:11:36.197 position:38% line:89% align:start
[snores]

00:11:42.136 --> 00:11:44.772 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's asleep! Hey, wake up!

00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:47.908 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's out like a light.

00:11:49.644 --> 00:11:51.011 position:35% line:89% align:start
Um, Emily?

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:52.980 position:16% line:83% align:start
Olga's been worried sick
about him

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:55.115 position:7% line:89% align:start
and he's in here napping away.

00:11:55.249 --> 00:11:57.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
That jerk better wake up
right now!

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:02.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's going on?
Oh, it's just you two.

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:06.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
Argh. You really know
how to screw up a good nap.

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:10.331 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tell me, where exactly
did you leave your little girl

00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:12.900 position:27% line:83% align:start
when you decided
to run off to dreamland?

00:12:13.602 --> 00:12:15.836 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry. I meant no harm.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.872 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why are you here?
Olga was worried about you.

00:12:19.006 --> 00:12:20.941 position:5% line:89% align:start
Was this really that important?

00:12:21.075 --> 00:12:22.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
I came here to gather
some parts.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
Primarily light and heavy rocks
that are difficult to transport.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.983 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's for my new magic cart
prototype.

00:12:29.116 --> 00:12:31.620 position:5% line:89% align:start
I caught the heavy rock already.

00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:33.354 position:19% line:89% align:start
As for the light rock,

00:12:33.487 --> 00:12:35.923 position:7% line:83% align:start
well that's when the danderocks
blocked my path

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:38.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I wasn't able to get
around them, so I failed.

00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:42.062 position:30% line:83% align:start
What prototype?
The one you mentioned before?

00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:44.498 position:13% line:89% align:start
Look there. That's the one.

00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:45.799 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.202 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Wait, is that rock flying?

00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:50.004 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ORTON]
That's how the light rocks are.

00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:52.406 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're lighter than air
and they're also rare monsters,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
so it's not like
I can just grab one.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:56.043 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I get it.

00:12:56.678 --> 00:12:58.312 position:5% line:89% align:start
Must be tough to do by yourself.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.881 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I bet two people
could handle it.

00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:05.185 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't get me wrong, Emily.

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:07.087 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're light,
but that hammer is not.

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:10.024 position:30% line:83% align:start
Um. I'm sorry.
Are you gonna be okay?

00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:11.859 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah. I'm golden.

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:13.762 position:16% line:83% align:start
I boosted my strength up
to rank S

00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:15.362 position:7% line:89% align:start
back when we were in Nihonium.

00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:18.232 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll try to get
this done quickly!

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:20.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
[hits]

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:23.904 position:47% line:83% align:start
Ah!
This is exactly what I needed!

00:13:24.706 --> 00:13:28.409 position:21% line:83% align:start
I agree, it's pretty.
But why did you need it?

00:13:28.543 --> 00:13:30.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's step outside
and I'll show you.

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:37.217 position:10% line:83% align:start
There, now we just wait for a
little bit and see what happens.

[EMILY]
If it turns into a stray,

00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:42.524 position:13% line:83% align:start
then it'll float up again.
Isn't that right?

00:13:42.657 --> 00:13:47.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
There was a ceiling
in the dungeon, but not here.

00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.063 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes, and that's the thing.

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:51.265 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll just have to run
as fast as we can

00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:53.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
and grab it before
it's out of sight.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.903 position:33% line:83% align:start
So basically,
it's all up to chance.

00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:59.073 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wonder if there's anything
I can do.

00:13:59.206 --> 00:14:01.141 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ORTON]
Should be any minute now.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.647 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's it!
It's time to grab my drop!

00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:13.854 position:19% line:89% align:start

What did you do?

00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:21.663 position:5% line:83% align:start
This little guy might be lighter
than air,

00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:24.164 position:21% line:83% align:start
but that coat of ice
will bring it right back down.

00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:26.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
That was amazing, Yoda!

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:31.338 position:38% line:89% align:start

[ORTON] The great artisan
Orton's latest magic cart

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:40.881 position:21% line:89% align:start
is finally complete!

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please take it with you.

00:14:42.584 --> 00:14:43.651 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you kidding?

00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:45.553 position:30% line:83% align:start
We can't accept
such an expensive gift!

00:14:45.687 --> 00:14:47.154 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't be silly.

00:14:47.287 --> 00:14:49.657 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's not a gift, it's a reward
for everything you did

00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:50.859 position:27% line:89% align:start
to help me today.

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:52.527 position:19% line:89% align:start
We didn't do that much.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
You protected our town
the other day

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:55.963 position:19% line:89% align:start
or have you forgotten?

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.699 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're the new hero of Secro!

00:14:57.832 --> 00:15:00.802 position:10% line:83% align:start
I believe that deed deserves
some kind of reward, don't you?

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:03.370 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:15:03.505 --> 00:15:07.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
Promise me you'll take good care
of my daddy's magic cart, okay?

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:09.611 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not fair.

00:15:10.678 --> 00:15:14.616 position:7% line:83% align:start
Come on! It's a reward for all
the hard work you've done.

00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:20.354 position:10% line:83% align:start
A reward. I see. I'll use it
with all my gratitude!

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:23.023 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gun shots]

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:26.260 position:38% line:89% align:start
Perfect.

00:15:30.164 --> 00:15:32.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oops, looks like it's overfull.

00:15:32.767 --> 00:15:34.368 position:13% line:89% align:start
Even if we take a few out,

00:15:34.502 --> 00:15:37.037 position:7% line:83% align:start
we'll still have at least twice
as many in here than usual!

00:15:37.171 --> 00:15:39.741 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah. This magic cart
is really no joke!

00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:43.377 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's amazing!
We should thank Orton and Olga.

00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:46.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
Duh! Thanks to them
we've got plenty to sell!

00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:49.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna drop these off
at Erza's place.

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:51.318 position:33% line:83% align:start
Sounds good.
Tell her I said hello!

00:15:51.452 --> 00:15:54.021 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll head home and start dinner!

I'm sorry, sir.
I've tried everything I could.

00:16:00.929 --> 00:16:03.898 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's just not enough
in here to make sense.

[MALE PUNK 1]
Oh, come on!

00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:07.635 position:7% line:83% align:start

10,000 pilos!

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:09.269 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're just making up prices
as you go

00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:11.138 position:10% line:83% align:start
'cause you don't wanna let go
of the cash!

00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:12.907 position:13% line:89% align:start
Fair is fair! Cough it up!

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.376 position:7% line:83% align:start
I deserve 20,000 for putting up
with such bad service!

00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:18.847 position:30% line:83% align:start
The list price
is just 8,400 pilos

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.013 position:30% line:83% align:start
for what you've
brought in today.

I do apologize, sir,

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:23.350 position:21% line:83% align:start

any more than that.

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:37.732 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wasn't talking to you!

about the prices and she isn't.

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:43.270 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can prove it to you.

all those bamboo shoots?

for that little stunt!

if I wanted one of these
green onions here?

It's a 120 pilos.

That sound good!
This is a magic cart.

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:14.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was told it was made
with rare monsters

from Arsenic or something.

One of its tricks is detecting
the weight of all its contents

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.743 position:13% line:83% align:start
and calculating the amount
at which they'll be sold.

That's exactly the amount
that she was quoting you

00:17:28.215 --> 00:17:29.249 position:13% line:89% align:start
when I walked in the door.

I just came in here
to trade like you,

but I'm flattered
you think I could pull off

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:37.324 position:21% line:89% align:start
something like that.

to bail me out again.

00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:06.621 position:24% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't have
to put up with that crap.

00:18:06.754 --> 00:18:09.256 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I always will.
No matter what.

00:18:09.389 --> 00:18:11.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
Comes with being an item trader.

00:18:11.793 --> 00:18:13.528 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
Everything that I sell here

00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:16.064 position:13% line:83% align:start
was gathered by adventurers
who risked their lives and limbs

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:17.464 position:13% line:89% align:start
to get their hands on them.

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:20.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
So when they come in,
they feel entitled

00:18:20.167 --> 00:18:21.936 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the highest quality
of service.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.538 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm happy to give it to them.

00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:26.106 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I want people to feel
comfortable selling to me.

00:18:26.774 --> 00:18:30.410 position:19% line:83% align:start
But, if I'm being saved
every time there's an issue,

00:18:30.545 --> 00:18:34.348 position:10% line:83% align:start
it makes things more tense.
And I mean that for me, too.

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:36.684 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, come on.
Don't feel like that.

00:18:37.685 --> 00:18:40.187 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's wrong with somebody
wanting to help you out?

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.990 position:13% line:89% align:start
We all need help sometimes.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
I mean, just think about
how many times you've helped me.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.428 position:7% line:89% align:start
Actually. I wouldn't say that.

00:18:48.563 --> 00:18:50.263 position:38% line:83% align:start
Honestly,
I can't think of anything

00:18:50.397 --> 00:18:51.733 position:19% line:89% align:start
that I've done for you.

00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:53.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
No matter what I bring in,
you buy it from me

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:54.702 position:21% line:89% align:start
with a friendly smile

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:56.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
and that always lifts
my spirits!

00:18:57.304 --> 00:18:58.706 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's different.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.576 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know you want customers
to feel comfortable,

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:03.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
but they should know
that if they disrespect you,

00:19:04.112 --> 00:19:07.548 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll show up. Your comfort
matters too, doesn't it?

00:19:08.983 --> 00:19:10.350 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:12.120 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course, there's really
nothing I could do that

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:13.621 position:27% line:83% align:start
would come close
to the amount of happiness

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:16.189 position:21% line:83% align:start

Just in case there's any doubt,

00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:32.472 position:27% line:83% align:start
that wasn't part
of an item trade.

00:19:32.607 --> 00:19:35.510 position:16% line:83% align:start
That was a kiss from me,
simply because it felt right.

00:19:35.643 --> 00:19:37.210 position:33% line:83% align:start
All I ask is
that you remember it

00:20:02.637 --> 00:20:04.204 position:24% line:83% align:start
when the most money
we could make in one haul

00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:05.873 position:27% line:89% align:start
was 20,000 pilos?

00:20:06.007 --> 00:20:07.407 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just barely.

00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:11.946 position:38% line:89% align:start
[clicks]

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.648 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
200,000?

00:20:13.781 --> 00:20:17.185 position:19% line:83% align:start
We could buy over 6,000
bean sprouts with that amount!

00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:18.786 position:27% line:83% align:start
And with all that
we've saved up.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.923 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
We can finally buy a new house!

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:29.530 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:33.768 position:7% line:83% align:start
It feels surreal saying goodbye
to this old place, huh?

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:36.838 position:19% line:83% align:start
And there's an element
of sadness in it.

00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:38.405 position:35% line:89% align:start
Little bit.

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:41.542 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
I mean, so many memories.

00:20:41.676 --> 00:20:43.044 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Yeah.

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:45.146 position:16% line:83% align:start
I never realized how much
security it brings.

00:20:45.278 --> 00:20:48.916 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know, just having a place.
Somewhere to go home to.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.018 position:27% line:89% align:start
True. I get that.

00:20:53.087 --> 00:20:54.722 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
200,000.

00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:57.225 position:21% line:83% align:start
After killing slimes
for three days,

00:20:57.357 --> 00:21:00.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
we finally saved enough
to pay rent on our new place.

00:21:01.062 --> 00:21:02.964 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know it's no small amount.

00:21:03.765 --> 00:21:04.632 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:06.801 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Are you okay?

00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:09.137 position:41% line:89% align:start
Emily.

00:21:10.071 --> 00:21:12.472 position:19% line:83% align:start
What if we were to keep
our lease on this house too?

00:21:12.607 --> 00:21:15.143 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, after we move
into our new place?

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.845 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then we can just come back home
anytime we feel like it.

00:21:17.979 --> 00:21:19.412 position:16% line:89% align:start
Really? Could we do that?

00:21:19.547 --> 00:21:21.949 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't it be expensive
to keep both of them though?

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.751 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've been working hard
for so long

00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:25.452 position:10% line:89% align:start
to save money for more space.

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.955 position:24% line:83% align:start
But what we wanted
was more of our home.

00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:29.824 position:16% line:89% align:start
More of what's precious.

00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:32.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
If we lose that,
we'll have nothing.

00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:34.327 position:27% line:89% align:start
I agree with you.

00:21:37.064 --> 00:21:40.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
[hums]

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:46.240 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yawns]

00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:48.075 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hello, I have risen.

00:21:48.209 --> 00:21:51.279 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well good morning to you, Yoda!
Sleepy head.

00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:53.014 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your breakfast is ready.

00:21:53.147 --> 00:21:54.447 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:55.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] You still make
the best breakfasts

00:21:55.616 --> 00:21:56.551 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the whole wide world!

00:21:56.684 --> 00:21:58.152 position:5% line:89% align:start
Trust me, no one's a bigger fan

00:21:58.286 --> 00:21:59.854 position:16% line:83% align:start
of Emily's carrot dishes
than me!

00:21:59.987 --> 00:22:02.523 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hang on, when did you get here?
Who let you in?

00:22:02.657 --> 00:22:05.392 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where there are carrots,
there will be rabbits.

00:22:05.526 --> 00:22:07.061 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:22:07.195 --> 00:22:09.263 position:13% line:83% align:start
I figured I'd made too much
food, so it's no problem at all!

00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:12.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
Man. How did we get so lucky?

00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:14.836 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[RYOTA] Whatever, let's eat!
-[EMILY] Whatever, let's eat!

00:22:22.777 --> 00:22:26.614 position:50% line:89% align:start
