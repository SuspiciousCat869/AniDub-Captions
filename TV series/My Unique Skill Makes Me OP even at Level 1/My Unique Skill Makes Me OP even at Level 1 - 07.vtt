[RYOTA]
Before I was reincarnated,

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.682 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was a miserable salary man
at a toxic company.

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.183 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now I'm in a crazy world

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.485 position:7% line:83% align:start
where everything's an item drop
from monsters.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.622 position:27% line:83% align:start
In this new life,
I'm stuck at level 1.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:23.691 position:27% line:83% align:start
But lucky for me,
my unique skill has maxed out

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:26.326 position:10% line:89% align:start
all my drop stats to rank S.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.063 position:13% line:83% align:start
And today, I'm practically
swimming in rare drops

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.032 position:30% line:83% align:start
during a battle
for a new dungeon!

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.268 position:21% line:83% align:start
But there's something
about this drop

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.270 position:19% line:89% align:start
that isn't quite right.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:15.135 position:21% line:83% align:start
I need to burn this
as soon as possible.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.843 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:24.512 position:33% line:89% align:start
I've got you!

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.616 position:24% line:89% align:start
I have work to do.

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:31.919 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think that's enough magic
from you for today.

00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:33.755 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please go rest.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.693 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not yet. They're depending on me
to do this for them.

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:41.562 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, I must keep going.

00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:45.600 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've seen this too many times.

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:48.569 position:7% line:83% align:start
People will get so overwhelmed
by their responsibilities

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:51.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
that their health crashes
and their spirits are crushed.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.608 position:21% line:89% align:start
Some people even die.

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.878 position:30% line:83% align:start
But this is all
I can to do to help.

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:58.613 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:00.882 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, I know this isn't about me,

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.751 position:7% line:83% align:start
but I really don't want to see
that happen to you.

00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.053 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.588 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasps, exhales]

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:09.222 position:33% line:89% align:start
[body thuds]

00:03:12.994 --> 00:03:14.862 position:19% line:89% align:start
What was that? And why?

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.098 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
When two healing bullets fuse,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
they become a sleep bullet.

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:21.301 position:27% line:83% align:start
She wasn't going
to rest otherwise.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.370 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
That is an excellent call.

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:31.913 position:27% line:89% align:start
[whimpers] What?

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:33.781 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.952 position:21% line:89% align:start
[gasps] It's sunset?

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.293 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.862 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, I'm too late!

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:49.564 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:03:50.832 --> 00:03:54.902 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gunshots]

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:02.744 position:35% line:89% align:start
Incredible.

00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:04.879 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:09.851 position:30% line:83% align:start
We're so sorry
to keep you waiting!

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:12.486 position:24% line:83% align:start
Go ahead and bring
all the trash over this way!

00:04:13.154 --> 00:04:15.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] This is what
I call an excellent haul

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.624 position:24% line:89% align:start
of homing bullets!

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.194 position:30% line:83% align:start
I need everyone
in a straight line!

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.462 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! Why're you up?

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:25.833 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, you really need
to get some more sleep.

00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:27.001 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, she's right.

00:04:27.135 --> 00:04:28.468 position:7% line:83% align:start
The two of us can handle things
out here.

00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:29.804 position:24% line:89% align:start
Or did you wake up

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.304 position:19% line:83% align:start
because you're feeling
a bit hungry?

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.940 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.474 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CELESTE]
Wow!

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:38.513 position:30% line:83% align:start
And don't even
worry about the trash.

00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:41.682 position:24% line:83% align:start
We moved this tent
closer to the collection site.

00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:44.417 position:16% line:83% align:start
What are you waiting for?
Don't let it get cold!

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:46.754 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.727 position:38% line:89% align:start
[slurps]

00:04:57.098 --> 00:04:58.633 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's delicious.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sniffles]

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:02.236 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.238 position:38% line:83% align:start
She cries
when she's eating, too!

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:06.274 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're also like Yota in the way

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.743 position:16% line:83% align:start
you tend to push yourself
too hard.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:11.612 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Really?
-Yeah. If anyone knows, it's me.

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:13.714 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[chuckles]
-[BOTH] Huh?

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.349 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:19.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. We haven't even asked
your name yet.

00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:22.355 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm Celeste. Nice to meet you.

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:25.325 position:33% line:89% align:start
I get it now.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.794 position:5% line:89% align:start
The dungeon drops are tax-exempt

00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:29.297 position:21% line:83% align:start
until it's ownership
is officially decided.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.398 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why so many
adventurers are here

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:33.201 position:13% line:89% align:start
even at this time of year.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.470 position:10% line:83% align:start
Right. And they produce more
and more trash every single day.

00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:39.707 position:13% line:83% align:start
A lot more than one person
can handle.

00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:41.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, rest assured,
we'll help you out

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.010 position:19% line:89% align:start
whenever we can, okay?

00:05:43.144 --> 00:05:44.344 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hm. Hm.

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.647 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thank you. I appreciate that!

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.683 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yawns]

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:51.652 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
this is the only work I can do.

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:53.521 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't have any other skills?

00:05:58.226 --> 00:05:59.594 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:06:01.863 --> 00:06:03.631 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think she just fell asleep.

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:05.733 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure she's relieved
to not have to carry the weight

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:08.102 position:10% line:83% align:start
of that burden all on her own
anymore.

00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:11.572 position:13% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] It's like her body
can relax now that it's over.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.643 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:18.045 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's way more powerful
than yesterday!

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:19.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
She looks better.
Her color is back,

00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:23.184 position:19% line:83% align:start
and her natural beauty
is so much more noticeable now.

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:24.919 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Yeah, I agree.

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.658 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since I had a chance
to recharge,

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.761 position:13% line:83% align:start
my magic revived at an even
greater level than normal.

00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:35.763 position:21% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] Remember that
because you'll deflate again

00:06:35.897 --> 00:06:37.865 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you keep overworking
yourself.

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:39.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
We have plenty of
space and food.

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:42.435 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why don't you stay with us
until this event is over?

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.671 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:06:44.372 --> 00:06:48.009 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, I can't. You two already
have done so much for me.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.078 position:5% line:89% align:start
That tent is far too comfortable

00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:53.581 position:10% line:83% align:start
for you to be giving up space
to anyone.

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:56.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
Emily's unique skill
is making any place a home

00:06:56.584 --> 00:06:57.985 position:5% line:89% align:start
and there's just no escaping it.

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:59.120 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:02.657 position:19% line:83% align:start
I see. I didn't expect
such generosity.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.594 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:09.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hm. I'll stay with you
for a little while, then.

00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:12.432 position:10% line:83% align:start
-I'd say that settles it. Hm.
-Hm.

00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:13.935 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
All right. Well,

00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:16.170 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna go check in
at the Secro HQ.

00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:18.706 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I'll go with you
as far as the shops.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.374 position:5% line:89% align:start
We should be back by lunchtime.

00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:22.109 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why don't you head
on to the tent?

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:24.779 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:26.981 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:28.516 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.518 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Now that I look at it again,

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:33.054 position:19% line:83% align:start
this place kinda feels
like its own little town.

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:35.756 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh!
-Huh?

00:07:37.792 --> 00:07:39.593 position:33% line:83% align:start
Can I ask why
you're selling these here?

00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:41.729 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'd be surprised
at the high demand.

00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:43.831 position:21% line:83% align:start
There are lots of men
who work around here

00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:46.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
who buy them as gifts
for their wives.

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:47.868 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:50.438 position:19% line:5% align:start
[RYOTA] You've got one
for a million pilos?

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:52.472 position:5% line:11% align:start
Definitely couldn't afford that.

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:54.775 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're absolutely
beautiful, though!

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.011 position:27% line:83% align:start
I didn't realize
you were into jewelry.

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:59.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I've always loved
beautiful rings.

00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:01.449 position:10% line:83% align:start
They're too expensive for me,
obviously,

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:03.217 position:27% line:83% align:start
but the sentiment
always gets me.

00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:05.953 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a gift that really
means something, you know?

00:08:07.722 --> 00:08:09.523 position:27% line:83% align:start
[DUKE] Thank you
for coming here, Mr. Sato.

My name's Duke

00:08:11.092 --> 00:08:13.194 position:24% line:83% align:start
and it's a pleasure
to meet you. Welcome.

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:14.528 position:27% line:89% align:start
And you, as well.

00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:16.964 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'd like you
to take a look at this.

00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:19.100 position:41% line:83% align:start
[DUKE]
It's a sketch of Selen.

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:22.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
The new dungeon that Secro
and Hetero are fighting over.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.572 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, we're looking at
ten floors, then.

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:26.874 position:30% line:83% align:start
We already know
what drops are found there.

00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:30.277 position:21% line:83% align:start
Veggies on odd floors
and meats are on the even ones.

00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.479 position:21% line:89% align:start
Split half and half?

00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:32.546 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.382 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, we can't count numbers.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:37.385 position:16% line:83% align:start
Instead, we decided that
the side whose floors yield

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:40.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
the most rare drops
within the time limit would win.

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.289 position:7% line:89% align:start
Got it. I'll go right in and--

00:08:42.423 --> 00:08:43.758 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's no need to hunt.

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:45.960 position:30% line:83% align:start
The adventurers
who encounter rare monsters

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:48.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
on the vegetable floors
will capture them alive

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:49.530 position:10% line:89% align:start
and have them ready for you.

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:50.598 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:52.566 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the most efficient way.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
We've already solicited help

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.870 position:35% line:83% align:start
in exchange
for some reward money.

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:59.040 position:7% line:83% align:start
All we need you to do is focus
on getting us rare drops.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] They created their
whole strategy around me?

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:05.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not something that ever would've
happened in my old world.

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.848 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I gotta admit,
I like how they think.

00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:09.583 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MALE STAFF 1]
They've got a rare one!

00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.318 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's on the first level!

-[grunting]

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:17.425 position:41% line:83% align:start
[DUKE]
As long as it's in our custody,

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:18.893 position:7% line:89% align:start
we have the option to kill it.

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:20.594 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please take all the time
you need.

00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:21.530 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
You got it.

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:22.830 position:44% line:89% align:start

Do you know those people?

00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:29.538 position:5% line:89% align:start
The older man is called Harvard.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.706 position:19% line:83% align:start
He holds the same role
in Hetero's Dungeon Association

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.509 position:24% line:89% align:start
that I do in Secro.

00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:37.211 position:21% line:83% align:start
Next is an adventurer
called Eugene.

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:38.513 position:19% line:89% align:start
His skills are strong,

00:09:38.646 --> 00:09:40.549 position:19% line:83% align:start
but his plant drop rate
is F rank.

00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:41.949 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:43.717 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why bring an adventurer
with low drops?

00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:46.320 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, because he can defeat
rare plant monsters

00:09:46.454 --> 00:09:48.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
and keep them from making drops.

00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:51.425 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which means that we'll end up
with fewer opportunities

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.960 position:27% line:89% align:start
to collect them.

00:09:53.094 --> 00:09:55.096 position:7% line:83% align:start
Are you saying they brought him
to sabotage us?

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:59.366 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's right. But thankfully,
this time we have an advantage.

unless its hidden core
is destroyed.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.059 position:7% line:83% align:start
If it's attacked anywhere else
on its body,

00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:27.928 position:30% line:83% align:start
it regenerates
and only increases in strength.

Unfortunately for them,

you wanna give me this much?

It's an appropriate

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:29.544 position:35% line:83% align:start
he had more
of that same ring in stock,

00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:31.378 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I was really curious
about what kind of stray

might emerge
from a million-pilo ring

so I may have experimented.

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:40.254 position:7% line:83% align:start

I could buy you another one.

00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:51.965 position:16% line:83% align:start
but now there's an effect
attached to it.

What do you say
we go test it out?

00:13:57.938 --> 00:13:59.139 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.110 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is this level okay?

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:04.144 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:05.780 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:14:05.913 --> 00:14:07.549 position:19% line:89% align:start
There's one! A treant!

Oh. Is that a chicken breast?

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:20.695 position:21% line:89% align:start
I already got a drop!

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:22.863 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:24.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
You seem pretty happy about it.

00:14:24.632 --> 00:14:25.999 position:27% line:89% align:start
You have no idea!

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:28.869 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've been wanting a meat drop
for so long now

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:31.004 position:7% line:89% align:start
and this is my very first one!

00:14:32.406 --> 00:14:35.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
My animal drop rate
was consistent at rank F.

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:37.277 position:33% line:83% align:start
Even though F
is just one rank below E,

00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:38.946 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's actually
a huge difference

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:40.180 position:24% line:89% align:start
in status out here.

00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:41.783 position:13% line:89% align:start
The 'F' stands for 'final,'

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:44.552 position:19% line:83% align:start
so some dungeons won't
permit entry to anyone below E

00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:46.621 position:21% line:83% align:start
because they see them
as unqualified.

00:14:46.755 --> 00:14:48.222 position:30% line:89% align:start
I had no clue.

Hurry! Go on and shoot!

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:11.145 position:38% line:83% align:start
You seem
to have great drop rates!

00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:12.714 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's holding you back?

00:15:12.847 --> 00:15:14.549 position:27% line:83% align:start
Go ahead and kill
the treant beard!

We're rooting for ya!

Ah!

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:19.453 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] If I kill it,
it'll definitely drop something.

00:15:19.587 --> 00:15:22.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
That would bring Hetero's
score even with Secro's.

What's wrong?
Did you have a change of heart?

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:30.698 position:10% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't receive judgment
from anyone out here

00:15:30.832 --> 00:15:33.500 position:35% line:83% align:start

last night and realized

00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:33.327 position:13% line:83% align:start
without wearing this ring,
my animal drop rate falls to F.

Good for you for coming up
with that on the spot!

All the time that
we've spent together

Mr. Sato, I've been told
you did some quick thinking

00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:48.643 position:13% line:89% align:start
for us on the second level.

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:50.043 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:51.880 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, that wasn't me.
That was my partner.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:55.182 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well then, your partner
just earned some reward money.

00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:58.586 position:30% line:83% align:start
Although, we do
have an unfortunate problem.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.787 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:16:59.921 --> 00:17:02.089 position:33% line:83% align:start

for backup adventurers.

00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:03.691 position:13% line:89% align:start
They'll be arriving tonight

00:17:03.825 --> 00:17:06.694 position:7% line:83% align:start
and that backup will instantly
triple their numbers.

00:17:06.828 --> 00:17:09.731 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're saying the floors
that drop meat will be full?

00:17:09.864 --> 00:17:11.599 position:7% line:89% align:start
Actually, the reverse is true.

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:13.433 position:38% line:83% align:start
They plan
to fill the odd floors.

00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:23.878 position:30% line:83% align:start

is to fight fire with fire.

00:17:24.646 --> 00:17:27.314 position:16% line:83% align:start

If we could somehow
still collect drops

00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:31.986 position:27% line:83% align:start
on floors three,
five, seven, and nine

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:34.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
we'd at least be tied
with them, now wouldn't we?

00:17:34.556 --> 00:17:37.291 position:30% line:83% align:start
If we did that,
we'd effectively win, but.

00:17:37.424 --> 00:17:39.159 position:33% line:83% align:start
Listen, Duke,
you gotta raise the reward

00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:40.628 position:13% line:89% align:start
for finding rare monsters.

00:17:40.762 --> 00:17:42.030 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm talking ten million!

00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:43.631 position:19% line:89% align:start
What? That's too much!

00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:45.967 position:10% line:83% align:start
If we were to pay that amount
and not get any drops,

00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:47.502 position:5% line:89% align:start
it would be a catastrophic loss!

00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:50.103 position:30% line:83% align:start
I guarantee you
that I will get rare drops.

00:17:50.237 --> 00:17:51.471 position:35% line:89% align:start
Guarantee?

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:53.608 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I kill something,
and nothing drops,

00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:55.777 position:30% line:83% align:start

the same amount back.

Level five.

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:19.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
The rare form of the danger bear
is the danger panda.

Once slain, it drops saltwort.

Level seven.

00:18:23.605 --> 00:18:26.440 position:7% line:83% align:start
The rare form of the mad golem
is the rock golem.

It drops daikon radish sprouts.

Man, getting these "rare drops"

00:18:29.978 --> 00:18:31.946 position:19% line:83% align:start
where I'm from would be
such a game changer.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.616 position:21% line:83% align:start

the weak head changes!

Yes, we've got this in the bag.

00:19:10.183 --> 00:19:11.485 position:7% line:89% align:start
We owe all of it to you, Duke.

Oh, come on, don't be so modest!

00:19:13.588 --> 00:19:16.924 position:16% line:83% align:start

At my old office,

00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:26.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
every suggestion I offered
was rejected.

00:19:26.734 --> 00:19:27.835 position:33% line:89% align:start
But out here,

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:29.837 position:10% line:83% align:start
my idea to devote 40 million
to adventurers

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:32.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
was taken seriously
and embraced.

00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:36.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whether we win or not,
I just made a big purchase,

00:19:36.744 --> 00:19:39.413 position:10% line:83% align:start
so I'm gonna need some quick

Just this. A little punishment.

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:58.900 position:19% line:83% align:start
Everyone you see here,
including me, has F drop rates.

If we could've stopped Secro,
the money would've been ours.

00:20:02.637 --> 00:20:05.238 position:24% line:83% align:start
And thanks to you,
we're no longer needed.

00:20:11.045 --> 00:20:14.515 position:7% line:83% align:start
This magic circle has the same
effect as a magic storm.

00:20:14.649 --> 00:20:17.885 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll no longer be able
to use your projectiles.

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:19.887 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, we won't kill you.

00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:22.757 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I will not rest
until I know for sure

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll never work
around here again!

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:28.629 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all shout]

00:20:30.198 --> 00:20:33.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Well, so long as
I don't think about efficiency.

00:20:33.668 --> 00:20:35.870 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:38.873 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm stronger
when I don't use my guns.

00:20:39.006 --> 00:20:40.575 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:20:43.745 --> 00:20:46.647 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasps] I mean, you can try but.

00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:50.283 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
You can use them? But how?

00:20:50.852 --> 00:20:54.354 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been able to use them
during a magic storm before.

00:20:56.157 --> 00:20:57.759 position:33% line:89% align:start
[gun clicks]

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:00.094 position:33% line:89% align:start
[gun clicks]

00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:01.129 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.831 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gunshots]

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.834 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:21:06.968 --> 00:21:07.835 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:09.637 position:16% line:89% align:start
It doesn't hurt anymore.

00:21:09.771 --> 00:21:11.404 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:14.008 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] This one's loaded
with special bullets.

00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:15.977 position:38% line:83% align:start
It works
just like healing magic.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.780 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gunshots]

00:21:20.748 --> 00:21:22.083 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[RYOTA] Ready.
-[EUGENE] How though?

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:24.852 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm fairly certain
you won't believe me, but.

00:21:24.986 --> 00:21:27.789 position:35% line:83% align:start
I honestly
understand how you're feeling.

00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:29.456 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, it's cool
if you wanna attack me

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.926 position:19% line:83% align:start
if it'll provide some
sort of peace for you.

00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:34.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you hurt yourself
in the process,

00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:35.997 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll be there to help you heal.

00:21:36.531 --> 00:21:38.766 position:21% line:83% align:start
But don't count on me
to lose, either.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've got someone special waiting
for me to come home safe.

00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:44.705 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:48.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
I really envy you.
I wish I had someone like that.

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.944 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
She wasn't always with me.

00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:53.214 position:7% line:83% align:start
There's still time for you to
find your own someone someday.

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:58.152 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:21:58.286 --> 00:21:59.352 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
I'm back.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:00.721 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Hi! Welcome back!

00:22:00.855 --> 00:22:02.790 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CELESTE]
Yes, welcome back!

00:22:02.924 --> 00:22:04.391 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
We've been waiting for you!

00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:06.393 position:7% line:89% align:start
Dinner's already on the table.

00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:10.330 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm really here, aren't I?
I'm home.

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:15.368 position:35% line:83% align:start
Well, yeah.
Where else would you be?
