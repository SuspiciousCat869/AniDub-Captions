Oh, yeah?

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:34.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, in that case,
I'll give you some advice

that I hope you'll remember.

who I aspire to be more like.

Aren't you supposed
to be in the dungeon?

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:03.397 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was making a brief
stop back here

00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:05.833 position:13% line:83% align:start
but then I heard the three
of you were fighting a monster

00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:07.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
that showed up during
the festival.

Why don't you ditch
this little "family"

would.

Yeah. Goods that're gathered
for the harvest festival

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
are turned into strays
in the arena

00:13:47.762 --> 00:13:50.230 position:7% line:83% align:start
and then adventurers kill them
as a demonstration.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.499 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wow. That is super weird.

Fighters participate in pairs
to reduce the risk a bit.

And if a team manages to defeat
one of the many strays,

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.207 position:38% line:83% align:start
they can
get a rare item as a prize.

That's the best part!

Well, why don't we join, then?

Who are you gonna have
as your teammate?

Assuming you really
do want to participate,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.220 position:5% line:83% align:start
you need to pick one more person
to fight alongside you.

Yeah, are you seriously
that surprised?

There's no pressure
if you don't want to,

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.168 position:13% line:83% align:start

the perfect partner.

always out there getting intel

your extended knowledge

The carrots must have died.
It's death and carrots, baby.

[MALE ADVENTURER 1] Why isn't
anything dropping, down here?

[MALE ADVENTURER 2] How am I
supposed to pay off my mortgage

00:20:07.542 --> 00:20:09.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
if I can't earn any money?

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know, but what are we supposed
to do about it?

00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:14.182 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not like you're
the only one with debt.

00:20:14.182 --> 00:20:17.719 position:7% line:83% align:start
Man, what do I tell my family
when I come home with nothing?

00:20:17.719 --> 00:20:21.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
Damn it! The drops can't
have stopped completely, right?

00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:24.224 position:35% line:83% align:start
Let's go.
Just gotta keep looking.

00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:27.360 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is bad.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.395 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, it is.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.864 position:5% line:89% align:start
Prices are already rising,

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:31.799 position:19% line:83% align:start
and people are buying
all that they can.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.769 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do we do if
we can't buy vegetables to cook?

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:37.572 position:35% line:83% align:start
Low-level!
Make a carrot come out!

00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:39.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
If only it were that easy.

00:20:39.874 --> 00:20:40.908 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hurry up!

00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:43.410 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm telling you,
it's not gonna happen.

[gunshot]

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:48.850 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.520 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh! Yay!
It's a resurrected carrot!

-[gulps]
-I don't understand, though.

00:20:54.889 --> 00:20:58.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nothing is dropping for anybody
else, so how is that possible?

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.862 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did they stop
for everyone but me?

00:21:00.862 --> 00:21:03.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
I had a feeling
that someone was calling me

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:04.498 position:16% line:89% align:start
but I couldn't tell who!

00:21:04.498 --> 00:21:05.800 position:16% line:89% align:start
I heard about that, too.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.202 position:5% line:83% align:start
Apparently,
it's pretty useless, Yota.

00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:09.904 position:7% line:89% align:start
They say nothing drops at all.

00:21:09.904 --> 00:21:12.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could there be
no drops whatsoever?

00:21:13.074 --> 00:21:15.042 position:27% line:89% align:start
That must be it!

00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:16.343 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gulps]
-Hey, Yota?

00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:17.912 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
I'm gonna go check something!

[RYOTA] If all of the dungeons
are like Nihonium now...

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:33.594 position:10% line:89% align:start
And if I'm right about Alice

00:21:33.594 --> 00:21:35.696 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the presence
she was picking up on.

00:21:40.935 --> 00:21:42.069 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:21:46.274 --> 00:21:48.042 position:33% line:89% align:start
I found you!

00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:50.377 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're the reason nothing's
dropping in the dungeons,

00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:52.379 position:33% line:89% align:start
aren't you?

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:54.682 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're Nihonium's
dungeon master!

[thuds]

00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:09.030 position:24% line:89% align:start
What is going on?

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.766 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why are none
of my attacks working?
