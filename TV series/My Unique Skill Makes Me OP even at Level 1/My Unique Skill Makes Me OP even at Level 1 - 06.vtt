[RYOTA]
Before I was reincarnated,

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:13.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was a miserable salaryman
at a toxic company.

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:15.182 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now I'm in a crazy world

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.417 position:7% line:83% align:start
where everything's an item drop
from monsters.

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:19.888 position:27% line:83% align:start
In this new life,
I'm stuck at level 1.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.589 position:27% line:89% align:start
But lucky for me,

00:00:21.723 --> 00:00:25.225 position:10% line:83% align:start
my unique skill has maxed out
all my drop stats to rank S.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
And today, I'm working
on getting my license,

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:30.497 position:10% line:83% align:start
while simultaneously dealing
with another gorilla?

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:33.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
But it's fine, because I end up
meeting a mysterious girl

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.168 position:38% line:83% align:start
who knows
how to use fire magic.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:37.204 position:13% line:83% align:start
What the heck is happening
out here?

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.403 position:33% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I got
some new watermelon drops today.

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:18.438 position:10% line:83% align:start
Think you could appraise them
for me?

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.577 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
Wow, that looks amazing!

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.712 position:10% line:89% align:start
Another job well done, Ryota!

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:27.314 position:7% line:83% align:start
Give me just a minute to gather
some things from the back.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I'll be right with you.
-[ERIC] That won't be necessary.

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:35.288 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm ready to assess your goods
right here and now.

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:36.724 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Eric!

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:38.258 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERIC]
Let's see.

00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:40.928 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:42.630 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, my! The refreshing texture

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:45.933 position:19% line:83% align:start
and juicy, sweet flavor
fulfills my soul.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.870 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's like I'm on a beach
with the sun blazing down

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.873 position:5% line:83% align:start
while a soft breeze blows gently
against my skin!

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:53.508 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MAN] What's that?
Watermelons from the guy

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
who makes Ryota's bamboo Shoots?

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.344 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MAN 2] First bamboo shoots,
and now watermelons?

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:00.313 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[MAN 3] I gotta try a bite!
-Hey! That's mine!

00:03:00.447 --> 00:03:02.482 position:10% line:89% align:start
Put that down and back away!

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.986 position:24% line:89% align:start
They all want them!

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.988 position:21% line:83% align:start
Would you be willing
to let us sell your watermelons

00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.057 position:16% line:83% align:start
exclusively in our store
as well?

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.625 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sure.

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.261 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Wow. The watermelons
are just as popular

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.863 position:21% line:89% align:start
as the bamboo shoots!

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:17.865 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right!
Nothing wrong with finding

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
another reliable source
of income!

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.736 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
Oh! Ryota.

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are those watermelons
still dropped

00:03:23.638 --> 00:03:25.807 position:7% line:83% align:start
-on the fifth level of Telulu?
-Uh-huh.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.743 position:27% line:83% align:start
I hope that means
you've gotten your license?

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:29.877 position:33% line:89% align:start
What license?

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
Um, the one that gives you
permission

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:34.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
to start exploring dungeons
that are lower than level six.

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:37.384 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because dungeons get more
dangerous every fifth level.

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
It ensures you have
the ability to survive.

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.421 position:27% line:83% align:start
And each town has
its own policy.

00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:44.859 position:7% line:83% align:start
In Secro, there's a new license
every five levels,

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:47.161 position:10% line:83% align:start
and traders aren't permitted
to buy items

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:48.730 position:19% line:89% align:start
dropped in those levels

00:03:48.863 --> 00:03:50.732 position:7% line:83% align:start
if the adventurer doesn't have
the appropriate license.

00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:52.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
I get that.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.135 position:10% line:83% align:start
It'd keep people from putting
themselves in danger

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.570 position:10% line:89% align:start
to score more valuable items.

00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:57.404 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
Yes, and it's a firm rule.

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:58.940 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, I recommend
getting a license

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:01.241 position:21% line:83% align:start
to make things easier
in the future.

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:04.512 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Guess this is it.

00:04:05.513 --> 00:04:06.848 position:33% line:89% align:start
Anyone here?

00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:14.555 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hi. I'd like to get a license.
Is this the right place?

00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:18.192 position:24% line:89% align:start
Your achievements?

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:19.594 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:21.829 position:33% line:83% align:start
When they ask
about your achievements...

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.532 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, I've been bringing back
watermelons

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:27.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
from the fifth level
of Telulu regularly.

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:32.439 position:35% line:83% align:start
[EXAMINER]
Telulu, huh?

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.043 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come this way.

00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:40.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's his problem?
Talk about attitude.

00:04:42.884 --> 00:04:46.419 position:19% line:83% align:start
This melon was dropped
at level six or lower in Telulu.

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:48.623 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to turn it
into a stray.

00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:51.259 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you can defeat it, you pass.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.794 position:38% line:89% align:start
Be ready.

00:04:52.927 --> 00:04:55.963 position:21% line:83% align:start
You haven't seen this
on any other level before.

00:04:56.097 --> 00:04:57.064 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scoffs]

00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:58.766 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's what I was hoping for.

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:02.937 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here goes!

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.972 position:35% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:08.543 position:35% line:83% align:start
Looks like
that one's a steel slime!

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:11.179 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's so tough,
blades are useless against it!

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.749 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's fine. I'm not gonna wait
to see what it does.

00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:18.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll show it what I do
with my rank S strength!

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.292 position:10% line:83% align:start
That really is hard as steel,
ow.

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.794 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Be careful.
-It's no problem.

00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:29.564 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've got a plan
that should prove interesting.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.970 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, slime,
let's see what you've got!

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:38.906 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[gun fires]
-[explosion]

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.775 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's a fire bullet!

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:42.944 position:24% line:83% align:start
But it doesn't seem
to be working yet!

00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:45.580 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Wait. Just give me a minute!
-[gun fires]

00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:48.850 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
And now it's a freezing bullet.

00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:52.086 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hold on. Watch this part.

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.353 position:44% line:89% align:start
See?

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.790 position:30% line:89% align:start
[glass cracks]

00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:58.993 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[shatters]
-Whoa! How did you do that?

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.661 position:21% line:89% align:start
Temperature extremes.

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:02.563 position:38% line:83% align:start
I hit it
with a powerful fire bullet,

00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:04.832 position:7% line:83% align:start
and then, immediately froze it
with the freezing bullet.

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:07.935 position:13% line:83% align:start
It makes the metal brittle,
which weakens it to order!

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.771 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Wow!
-Amazing!

00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:13.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
Guess the joke's on me!
You're really something, kiddo!

00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:15.710 position:21% line:83% align:start
You have my approval
as an examiner!

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:19.046 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your Secro license for levels
six and beyond is approved!

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.314 position:27% line:89% align:start
Congratulations!

00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:23.383 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Look at my shiny new license!

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:25.553 position:5% line:89% align:start
Congrats! You truly deserve it!

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:28.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been working here
for over ten years.

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:29.790 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've never been so impressed!

00:06:29.924 --> 00:06:32.193 position:30% line:83% align:start
Secro's future
sure is looking bright!

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:35.863 position:10% line:83% align:start
How to make this a consistent
gig and get those regularly?

00:06:35.997 --> 00:06:38.666 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[EMILY] Yota?
-Lemme think. Oh, that's right.

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:40.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've got some preparing to do.

00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:43.170 position:5% line:89% align:start
Emily! I'm gonna need your help!

00:06:43.304 --> 00:06:46.040 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's something important
I have to find.

00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.176 position:7% line:89% align:start
Looks like we finally made it!

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.711 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:55.216 position:5% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] When you said you needed
1.5 million pilos

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:56.684 position:13% line:89% align:start
because you wanted a tuna,

00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:59.153 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have to admit,
you really threw me for a loop.

00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:01.889 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've got a theory
I've been wanting to test out.

00:07:02.023 --> 00:07:05.760 position:10% line:83% align:start
But the first step is turning
this tuna into a stray.

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:07.862 position:30% line:89% align:start
There it goes!

00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:11.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
[gasps] That stray looks
kinda familiar.

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
[roars]

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.903 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's the same kind of gorilla
that attacked Secro!

00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:19.206 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Don't worry! I can handle this!

00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:21.409 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'll hit it
with a freezing bullet first.

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:23.577 position:13% line:89% align:start
That should immobilize it!

00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:29.317 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sorry, man!

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.452 position:21% line:83% align:start
It sucks that this is
the same gun, but I gotta do it!

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.690 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gun fires]

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:39.794 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Wow! That was amazing, Yota!

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:41.562 position:13% line:83% align:start
That first gorilla gave you
so much trouble,

00:07:41.696 --> 00:07:43.898 position:21% line:83% align:start
but you beat this one
in record time!

00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:45.232 position:41% line:89% align:start
[poof]

00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:48.569 position:10% line:89% align:start
Awesome! Just like I thought!

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:51.639 position:24% line:83% align:start
Gorillas drop guns
as well as the ammunition.

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:53.941 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now, I can be
a double pistol wielder!

00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:55.643 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is gonna make it
a lot easier

00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:57.912 position:16% line:83% align:start
to handle special bullet
combinations!

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:01.749 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why do you need two guns?
You've got me worried!

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:05.019 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please don't get too excited
and end up being evil!

00:08:06.554 --> 00:08:08.889 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, come on! It's fine!

00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:12.159 position:7% line:83% align:start
As long as I have you around,
I'll be as peaceful as a dove!

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did something happen?

00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:23.571 position:10% line:83% align:start
Actually, we've got a strike
on our hands.

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:24.739 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Doesn't sound like things

00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:26.407 position:13% line:89% align:start
have been as peaceful here.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.976 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ERZA] The Adalberd Group
occupies level six of Silicon,

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.345 position:16% line:83% align:start
and that's the only place
to get rice.

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:32.847 position:13% line:89% align:start
But now, they're telling me

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.682 position:7% line:83% align:start
that if I don't raise the price
of rice in Secro,

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:36.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
then, they won't sell me
any more.

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.185 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not good.

00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:39.754 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.158 position:16% line:83% align:start
I suppose the first thing
I should do

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:46.527 position:13% line:83% align:start
is find whoever's in charge
and talk to them.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.929 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NEPTUNE]
Well, well, if it isn't Sato.

00:08:49.397 --> 00:08:51.999 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Oh, Neptune. Hi.

00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:54.535 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Surprised to see you.
-I'm guessing that you're here

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:56.871 position:10% line:83% align:start
because of Adalberd as well,
aren't you?

00:08:57.004 --> 00:09:00.541 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Yeah. So, are you then?
-I came by request.

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:03.744 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Request?
-Adalberd does this quite a lot.

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:05.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
As a result, the people in town

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:07.481 position:19% line:83% align:start
are finally running out
of patience.

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, I've come to see
if I can find

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:11.152 position:16% line:83% align:start
a more permanent solution
to the problem.

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.254 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you trying to say
the Neptune Group's here

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:14.688 position:10% line:89% align:start
to get rid of them for good?

00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:16.457 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, not quite.

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:19.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
Less getting-rid-of,
more destroying.

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.830 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Question for you.
-[NEPTUNE] What is it?

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:24.698 position:13% line:83% align:start
Would you be opposed to me
handling it?

00:09:24.832 --> 00:09:27.034 position:19% line:83% align:start
You want to be the one
to destroy them?

00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:28.702 position:35% line:89% align:start
Get rid of.

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:32.306 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.941 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ADELBERD] See?
This is what you're doing wrong.

00:09:34.075 --> 00:09:36.077 position:10% line:89% align:start
You gotta go in there and...

00:09:36.477 --> 00:09:37.878 position:16% line:89% align:start
Stand back! Who are you?

00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:40.314 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MAN] Entry to this level
is forbidden!

00:09:42.283 --> 00:09:44.952 position:10% line:83% align:start
-So, you're gonna use force?
-Get out here!

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:48.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
We've got townies trying
to muscle their way in!

00:09:52.293 --> 00:09:53.828 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:09.443 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, so glad that worked out.

00:10:09.578 --> 00:10:10.978 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wow! What is that?

00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:13.881 position:10% line:83% align:start
Jeez. You really have to stop
doing that to me!

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:17.918 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is a healing bullet.
All it does is heal wounds.

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.453 position:19% line:83% align:start
But when two are fused
together,

00:10:19.588 --> 00:10:20.955 position:13% line:89% align:start
it becomes a sleep bullet.

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:22.957 position:10% line:83% align:start
And it will knock your target
right out.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.792 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yep! Getting a second gun

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.928 position:13% line:83% align:start
opened up a whole new world
of possibilities for me!

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:34.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
What can be accomplished
with two guns?

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
I tested out a whole mess
of theories I had.

00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:43.811 position:13% line:89% align:start
Amazing! How'd you do that?

00:10:43.944 --> 00:10:45.980 position:16% line:83% align:start
I shot a freezing bullet
and a fire bullet

00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:47.582 position:19% line:89% align:start
at the exact same time,

00:10:47.715 --> 00:10:50.351 position:13% line:83% align:start
which apparently turns them
into an erasing bullet.

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:52.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
Erasing? That's so cool!

00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:54.655 position:7% line:83% align:start
It seems like you've been able
to do so much

00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:57.057 position:5% line:89% align:start
just by using one bullet combo!

00:10:58.092 --> 00:11:00.394 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I took her observation
as a generous hint

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:03.632 position:13% line:83% align:start
and started trying several
other bullet combinations.

00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:06.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
There are any number
of bullet fusions

00:11:06.734 --> 00:11:08.135 position:7% line:89% align:start
just waiting to be discovered,

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:10.605 position:24% line:83% align:start
all because I made
the wise decision

00:11:10.738 --> 00:11:12.507 position:21% line:89% align:start
to get a second gun.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.343 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ah, so, you're actually doubling
their healing power.

00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:17.978 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's exactly it.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:21.015 position:41% line:83% align:start
Right.
I gotta get these guys outside.

00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:24.051 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why, yes, I would love help.
Thank you so much.

00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:25.119 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:32.193 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, now, if it isn't
the infamous Ryota Sato.

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:36.263 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Wait for it, and...

00:11:36.397 --> 00:11:37.798 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:11:38.633 --> 00:11:41.769 position:13% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I don't want to do
any more eyecatches!

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:44.138 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CLINT]
Thank you for coming by.

00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:46.373 position:27% line:83% align:start
As you may know,
I'm Clint Gray,

00:11:46.508 --> 00:11:48.108 position:13% line:89% align:start
the dungeon chief of Secro.

00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:51.513 position:24% line:83% align:start
-The dungeon chief?
-What? Doesn't ring a bell?

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:52.880 position:13% line:89% align:start
It means I hold a position

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:55.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
of considerable authority
in town.

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:56.551 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we?

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:00.387 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's a favor I would like
to ask of you.

00:12:00.522 --> 00:12:01.956 position:35% line:83% align:start
-There is?
-Yes.

00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:03.658 position:27% line:83% align:start
I want to request
your assistance

00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.025 position:5% line:89% align:start
in the battle for a new dungeon

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:07.494 position:10% line:83% align:start
against our neighboring city
of Hetero.

00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:10.464 position:30% line:83% align:start
We're fighting
over a new dungeon?

00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:11.999 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a sticky situation.

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:14.335 position:21% line:83% align:start
The dungeons that lay
to the East of Secro

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:15.803 position:24% line:89% align:start
have meat as drops

00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:18.005 position:19% line:83% align:start
and we all know Hetero
is the livestock city.

00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:19.641 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Well, I didn't.

00:12:19.773 --> 00:12:22.009 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CLINT] But an unusual dungeon
was recently discovered

00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:24.478 position:19% line:83% align:start
halfway between Hetero
and Secro.

00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:28.082 position:5% line:83% align:start
Strangely, the drops in this one
appear to be divided evenly

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:30.217 position:10% line:89% align:start
between vegetables and meat.

00:12:30.351 --> 00:12:32.052 position:7% line:89% align:start
If there were more vegetables,

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:34.288 position:13% line:83% align:start
then, Secro could claim it
free and clear.

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:37.024 position:33% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Okay.
So, they decide ownership

00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:38.693 position:13% line:89% align:start
by the ratio of the drops.

00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:40.261 position:33% line:89% align:start
Cool, but...

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:42.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is it necessary to pick
which city it'll belong to

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.398 position:24% line:83% align:start
if people from both
can hunt there?

00:12:44.532 --> 00:12:45.366 position:41% line:89% align:start
[angry]

00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:46.967 position:27% line:89% align:start
A tax is applied

00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:49.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
to the sale of every single
dropped item, you fool!

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.038 position:10% line:89% align:start
Which means dungeon ownership

00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:53.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
makes a huge difference
in a town's economic health!

00:12:54.842 --> 00:12:57.378 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right. Sorry.

00:12:57.512 --> 00:13:00.781 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, I apologize
for losing my composure.

00:13:00.914 --> 00:13:02.950 position:5% line:89% align:start
Allow me a moment to cool down.

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.489 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:08.623 --> 00:13:12.059 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah! Sugar. It perks me right up!

00:13:12.594 --> 00:13:13.894 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
That's hardcore.

00:13:14.028 --> 00:13:16.163 position:21% line:83% align:start
Guess they don't know
about diabetes here.

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:18.533 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, since meat
and vegetables are found

00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:20.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
in equal proportions there,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.069 position:30% line:83% align:start
we decided that
we'd determine its ownership

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:24.338 position:27% line:83% align:start
based on who gets
more rare drops.

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.407 position:13% line:83% align:start
As you've become well known
around the city

00:13:26.541 --> 00:13:28.510 position:19% line:83% align:start
for both your strength
and your high drop rates,

00:13:28.643 --> 00:13:31.111 position:7% line:83% align:start
I knew you were just the person
we needed.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:33.715 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll be compensated,
of course.

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:35.282 position:13% line:89% align:start
A cash payment, if we lose.

00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:38.052 position:13% line:83% align:start
And an exemption from taxes
on all dropped items

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:40.054 position:19% line:83% align:start
you receive henceforth,
if we win.

00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:43.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you say?
Will you accept this challenge?

00:13:43.424 --> 00:13:46.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] It's nice
having my work recognized

00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:49.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
and knowing that people
depend on me.

00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:51.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll need to bring my guns.

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:53.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I should have plenty
of special bullets ready.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.503 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, that just leaves
the magic cart,

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:57.304 position:19% line:89% align:start
a change of clothes...

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:02.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
Feels like I'm getting ready
for a business trip.

00:14:02.811 --> 00:14:06.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
Back then, I worked too hard.
Pushed myself to breaking.

00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:10.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now, I've got Emily
to look out for me.

00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:11.385 position:41% line:89% align:start
Emily.

00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:14.154 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:16.957 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's the story.

00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:20.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, I'll be heading out
to this new dungeon, Selen.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.464 position:19% line:83% align:start
Really? Wow! Just like
the Neptune Group does.

00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:25.466 position:27% line:83% align:start
Being asked to go
and inspect a dungeon

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.201 position:16% line:89% align:start
is a seriously big deal.

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.936 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, I recall hearing

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.739 position:24% line:83% align:start
they were the ones
who checked out Nihonium.

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:33.207 position:27% line:83% align:start
You'll do great.
And don't worry.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.076 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be right here, holding down
the fort while you're away.

00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:38.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was hoping you could come too.

00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:40.948 position:10% line:83% align:start
-What? You want me with you?
-Yeah.

00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:43.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why, though? I won't be much use
to you there.

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:45.152 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not true!

00:14:45.687 --> 00:14:48.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just having you there
will be a huge help.

00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:55.830 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Low-Level! Carrots!
-You're here?

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:58.165 position:10% line:89% align:start
Focus! What about my carrots?

00:14:58.298 --> 00:14:59.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
It'll be all right.

00:14:59.734 --> 00:15:02.336 position:7% line:83% align:start
We'll get as many as you need,
before we leave.

00:15:02.804 --> 00:15:04.204 position:44% line:83% align:start
[EVE]
You better!

00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:08.208 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
It's so empty.

00:15:08.342 --> 00:15:10.110 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, most things become strays

00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:12.980 position:27% line:83% align:start
except for three,
air, water, and earth.

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:15.048 position:27% line:83% align:start
Other than places
with lots of people,

00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:17.852 position:16% line:83% align:start
like towns and dungeons,
it's this way everywhere.

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:19.319 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow.

00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:22.423 position:5% line:89% align:start
Still crazy how desolate it is.

00:15:22.857 --> 00:15:24.793 position:16% line:89% align:start
This world is so strange.

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:27.361 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, whatcha doing down there?

00:15:27.562 --> 00:15:30.197 position:19% line:83% align:start
Traveling between towns
can be really tough.

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.700 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want to leave
a little something along the way

00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:36.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
in case it helps cheer up anyone
who passes after us.

00:15:36.704 --> 00:15:40.909 position:13% line:83% align:start
Draw a circle like the sun,
make it nice and big and round.

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.544 position:16% line:89% align:start
Add another, what ya got?

00:15:42.677 --> 00:15:46.548 position:13% line:83% align:start
A little face just waiting
to be found.

00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:49.416 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh! I can't forget the body!

00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:51.820 position:41% line:83% align:start
There,
it's standing nice and tall,

00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:55.422 position:13% line:83% align:start
so people remember to keep
their heads up no matter what.

00:15:55.657 --> 00:15:56.990 position:30% line:89% align:start
Swoosh, swoosh.

00:15:57.257 --> 00:16:00.294 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whoops. I need to add
some pupils to the eyes.

00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:02.095 position:30% line:89% align:start
[clears throat]

00:16:02.996 --> 00:16:06.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's all done, can you see?
A friend for you and me.

00:16:08.803 --> 00:16:10.772 position:30% line:89% align:start
Um, what is it?

00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:13.073 position:13% line:89% align:start
[giggles] Mr. Bean Sprout!

00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:15.910 position:19% line:83% align:start
A source of both energy
and happiness!

00:16:16.043 --> 00:16:19.379 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right. Of course.
Here, let me.

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:22.951 position:44% line:83% align:start
Wow!
You're a pretty good artist.

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:24.586 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a cute buddy you gave him.

00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:27.988 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, thanks.
Yours is cuter, though.

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:35.462 position:10% line:83% align:start
-There, now it's really done.
-Okay!

00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:37.064 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you ready
to get moving again?

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:38.600 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yep, let's go.

00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:48.408 position:13% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] Hey, Yota. Can you
hold up that side, please?

00:16:48.543 --> 00:16:50.010 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
I think so, yeah.

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:53.280 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] And, hup! There!
Now, were all set.

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:57.785 position:21% line:83% align:start
A backpack that small
had a tent this big in it?

00:16:57.919 --> 00:17:00.487 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's time for me to show off
my real skills.

00:17:00.622 --> 00:17:03.023 position:19% line:83% align:start
But first, could you go
and fetch some water for us?

00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:04.324 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.329 position:21% line:89% align:start
[loud banging noise]

00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:13.166 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] What the heck
is going on in there?

00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:17.705 position:10% line:83% align:start
Roughing it in the wilderness
like this

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.374 position:10% line:83% align:start
is a big change after living
in a nice, cozy house

00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:22.142 position:19% line:89% align:start
with Emily for so long.

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:25.045 position:21% line:83% align:start
I got up super early
to go find carrots too.

00:17:25.178 --> 00:17:26.981 position:21% line:89% align:start
Low-Level. Nice job.

00:17:27.114 --> 00:17:29.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sure hope I left enough of them.

00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:31.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] I'm finished.
You wanna see?

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:32.486 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:17:34.556 --> 00:17:37.692 position:16% line:83% align:start
What? Where in the world
did you get all this?

00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:40.294 position:33% line:83% align:start
A warm light
illuminating the space?

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
A comfy bench inviting you
to sit down?

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.466 position:7% line:83% align:start
And a table set with what looks
like seriously good food!

00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:50.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
Emily can transform
even a humble tent into a home!

00:17:51.471 --> 00:17:53.041 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait, you didn't say,

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:55.843 position:10% line:83% align:start
where did all this furniture
and food and stuff come from?

00:17:56.544 --> 00:17:59.413 position:16% line:83% align:start
Here, I made sure to pack
everything we would need.

00:17:59.547 --> 00:18:01.315 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was pretty heavy, though.

00:18:02.282 --> 00:18:04.752 position:10% line:83% align:start
What kind of magical backpack
is that?

00:18:04.886 --> 00:18:06.153 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Guess what?

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:07.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's a treat
for after dinner too!

00:18:07.655 --> 00:18:08.823 position:41% line:89% align:start
[moans]

00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:11.593 position:19% line:83% align:start
Going on our first trip
together is very special.

00:18:11.793 --> 00:18:14.562 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was so happy,
I put in extra effort.

00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:16.396 position:38% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
So cute!

00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:22.369 position:10% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] Oh, right! I should
go ahead and burn our trash.

00:18:22.704 --> 00:18:23.771 position:38% line:89% align:start
Burn it?

00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:26.173 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Instead of throwing it out?
-Yes, of course.

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:27.809 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's only proper.

00:18:27.942 --> 00:18:30.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
Back in town, there are people
who handle incineration for us.

00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:33.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
But at times like these,
we have to do it ourselves.

00:18:33.815 --> 00:18:36.383 position:13% line:83% align:start
We don't want these things
turning into strays, you know.

00:18:36.517 --> 00:18:38.519 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even garbage turns into strays?

00:18:38.653 --> 00:18:41.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yep, and the strays that debris
produces are incredibly strong.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.491 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're different monsters
than they were originally.

00:18:44.626 --> 00:18:47.194 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, trash spawns
different monsters, huh?

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:48.763 position:16% line:89% align:start
Waste disposal is vital.

00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:51.131 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's not a job
to be taken lightly.

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:54.134 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, if I killed a trash stray,

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:56.303 position:33% line:83% align:start
do you think
something might happen?

00:19:00.675 --> 00:19:02.577 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay, let's see what we've got.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.680 position:38% line:83% align:start
It looks
like a giant Frankenstein?

00:19:05.813 --> 00:19:07.214 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll hold it here!

-[EMILY] Roger that!

00:19:12.053 --> 00:19:13.588 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well start with this one.

00:19:14.122 --> 00:19:16.156 position:7% line:89% align:start
Burn it to ashes, fire bullet!

00:19:16.624 --> 00:19:18.793 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's no good.
The flames aren't strong enough!

00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:21.929 position:24% line:83% align:start
If one won't do it,
then, how about this?

00:19:22.063 --> 00:19:23.131 position:41% line:83% align:start

They always make
such a loud sound, huh?

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.178 position:30% line:83% align:start
Fused bullets.
They're gonna be handy for sure.

00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:40.313 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes! They're amazing!

00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:41.549 position:44% line:89% align:start
Now.

00:19:56.998 --> 00:19:58.265 position:24% line:89% align:start
What just happened?

00:19:58.398 --> 00:20:00.735 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did that bullet
loop back around, or...

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:02.402 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Pretty cool.

00:20:02.537 --> 00:20:04.471 position:13% line:83% align:start
The bullet actually chased
the slime.

-Oh, good,

00:20:08.142 --> 00:20:11.512 position:7% line:83% align:start

dangerous weapons already.

So, this is it!

The controversial new dungeon
between Secro and Hetero, Selen!

00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:21.288 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's very lively here.
-Not too surprising.

00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:22.957 position:30% line:83% align:start
With both towns
sending adventurers

00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:24.659 position:19% line:89% align:start
to check the place out.

Emily, you see that?

00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:31.532 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah,
looks like a pile of trash.

00:20:32.066 --> 00:20:33.300 position:21% line:89% align:start
People mean garbage.

00:20:33.433 --> 00:20:35.069 position:21% line:83% align:start
And there are plenty
of people around.

00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:38.606 position:7% line:83% align:start
Is it safe for them to leave it
stacked up like that, though?

00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:41.676 position:13% line:83% align:start
This area's pretty crowded,
so it should be okay.

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:44.645 position:10% line:83% align:start
But it is still kind of scary
to look at.

00:20:46.147 --> 00:20:47.380 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CELESTE]

of gathering up all the trash

Whoa!

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.403 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's already another pile
just as big.

00:21:10.538 --> 00:21:12.173 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's a lot to handle.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.908 position:24% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I don't see
how she can burn enough

00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:16.476 position:16% line:83% align:start
to keep up with this kind
of waste production.

00:21:21.215 --> 00:21:22.382 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look at her.

00:21:22.517 --> 00:21:24.317 position:19% line:83% align:start
She can't keep going on
like this.

00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:27.789 position:13% line:83% align:start
Those bags under her eyes,
and she's so pale.

00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:30.158 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's what people who have
put in over a hundred hours

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.292 position:19% line:83% align:start
of overtime in a month
look like.

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:34.095 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know from experience.

00:21:34.562 --> 00:21:36.898 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Let's help!
-Yes, of course!

00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:45.506 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Are you all right?
-More adventurers?

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.307 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you have any trash,

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.076 position:33% line:83% align:start
bring it here
and I'll see to it.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.745 position:30% line:89% align:start
We'll do that,

00:21:50.878 --> 00:21:52.947 position:16% line:83% align:start
but maybe you should rest
for a while.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.284 position:35% line:83% align:start
Thank you.
I can't at the moment, though.

00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:59.086 position:21% line:83% align:start
I need to burn this
as soon as possible.

00:21:59.253 --> 00:22:01.789 position:41% line:83% align:start
-But...
-I'll be okay.

00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:06.459 position:21% line:89% align:start
Fire Magic, Inferno!

00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:12.900 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:22:14.302 --> 00:22:15.570 position:33% line:89% align:start
I've got you!
