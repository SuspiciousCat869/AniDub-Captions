Your body becomes
corporeal when you attack.

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:33.014 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's your one weakness,

00:03:33.147 --> 00:03:35.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I bet you didn't even
know about it, did ya?

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:38.953 position:16% line:89% align:start
You remember that bullet

00:03:39.087 --> 00:03:40.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
you pulled out of your foot
a minute ago?

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.657 position:7% line:89% align:start
That baby was a homing bullet.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.025 position:27% line:89% align:start
And lucky for me,

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:46.226 position:10% line:83% align:start
it's homing ability kicked in
at the exact moment

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.696 position:30% line:83% align:start
your attacking
foot became corporeal.

00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:50.865 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's so simple, really.

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.333 position:21% line:83% align:start
All I had do is fire
a mega ton of bullets

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:54.969 position:16% line:89% align:start
in your general vicinity.

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.571 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aiming's irrelevant

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.606 position:10% line:83% align:start
since they'll always find you
the moment you attack.

Sadly, I'm all out
of homing bullets,

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:04.846 position:16% line:89% align:start
but it doesn't matter now

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
that I shaved down
your speed and power.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.516 position:7% line:89% align:start

it wasn't actually my intention

00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:46.827 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BUTLER]
Of course!

00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.964 position:16% line:83% align:start
Her maximum level is 99,
and she's currently at level 94.

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:52.333 position:10% line:89% align:start
She'll reach 95 any day now.

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:53.868 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:58.439 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:00.174 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BUTLER]
See? It's as I said.

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:01.308 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Yeah.

00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.247 position:30% line:83% align:start
So even though
her level keeps going up,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.115 position:10% line:89% align:start
her abilities never improve.

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:12.086 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nothing's worse than working as
hard as you can all for nothing.

00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:14.321 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, hold out your hand.

00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:17.558 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmm! You mean like this?

00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:23.230 position:35% line:83% align:start
Huh! Look,
I actually leveled up!

00:09:23.364 --> 00:09:24.765 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:27.068 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] It's true, this ring
turns any experience

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:29.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
gained after maxing out
your level into a crystal.

00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:31.772 position:10% line:83% align:start
I couldn't quite wrap my head
around it,

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:34.341 position:10% line:83% align:start
but this is undeniable proof
that it works!

00:09:34.475 --> 00:09:35.743 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MARGARET]
Oh, my!

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.111 position:27% line:89% align:start
Something wrong?

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:39.680 position:27% line:83% align:start
My ranks went up.
Every last one of them!

00:09:39.814 --> 00:09:41.615 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:43.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoa, what are the odds of that!

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:45.554 position:7% line:83% align:start
This proves all your hard work
is paying off

00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:47.655 position:16% line:89% align:start
and wait, hang on a sec.

00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:50.124 position:7% line:89% align:start
Give me your hand again, okay?

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:51.158 position:38% line:89% align:start
Um, sure.

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:56.797 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've miraculously
leveled up once again!

00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:58.833 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
What?

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.334 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Just as I suspected!

00:10:00.468 --> 00:10:01.836 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you mean by that?

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:03.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] The princess
is a majorly late bloomer.

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:06.140 position:21% line:83% align:start
Her drop rates were E
at level 95,

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:09.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
and D at level 96.
When she reaches level 99,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.678 position:24% line:89% align:start
they'll be A rank.

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:11.745 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm sure of it!

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.180 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:15.616 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ALL] Hail Princess Margaret!
Hear, hear!

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:17.651 position:7% line:89% align:start
What you said before was right.

00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of my hard work
has paid off.

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:21.622 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm so grateful to you
for teaching me

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:23.224 position:19% line:89% align:start
such a valuable lesson.

00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:24.492 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's nothing.

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
Had to test the crystals
out anyway.

00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:30.331 position:7% line:83% align:start
Last time I asked you to accept
my very first ring as a token

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:32.500 position:16% line:89% align:start
of my deep appreciation.

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:33.801 position:38% line:89% align:start
But now.

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:36.070 position:7% line:89% align:start
I offer my heartfelt admiration

00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:39.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
as well as every other
"first" thing. Ever.

00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:43.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, um, right. That's very nice,
but also wholly unnecessary.

00:10:43.344 --> 00:10:45.813 position:10% line:83% align:start
And sorry, but I've gotta go
take care of something.

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:47.381 position:33% line:89% align:start
See ya later!

00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:48.617 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:52.453 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:54.523 position:19% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I went to every
veggie vendor in town

00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:57.091 position:7% line:83% align:start
and bought all the bean sprouts
and carrots I could get.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:11:00.961 position:19% line:83% align:start
I won't rest until all
of our levels are maxed out!

00:11:01.095 --> 00:11:02.396 position:38% line:89% align:start
Question.

00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.198 position:13% line:83% align:start
Does that mean we're going
to turn all of those into strays

00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:06.400 position:33% line:83% align:start
and then try
to defeat them together?

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:09.136 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Nah, I have a way
more efficient method in mind.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
This ring turns leftover
experience points into crystals.

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:15.176 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which I can, in turn,
share with the rest of you!

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:16.410 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, that must be

00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:18.145 position:7% line:83% align:start
what the dungeon master dropped
yesterday.

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:20.948 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a nice thought,
but is it actually possible?

00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:22.249 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sure is.

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:23.884 position:24% line:83% align:start
But Alice here has
already maxed out her level.

00:11:24.018 --> 00:11:26.086 position:21% line:83% align:start
So that just leaves,
you, Emily, and Eve.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.390 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm already maxed out on level,
but not carrots.

00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:31.292 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:33.327 position:33% line:83% align:start
These carrots
were born to be eaten.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.363 position:30% line:83% align:start
Calm down, Eve.
Please just be patient.

00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:38.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then Yota will give you even
tastier carrots

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:39.700 position:16% line:89% align:start
than those little things.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Patience.

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:43.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know I'm good for it.
You can trust me.

00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:45.239 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:48.342 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not fair, but fine.
I can wait.

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:50.945 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right,
then let's get started!

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:53.781 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:56.984 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gunshots]

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:58.385 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Any regular bullets

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.920 position:19% line:83% align:start
they drop automatically
go in my pouch,

00:12:00.054 --> 00:12:01.922 position:38% line:83% align:start
ensuring
I won't run out of ammo.

00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:04.391 position:24% line:89% align:start
Act fast, you two!

00:12:04.526 --> 00:12:06.460 position:24% line:83% align:start
Take turns grabbing
the crystals!

00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:09.664 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:12:09.797 --> 00:12:12.233 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh! I really did
level up from that!

00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:14.368 position:30% line:83% align:start
He already has
this whole crazy process

00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:15.903 position:24% line:89% align:start
down to a fine art.

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:18.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's the perfect example
of a first-class adventurer.

00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:21.275 position:10% line:89% align:start
Look at that. I had no clue.

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
The leader of the party
I joined is super amazing!

00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:27.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
No one in the world
is better than my Yota!

00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:30.184 position:27% line:83% align:start
Roasted carrots.
Toasted carrots.

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:33.287 position:10% line:89% align:start
Baked carrots. Caked carrots.

[EMILY]
Oh, wow!

00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:39.960 position:16% line:89% align:start
My level's maxed out now?

00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:42.763 position:30% line:83% align:start
And my vitality
went up to A rank, too!

00:12:43.297 --> 00:12:44.498 position:41% line:89% align:start
[beeps]

00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:46.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] One of your drop
rates went up a bit as well.

00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.935 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
That's so great!

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:50.204 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now it's your turn to see
how much you've improved.

âª

00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:56.143 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Look, your MP is A-rank now!

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:58.580 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:12:58.713 --> 00:13:00.214 position:41% line:89% align:start
[beeps]

00:13:01.683 --> 00:13:03.284 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:08.523 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're officially kicked
out of Team All-F Drops!

00:13:08.657 --> 00:13:12.159 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I'm so grateful!
-I am, too! Thank you, Yota!

00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:15.296 position:10% line:83% align:start
But still, I can't help being
just a little bit sad.

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:18.198 position:24% line:83% align:start
You worked so hard
but didn't get any experience.

00:13:18.332 --> 00:13:20.034 position:13% line:89% align:start
Must be super frustrating.

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:22.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] You're wrong.
I've gained tons of experience.

00:13:22.704 --> 00:13:25.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not exactly the kind
you can level up with,

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:27.575 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the experience
I've gained here is priceless.

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:29.410 position:10% line:89% align:start
Like the memories we've made.

00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:31.945 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm so lucky to have this ring.

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.380 position:5% line:89% align:start
It lets me take what I've earned

00:13:33.515 --> 00:13:35.215 position:33% line:83% align:start
and share it
with the people I care about.

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:37.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
-What could be better?
-Oh, Yota.

00:13:37.786 --> 00:13:39.019 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Anyhoo!

00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:40.722 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now that
we've all maxed out our levels,

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:42.222 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess that means
the Ryota Family

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:44.825 position:24% line:83% align:start
is ready to move on
to the next challenge!

Yeah!

The next carrot?

They haven't been
together very long,

The little blonde

a magic user.

00:14:21.462 --> 00:14:23.631 position:24% line:83% align:start
She also excels at
intel gathering.

[MALE TOWNSPERSON 4]
Somehow they even tamed

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:26.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
the Killer Rabbit!

00:14:26.768 --> 00:14:28.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I hear the new girl
they just recruited

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:31.972 position:16% line:83% align:start
has the power to command
monsters! How cool!

[MALE TOWNSPERSON 5]
That Ryota Sato guy

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:35.909 position:16% line:83% align:start
really knows how to bring
together top talent.

That's not a name
I'll soon forget!

[ALICE]
If I'm being honest,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.981 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't really
get the point of all this.

00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:43.183 position:5% line:83% align:start
As long as one member of a party
has a license,

00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:44.619 position:13% line:83% align:start
the others don't need one,
right?

00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:46.588 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's true,
but it's better to have one

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
because you never know
when it will come in handy.

00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:51.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
It will mean good things
for our family, too.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:53.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
Us all having them
makes us look stronger.

00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:55.362 position:13% line:89% align:start
And there's always a chance

00:14:55.496 --> 00:14:57.097 position:7% line:83% align:start
we'll need them for some quest
that comes along.

00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:00.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well said. Today we'll be
getting licenses for Emily

00:15:00.267 --> 00:15:03.237 position:19% line:83% align:start
and Celeste to go below
the fifth level of Telulu.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.139 position:33% line:83% align:start
It'll be easy
with your skill levels

00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:07.074 position:21% line:83% align:start
so there's no reason
to be nervous.

00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:09.042 position:16% line:83% align:start
Alice, this will help you
prepare to get

00:15:09.176 --> 00:15:10.545 position:16% line:89% align:start
your own license someday.

And congrats to both Emily
and Celeste

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.602 position:13% line:89% align:start
for getting their licenses.

00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:36.805 position:16% line:83% align:start
I couldn't be prouder of
what our little family has done

00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:38.038 position:21% line:89% align:start
in such a short time.

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:39.440 position:27% line:89% align:start
Agreed for sure!

00:15:39.574 --> 00:15:41.843 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, now what?
What'll we do next, Ryota?

00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:44.779 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll go our separate ways.
Just for a little while.

00:15:44.913 --> 00:15:46.113 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
What?

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:47.414 position:16% line:89% align:start
We'll each be responsible

00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:49.016 position:24% line:83% align:start
for mining our own
hunting ground,

00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:50.552 position:10% line:89% align:start
assigned based on our skills.

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:52.286 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want to learn
where each of us excels,

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:53.755 position:13% line:89% align:start
what makes us the happiest,

00:15:53.888 --> 00:15:55.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
and how much profit
we can rake in on average.

00:15:56.089 --> 00:15:57.659 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, what do you think?

00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.226 position:7% line:89% align:start
That does make a lot of sense!

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:01.195 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's for the good of the family.

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:03.531 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll get potions to up
your drop rates.

00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:06.935 position:16% line:83% align:start
Use as many as you need.
I can easily get us some more.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:07.936 position:35% line:89% align:start
That said.

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:09.436 position:24% line:89% align:start
No working overtime

00:16:09.571 --> 00:16:11.038 position:19% line:83% align:start
even if you didn't earn
as much as you'd like.

00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:12.674 position:30% line:83% align:start
There'll be no
arguments on that one.

00:16:12.807 --> 00:16:15.108 position:7% line:83% align:start
And we'll all do our very best
to get together for lunch

Well, on average,

I hit a new record these
last six days.

Earning the equivalent
of 120,000 pilos per day.

What does
"the equivalent of" mean?

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.604 position:16% line:89% align:start
It means I ate them all.

00:16:42.737 --> 00:16:46.340 position:16% line:83% align:start
120,000 pilos in carrots,
six days in a row?

00:16:46.473 --> 00:16:48.710 position:30% line:83% align:start

a new daily record!

we earned 215,123 pilos.

[ALL gasp]

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:07.027 position:13% line:89% align:start
That means working together

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
we can rake in just about
two million pilos

every single day.

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.499 position:5% line:89% align:start

Anything that fits in the cart
can be sent here.

00:17:37.324 --> 00:17:39.226 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's Orton's latest

That really is a handy feature.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.973 position:7% line:83% align:start

in a dungeon with a full cart.

00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:53.373 position:13% line:89% align:start
We can keep right on mining

00:17:53.508 --> 00:17:55.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
without having to make
a trip to town.

00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:59.079 position:27% line:83% align:start
That sounds nice.
But I have a question.

00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:00.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
What's on your mind?

00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:03.317 position:19% line:83% align:start
How do we get the items
we send here to the trader?

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.185 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Uh.

00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:07.855 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, what I'm saying is.

00:18:07.989 --> 00:18:10.692 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even if we gather everything
at home first,

00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:13.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
we'd still have to make multiple
trips between here and there

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:14.762 position:38% line:83% align:start
to trade
all our drops for the day.

00:18:14.896 --> 00:18:17.197 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just one day's worth of doing
your own trips here

00:18:17.331 --> 00:18:19.399 position:7% line:89% align:start
is already something to behold.

00:18:19.534 --> 00:18:21.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
And your daily record's
unbelievable,

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:23.705 position:24% line:83% align:start
sixteen visits here
in a single day!

00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:25.540 position:33% line:83% align:start

you kept track of that.

00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:32.847 position:30% line:89% align:start
Probably, yeah.

00:18:32.981 --> 00:18:34.782 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, more importantly.

00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:36.517 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please tell me
we can still count on you

00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:39.353 position:13% line:83% align:start
to keep doing business here

when you've done so much for me?

00:18:42.523 --> 00:18:44.058 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why I'm hoping
for your help

I'm looking
forward to helping you out.

00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:00.575 position:24% line:83% align:start
So you'll be doing
your calculations here

00:19:00.708 --> 00:19:02.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
and then making the arrangements
for collection?

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.112 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's wonderful.

00:19:04.244 --> 00:19:05.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
And you'll be here with us
every day,

except for on holidays!

you're officially a member

What a world.

00:19:19.994 --> 00:19:22.429 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm so grateful that I ended up
as a drop here

00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:24.331 position:10% line:89% align:start
and left my old life behind.

to be a welcome party for Erza.

00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:30.972 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can understand
why Eyna's here for that.

00:19:31.105 --> 00:19:33.641 position:10% line:89% align:start
But what are you doing here?

00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:36.110 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've been dying
to visit your house.

00:19:36.243 --> 00:19:38.012 position:10% line:89% align:start
I couldn't resist the chance.

00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:40.715 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can't just show up
somewhere you weren't invited!

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:42.950 position:27% line:83% align:start
You even brought
your whole crew with you!

00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:44.919 position:19% line:89% align:start
Aww. We're not welcome?

00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:46.420 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please, Yota?

00:19:46.554 --> 00:19:48.255 position:19% line:83% align:start
Having more guests here
will only make the party

00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:49.757 position:24% line:89% align:start
that much more fun!

00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:50.992 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's that.

00:19:51.125 --> 00:19:53.027 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your partner has
made her wishes crystal clear.

00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:54.461 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's out of your hands!

00:19:54.595 --> 00:19:57.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whatever. Just do what you want.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.900 position:27% line:83% align:start

-Huh?

00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.300 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[door opens]
-Hello?

00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:01.936 position:27% line:89% align:start
Um, hello there.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
I still haven't thanked
you for your help earlier.

00:20:05.139 --> 00:20:06.708 position:41% line:89% align:start
So, um.

00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:09.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're just some simple flowers
but I hope you'll accept them.

00:20:09.677 --> 00:20:11.946 position:24% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Oh, thanks.
Would you like to come in?

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.682 position:24% line:83% align:start
We would be honored
to join you, Mr. Sato!

00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:16.918 position:30% line:83% align:start
We have an idea
for the princess' next product,

00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:19.453 position:13% line:83% align:start
but we'd like your opinion
on the matter!

00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:21.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's please hold off
on business talk.

00:20:22.557 --> 00:20:23.858 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
Each new guest.

00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:26.293 position:27% line:83% align:start
Makes a party way
more fun than it was before!

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:28.295 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MARGARET]
Thank you for having us.

00:20:29.197 --> 00:20:31.398 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey! Looks like quite a shindig.

00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:32.767 position:41% line:83% align:start
[OLGA]
Daddy!

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.603 position:30% line:83% align:start
You can't go in
without their permission!

00:20:37.138 --> 00:20:38.639 position:16% line:89% align:start
Won't you please join us?

00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:40.340 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure we'll have
a much better time with you

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:42.442 position:19% line:89% align:start
and your daddy around.

00:20:42.577 --> 00:20:46.114 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sorry to intrude. I'm dropping
off a thank-you gift.

00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:47.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
For what?

00:20:47.815 --> 00:20:49.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
I hear you're the one
who defeated the dungeon master.

00:20:49.984 --> 00:20:51.384 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is your reward.

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:53.487 position:7% line:89% align:start
A year's supply of sugar cubes!

00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:55.923 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I won't hear a word
about how it's too generous!

00:20:56.057 --> 00:20:58.025 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's not what
I was going to say.

00:21:00.628 --> 00:21:02.196 position:44% line:83% align:start
[EVE]
Hey, Low Level!

00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:03.598 position:10% line:89% align:start
There aren't enough carrots.

00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:06.500 position:16% line:89% align:start
Um, Ryota. What happened?

00:21:06.634 --> 00:21:08.368 position:16% line:83% align:start
The ratio of men to women
in this place

00:21:08.503 --> 00:21:10.303 position:19% line:89% align:start
is way out of balance!

00:21:10.772 --> 00:21:13.775 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, good news!
It's about Bonesy and Jiggly.

00:21:13.908 --> 00:21:16.744 position:10% line:83% align:start
They told me they're excited
to make friends with Olga!

00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:18.146 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:20.948 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's great that everyone's
having such a lovely time!

00:21:21.082 --> 00:21:22.282 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a party!

00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:23.885 position:30% line:83% align:start
We're so lucky
to have this many friends

00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:24.919 position:21% line:89% align:start
to celebrate with us!

00:21:25.052 --> 00:21:27.755 position:50% line:89% align:start

00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:29.924 position:10% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] When I first arrived
in this world.

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:32.093 position:33% line:83% align:start
I was gifted
with a unique skill.

00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:36.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since then, my life has
been full of good fortune.

00:21:36.664 --> 00:21:38.298 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wonder what the old me

00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:40.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
would think
if he could see me now.

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:42.970 position:21% line:89% align:start
Though the truth is.

00:21:43.104 --> 00:21:46.541 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:21:46.674 --> 00:21:49.911 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's not the skill
that's made me so happy.

00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:51.344 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:54.414 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:56.951 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:21:58.252 --> 00:21:59.720 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:22:01.088 --> 00:22:04.058 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's looking like we're going
to need a lot more food.

00:22:04.192 --> 00:22:06.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
Guess I'll run out
to the dungeon and stock up.

00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:09.730 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Okay! We'll go with you!
