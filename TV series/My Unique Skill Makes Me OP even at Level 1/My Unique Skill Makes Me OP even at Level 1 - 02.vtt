Before I was reincarnated,

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:14.816 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was a miserable salaryman
at a toxic company.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.752 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now I'm in a crazy world
where everything's an item-drop

00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:19.486 position:30% line:89% align:start
from monsters.

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.823 position:27% line:83% align:start
In this new life,
I'm stuck at level one,

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:23.525 position:27% line:89% align:start
but lucky for me,

00:00:23.658 --> 00:00:27.060 position:10% line:83% align:start
my unique skill has maxed out
all my drop stats to rank S.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was also lucky enough to meet,
a ginormous gorilla monster?

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.637 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ooh, I wonder what rare goody
I'll get for defeating

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.237 position:33% line:89% align:start
this bad boy!

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:39.641 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:42.476 position:13% line:89% align:start
The bunny girl from before.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.947 position:10% line:89% align:start
I hate your kind. Low Levels.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.584 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right, but, did you have to come
to my house to tell me that?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have something else to say?

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:55.289 position:27% line:89% align:start

Well, that's what
I'd like to know myself.

Your low-level noggin survived

That's... I mean.

my HP is maxed out.

Those belong to us, you know.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.637 position:27% line:83% align:start

with us if you like.

âª

00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:10.518 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then we slice them up into thin,
uniform shapes

00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:12.587 position:5% line:89% align:start
so they cook quickly and evenly.

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.355 position:13% line:89% align:start
Boil them just long enough

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.658 position:19% line:83% align:start
so that they're cooked,
yet crunchy.

00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:22.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
The carrot skin and leaves
make for a nice, savory sauce.

00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:26.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
All that's left is to combine
everything on a plate

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:29.203 position:21% line:83% align:start
to create a tri-color
carrot delicacy.

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:32.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
It pairs beautifully with carrot
and bean-sprout soup.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.242 position:16% line:89% align:start
And that's how it's done!

I'm not gonna argue
with you on that.

you for thinking so.

is totally god-tier!

Before I came to live here,

was incredibly special.

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:46.581 position:16% line:89% align:start

Carrots. That's it.

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.836 position:7% line:83% align:start
That seed ranked up my strength
from F to D,

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:24.171 position:35% line:83% align:start
and slimes
got a lot easier to kill.

00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:26.841 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm basically
the God of carrots.

00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:35.316 position:33% line:89% align:start
There she is.

-[MAN 2] He's insane.

00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:39.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
No one in their right mind

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.188 position:33% line:83% align:start
just walks up
to the Killer Rabbit!

00:08:41.322 --> 00:08:42.523 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here. For you.

[all gasp]

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:46.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
That fool has no idea

00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:48.896 position:38% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.831 position:19% line:89% align:start
I love carrots so much!

00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:52.133 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
What, no way!

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:53.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
How did that jokester
find carrots

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:55.369 position:21% line:83% align:start
that are good enough
for the scary bunny?

[chomping]

00:08:57.371 --> 00:08:59.206 position:30% line:89% align:start
Such pure joy.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.209 position:10% line:89% align:start
You've got some issues, lady.

00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:04.045 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ERZA]
Hey! Ryota!

00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:06.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you friends with
the bunny girl or something?

00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:08.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Well, I've met her.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.119 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't think "friends"
is the right word, though.

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:14.188 position:16% line:89% align:start
Eat as much as you want!

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:17.526 position:16% line:83% align:start
I gave her some carrots,
and now she's obsessed with me.

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:20.261 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all scream]

00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:22.463 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hand 'em over!

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:23.731 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'll buy up
the whole bunch from you

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:25.633 position:7% line:89% align:start
for double their retail value!

00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:27.735 position:19% line:89% align:start
Double? Sure, but why?

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:31.138 position:19% line:83% align:start
How could you not know?
That woman there.

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:34.141 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's the one and only
Eve Callusleader.

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:36.877 position:13% line:83% align:start
An adventurer who's known
for her natural bunny ears

00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:38.946 position:16% line:89% align:start
and overall bunny motif.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.048 position:13% line:83% align:start
They say her special move,
Excalibur,

00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:44.085 position:38% line:83% align:start
is deadly
and can cut a boulder in half!

âª

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:47.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's also a famous
carrot connoisseur,

00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:50.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
and among the dungeons
in the vicinity of Secro,

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:53.594 position:19% line:83% align:start
there are carrot levels
that only she has ever attained!

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:58.132 position:30% line:83% align:start
Her catchphrase
is "Death or Carrots".

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:00.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's rumored that people
have actually been killed

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:03.938 position:7% line:83% align:start
because they dared to give her
less-than-ideal carrots!

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:06.240 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's what we call
too much information.

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:08.776 position:19% line:83% align:start
Any carrots that earn
Eve's seal of approval

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:12.046 position:5% line:83% align:start
are sure to sell for the highest
possible price!

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:13.881 position:41% line:83% align:start
We here
at the Swallow's Gratitude

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:17.151 position:16% line:83% align:start
would do anything to get
our hands on such fine stock!

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:20.254 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll give you 15,000 pilos
per carrot!

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:22.957 position:16% line:89% align:start
/15,000 multiplied by 30,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.094 position:27% line:83% align:start
/that's 450,000
pilos per month!

00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:28.996 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've got to thank her!

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.930 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:32.166 position:16% line:89% align:start
Carrots before gratitude.

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:33.767 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.803 position:24% line:89% align:start
Gimme more carrots.

00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:37.204 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's all I've got for today.

00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:39.406 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll give you some more
tomorrow, okay?

00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:41.909 position:13% line:89% align:start
No! I hate you, Low Level!

00:10:42.577 --> 00:10:43.978 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Enough.

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:46.313 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all exclaim]

00:10:46.447 --> 00:10:48.315 position:19% line:89% align:start
My name is Ryota Sato,

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:50.552 position:5% line:83% align:start
and it's rude to keep calling me
"Low Level".

00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:52.153 position:33% line:89% align:start
But carrots!

00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:53.555 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:56.157 position:13% line:83% align:start
I promised Emily I'd stop
working by a certain time.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.326 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll bring you more carrots
tomorrow, trust me.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.762 position:19% line:89% align:start
Death or carrots, baby.

00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:05.399 position:16% line:89% align:start
Gotcha, death or carrots.

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:07.569 position:35% line:89% align:start
Fine, then.

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:09.303 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll see you tomorrow.
Goodnight!

I'll be back with even more.

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:19.694 position:30% line:83% align:start

[ERZA] Ooh, another haul

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:10.605 position:16% line:83% align:start
To be honest, we got way
more drops than that.

00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:12.774 position:19% line:83% align:start
This was just the most

Are you saying that you don't

My own magic what?

00:16:18.312 --> 00:16:19.714 position:24% line:89% align:start
Like one of those.

âª

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:26.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
A magic cart allows you
to carry more items,

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:29.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
which maximizes both

Whoa. All right, sign me up!

[EMILY] Are we going to buy
a magic cart?

00:16:34.562 --> 00:16:38.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yep. I'm liking the sound
of max profits.

00:16:43.771 --> 00:16:45.005 position:21% line:89% align:start
I see loads of carts,

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:47.040 position:30% line:83% align:start

What's this? Ah, welcome.

00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:13.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're here to purchase
one of your magic carts, sir.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.168 position:35% line:83% align:start
Well then,
I've got just the thing

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:17.304 position:27% line:83% align:start
for an adventurer
such as yourself.

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.806 position:19% line:89% align:start
I recommend this model.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
It comes equipped
with a monster-detection system.

00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:24.044 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, that's right up our alley!

00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:25.379 position:16% line:89% align:start
It sounds really useful!

00:17:25.513 --> 00:17:26.246 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.649 position:24% line:89% align:start
I modded it myself

00:17:27.782 --> 00:17:29.717 position:27% line:83% align:start
and can guarantee
it works like a dream.

00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:33.086 position:13% line:83% align:start
I see, she was serious when
she said that you were modding.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.288 position:5% line:89% align:start
So how much does this one cost?

00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:36.390 position:13% line:89% align:start
It'll be ten million pilos.

00:17:36.524 --> 00:17:38.325 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Ten million?

00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:40.093 position:21% line:89% align:start
If money's a factor,

00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
then I have regular ones
for two or three million.

00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:44.866 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's still
very, very expensive.

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:46.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
Cheaper also means less fun.

00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:49.269 position:21% line:83% align:start

Don't worry.

00:20:00.568 --> 00:20:03.037 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm not going to let that thing
destroy our town!

I'm coming.

The rest of you,
keep it where it is!

Hold up!

00:20:19.252 --> 00:20:21.288 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who do you think you are
dishing out orders like that?

00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:22.724 position:38% line:89% align:start
Reckless.

00:20:22.857 --> 00:20:24.992 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't blame me for your demise,
Low Level!

00:20:25.126 --> 00:20:26.828 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've got this, leave it to me!

Take that!

Nice one. Thank you!

Never underestimate

You did it, Yoda!

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:18.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
Gotta be the cheekiest
low level ever.

Incredible!

You saved the whole town,
my good man!

-Thanks, mister!
-[MAN 9] We owe you everything!

You're our hero! You protected

This feeling.

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.497 position:24% line:83% align:start
Before I came here,
I never made anyone happy.

00:21:37.632 --> 00:21:39.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
Never made a difference
like this.

00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:42.069 position:24% line:83% align:start
But that's changed.
Not just that.

Somehow I've changed, too.

-You hear something, Yoda?
-[RYOTA] Emily.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.380 position:13% line:83% align:start
Didn't you mention earlier
that strays never drop items?

00:21:53.514 --> 00:21:54.916 position:21% line:89% align:start
Right, they never do.

00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:56.984 position:41% line:83% align:start

That sound is unmistakable.

And I am the only one
who gets drops in Nihonium.

There's a chance it'll be
the same with the gorilla.
