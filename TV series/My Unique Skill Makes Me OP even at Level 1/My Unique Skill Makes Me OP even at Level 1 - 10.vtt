Before I was reincarnated,

00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:14.314 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was a miserable salaryman
at a toxic company.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:15.817 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now I'm in a crazy world

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.218 position:7% line:83% align:start
where everything's an item drop
from monsters.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.454 position:27% line:83% align:start
In this new life,
I'm stuck at level one.

00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:23.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
But lucky for me,
my unique skill has maxed out

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.560 position:10% line:89% align:start
all my drop stats to rank S.

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:27.929 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, today is moving day again!

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.097 position:10% line:89% align:start
And yes, that is a metal me!

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.431 position:27% line:89% align:start
Because why not?

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hold on. Is that another girl?

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.269 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not that I'm against
making new friends.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.772 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just never know what's
gonna happen out here!

Hi there, Yota!

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:23.711 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good morning!

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:25.245 position:33% line:89% align:start

Um. [gasps]

Celeste? What happened?

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:30.718 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:33.220 position:38% line:83% align:start
She said
that her head was hurting.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:34.354 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:35.757 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you think you caught a cold?

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.025 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.492 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's from the magic storm.

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.360 position:5% line:89% align:start
I remember learning about those.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:41.896 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's the natural phenomenon

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.965 position:21% line:83% align:start
that prevents people
from using magic, isn't it?

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.034 position:33% line:83% align:start
I always get
these throbbing headaches

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.037 position:19% line:83% align:start
and my head feels like
it's filled with metal boulders.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.672 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aw, man, I didn't realize

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.173 position:13% line:83% align:start
the storms had those kinds
of side effects, too.

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.943 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll be fine as long
as I don't let it keep me down.

00:02:56.077 --> 00:02:58.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
After the storm passes,
I'll feel much better.

00:02:58.546 --> 00:02:59.881 position:30% line:89% align:start
I have an idea!

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:01.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
Instead of going back
to the dungeon today,

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
why don't we go look
at bigger houses?

00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:05.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] Hopefully,
we can find one big enough

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:08.221 position:16% line:83% align:start
that she won't feel sick
during magic storms.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:12.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe there are even houses that
are built to counteract them.

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:15.495 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, I hope you folks like it.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.864 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure
this is the only one

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:20.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have that meets
all of your requirements.

My headache!

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.405 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's cleared up!

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.741 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's great news!

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.910 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes! I didn't realize
there were houses

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:30.243 position:13% line:89% align:start
that could help with that!

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then you're going to love
this property

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:32.914 position:24% line:89% align:start
since it was built

00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:34.782 position:21% line:83% align:start
using the very latest
magic storm-blocking

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:35.950 position:21% line:89% align:start
construction methods.

00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:37.952 position:13% line:83% align:start
I imagine that should feel
quite reassuring

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:39.219 position:24% line:89% align:start
for any magic user.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.360 position:35% line:89% align:start
I love it!

the monthly payments

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.964 position:33% line:89% align:start
looking like?

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:51.298 position:13% line:89% align:start
Given the modern technology

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.900 position:38% line:83% align:start
that went
into this home's construction,

00:03:53.034 --> 00:03:56.170 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's listed for higher
than the usual market price.

00:12:20.508 --> 00:12:23.410 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's tough! And fast!
And super strong!

00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:24.979 position:21% line:89% align:start
My best guess is that

00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:27.848 position:10% line:83% align:start
it takes on 80% of the specs
of whatever it copies.

00:12:28.282 --> 00:12:30.351 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not a monster suited
for big gatherings.

It's the same fruit as before.

00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:43.097 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, it's actually different.

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:46.433 position:16% line:89% align:start
I see. Could this mean...

00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:49.870 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Here, let's test it out.
[chomps]

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:53.307 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, hold on.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.875 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you mean
you've learned magic?

00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.844 position:7% line:89% align:start
You really learned two spells?

00:12:56.977 --> 00:12:59.380 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah. One is called Wind Cutter.

00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:02.082 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CELESTE] It's a level-one
wind elemental spell.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.884 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's amazing!

00:13:04.018 --> 00:13:06.186 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm dying to know
what the other spell does now!

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm actually curious
about it, too!

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:10.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay, but it's kind of weird.

00:13:11.025 --> 00:13:12.694 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll give it a try
on those guys.

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:15.262 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, do what we always do.

00:13:15.396 --> 00:13:16.297 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.197 position:33% line:89% align:start
Easy enough!

I feel like I'm Yota now!

00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:40.522 position:38% line:83% align:start
You mean,
what that spell does is...

00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:42.923 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yep, although I have to use it
on a monster

00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:44.592 position:19% line:89% align:start
before I even attack it

00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:47.928 position:10% line:83% align:start
and then my drop rates apply
to whomever actually defeats it.

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:50.632 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, then it makes
someone else rank S?

00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:52.933 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but it's not that useful.

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:54.201 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's just for monsters,

00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:55.603 position:13% line:83% align:start
so there's really not much
it can do

00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:57.404 position:13% line:83% align:start
other than help with drops
if I'm around.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:13:58.939 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
I think it's useful!

00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:00.742 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Uh?
-[EMILY] In fact, I'm grateful!

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.376 position:7% line:89% align:start
Um, what are you grateful for?

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because I never would've
leveled up

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:06.581 position:10% line:89% align:start
after that battle without it!

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:07.881 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's true!

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:09.183 position:16% line:89% align:start
When he uses that spell,

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:10.585 position:38% line:83% align:start
it means
that someone else on his team

00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:12.152 position:13% line:89% align:start
can finish off the monster!

00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:14.321 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're helping
your whole team level up, Yota.

00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:15.989 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't know
what could be better

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:18.225 position:33% line:83% align:start
than a spell
that helps my friends!

00:14:18.727 --> 00:14:20.994 position:7% line:83% align:start
We can all share the experience
from now on.

00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:23.598 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll level up together.
As a party!

00:14:23.732 --> 00:14:25.966 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Absolutely!
-Great!

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.205 position:19% line:83% align:start

I might head to Nihonium today.

-Oh, Hi, Ryota.

You're carrying a lot there.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.447 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you. Seriously.

00:14:40.582 --> 00:14:42.950 position:27% line:83% align:start
I bought too much
and made things hard.

00:14:46.755 --> 00:14:48.889 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ERZA] Thanks again.
I appreciate the help!

00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:50.391 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, I better get going.

00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:52.326 position:41% line:83% align:start

You'll actually let me join?

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:53.460 position:44% line:89% align:start

00:14:53.595 --> 00:14:54.495 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

It wasn't supposed

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:03.337 position:27% line:89% align:start
to be like this.

You're really going to let me
join your group?

Yes,
you have a lot of potential,

00:15:11.412 --> 00:15:13.815 position:10% line:83% align:start
and potential can only shine
in a dungeon!

Oh, well, yeah. Poor girl.

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:19.219 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's been asking around

00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:21.121 position:16% line:83% align:start
for adventurer companions
lately,

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:23.223 position:5% line:89% align:start
but her max level is only a two.

00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:25.459 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why everyone's been
turning her down.

00:15:25.593 --> 00:15:26.561 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:15:26.694 --> 00:15:28.061 position:19% line:83% align:start

in the dungeons.

[RYOTA]
Not a good idea.

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:30.931 position:21% line:89% align:start
And what do you want?

00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:33.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to take this girl
for my party.

Who, me? Are you sure?

Yes.

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:23.651 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, what's your name?

00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:24.953 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm Alice.

I can't think of any other word
to describe this than hopeless.

00:16:47.642 --> 00:16:50.143 position:30% line:83% align:start
But considering
my own past experiences,

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:52.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
she should be able to fight
in this dungeon.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.047 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:55.415 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nothing.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.317 position:27% line:83% align:start
You should start
with some leveling up.

00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:58.686 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are you ready to go in?

Ah! [chuckles]

What's funny?

It is?

00:17:06.928 --> 00:17:08.295 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah! Guess why?

00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:10.297 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've been told
I was born in a dungeon!
