[RYOTA]
Before I was reincarnated,

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.217 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was a miserable salary man
at a toxic company.

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:18.686 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now I'm in a crazy world

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.421 position:7% line:83% align:start
where everything's an item drop
from monsters.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.791 position:27% line:83% align:start
In this new life,
I'm stuck at level 1,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.492 position:27% line:89% align:start
but lucky for me,

00:00:25.627 --> 00:00:29.196 position:10% line:83% align:start
my unique skill has maxed out
all my drop stats to rank S.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.032 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wait, why isn't anyone allowed
in this dungeon?

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:35.235 position:27% line:83% align:start
"Dungeon master?"
What does that even mean?

Great job today, friends!

00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:20.407 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-Ah!

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
[EMILY] There's a whole lot more
where that came from!

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.611 position:16% line:89% align:start
One sec. I'll go get it!

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:24.646 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.049 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's been going hard ever
since I've had less work.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.584 position:13% line:89% align:start
I hope it's only temporary.

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:32.754 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's celebrating how well
you've done and so am I.

00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:34.287 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, hold off on that.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.223 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, it's not like
they've officially decided

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
that Selen belongs to Secro yet.

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:40.828 position:24% line:83% align:start
Once that happens,
it'll truly be over.

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:44.197 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then we can go back to Secro
with nothing to worry about.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.702 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope they decide sooner
rather than later.

00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:51.939 position:16% line:89% align:start
Look! I made you a cake!

00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:53.875 position:7% line:89% align:start
What? How did you manage that?

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:55.743 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
I baked it over the campfire.

00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:58.378 position:16% line:83% align:start
You mean the one outside?
Must've been a challenge.

00:02:58.513 --> 00:03:01.348 position:33% line:83% align:start
Uh, Celeste.
Don't overthink it, trust me.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.684 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Yes, but.

00:03:02.817 --> 00:03:04.519 position:41% line:83% align:start
[EMILY]
And there's ice cream, too!

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:07.187 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] Hey, wait a minute!
How do you have ice cream?

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.931 position:27% line:89% align:start
Try not to move.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:54.301 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is a healing bullet.

Think so. [gasps]

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:05.079 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh. Well, you're awake.
That's a good sign.

00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:06.246 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.749 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no! This can't be happening!

00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:09.416 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why is my heart pounding
so fast?

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
And my face feels like
it's burning up!

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:13.621 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh. Look, I didn't mean to.

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.791 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you doing that for?

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:20.928 position:7% line:83% align:start
Can you take a breath, please?
Celeste!

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:23.430 position:19% line:89% align:start
I feel much calmer now!

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:24.799 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Okay. Do you?

00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:27.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, absolutely!
What were you saying?

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:28.870 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry
for the distraction,

00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:31.005 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you were about
to ask me something, right?

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.405 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Uh, yeah.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.676 position:7% line:83% align:start
Almost forgot, about that trash
you just burned.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.178 position:24% line:83% align:start
There wasn't really
that much of it,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.613 position:27% line:89% align:start
so I'm wondering

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:40.848 position:24% line:83% align:start
if it was necessary
to use such a huge spell

00:04:40.982 --> 00:04:42.315 position:19% line:89% align:start
on something so small?

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
Eh, maybe not. But it's
the only one I know how to use.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.754 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:46.888 --> 00:04:48.923 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CELESTE] It's the level three
fire spell, Inferno.

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:52.359 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can cast it well,
but nothing else, unfortunately.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.961 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Wait, for real?

00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:56.931 position:7% line:83% align:start
What about levels one and two?
Don't you know those?

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm afraid I don't.

00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:01.569 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:03.237 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MAN ADVENTURER 1]
Excuse us!

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.238 position:35% line:89% align:start

Let me help you.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.290 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've got a lot more time now
that my work's all done.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.258 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a lot to handle alone.

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:26.727 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, I appreciate it.

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:34.068 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:05:34.202 --> 00:05:36.237 position:10% line:83% align:start
We keep burning and burning,
but it's never enough!

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:37.905 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not always this way, right?

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, today is a little
different.

00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:42.777 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's often more garbage
when a dungeon master appears.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.147 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but you lost me there.
What's a Dungeon Master?

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.149 position:27% line:83% align:start
They only show up
every few months,

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:49.851 position:7% line:89% align:start
but it's the boss of a dungeon.

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:52.086 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes, and they're very strong
and dangerous.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.354 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everyone is advised
to avoid the dungeons

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.723 position:21% line:89% align:start
for their own safety,

00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:57.357 position:30% line:83% align:start
so they've been
stress-eating instead.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.492 position:5% line:89% align:start
And that has led to all of this?

00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:00.862 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:02.864 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey. It's gonna be okay,
Celeste!

00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:05.933 position:10% line:83% align:start
They'll have a team together
to get rid of it in no time!

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:07.201 position:35% line:89% align:start
You'll see!

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:08.870 position:16% line:83% align:start
I bet things will be back
to normal by tomorrow!

00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:11.505 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, of course.
I'm sure you're right.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.040 position:30% line:89% align:start
I have an idea.

00:06:13.174 --> 00:06:15.009 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why don't you take the rest
of the day off to relax?

00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:17.178 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I can handle what's left.
-Huh.

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:19.947 position:35% line:83% align:start
I couldn't!
This is what I'm expected to.

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:23.618 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you keep going like this,
you're gonna pass out again.

00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:25.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're pushing yourself
too hard.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.722 position:19% line:83% align:start
Without your strength,
you can't help anyone.

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:29.023 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:33.261 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] I'll take it from here.
You got this, Emily?

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.930 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know it! Right this way!

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:38.799 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wait. Are you sure we are okay?

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.572 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right, let's get started!

âª

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:51.646 position:16% line:83% align:start
-All of that in one day?
-Afraid so.

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:53.614 position:5% line:89% align:start
But there's some good news, too!

00:06:53.748 --> 00:06:55.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
The team to remove
the dungeon master

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.784 position:16% line:89% align:start
should be assembled now.

00:06:56.918 --> 00:06:59.186 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll go and check
where things stand, then.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hopefully, you'll feel
a little better knowing that

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:02.924 position:5% line:89% align:start
there's an end to this in sight!

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:04.457 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes. I do.

00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:06.426 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay. I'll come and report back.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time we talk,
I wanna hear about

00:07:08.296 --> 00:07:09.964 position:10% line:89% align:start
all the sweet dreams you had!

00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:11.999 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:12.833 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get what?

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:14.368 position:13% line:89% align:start
We barely know each other,

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:17.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
so why is Ryota being
so kind to me?

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:21.409 position:5% line:83% align:start
Huh. 'Cause that's just the type
of person he is.

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:22.877 position:5% line:89% align:start
If he knows somebody needs help,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.812 position:19% line:83% align:start
he's not gonna be able
to ignore them.

00:07:24.946 --> 00:07:26.614 position:7% line:89% align:start
It was like that in Secro, too.

00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:28.349 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where you two are from.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.752 position:24% line:83% align:start
Once that happens,
it'll truly be over.

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:35.089 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then we can go back to Secro
with nothing to worry about.

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:38.125 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:42.630 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh.

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:45.366 position:13% line:89% align:start
Neptune? Why are you here?

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:46.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.170 position:16% line:83% align:start
In case you haven't heard
the latest news,

00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:50.738 position:7% line:89% align:start
the dungeon master's appeared.

00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.040 position:27% line:83% align:start
We've asked them
to come help us defeat it.

00:07:53.174 --> 00:07:56.110 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA] What a coincidence!
That's why I stopped by.

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:59.113 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm really hoping you can get
rid of it as soon as possible.

00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:01.449 position:13% line:83% align:start
It would help out a friend
of mine a lot.

00:08:01.582 --> 00:08:03.818 position:38% line:83% align:start
Trust me,
I wish I could do it all myself.

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.720 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Okay, why can't you?

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:08.589 position:7% line:83% align:start
Things are a bit stickier here
than expected.

00:08:08.723 --> 00:08:10.124 position:33% line:89% align:start
Meaning what?

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.293 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's our agreement with Hetero.

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:14.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
It states that if a dungeon
master appears,

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:18.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
then the two towns must assemble
a joint force to defeat it.

00:08:18.733 --> 00:08:20.735 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've arranged to send
in the Neptune Group

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:23.437 position:30% line:83% align:start
from our side,
but they are stalling.

00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:25.373 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hetero hasn't taken
any action yet.

00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:28.275 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're saying they're not even
gonna try? Why not?

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:30.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LIL] Because that just
works out better for them.

00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:33.848 position:13% line:83% align:start
If a dungeon master sticks
around for a long time,

00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
the ecology of its dungeon
can change eventually.

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.452 position:21% line:89% align:start
And if that happens,

00:08:38.619 --> 00:08:42.223 position:7% line:83% align:start
then the items that drop will,
too, which may help them.

00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:43.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
That sounds bad.

00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:44.925 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:46.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
The dungeon was practically
in Secro's hands,

00:08:46.794 --> 00:08:48.529 position:19% line:83% align:start
but this could send us
back to square one.

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:51.098 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know that's what they're
hoping will happen, anyway.

00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:53.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just hope we're not too late
to defend our claim.

00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:55.770 position:27% line:83% align:start
Forget about this
joint force thing.

00:08:55.903 --> 00:08:57.938 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna go in
after the thing myself.

00:08:58.072 --> 00:08:59.440 position:7% line:89% align:start
If I'm not asking for any help,

00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:00.975 position:21% line:83% align:start
then it shouldn't be
a problem, right?

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:04.145 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mm-mm. I'm sorry.
I can't allow that, either.

00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:05.546 position:33% line:89% align:start
And why not?

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.249 position:10% line:83% align:start
You all have your own rules,
apparently.

00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:09.717 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
What?

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
[RAN] You can't enter
with a group of fewer

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:12.586 position:19% line:89% align:start
than three adventurers

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.123 position:16% line:83% align:start
and everyone has to have
stats ranked A or higher.

00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:17.892 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Why is that the rule?

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.794 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because the dungeon master
is a sick,

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:21.429 position:13% line:89% align:start
dangerous force of nature!

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:23.364 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all sigh]

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:24.965 position:41% line:83% align:start
[DUKE]
I apologize.

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:27.468 position:33% line:89% align:start
Then Neptune,

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:28.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
-why don't you and I.
-I cannot.

00:09:29.103 --> 00:09:30.638 position:10% line:89% align:start
We already signed a contract

00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:32.273 position:33% line:83% align:start
to be a part
of Secro's joint force,

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:36.243 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I can't act on my own,
I promise I would if I could.

You can't be the only option.

00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:44.952 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sure someone around here
will help me.

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:47.788 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just don't expect it to be easy.

00:09:48.122 --> 00:09:49.590 position:44% line:89% align:start

[NEPTUNE]
All the adventurers here

00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:53.928 position:24% line:83% align:start

to profit off drops

while they're tax-exempt.

You think they're going
to be ambitious enough

00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.700 position:10% line:89% align:start

the two of us can't go

all the other monsters

Thank you for working so hard
to help us, Celeste!

00:19:32.707 --> 00:19:36.209 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sobs]

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:37.477 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CELESTE]
Thank you.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.049 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.950 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:19:44.686 --> 00:19:47.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
[DUKE] You're telling me
you defeated the dungeon master?

00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:50.323 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Is that weird?

00:19:50.457 --> 00:19:52.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, it's certainly
given me quite the shock!

00:19:52.994 --> 00:19:55.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
We, we have to inform
the adventurers right away.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.800 position:19% line:83% align:start
If the dungeon ecology
has changed, we must know!

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:00.902 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thank you. See you soon!

00:20:02.804 --> 00:20:06.306 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm impressed! It was really
just the three of you?

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.442 position:33% line:83% align:start
To find such
wonderful companions.

00:20:08.576 --> 00:20:11.045 position:27% line:83% align:start
-You're so lucky.
-Companions.

00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:13.981 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just can't get over
how amazingly you handled

00:20:14.115 --> 00:20:15.248 position:7% line:89% align:start
everything back there, Celeste!

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.751 position:10% line:89% align:start
I could say the same for you!

00:20:16.884 --> 00:20:20.988 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah. By the way,
where'd Neptune go?

00:20:21.122 --> 00:20:22.489 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both chuckle]

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.258 position:21% line:83% align:start
[NEPTUNE] Looks like
I missed out on my chance

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:26.828 position:24% line:89% align:start
to fight with Sato.

00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:29.597 position:13% line:83% align:start
And it's all because of you
and your stupid bullying.

00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:33.333 position:27% line:89% align:start
So then, tell me.

00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:35.469 position:13% line:83% align:start
What are you planning to do
about it?

00:20:36.137 --> 00:20:38.606 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Harvard screams]

00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:48.950 position:35% line:89% align:start
[crackling]

00:20:51.052 --> 00:20:52.319 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Celeste.

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:55.923 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, hello! These are amazing!

00:20:56.057 --> 00:20:59.292 position:5% line:83% align:start
I never thought I'd learn to use
level one magic in my life!

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.095 position:16% line:83% align:start
This has all been a dream
come true!

00:21:01.229 --> 00:21:04.031 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ah, I'm glad you're getting
some good use out of them.

00:21:04.165 --> 00:21:05.566 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, that reminds me,

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.069 position:13% line:83% align:start
I heard that Selen belongs
to Secro from now on.

00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:10.905 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah. They confirmed
that the dungeon's ecology

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:13.608 position:24% line:83% align:start
didn't change after
the dungeon master appeared.

00:21:13.741 --> 00:21:17.111 position:13% line:83% align:start
Many things have happened,
but I'm glad it's finally over.

00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:21.082 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, I guess you're leaving
for Secro soon.

00:21:21.215 --> 00:21:22.850 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Yeah, tomorrow.

00:21:22.984 --> 00:21:24.317 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:21:26.687 --> 00:21:29.056 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh, Celeste. I was thinking.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.491 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Why don't you come with us?
-I want to go with you!

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:33.360 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Huh!

00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:35.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, are you asking me to come?

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.265 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RYOTA]
Well, I mean.

00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:38.933 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yesterday, when she said

00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:40.768 position:33% line:83% align:start
we were lucky
to find each other?

00:21:40.902 --> 00:21:44.005 position:10% line:83% align:start
It seemed like it'd be silly
to throw that away, right?

00:21:44.138 --> 00:21:46.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought it might be smart
to start up my own party

00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:47.307 position:21% line:89% align:start
with the three of us.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.178 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes! I'd love to join you!

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.546 position:27% line:89% align:start
Glad to hear it!

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:54.615 position:13% line:83% align:start
I mean, we'll have to talk
to Emily first, of course but--

00:21:54.749 --> 00:21:56.851 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm all about it, friends! Yay!

00:21:56.984 --> 00:21:58.119 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:21:58.252 --> 00:21:59.620 position:10% line:83% align:start
Were you just creeping there
the whole time?

00:21:59.754 --> 00:22:01.388 position:13% line:89% align:start
Maybe! But I'm glad to know

00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:02.957 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll be in the Yota Family
with Celeste!

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.725 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're all gonna have
such a good time!

00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:07.862 position:10% line:83% align:start
-We'll be the best team ever!
-[chuckles]

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.230 position:38% line:89% align:start
I agree.

00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:11.799 position:13% line:83% align:start
And we're lucky to have you
with us. Thanks, Celeste!

00:22:13.935 --> 00:22:15.402 position:33% line:89% align:start
My pleasure!
