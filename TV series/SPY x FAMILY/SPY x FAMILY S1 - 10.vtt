00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.097
[door opens]

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:57.849
[INSTRUCTOR A] Good morning
to you, Master Henderson.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.185
[HENDERSON]
Good morning to you as well.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.729
I'm preparing a spot of tea.
Would you care for some?

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.315
Yes, that sounds lovely.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.445
[INSTRUCTOR A] Been quite a
while since you were in charge

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.073
of the youngest of
the grade school kids.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:15.200
How are they?
Giving you any trouble?

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.995
[HENDERSON] I must say, I see
a great deal of promise in them.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.496
[INSTRUCTOR A laughs]

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:22.040
Well, I heard one of them
earned a Tonitrus Bolt

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.376
before classes even began.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.714
There was a rather
inelegant moment,

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.632
but it was handled swiftly.

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:33.719
[INSTRUCTOR A] I've never heard
of one being given so soon.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.971
I only did what I deemed
absolutely necessary

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:37.681
for the situation.

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:39.766
Good deeds shall be rewarded

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:42.811
and misconduct shall be met
with decisive punishment.

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.856
It's an essential philosophy
in the world of education.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:49.109
I've much to learn
from you, sir. Ha.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.238
[HENDERSON] As the elementary
students continue

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.824
to pass through the
gates of Eden College,

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.826
to learn the ways
of true elegance,

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:00.829
so shall our school's
traditions continue.

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:05.042
Our house of learning exists to
ensure the future of our society

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.084
is an elegant one.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:13.133
[alarms ringing]

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:28.649
[EWEN]
Lord Damian! Look at this!

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.818
I believe I found your
older brother in here!

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:33.695
[DAMIAN]
Yeah.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:36.365
[EWEN] This must be
his entrance ceremony.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.076
I'm sure we can find
him elsewhere.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.410
Hey, there he is!

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:43.789
Ah! There he is again!

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.292
[EWEN] And here as well!
Being named as the team's MVP!

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.670
[EMILE] Wow, Lord Damian,
your brother sure is raking in

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.421
the Stellas like
there's no tomorrow!

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.256
It's unbelievable!

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:54.758
It'll be easy for you, too.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.803
You'll probably become an
Imperial Scholar even faster!

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.930
The first to get a Stella
in our grade, at least.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:02.182
That should be no
problem for you!

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:03.975
Um, yeah, easy.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.688
But still, it'll be
a while till our exams,

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.357
so your first chance is...

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.693
...ah, P.E. class next week!

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.029
We've got a dodgeball game
with one of the other classes!

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:17.906
A friend of mine told me
something that he heard

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.575
from his other friend
who's in Class Seven.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:24.079
He said if you're the MVP,
they'll give you a Stella, too!

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.330
Is that true?

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.582
[EMILE] This is your
chance, Lord Damian!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.085
I can be the MVP.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.355
[HENDERSON sighs]

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.445
[HENDERSON]
The day is sunny and clear.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.489
And the young ladies and
gentlemen of Eden College

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.577
will be adding yet another page
to our glorious history book.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:09.416
With brilliance and, of course,
a healthy dose of elegance.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:10.542
[DAMIAN]
Shut up!

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.086
That happened because you picked
a fight with me, you know!

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.296
It wasn't my fault.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:15.922
She's right! You were
the ones who starte--

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.091
Hey! Zip it, uggo!

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.092
You're such a jerk.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.761
[DAMIAN] Watch it,
you stubby legged raccoon!

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:24.431
[BECKY] You should know better
than to talk to girls like that!

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:27.809
[HENDERSON]
We need elegance.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.322
[ANYA]
I have returned!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.491
[YOR]
Hello, Anya! Welcome home.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.244
[ANYA] Papa, I have some
really important news!

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.912
[TWILIGHT]
What?

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.498
You can get a Stella in
your next P.E. class?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.542
Yeah, it's what Becky told me!

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:16.918
Want to know what I heard?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.255
My friend told me that her other
friend in Class Seven told her.

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:23.967
In the game during P. E.,
the winning class's pick for MVP

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.761
will automatically receive
a Stella Star, too!

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:30.473
[TWILIGHT] Only a rumor, then.
Huh. Seems a bit dubious to me.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:33.351
[YOR] Sounds like we need
to train! Don't you think?

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.144
[ANYA]
More training!

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:37.355
But I wonder, what sport
will you kids be playing?

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.690
[ANYA]
Dodgeball.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.860
Okay, then, dodgeball.
Let me think.

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.612
That's where you hit your
opponent with a ball

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.030
to do them in, isn't it?

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.239
[TWILIGHT]
That's one way to put it.

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.575
Mama! Teach me
your killer moves!

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:49.910
I'll be happy to!

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:53.330
I can teach you the ultimate
killer move! That'll show 'em!

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.540
[gasps]

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.792
Guess I didn't realize you
were into sports, Yor.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.127
I'm not, really.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.087
I just used to play catch
with my brother sometimes

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.339
when we were kids.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.715
[YOR] I can't tell them
I rip people apart

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.634
and toss them around
for a living!

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.136
I promise to steer you in
the right direction, Anya!

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:11.723
And with this move,
you will catch that star!

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:14.976
It'll be so cool to kill 'em all
in this dodgeball game, Mama!

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.646
I am gonna catch that
star and smash it!

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.356
[TWILIGHT] I'm glad she's
so motivated, but...

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:20.649
[ANYA]
They'll call me "Super Anya"!

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.025
[YOR]
Yes!

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.197
We'll start off with
strength training. 'Kay?

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.157
One.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.159
Two.

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.538
[YOR]
Three.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.335
[YOR]
Four.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.050
And five.

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.805
And six?

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.187
Good stamina is crucial.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:03.733
[ANYA groans]

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.944
Oh! Are you okay?

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.571
[YOR]
Now, listen carefully.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:09.447
When you throw the ball,

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.741
you're using a whole lot
more than just your arms.

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:12.659
So you need to make sure

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.452
that when you step
out with your foot,

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.664
you're already twisting your
hips as you shift your weight,

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:20.959
channeling all of your strength
into your shoulder, boom!

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:31.553
[YOR]
Okay! Now you try it!

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.055
[YOR]
Hey, Loid!

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.602
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.312
[TWILIGHT]
This is training?

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.481
I don't really understand
how it helps,

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.568
but I did tell Yor she
could handle this.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:48.695
[YOR]
Hm?

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.698
Hey, Anya, you have to wake up!

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:53.950
[YOR]
Hey!

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:54.868
[ANYA]
Hey!

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:55.744
[YOR]
Hah!

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:56.578
[ANYA]
Hah!

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.495
[YOR]
Hup!

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.580
[ANYA]
Hup!

00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.622
[YOR]
Slap!

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:00.373
[ANYA]
Slap!

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.291
[YOR]
Fwap!

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.292
[ANYA]
Fwap!

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:03.251
[YOR]
Chwass!

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.003
[ANYA]
Chwass!

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:24.105
Tomorrow at school,
I'm gonna catch that star!

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.780
[ANYA]
I did my best.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.991
Mama's training almost
did me in, but I made it.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:38.912
I even thought up an attack
name for my killer shot.

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.873
I swear, that star is mine!

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.757
[ANYA]
I'm gonna get lots of stars.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.345
[ANYA] Papa needs me to,
for his mission!

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:57.722
[EMILE] You've got a lot of
swagger for such a shrimp.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.849
You just need to make sure
you and your stubby legs

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.309
don't hold Lord Damian back.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.353
Uh! Is that right?

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.855
Why are we playing with
these dumb boys, anyway?

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.440
Ugh. Like we'd ever
actually want to be

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.818
on the same team as them.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.863
[ANYA] Second son. His daddy is
Papa's target for this mission.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:16.533
If I become his friend,
good things are gonna happen!

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.952
Ugh. What are you
starin' at, uggo?

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.830
[ANYA] But he's a big-time
meanie, and I don't like him.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.040
[growls]

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.250
[DAMIAN] I don't have
any time to waste

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.544
on a raccoon-faced
runt like you.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.170
[ANYA]
What'd he call me?

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.631
[DAMIAN] I desperately need
to make MVP in this game

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.883
and collect that first Stella.

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:35.844
It's important to become
an Imperial Scholar

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.848
just like my brother,
'cause if I don't...

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:44.352
[DAMIAN] ...Father will
never acknowledge me.

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.730
[EWEN] Uh. Hey, wait
for us, Lord Damian!

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:51.484
[HENDERSON]
Gather round!

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:55.905
Unfortunately, Coach
Bobby is out today.

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.992
Meaning, I will be serving
as his substitute.

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:01.494
Remember to behave in
a sportsmanlike manner,

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.539
and of course, to execute
the most elegant of plays.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.790
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:06.749
[HENDERSON]
Without further ado,

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.501
we will commencetoday's
dodgeball match

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:13.256

Obviously, he was a
super early bloomer,

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.289

trophies in tournaments

--[BILL] Huh.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:41.258
The game is over!

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.886
[STUDENT I]
Yay! We won!

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.221
[ALL]
Huh?

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:47.848
That Stella Star's
as good as yours, Bill!

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.184
[HENDERSON]
Stella, you say?

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.686
We do not award Stella
for winning one small game

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:54.063
in a single class.

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:56.440
That would be quite ridiculous.

00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:58.067
But while we're on the subject,

00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:01.153
screaming "die" at your opponent
like that is unacceptable.

00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:04.615
Therefore, I have no issue
giving you a Tonitrus Bolt.

00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:08.786
[STUDENT J] It's okay, Bill!
We'll do better next time!

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.955
Not like this is
our only chance.

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:12.081
[HENDERSON]
On the other hand,

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:13.666
two students at odds
with each other

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:17.253
put aside their differences to
face this challenge together.

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:19.338
Their elegance proves
that we do indeed

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.092
have young ladies and gentlemen
who are worthy of a Stella.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:24.593
What's wrong with
you, you idiot?!

00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:26.387
That was the worst
throw in history!

00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:28.556
I should've never
defended you!

00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:31.517
Hey, now! It's not like you
hit anyone, so shut up!

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.769
I don't like you after all.

00:22:33.811 --> 00:22:35.521
[DAMIAN] What did you
just say, stubby legs?

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:37.982
[BECKY] I told you that you
shouldn't talk to girls like...

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:40.901
[HENDERSON]
Or perhaps we don't.

00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:44.196
[ANYA] Nothing Mama
teaches me ever helps...

00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:19.041
[inaudible]
