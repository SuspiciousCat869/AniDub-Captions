WEBVTT

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:21.438
[NIGHTFALL] Twilight, my mentor,
you've changed.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.732
This fraudulent Forger
family has given you

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:28.278
unnecessary emotions and dulled
your cunning as an agent.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.739
You're like a hunting knife
that's been chipped.

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:35.494
To see what you've become,
it hurts my heart.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:39.414
Ah. But this gentler version
of you is adorable.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.750
I don't know if I can handle it!

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.001
I love you.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.797
You may be like a toy knife
that collapses on contact,

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.007
but my feelings are
as strong as ever.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.218
Actually, you're far
more desirable now,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.095
and I'm madly in love with you.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:56.473
This is just not right,
though. It should be me.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.393
I should be the one who
awakens this side of you.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.395
Yor Forger.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:05.440
I will take your position
and be the wife he deserves.

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.496
[NIGHTFALL]
Cavi Campbell, age 56.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.665
Made his fortune
in the energy sector

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.959
and is one of the world's
foremost art collectors.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.045
His personal gallery
includes a painting

00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:51.838
valued at a million dalc.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.465
"The Lady in the Sun."

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.884
That's the target for
our mission together.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.010
[TWILIGHT]
A painting?

00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:57.803
[NIGHTFALL]
Yes.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:01.431
One that was previously owned by
the late Colonel Erik Zacharis.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:04.685
A military intelligence officer
for the East during the war,

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.229
and a major player
in ending the war.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.188
[NIGHTFALL]
Correct.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.982
Supposedly, he possessed
some extremely sensitive

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.694
top-secret information that
was suppressed and hidden

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:17.114
for fear it could reignite the
flames of war if made public.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.241
Known as the Zacharis Dossier.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.411
It may contain records of the
East's human experiments,

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:25.664
or details of the West's
massacre of POWs,

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.542
but its contents are pure
speculation as of now.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.712
Also called the "ticking time
bomb under thin ice."

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:35.215
Its whereabouts are a
mystery as well, but...

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:38.343
There could be clues to the
location found in the painting?

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.555
[NIGHTFALL] Our intel comes
from a well-connected source.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.057
We believe there might be
some kind of code within it.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.435
Now it's only a matter
of time before Campbell

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.563
or the Ostanian government
discovers the code.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.774
Our orders are to find and
retrieve the Zacharis Dossier

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.526
before they do.

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.612
[TWILIGHT] Whether its contents
are harmful to East or West,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.448
it's still highly likely
the information

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.993
will be used to reignite
those flames, as you say.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.661
Where is the painting now?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.163
[NIGHTFALL] Underneath
the Campbell mansion

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.457
with the rest of his collection.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.959
It's closely guarded, and
Campbell has connections

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.794
to the State Security Service.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.130
Those that dared to enter
without authorization

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:16.757
have quickly met their end.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.634
Infiltration is quite risky.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:20.927
Our plan?

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.930
[NIGHTFALL]
I have one, of course.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:28.977
[CROWD cheering]

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.783
Game, set, and match!

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.494
You freakin' kidding me?!
Gimme my money!

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:49.831
[COMMENTATOR A] A good payout
for some on that match!

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.751
You have ten minutes to place
your bets on the next round,

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:53.585
so let's get ready...!

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:54.961
Nightfall.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.671
Yes, Twilight, what is it?

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.508
Was this truly the only way
to proceed with the mission?

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.052
This was the most
certain method.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.554
Since Campbell runs this
illicit tennis tournament

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:07.265
with other members of his
underground tennis club,

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.059
it's our best way in.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.019
Bigwigs from the
world of finance,

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:14.147
as well as organized crime,
gather for the competition,

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.316
colloquially known
as the Cambelldon.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.860
Those behind the event
usually enter their own

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.029
highly skilled players
to compete.

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.739
But amateurs can also play,

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.116
with an exorbitant
entry fee, of course.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.495
The winner is free to choose
whatever work of art they want

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.038
from Campbell's collection,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.999
which can be quite
a valuable prize.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.418
[TWILIGHT]
Yes. But why tennis?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.587
And who's heard of an
underground tennis club?

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.631
[NIGHTFALL] I think he's
just really into it.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:43.885
Entering is risk-free, and once
we win, the mission's complete.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.680
[TWILIGHT] Let's hope
it goes that smoothly.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.348
[COMMENTATOR A] Next up,
we have the fourth match

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.893
of our first round with
Twain and Nafalia Phony!

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.937
It looks like we're up.

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.522
[COMMENTATOR A] They're not
only doubles partners,

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:56.273
but husband and wife.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.149
[AUDIENCE C] Hope you get
creamed out there!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.693
[AUDIENCE E] I bet a hundred
dalc they divorce!

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.695
Why did you choose
this cover story?

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:02.362
[NIGHTFALL]
Wow.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.615
All these people really believe
we're a married couple.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.993
[COMMENTATOR A] They'll be goin'
up against Wolson and Babol!

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:11.663
The legendary duo that dominated
the Grand Slam ten years ago!

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:15.125
Wait a sec, we're facing off
against retired champions?

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.419
Have you played much
tennis, Twilight?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.254
I've dabbled a tiny bit.

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:21.756
And practiced with
the family recently.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.552
No fair! I wanna
play tennis, too!

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:28.597
Then maybe we should
all play some together!

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.850
[NIGHTFALL]
So what did you tell them?

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.768
[TWILIGHT] Just that I was
having a friendly tennis match

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.605
with some of my associates
in the medical field.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.065
Believable.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.984
[NIGHTFALL]
Someday, you won't have to make

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.986
excuses like that, Twilight.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:44.738
There's no need
for you to worry.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.114
You could just stand and watch

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.450
from the back corner
if you'd like.

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.160
[NIGHTFALL]
This mission will also serve

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.620
to prove beyond a doubt

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.457
that I'm the perfect fit to play
your wife for Operation Strix.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.084
I can handle all the action
here on the court.

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.503
You know you can
always count on me!

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.547
[SENIOR AGENT A] Nightfall's a
little too eager to get ahead.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.300
Keep an eye out to make sure
she doesn't get sloppy.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.552
[TWILIGHT] Here comes that
sinking feeling again.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:10.722
[COMMENTATOR A] The odds are
an amazing 40 to 1.3!

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.182
Do we have any brave souls

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.934
willing to bet on
these lovebirds?

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.269
This supposed to be some
kinda joke, or what?

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.729
They look like a
couple of tourists

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.272
lost on their way to the spa.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.857
We may have officially retired,

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.651
but we never stopped
trying to be the best

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:23.902
to ever play the game.

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.655
The only way to find players
strong enough to take us

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.365
was in the underground arena.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.658
We holed up in the mountains

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.785
and went through the most
punishing training regimen

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.286
to prepare for this.

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.622
Well, let's all try to
have a good, clean match.

00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:37.791
Best of luck to you
both, gentlemen.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.668
[WOLSON]
Match? You poor fool.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:44.172
This is gonna be a total
slaughter, so say your goodbyes.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:47.008
[UMPIRE A]
Team Phony is first to serve.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:00.313
[UMPIRE A]
Fifteen-love!

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.567
[NIGHTFALL] Immediately scoring
a service ace against a pro.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.445
You've redefined what it means
to "dabble," Twilight.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.364
I love you.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.576
[UMPIRE A]
Thirty-love!

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.495
Forty-love!

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:17.414
That's game!

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.623
[CROWD cheering]

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.083
What the hell was that?

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.793
I've never even seen
a top-ranked player

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.628
make that kinda serve.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.632
It's on. Shoot for the
chick and show no mercy.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.592
Take this!

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.806
In your face!

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.891
[UMPIRE A]
Love-fifteen.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.685
Now, what in the--?

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:41.563
Nice work, Nigh--Nafalia.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:42.897
[NIGHTFALL]
He praised me!

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.357
Just warming up.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.526
[NIGHTFALL] Okay, all I have
to do is keep showing him

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:49.446
how amazing I am,
mercilessly crush the enemy,

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.698
and get the painting in a flash.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.991
[TWILIGHT]
You're incredible!

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.743
Let's play doubles
in the game of life,

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.161
where love means everything!

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.748
[NIGHTFALL] Oh, Twilight!
You've aced my heart!

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.594
[UMPIRE A] Game, set, and match!
The Phonies take the win!

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:13.970
[COMMENTATOR A]
What an upset, folks!

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.389
This amateur couple
came out of nowhere

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.266
and annihilated the pros!

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:21.519
Looks like we've got a dark
horse in the running!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.105
Was it a fluke, or a sign
of things to come?

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.982
This could get very interesting!

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.776
[laughs]

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.569
Now that was a hell of a match.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.363
This surprise could make us
a fortune, gentlemen.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.364
[MEMBER A laughs]

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.325
You wouldn't be rigging
any matches on us,

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:36.701
would you, Mister Campbell?

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:37.869
[MEMBER B laughs]

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.162
We just wanna engage in some

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.331
good, clean, high-stakes
gambling, after all!

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:44.834
Hmph. They may be pros,
but still normal men.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.503
My big and beefy Boric brothers

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.046
will be taking to
the court next.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.255
The Phonies are done.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:52.383
[MEMBER A] You mean that pair
of junkies you brought?

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.260
[MEMBER C laughs]

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.387
[MEMBER C] You'll change
your tune soon enough.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.098
We're working with the
government to develop

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.725
a new doping agent called OSO-R.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.436
It's for the upcoming
East-West Sports Exhibition,

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.814
but they'll use it today.

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:09.317
[COMMENTATOR A] Thank you for
waiting, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.986
We will now begin
the second round!

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.364
Our first match will
feature the Phony pair,

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:16.366
who just wowed us
with a miracle upset,

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:21.454
playing against the Mad Dogs
of Dressen, the Boric brothers!

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:24.999
Nafalia, thought you said
this would be risk-free.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.836
Let's just do our best,
okay, sweetie?

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:40.807
Mama! The ball ran away! Mama!

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.726
[YOR]
Oh, I'm sorry about that, Anya.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.648
[ANYA] I guess she's
lost in her tots?

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.651
No. I'm paying
attention, really.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.198
[YOR] If he's playing in a
tennis match with coworkers,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.576
does that mean she's there, too?

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.370
What's her relationship
with Loid anyway?

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:05.248
Ohh! I don't ever wanna
go back to my old life

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.793
and have Yuri worry
about me 24/7!

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.212
The ball?

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:14.382
[YOR] Maybe I should just
take care of her first.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:15.133
[gasps]

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.552
[YOR] No, no, no!
Stop thinking like that!

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:20.430
Come on, Yor, you can't solve
every problem that way.

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:23.057
You could make things worse!

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.810
It's okay, Mama.
Don't worry about it.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.021
Uh, worry about what?

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:30.481
[YOR] Uh-oh, does she
know what I'm thinking?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.400
Uh, everything will be fine.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:34.235
Papa is gonna win big time

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.738
and he's gonna bring
home a giant trophy.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.241
Uh. Yeah.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.161
You're right, Anya.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:46.080
Loid can do anything
he puts his mind to.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.541
He'll give his opponents
a big ol' kapow!

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.210
[ANYA]
Kapow!

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:53.588
[ANAN]
Kill. Tennis.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.633
Well, that's odd.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:59.677
Those certainly don't seem to be
the same bony Boric brothers

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.095
from the first round.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.640
The Cambelldon is run
quite differently.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:06.226
You can modify your gear,
take steroids,

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.561
and engage in
unsportsmanlike conduct.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.146
Almost anything goes.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.440
I'd wager some
doping was involved.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:15.068
[TWILIGHT]
Yeah, an extremely safe bet.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.237
Come on, you meatheads!
I got a fortune riding on you!

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:19.530
Screw this up, and
you're dead, ya hear?

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.075
I'll kill you!

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.204
[COMMENTATOR A]
Whoa, now!

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:29.374
The younger brother, Catan,
tore a hole in the fence!

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.416
Kill all!

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.293
Shut your face and watch!

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.379
[COMMENTATOR A] Look at
that monstrous strength!

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.673
And betting time
is just about over.

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:39.050
The Phony pair pulled out
a miracle last round,

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.594
but can they topple the
gargantuan Boric brothers?

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.680
We'll find out soon!

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.306
[TWILIGHT]
Their inhuman, brute strength

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.683
will be an issue for us.

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:49.769
How do we fight them
without losing our stamina?

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:54.357
[COMMENTATOR A]
Oof!

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:58.111
The older brother, Anan, easily
crushed a ball like a grape!

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:00.697
Let's take good care of
the equipment, please.

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:01.990
[ANAN]
Hey, boy!

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:04.993
I think I smell a little
piss comin' from ya.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.744
So get this girl to
change your diapers

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.497
and go back to your crib, huh?

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.292
Pissy diaper!

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.501
[NIGHTFALL]
I'd be happy to.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.086
Aw, what's wrong?

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.880
Does the little pissy baby
not know how to talk?

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.216
He's too dumb to use
his words, bro.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.259
We'll have to spank him!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.511
Yeah, you can tell
just by lookin'

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.763
that the guy's got no
brains in his head.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:29.225
Thinkin's just too hard for
mama's special little baby!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:35.648
[BROTHERS laughing]

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:40.611
[buzzer sounds]

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:44.949
[UMPIRE A] Game, set,
and match. Phonies win!

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.326
[COMMENTATOR A]
Holy cow!

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.577
Their name may be Phony,

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.162
but they are the
real deal, folks!

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:51.497
They literally overpowered
the massive Boric brothers

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.333
from the first serve
of the game!

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.626
No mercy for the opponents!

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.588
Did you have to hit them
with that many smashes?

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:01.341
My hand just kept slipping.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:02.759
[NIGHTFALL]
They should die.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.802
But they were
my secret weapons!

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:05.887
Tough break.

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:08.306
Maybe send that drug
of yours back to R&amp;D

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.432
before that exhibition.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.310
These upstarts are
extremely impressive.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:15.313
You might find yourself in a bit
of trouble there, Campbell.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.272
[CAMPBELL]
Hm?

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:19.609
Oh, yeah? I'm not worried.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.987
[NARRATOR] Mostly thanks to
Nightfall's increasingly bold

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.074
and powerful moves,
the aptly named Phony pair

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.868
continued their steady advance
through the competitors,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.623
eventually making their way
into the final round.

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:36.334
Wait here. The finals will
begin in about 20 minutes,

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.587
so please, make
yourselves comfortable.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.596
Just one more match left.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:52.100
[NIGHTFALL] Twilight, how do
you like my flawless plays?

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:54.018
Do they get you excited?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.479
Apparently, we'll be facing
Campbell's son and daughter

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.356
in the final round.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.608
And although they're
still in high school,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.776
from the time they could walk,

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:04.737
they've rigorously trained
with the top names in tennis.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.407
Since their father's in charge,
we should be even more wary

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:10.034
of underhanded methods
to tip the scales.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.994
Well, from their
matches thus far,

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.871
the two don't appear
to be that skilled.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.457
I'll end this match in no time.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.792
[NIGHTFALL]
And once we win,

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:22.338
he'll choose me as his doubles
partner in the game of life!

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.256
[gasps]

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.465
Nightfall.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.425
[NIGHTFALL]
Yes?

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:26.676
[NIGHTFALL]
Wow, I can't believe

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.261
you're making your
move right now!

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.012
This is all so sudden, Twilight!

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:33.516
I don't know if my heart
can take it! Oh!

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:38.813
Take it down a notch.
You're tearing up your hands.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.731
This is going to be
harder than you think.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.317
I know you want to win,
but pace yourself.

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:45.903
I know exactly what I'm doing.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.990
Let's win and finish
up the mission.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:55.079
I've heard something similar
from countless fallen allies.

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.960
[TWILIGHT] Losing your cool
can mean losing your life.

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:04.422
Just how many times
must I repeat myself?

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.468
[NIGHTFALL]
You're right.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:11.637
[NIGHTFALL] Twilight, the lesson
you used to drill into me

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:14.223
was that we spies
are expendable.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:18.394
Now you're sick with
worry over me.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.981
Why must you never play fair
with my heart? How dare you!

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:24.275
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you...

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.527
[TWILIGHT] Whoa!
She's staring daggers into me!

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:29.864
Does she truly doubt
my methods that much?

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.742
[NIGHTFALL] Damn it!
Why did I pull my hand away?

00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.411
How stupid of me!

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.623
I can still feel his warmth
tingling on my hand.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.584
Tingling?

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.337
Wait a sec.

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:45.505
So what now?

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:48.424
You need to hold your breath
and close your eyes.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:52.803
Colorless and odorless gas.
Non-lethal, most likely.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.222
[TWILIGHT]
I see now.

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:55.890
This is why the
Campbell kids' opponents

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:59.685
all seemed off their
games earlier.

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:03.231
They're trying to impair us
before the round begins.

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:05.650
[NIGHTFALL]
A dirty trick.

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.156
[TWILIGHT]
Hmm. We're locked in as well.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.783
It would be easy to
break out of here,

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:14.825
but if there's a guard,

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:18.913
then we might have to attack him
and put the mission in jeopardy.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:22.625
We'll have to pretend
we fell for the trap.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.252
We should cover up
as much as possible

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:27.630
and get into those lockers
to minimize the effects.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.258
Can you make it
till the door opens?

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:33.302
[NIGHTFALL] I'm good for
ten minutes, at least.

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:34.679
[COMMENTATOR A]
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.972
thank you for waiting!

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.765
Without further ado,
the final round

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:41.811
of the 14th annual Campbelldon
is about to get underway!

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:46.023
It'll be the Phony pair versus
the Campbell siblings!

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.316
The Phonies are on a roll,

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:49.485
but will it be enough
to stop the siblings'

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.945
third victory in a row?

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.155
The odds slightly favor
the Campbell kids!

00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.699
[CAMPBELL]
Yes, this is perfect.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.577
You rubes keep putting your
money on those nobodies.

00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:00.746
How interesting. I think I'll
bet on the couple as well.

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:02.164
I will, too.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.916
I assume you're betting
on your children,

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.668
aren't you, Mister Campbell?

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.630
But of course! I've got
ten million on my kids.

00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:11.632
[CAMPBELL] They're gonna
wipe the floor with 'em.

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:15.720
Especially after those Phonies
sucked up all that gas. Ha!

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:18.139
Looking a little pale
and shaky there, folks.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.227
Now, Carrol and Kim,
show them no mercy.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:24.437
You okay?

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:27.356
I'm fine, but still
slightly numb

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:28.983
and a little bit out of breath.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:30.860
I got word from Daddy.

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:33.988
He said we can stop pretending
to struggle so much.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.366
Heh. I'm, like, so over
of all his micro-managing.

00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:38.951
Let's take out these losers.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:41.787
Daddy can shut up and
buy us a new yacht.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.753
[UMPIRE A]
And Phony is first up to serve.

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:02.475
Now that's just pathetic!

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.070
That's out!

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:15.237
[COMMENTATOR A]
Whoa!

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:17.823
Carrol's jet-powered racket
forces a Phony error!

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:19.825
It's not like I'm cheating.

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:24.121
It was a real challenge to learn
how to use this thing correctly.

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:32.213
[COMMENTATOR A] A nice hit
from the Phony lady!

00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:35.675
Will Kim be able to
reach it in time?

00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:48.688
[COMMENTATOR A] She can!
With the bursting whip racket!

00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:53.901
They won't be a problem.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.945
[COMMENTATOR A] The Campbell
siblings are proving once again

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:58.656
why they're the reigning champs!

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.451
[UMPIRE A]
Game, Campbells!

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.622
[UMPIRE A]
Game, Campbells!

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.666
Game, Campbells!

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:10.668
[COMMENTATOR A] What a blowout
from the title holders

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.836
right out of the gate!

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:12.962
And this is the first set

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:15.631
that's slipped through the
hands of the Phony pair!

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:18.426
Hey! Play better, damn you!

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.344
[AUDIENCE R] You should've used
a cross on that return,

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:21.262
you idiot!

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.514
[AUDIENCE T]
You've still got this, Nafalia!

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.349
[NIGHTFALL] I'm going
to remember the faces

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:29.437
of every single person
who ridiculed Twilight.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:32.440
What a shot! Sorry, old chum.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.408
[COMMENTATOR A] Kicking off the
second set of the final match!

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.910
The Phonies are desperate
for a win this time!

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:48.622
Carroll Campbell
is first on service!

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:49.999
[CARROL]
Hup!

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:53.544
[COMMENTATOR A]
Here comes the return!

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:58.007
[KIM] Can't get a great hit,
but with enough spin...

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:04.764
[KIM grunts]

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:07.057
They got lucky.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.317
[UMPIRE A]
Love-thirty!

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.113
[COMMENTATOR A]
It looks like the Phony pair

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:23.032
is getting back into
the swing of things,

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.284
and just in the nick of time!

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.411
Damn it! What the
hell's going on?

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:29.079
[COMMENTATOR A] The Campbell
siblings have given up

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.791
three games in a row this set!

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.793
[CARROL]
All right, then...

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:36.629
[COMMENTATOR A]
Will the Phony duo be able

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.257
to sweep the set against
the title defenders?

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:43.719
[gasps]

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:45.763
[COMMENTATOR A]
What the--?!

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:49.850
Nafalia's ball seems to
have a mind of its own!

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:52.895
[chuckles]

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:57.316
I see. The court is divided
into 36 small panels.

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.693
I'd wondered what
that was all about.

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:02.696
Those can't be the only dirty
tricks they'll be using.

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.490
This could get ugly.

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:05.991
[TWILIGHT]
Not an issue.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.410
I won't be beaten so easily.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:11.914
Not by these
underhanded gimmicks.

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:14.625
[NIGHTFALL]
There he is.

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:19.004
Watch my back, Nafalia.
I'll need your support on this.

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:21.507
[NIGHTFALL]
There's the Twilight I admire.

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:26.470
The one I can't help chasing.
The one I want to support.

00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:29.473
The man who turned
my respect into love,

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:32.351
whose dreams became my dreams.

00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:34.854
The real deal.

00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:36.397
[NIGHTFALL]
I got you, Twain.

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:38.941
Now let's do this.

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:41.902
We'll crush them!

00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:43.946
[NIGHTFALL]
I love you!

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:18.749
[inaudible]
