00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.135
[NARRATOR] The nations
of the world continue

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.971
their fierce war of information
in the shadows.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:13.764
And to keep an eye

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.016
on a leading figure in
Ostania's government,

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.726
Westalis began a
top-secret mission

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:19.603
called "Operation Strix."

00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:22.064
With the master of disguise
known as Twilight at the helm,

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.107
phase one of the plan
has been completed,

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.651
creating a false
family as a cover

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.530
and enrolling his "child"
in the esteemed Eden College.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.782
Said daughter has earned
one Stella Star,

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.534
the first of eight
required to become

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.453
one of Eden's exclusive
Imperial Scholars.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:38.247
Now the mission moves
on to phase two,

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.541
securing an invitation
to attend the gathering

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:43.043
that will place Twilight
right next to their target,

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:45.087
Donovan Desmond.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:27.022
[HENDERSON] Your next social
studies assignment

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.607
will be to research
an occupation

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.442
that piques your interest.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.861
Feel free to visit your
parents' workplaces

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:35.364
or go interview workers at
a local shop or company,

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.657
for example.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.575
Perhaps use your
parents' connections

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:40.118
to speak with dignitaries.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.954
And of course, if you'd like
to know more about educators,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.790
you may interview me as well.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.043
I'll gladly tell you all about
our elegant profession.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:49.795
Compile your findings
into a report

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.631
and be prepared to
present it on Friday.

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:55.175
So are you gonna
interview your father?

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:57.386
If I can catch him.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.262
I think I'll take the
quick and easy route.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.431
I'll just ask my dad
about his job.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.891
What about you, Anya?

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.768
[ANYA]
Hmm...

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.940
A job investigation?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.983
[ANYA] I'm supposed to ask
why you chose your job

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.819
and/or how you got your start.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.278
Stuff like that.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.448
And then they want me to watch
you work and take notes.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.034
[YOR]
Uh. Watch me work?

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.161
[YOR]
Oh, boy, what should I tell her?

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.248
I mean, my profession?
Which one?

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.250
Okay, Anya, now pay attention.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.044
I'm gonna show you what I do
for my second job, all right?

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.671
'Kay.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.799
[YOR] At first,
I only started doing this

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.676
so that I could take
care of my brother,

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.678
but now I'm actually
proud of my work.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.098
As the Shopkeeper always says,
this job is a noble calling

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.100
since we're risking our
lives for our country--

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.144
the same way a soldier
in the army does!

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:47.978
[phone ringing]

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.065
[YOR] Oh! That must be them now
with my next assignment.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.943
It looks like this man
is our newest customer.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.279
What a despicable
traitorous pig.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.364
But I really shouldn't
sully your tender ears

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:03.034
with the list of awful
things he's done.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.244
There's no time to waste.

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:05.996
You're gonna be
watching me in action.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.289
Do you think you can keep up?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.290
Yep!

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.250
[YOR] The Shop lets me know
how many enemies there are

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.127
and how the security
is laid out,

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.255
so all I have to
do is get inside.

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:16.590
I'll usually kill on sight,

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.134
but killing the wrong
person is a big no-no.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:22.387
So I always study the briefing
documents carefully.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.348
The key is confidence
in your skills.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.225
[SECURITY A]
An intruder!

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.478
[YOR] What makes the job
so rewarding is the feeling

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.481
that I'm doing my part
to clean up this country.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.441
When I think of all the lives
that are being saved

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:39.029
by what I'm doing, it really
puts a spring in my step!

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.030
In this line of work,

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:43.158
honing your body and
techniques are essential.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.786
Plus, it's important
to know human anatomy.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.871
I try to remember that
the target is human,

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:50.081
and the least I can do is
make their final moments

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.958
as painless as possible.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.169
Make sense?

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.379
[MAN A screams]

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.549
[YOR] For example, if you
simply [beep] the [beep]

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.553
in someone's neck,
they'll die rather quickly.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:06.056
You could also precisely
attack one's vital points

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.307
like the brain or heart.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.185
Uh! Look at you, you're covered!

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:10.977
You know what?

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.773
Let's just tell Loid we went
to the tomato festival, okay?

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.234
[YOR]
Uh...

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.070
[ANYA] I think I'm gonna
investigate Papa's job.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.156
Oh! Sure, that works!
And it's probably for the best.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.283
Working at City Hall
can be quite rewarding,

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.994
but it might be a little
bit boring for you.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.496
[TWILIGHT]
I'm home.

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:32.332
[ANYA]
Papa! Blah, blah, yadda, yadda.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.125
Ah, yes. Understood.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:41.132
I work in the hospital's
psychiatry department.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.426
I made sure to tell them
in advance you're coming,

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:44.928
but don't bother anyone, okay?

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.389
Uh-huh.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.598
It's huge!

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.516
[TWILIGHT]
Well, it is the capital's

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:52.435
most prominent hospital.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.728
[TWILIGHT] A private
practice would've made

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.397
for an easier cover story,

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.524
but many high-profile names
from the political

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:59.359
and business world
frequent here.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:01.611
This place lets me infiltrate
their social circles

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.405
and steal plenty of information.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.073
Ohh.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.577
I don't think anything I've said
is particularly noteworthy.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.704
Also, why are you
dressed like that?

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.623
[ANYA] This is how
investy-gators dress.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.458
[TWILIGHT]
I see.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:20.839
[ANYA gasps]

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:24.509
Although most psychiatrists
don't wear lab coats,

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.263
I find that it completes
the look, as they say.

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.765
[TWILIGHT] Now, what did you
wanna know about my work?

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.517
They gave me a list of things.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.729
But the first one was,
"Why did you choose this job?"

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.067
Why be a psychiatrist?
Uh... let me think.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.737
You know how everyone
gets a cold sometimes?

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:46.865
Well, they don't only
get them in the body.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.325
There are a lot of people
who catch colds

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.911
in their minds as well.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.370
In gym class, Second Son said

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.081
I couldn't even catch a cold
'cause I'm too dumb.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.335
[TWILIGHT] He did? Well,
let's try to ignore that.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.712
But back on topic,
I thought it would be nice

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.839
to try and help those folks out.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:04.174
The war may be long over,

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.800
but there are so many
people out there,

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.637
veterans especially,
who are still suffering.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:09.930
[ANYA]
Ohh.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.681
[TWILIGHT]
Desmond is a recluse.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:14.643
I figured that if I'm lucky,
maybe one day he'll get sick,

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.561
and being a doctor would
give me an opportunity

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.773
to approach him without
arousing suspicion.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.609
[TWILIGHT] I made up my mind
when I was in college.

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:23.818
[ANYA]
Next question.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.988
What is the atmospear
like at your workplace?

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.198
[TWILIGHT]
You mean "atmosphere."

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.533
Why, if it isn't Doctor Forger.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:34.079
And this must be the little one
we've heard so much about!

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.915
[TWILIGHT] These are my
colleagues. Say hello.

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:39.250
[ANYA] Pweasure to meet
your 'quiantenance.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.877
She's adorable!

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.629
What a good girl,
here for homework!

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:45.632
Goodness! What a perfect little
doe-eyed princess you are!

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.968
Why don't you have a snack?

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.345
[ANYA]
Papa's workplace is paradise.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.639
Sure must be nice.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:55.600
Could you please tell me what
Papa's like at work, please?

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:58.144
He does everything
with such a sense of style.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.855
He's so careful and kind
with the patients, too!

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.066
Your father's amazing,
young lady.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.276
He became an indispensable
part of our team

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.070
as soon as he transferred in.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.780
He never let it get to his head.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.657
He's always respectful
and humble.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.075
[DOCTOR G]
Ah, that reminds me.

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.035
My neurologist friend
was really hoping

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.246
you'd come to our next
meeting, Doctor Forger.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.081
[PSYCHIATRIST A] The director
wants you to come golfing, too!

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.749
Are you popular, Papa?

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:23.503
Um. Well, I do try to
be sociable, at least.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:24.421
I'll make sure to check in...

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.922
[TWILIGHT]
Maintaining a diverse collection

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.799
of contacts is essential.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.677
It makes it easier to gather
info and forge new connections,

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.679
but what's more important
is being someone

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.849
that makes people think,
"What? No way he's a spy!"

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.810
I can't stand out
for being antisocial.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.104
[ANYA]
"What? No way he's--"

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.356
Seriously, why do you
keep taking notes

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:44.941
when nothing significant
has happened?

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.819
[ANYA] Next, what is the
hardest part of your job?

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.030
That question's
a bit of a toughy.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.072
[TWILIGHT]
Hmm.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.241
I'd say it's the fact that
the wounds we treat

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.535
aren't visible ones.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.162
Doctors aren't wizards.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.747
We can't read our
patient's minds

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.540
to figure out what's
going on with them.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:01.750
[chuckles]

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.710
[TWILIGHT]
Why do you look so smug?

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:06.963
Since we can't just tell, we
have to observe their actions.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:10.425
Without preconception,
meticulously and assiduously.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.261
[TWILIGHT] Not unlike a spy
dealing with their target.

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.221
The biggest difference
being that, in the end,

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:19.225
spies betray that trust for
their organization's gain.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.935
These are good snacks
y'got here.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.229
[NURSE C] Oh, yeah?
Would you like some more?

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.272
[PSYCHIATRIST A]
How about some juice?

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.982
[DOCTOR G]
You wanna take an inkblot test?

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.817
[TWILIGHT]
This interview is over.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.152
You're so serious.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.279
I think it's one of his
best character traits.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.823
I only wish we could get this
guy in a clinical setting

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.076
where he could really put
those skills to good use.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:39.704
Apologies. I've just been
so busy with my research.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.790
[TWILIGHT] I suppose the actual
hardest part of my job

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.626
is keeping it secondary
to my mission.

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:46.920
[PSYCHIATRIST A] Well, we should
be getting back to work.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.005
[NURSE B]
I'll see ya later, Anya!

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.257
Enough questions. I wanna
see you in action.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.550
Like, with a patient?

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:53.885
I'm afraid that would
be a violation

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.887
of patient/doctor
confidentiality.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:10:00.350
And I really can't show much
of my research to you either.

00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:03.478
I guess I can at least show
you the consultation room.

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.524
I don't plan on using
this space today anyway.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.944
This is just a normal room,
not like the opertating one.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:14.531
Well, we want our patients
to feel relaxed and at home.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.950
[ANYA] Where's the
brain-fixing machine?

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.118
[TWILIGHT]
Did you pay attention at all

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.328
when I explained
what this job's like?

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.248
That's enough of that, let's get
to those other questions.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:26.084
Seriously, what cartoon
did you get this from?

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.211
[ANYA] My homework's done,
and I'm bored.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.380
[TWILIGHT] Hey, don't touch
anything without asking!

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.632
There's a lot of
important stuff in here.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.134
[TWILIGHT]
Like the secret escape passage

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:37.011
behind this bookshelf
in case there's an emergency.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.180
It'll open if she
turns the lever.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.683
[ANYA]
Secret passage? Lever?

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:44.185
[knocking]

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.020
[TWILIGHT]
Must be a WISE agent.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.897
Sounds like something
urgent's come up.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.190
If you're done with
your assignment,

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.026
should we have Yor
come pick you up?

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:55.697
[ANYA] No, I can wait until
you're done with work.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.198
[ANYA]
Being a spy is tough.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.120
If you really want to, then keep
yourself busy with this.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.414
We use this as
a diagnostic tool.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:07.125
You can place the toys and props
in the sand however you want,

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.334
so get creative!

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.669
Sounds like fun, huh?

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.337
[ANYA]
Sounds boring.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.174
And remember, don't touch
anything else, okay?

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.300
'Kay.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.969
I'll be back in
about ten minutes.

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.934
[chuckles]

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.189
[FIONA] Some documents
concerning revisions

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.066
to the DSM should be
arriving by the weekend.

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:33.735
Understood.

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.320
[TWILIGHT]
A number of my fellow agents

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.197
have also infiltrated
this hospital

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.365
to help with my cover story.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:40.867
Another mission.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.703
You've made the necessary
adjustments to my schedule here?

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.079
[FIONA]
Of course.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.790
Was that little girl you
were just with Anya Forger?

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.542
She seems quite attached to you.

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:51.628
Uh-huh, and she's
a real handful.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.129
Oh, I'm shocked to hear

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:56.257
that someone can get
the better of you, Doctor.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.848
Ah!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.351
Exploring is cool!

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:09.062
This secret passage is so small.

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:10.188
[DOCTOR C]
Our discussion today

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.900
will be on psychic phenomena
and neuroscience.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.610
[ANYA]
Some kinda serious meeting?

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.362
[DOCTOR C] Around five
percent of the cases reported

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.072
lack an adequate explanation--

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:20.823
[DOCTOR D]
Ha! Nonsense!

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:24.160
Anyone complaining about ghosts
and ghouls just has mythomania!

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.703
Perhaps they're hallucinations

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.248
caused by abnormalities
in brain function?

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.124
[DOCTOR D] Why are we
even entertaining this?

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:34.254
[ANYA] They're talking
about ghosts? So cool!

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.172
[ALL]
Hm?

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.092
[DOCTOR C]
Did you hear something?

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:41.511
[DOCTOR E] Uh, there's no
room above us, though.

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:45.139
[ANYA] Oh, no! They'll find
the secret passage!

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:48.226
It's... just our imagination.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.395
[DOCTOR C] Anyway,
as for how we should handle

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.938
these kinds of situations,

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.190
I think it'd be in our best
interest to tread lightly--

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:56.776
[DOCTOR D] I don't have time
to argue about fantasy.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:57.944
This meeting is over.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.028
[gasps]

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.241
[ANYA] Oh, yeah. I gotta get
back before Papa does!

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.409
[gasps]

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.870
[ANYA] My leg's stuck!
I can't get free!

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.123
I'm in big trouble!

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.000
[ALL gasp]

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:16.921
[ALL scream]

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.673
There is definitely
something up there!

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.216
[DOCTOR F]
Is that a baby crying?

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.217
It's a ghost!

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:24.679
This must be what they
were all talking about!

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.515
[ANYA] I got it out!
Now I need to hurry back!

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:30.476
[rumbling]

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:34.397
It's gone?

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.107
I never believed it till now!

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.817
But there really is a ghost
of a baby who died

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:40.778
because of a doctor's
mistake haunting us!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.406
[DOCTOR D] Uh, gentlemen,
let us continue the meeting.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:44.157
[DOCTOR E]
Good idea!

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.533
[DOCTOR D]
From now on, if a patient makes

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:49.078
any mention of a ghost,
we take it at face value!

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.958
[sighs]

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.084
[TWILIGHT]
Glad that's done.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.378
I wonder how Anya's
box turned out.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.880
[ANYA]
Papa's close by!

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:02.133
I gotta hurry up and
make something, quick!

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:05.511
[TWILIGHT]
I'm back.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.306
[ANYA] Wow, playing with
toys is so much fun!

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.640
Let's have a look.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.267
Now, you might not believe this,

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.144
but that sandbox gives
us some insight

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.022
into the deeper parts
of a patient's psyche.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:20.109
Looks like your
mind is... chaos!

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.070
This result is unprecedented!

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.030
I've never seen anything
like it before!

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.115
[ANYA]
I just dumped everything in.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.494
[TWILIGHT] Why are there so many
half-buried dolls everywhere?

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.330
[ANYA] That's 'cause,
uh, they were all defeated

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.375
by the bad guy's
Rolling Sweep Attack.

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.709
[TWILIGHT]
What on earth?

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:39.837
I have no idea what that
means, but it sounds bad.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.257
I've been so busy I didn't even
notice, but she's a disaster.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:44.967
I mean, she was dragged
out of an orphanage

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:46.052
by a complete stranger,

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:48.012
of course she'd be under
a lot of stress!

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.139
[ANYA]
Uh, Papa, I don't think--

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.265
[TWILIGHT]
I'm sure she did the best

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.393
any child could
to endure it all.

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:55.520
But to see this darkness
burst out of her now

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.480
in this morbid spectacle!

00:14:57.522 --> 00:15:00.191
No. Perhaps I just
didn't want to notice.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:03.486
This is my failure,
as a parent and a spy.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.696
I have to do something.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.573
How about we head
home for the day?

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:08.616
We can stop at a bookstore

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.910
and get you the new
<i>Spy Wars</i> volume.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.537
[ANYA]
Oh, yay.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:13.287
And after dinner,

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.915
we can spend some time
putting together your report.

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.042
Did you take good notes?

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.168
[ANYA]
Papa, wait!

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.796
[ANYA]
He'll see the spy stuff!

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:25.049
Uh! This is--

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.343
[TWILIGHT]
Illegible.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.929
[TWILIGHT]
It's, uh... Yeah.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:33.015
[ANYA] I'll get it together
and write the report myself.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.016
[TWILIGHT]
Oh, yeah?

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:37.937
Well, that's great!
Such a good girl!

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.981
[ANYA]
Mama, we're home.

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:42.150
Welcome back you two.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.067
Did you get to see Loid's

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.736
amazing concussive
therapy at work?

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:46.362
His what?

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:49.282
Yor, I assure you that is
just for extreme cases!

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:51.993
[YOR] The way he skillfully
punches and kicks his patients

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.327
is a sight to behold!

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.996
[ANYA]
Papa's a monster.

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:55.621
[BOND barks]

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.915
[TWILIGHT]
Yor, please!

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:03.254
[BOY B] And I realized I want
to work in this profession

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.797
when I grow up, too.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:05.882
The end.

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:06.757
Good show.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.176
Such an elegant report

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:11.387
that conveyed your
feelings on the career.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.599
Next up... Anya Forger.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.312
Papa's job is being
a sp-a spychiatrist,

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:20.938
or "feelings doctor."

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.982
He works very hard every day.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:26.110
He takes stomach medicine and
stays up all night researching

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.654
so his patients can
have some piece of cake.

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.281
He said he wants to
help everybody

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.116
who has had a hard time
because of the war and stuff.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.035
Wow, how noble!

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:36.996
[HENDERSON]
Yes, sounds like Loid Forger.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.248
[ANYA] In order to build
trust with his targets,

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.710
he talks to them meticuloosely
and asidduly.

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.086
[HENDERSON]
Targets?

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.672
[ANYA] Papa is very desperate
to make friends.

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:50.426
He even plays golf at work and
uses a secret escape route.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.595
Oh, and they give
you snacks there.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:55.306
[EWEN] Snacks?
Is that a codeword for bribes?

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.850
[ANYA] And apparently, he
punches and kicks his patients

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.101
every once in a while.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:02.772
[HENDERSON] Maybe I have
the wrong impression of him.

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.607
Is something the
matter, Twilight?

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:07.276
Nothing. Just a bad feeling.

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.487
[NARRATOR A] Loid was called
to the school a few days later,

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.155
but was able to
smooth things over

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.866
with his skills of persuasion.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:21.791
[BONDMAN] "Top secret," huh?
Must be another mission.

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:23.543
It's a code.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:29.131
Saturday at 0800 hours
come to the bridge.

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:35.012
[gasps]

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.640
[MYSTERIOUS MAN A] Hmm.
You actually cracked that code.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.934
You're as elite as they say.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:42.061
I'm gonna make a code, too!

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:45.231
[TWILIGHT] There she goes
playing spy again.

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.110
Hey, Anya.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.696
[ANYA]
Top secret!

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.531
[TWILIGHT] No one's going
to be able to read that,

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.992
let alone crack the code.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.872
[TWILIGHT] Her handwriting
is impossible to decipher,

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.375
even with my refined
decoding skills.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:05.668
[gasps]

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:10.631
I've got the night shift.
Make sure you study, okay?

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.181
Nothing like the smell
of fresh laundry.

00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:21.517
[ANYA]
Mama, I have a request!

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.603
Do you now? Well, what is it?

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:28.399
Could you write something for
me? Like, exactly how I say?

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:40.036
All right. Code's done!

00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:45.041
Listen well. This is a top
secret mission. Tell no one.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:49.503
I've got some mail for you.

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:52.673
Uh? Can I help you?

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:54.175
You need to put
stamps on the letters

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:56.135
and put them in
the mailbox, okay?

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:57.094
[gasps]

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.263
[ANYA]
The code has been rejected!

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.807
[YOR]
You shouldn't do that, Anya.

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:02.683
[ALL laughing]

00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:04.935
[NEIGHBOR A]
I swear, it's true!

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.437
[ALL]
Hm?

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:11.233
What the--? What's this?

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:13.653
[NEIGHBOR A] Hm? It doesn't
really say anything.

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:14.737
Is it some sort of prank?

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.405
[NEIGHBOR B] Now that
I get a good look at it,

00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:18.449
my son made something similar.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:21.410
He was copying some cartoon
about spies, I think.

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.245
Oh, that explains it, then.

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.830
[NEIGHBOR A] Seems that
precious little girl's

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.749
always pretending to be a spy.

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.751
[NEIGHBORS laughing]

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:31.545
[FRANKY] Yo. What're you doin'
out here in the hall?

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:32.630
[ANYA]
Scruffy-head.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:35.007
Loid home by any chance?

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.637
Man. Of course.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.848
Well, them's the breaks.
I'll try later.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.225
Huh?

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:49.397
And what's this?
Some kinda message from Loid?

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.607
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.901
I'm afraid it's top secret.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.820
[FRANKY]
Uh...

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.119
[BECKY]
Hey, Anya! Good morning!

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:08.999
Uh. What's this? A letter?

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.420
Okay.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:16.799
Oh, I know! Must be that quiz
everyone's talking about!

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:19.760
I'm afraid it's top secret.

00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:23.514
Jeez. Anya,
you're such a meanie.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.099
You can't just flaunt
something in my face

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.810
and never tell me what it is!

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.313
[ANYA gasps]

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.567
[ANYA]
It's top secret!

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:37.153
Huh? The heck is this?

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.408
A secret code.
Just try and crack it.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.160
So I have to do some
stupid puzzle

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:46.412
'cause you shoved
it in my face?!

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.831
That is not happening!

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:02.386
Man, I can't wait to see
who shows up tomorrow!

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.933
[ANYA]
You actually cracked that code?

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:11.395
Guess you're as elite
as everyone says.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.903
[FRANKY]
Hm? Oh, yeah, that.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.364
[FRANKY] I can tell it's
supposed to be some kinda code,

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:23.991
but, like, why?

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:28.329
Pretty nice handwriting.
Could it be from a woman?

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.749
It does smell nice!
Like good hand soap!

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:37.129
[FRANKY] Is it possible this is
some twisted love letter?

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:44.178
Be a sweetheart and give this to
that man. But don't tell anyone.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.431
This romance is
top secret, okay?

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.313
All right. It's Saturday
at eight o'clock.

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:57.608
I'm here at the bridge
just like the cipher said.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.528
[FRANKY]
Bet you thought you had me, huh?

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:03.155
But I'm the best informant
in the East and the West.

00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:05.115
Cracking a code or
two is child's play

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.827
for a man of my caliber!

00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:10.621
Though I didn't sleep a wink
because I was so excited!

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:14.041
And the morning sun wasn't
doing me any favors.

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:16.460
Crazy she'd call me
out here using a code.

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:18.796
I wonder where this agent works.

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.507
Or wait, maybe she's just
got a thing for mysteries!

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:22.800
Like, she won't
bother with a man

00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:26.720
who can't crack the code of love
and come sweep her off her feet!

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:31.767
[alarm ringing]

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.028
Afraid that's top secret.

00:24:19.124 --> 00:24:21.961
[inaudible]
