[PROPRIETRESS A]
It's not unheard of.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.495
Kids grow so quickly
at this age.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:01.455
That's true.

I get not wanting to make
a big deal about it and all,

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:12.633

at least told me

I'm sorry, it must've
just slipped my mind.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.972
And to think that your
adorable daughter

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:21.433
is going to the prestigious
Eden College.

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.185
Congrats, dear!

Thanks a crunch!

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.065
Is it safe to assume
you're an Eden College alum?

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.193
No. I attended a little
school out in the country.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.779
[PROPRIETRESS A] Oh, then you're
going to want to be careful.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.322
You could say there's
something of a wall

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.740
between the alumni families

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:39.034
and the first-generation
ones at that school.

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.952
I hear that it can
even lead to bullying

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.288
and discrimination
among the children.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.749
Plus, hazing from
the honor students.

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:49.086
Tension between the dorm
kids and commuters, too.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:52.172

lots of those commuters

But it's no surprise,

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:58.178
since most of the students
come from rich families.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.097

Don't worry, there's plenty of
fun to be had at Eden, too.

There, you're all measured.

Okay, you're getting one
uniform, a winter coat,

00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:18.031
a vest, and a sweater, so that's
three additional items.

What's this about?

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.503

out of money here?

Here's a couple more of them.
Turns out school is expensive.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.975
You've got stones to hand

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:53.103
Fine.

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:56.398
Anyway, let's review
your next steps.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.859
This'll be phase two
of Operation Strix.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.153
Though knowing you, I doubt
you need such a reminder.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.697
Thank you, but honestly,

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.491
I'm feeling a bit
off my game lately.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.910
[HANDLER] Phase two requires
a social gathering.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:12.789
Before we talk nitty-gritty,
let's revisit how Eden works.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:17.460
There are about 2500 students,
ranging from ages 6 to 19,

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.505
and the curriculum
covers all 13 years.

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.465
Academics, sports, the arts.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:25.927
They offer a top-class
education in every field.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.263
The students who manage
to distinguish themselves

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.015
amongst even their fellow elites

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.059
join the honor program
as "Imperial Scholars."

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.228
As it so happens,
the social gathering

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.230
that Desmond regularly attends

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:40.609
is only open to the families
of said Imperial Scholars.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.819
In order to gain this
honor program title,

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.406
a student must earn eight merits
known as "Stella Stars."

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.325
They're awarded for
exceptional grades

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.119
and contributions to society.

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:54.247
Which means, first off, you will
need to turn your daughter

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:55.749
into an honor student.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.251
And if that necessitates
underhanded methods,

00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.544
then so be it.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:00.754
But be careful.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.506
Those with poor grades or
exhibiting bad behavior

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.343
are given demerits,
called "Tonitrus Bolts."

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.219
When a student receives
eight of these,

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:11.932
they are immediately expelled.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:12.891
Now, let's work...

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.571
Uh-oh!

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.489
Looks like we're gonna need

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.033
to tack on some
medical bills now, too.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.202
Let's see your wallet,
Miss Nanny.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.912
I'm afraid I used all my money,

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.747
so there's nothing
of value in here.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.333
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.501
[THUG A]
Oh, yeah?

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:30.255
Guess that uniform's
our ticket after all.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.382
I hope you got
somewhere to go,

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.509
'cause her mommy's gonna
fire you so quick,

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.678
it'll make your head spin.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.766
You broke that barehanded?

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:46.563
I am that girl's mother,
do you hear me?!

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.815
If you don't wanna end up
like that vegetable,

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.025
I suggest you leave right now!

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.485
[THUGS yell]

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.446
Mama's so cool.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.448
Are you all right, my sweetie?

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.577
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have
let you out of my sight.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.579
There, there.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.331
And I've ruined
all our groceries.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.501
Look at me, I'm a
failure of a mother.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:16.259
But I love my Mama!
She's so strong and cool!

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:18.261
There, there.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.597
Super killer punch, kapow!

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.807
Uh, please don't
do that in public!

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:26.186
[ANYA]
Mama! Can you train me, please?

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.730
[YOR]
Wha--? Train you?

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.231
[ANYA]
I know it's really dangerous

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.943
to be an Eden student now,
but it won't be as scary

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.654
if I train and get
strong like you!

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.616
Then I can study really
hard and not die!

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:43.328
I wanna be just like you, Mama!

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:47.707
[YOR] Maybe I'll never be
like a normal mother...

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.375
...but I'm going to give it
everything I've got

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.960
for her sake.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:54.172
'Kay. Then let's head home
and start your training!

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.798
[ANYA]
Training!

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.845
Hey, I'm home.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.680
[YOR]
Hiyah!

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:03.681
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.225
Um. What are you doing?

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.684
Preparing her for school!

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.353
Hiyah!

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.479
[YOR]
Hiyah!

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.773
[TWILIGHT]
Yup. Feeling it again.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:12.857
[ANYA]
Hiyah!

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.698
You are, truly, the chosen few.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.700
As a result of your hard work

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.786
and the determination
of your parents,

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:28.081
you have been accepted into
Ostania's premiere academy--

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.457
Eden College.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:34.462
A feat that you select 228
new students can now claim.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.090
On behalf of my esteemed
colleagues, I say,

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:40.718
"Congratulations and
welcome to our school."

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.221
[TWILIGHT] We're finally
through Eden's door.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.765
Papa, all the kids are wearing
the same thing as me.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.601
Indeed. That's how
a uniform works.

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:52.063
[TWILIGHT] It's just the first
of many hurdles to overcome.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.148
[HANDLER] Keep in mind there
are strict requirements

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.818
to attending Desmond's
social gatherings.

00:12:56.859 --> 00:13:00.321
Most importantly, your student
must be an Imperial Scholar.

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:03.700
Meaning they have received eight
merits, or "Stella Stars."

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:06.327
Don't forget that peace
between East and West,

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:10.206
as well as our very future,
hangs in the balance.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.250
[TWILIGHT]
Turning Anya into an elite?

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.419
That's something I've
all but given up on.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.795
[ANYA gasps]

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.548
[TWILIGHT] This school only
accepts the best of the best.

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:20.174
Even if a top position
is achieved,

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.885
it will be difficult
to maintain.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.345
Next, we will
announce the houses

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.806
and their corresponding
housemasters.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:30.018
Please come forward when
your name is called.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.770
Class one, Specter Hall.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.897
William Howard.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:41.237
Theodore Russell.
Grace Fein. Jessica Clark.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.488
Now, for class two...

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.407
Which one'll take me?

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.534
I have no idea.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.619
[TWILIGHT]
Actually, that's not true.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.788
I managed to modify
the class assignments

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.752
in the hopes that would increase
the mission's chance of success.

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:58.671
I had to ensure that Anya...

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.006
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Damian Desmond.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:03.760
[TWILIGHT]
...would be in his class.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:07.722
My target, Donovan Desmond's
second son, Damian.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.558
[DAMIAN]
That's Lord Damian to you.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.311
[TWILIGHT] He'll be joining his
older brother at Eden this year.

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.645
I've been watching
him from the moment

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:17.607
I saw his name on the
list of applicants.

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.942
If plan A, the Imperial
Scholar route,

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.570
proves too difficult,
we'll go to plan B.

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.740
I call it:
"The Friendship Scheme."

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:29.202
Step one, get into his class
and become his friend.

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:32.705
Step two, get invited to his
house, with Dad in tow.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:36.084
Step three, direct contact
with the target.

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.044
It'll likely be
more complicated,

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.837
but we should be prepared.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.215
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Anya Forger.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:44.008
It's your turn.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.595
[TWILIGHT] I'm sure Anya
grew up around a lot of kids

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:50.556
during her days
at the orphanage.

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:54.394
Gives me faith in her
communication skills.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:57.438
[ANYA]
That's the bad guy boss's kid.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.856
[DAMIAN]
What's her deal?

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.109
Ha. I know.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.570
She took one look at me
and it was love at first sight.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:07.198
Well, she's got excellent taste.

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:11.953
[DAMIAN]
Playing hard to get? How cute.

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.664
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Becky Blackbell.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.291
[BECKY]
Nice to meet you!

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.293
[TWILIGHT]
Hmm... Blackbell?

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:22.755
Must be the daughter of that
major military contractor's CEO.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:26.217
Wait, and that girl's father
is the VP of parliament.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.095
And there's the son of a
prominent secret service member.

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:31.973
Her classmates are a
treasure trove of intel!

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:34.100
Anya better be friends
with all of them!

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.685
[YOR giggles]

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:38.187
[YOR] Loid gets so intense
when it comes to Anya!

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.857
My name's Becky! What's yours?

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:42.733
[BECKY]
She looks like a baby.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.652
I don't mind showin'
her the ropes.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:45.945
[ANYA gasps]

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.071
[INSTRUCTOR A]
These 29 students...

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.990
[TWILIGHT]
Don't be rude!

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:50.241
[INSTRUCTOR A]
And will be under the tutelage

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.827
of Master Henderson.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.829
Look! It's the nice one.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.956
[TWILIGHT]
Seems he kept his job.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.749
It's a bit unfair
for a housemaster

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.710
to have to teach new students,

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:03.337
but I suppose it
could've been worse.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.173
[HENDERSON] I'll whip these
rugrats into shape

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.466
like the old days.

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:07.925
[ANYA gasps]

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.010
[INSTRUCTOR A]
And now, the new students

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.596
will accompany their teachers
on a tour of the campus,

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.348
then head to their
respective classrooms.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.392
While they are getting
acquainted with the grounds,

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.060
all the parents are
cordially invited

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:21.272
to get acquainted with each
other in the lounge of Tower C.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.774
[TWILIGHT] You'll be on your
own from here on out, Anya,

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.569
so please, do your best.

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.071
[ANYA]
Okey-dokey!

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.240
[HENDERSON]
Forger! Stay in line!

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:32.116
[BECKY giggles]

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.160
Starting to worry.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:38.247
It's hard to send her off
into the world. She'll be okay.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.960
[HENDERSON]
This is the dining hall.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.129
You will be provided
the most elegant dishes

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.381
made by world-class chefs.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:50.301
A special dining hall reserved
for Imperial Scholars

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.553
lies just beyond those doors.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:55.515
Exhibit elegance in your
behavior and grades to receive

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:58.768
the eight Stella required to
become an Imperial Scholar.

00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:00.978
So you must all
do your very best.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.355
[CHILDREN]
Sir!

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:03.814
[HENDERSON]
However, be aware that those

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:06.192
who miss the mark will
receive Tonitrus Bolts

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.444
and face punishment
or expulsion.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:10.279
[ANYA]
Why's he looking at me?

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:13.491
Lord Damian's gonna be an
Imperial Scholar in no time!

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.784
I'm counting on it.

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.410
You're in, for sure!

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:19.580
I mean, my father is the head
of the National Unity Party.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:20.915
--Wait, seriously?
--[BOY B] Wow!

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.750
[GIRL A] Oh! Father says
we owe quite a bit

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:24.001
to the Desmond Group!

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:26.504
[HENDERSON]
Silence! No private chatting!

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.422
They're so dumb.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.050
[DAMIAN]
Hm.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:32.593
And what about you?

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.428
What exactly does
your father do?

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.346
If he's important,

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.766
you might just have a chance
at being my friend.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.227
[ANYA]
Gotta stay cool for the mission.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.813
A sp-- He's a feelings doctor.

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:44.855
[DAMIAN]
Hm.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.607
Sounds like a nobody to me.

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.819
You're probably not very
rich, either. Pathetic.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.737
[ANYA]
I wanna go play at your house!

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.699
No way! Why would he
want you there, ugly?

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.867
These little peasants
are getting too bold!

00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.079
We don't want your grody
peasant germs, loser!

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:04.041
[ANYA] Now is the time for me
to unleash my killer punch!

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.294
[YOR]
Listen carefully, Anya.

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.046
Anyone who lets their emotions
control their fists

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:11.299
doesn't know the meaning
of true strength.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.050
If someone's being
a little rude,

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:16.220
laughing it off makes you
the bigger, cooler girl.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.346
I'll be cool!

00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:19.098
[YOR] A smile can be
the strongest defense

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.517
against any kind of
trouble or fight.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.269
Don't just stand
there and take it!

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.688
At least call him
dumb or something.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.314
[ANYA]
Heh.

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.524
I don't care what
you have to say.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.984
[DAMIAN]
Huh?

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.987
[ANYA]
Heh.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:34.614
[DAMIAN]
What's with that smirk?

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:37.158
How dare she mock me like this!

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.951
[BECKY]
Look at that composure!

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.913
She's not a baby after all.
She's cool and mature!

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:43.914
[BECKY]
Wow!

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:46.250
I'm super impressed at
how grown up you are!

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.045
I'm a grown-up?

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.880
[gasps]

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:52.673
[ANYA]
Heh.

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:55.009
[DAMIAN grunting]

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:58.471
[DAMIAN] Don't get cocky,
you dumb ugly... uggo!

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:01.891
Lord Damian, please
broaden your vocabulary.

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:02.767
For real?

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.185
She may be uglier than me,

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:06.145
but you don't have to
be so rude about it.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:07.521
[DAMIAN]
Shut up!

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.815
You! Must I repeat myself?

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:12.526
You can be punished
on your first day!

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:15.488
[DAMIAN] You brat. You'll pay
for embarrassing me.

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:17.365
Watch your back!

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:21.369
[ANYA] Mama's a liar.
Smiling didn't help one bit.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.376
--[DAMIAN whistling]
--[EWEN, EMILE chuckling]

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:31.587
If you don't stop it right now,
I'm gonna tell the teacher!

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.714
There's no proof
that we did anything.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:35.424
[EWEN, EMILE]
Nope, no proof!

00:19:35.466 --> 00:19:37.843
Just get outta my way.

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.137
Listen, uggo!

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.599
Every day I'll make it
my mission to bully you.

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:44.767
When I'm through with you,

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.311
you're never gonna
smirk like that again.

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:49.897
If she cries, maybe her
"feelings doctor" daddy

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:50.731
can fix her!

00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:53.734
[DAMIAN]
Ha! That's a good one!

00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.486
Daddy's widdle baby!

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.905
[BOYS laughing]

00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:01.409
Hey, look at me, uggo!
Or are you scared?

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.743
Huh?

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.004
[HENDERSON]
What's going on?

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:17.133
Teacher! This girl just
punched Lord Damian, sir!

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.092
[ANYA gasps]

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:20.428
I stuck out my hand
and he just ran into it.

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:23.639
Don't lie! No one would ever
believe that stupid story!

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.933
Yeah! You even made sure
the teacher wasn't looking

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:26.976
before you hit him!

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:29.103
There's no proof
that I did anything.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.479
We can all see your fist mark

00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:32.982
right there on his
face, you know?

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:36.694
Surely you're aware lying
is extremely inelegant.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:39.321
Anya Forger.

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.365
[BECKY] But, sir,
that's not what happened.

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:45.953
She was holding back all day,
but these bullies went too far.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.205
[HENDERSON]
So it's true that you hit him?

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.249
[grunts]

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.710
[YOR]
This is very important, Anya.

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.879
Never use force, okay?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.130
Unless it's, like,

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:59.842
a situation where you have
to save a friend in trouble.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:04.680
[ANYA]
I-I was saving her.

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:09.435
He stepped on her foot,
and that made me really angry.

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.103
I'm so sorry.

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:12.688
[BECKY gasps]

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.526
[BECKY] She did that
for me? How sweet!

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:21.113
[HENDERSON] She showed restraint
in regards to her own abuse,

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:24.575
as well as the courage to
defend a friend in need.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:30.289
Truly elegant, Anya Forger.
However, I'm afraid...

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:34.168
[TWILIGHT] It seems the Desmonds
never even showed up.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.712
Well, no need to rush things.

00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:40.007
Now that she's enrolled at
Eden, we have ample time.

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:42.009
And I was able to make
a few connections.

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:44.553
...please head toward the
courtyard to greet them.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:46.931
Now gather round so we can
take our group photo.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.349
Where's Anya?

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.768
[HENDERSON]
Forger, a moment.

00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:54.271
[TWILIGHT]
She punched a boy?

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.189
He didn't hurt you, did he?

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:58.317
[TWILIGHT] And of course,
it had to be Desmonds' son.

00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.151
Who else?

00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:01.237
...would result in three
Tonitrus Bolts.

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:03.989
But it became one,
with my discretion.

00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:07.117
That was truly the
best I could do.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.953
I am so sorry, Loid!

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:11.121
I think it's because of
the way I trained her.

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:11.914
And of course,

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:15.125
I'll have to have a word
with his parents as well.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:16.418
[TWILIGHT]
It's the first day of school

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.546
and she's already lost a point.

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:22.758
And her relationship with Damian
may prove unsalvageable.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.427
All right, everyone,
we're almost ready!

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.096
Now, the family on
the right over there?

00:22:27.137 --> 00:22:30.724
I need you to smile!
Say, "Cheese"!

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.624
[inaudible]
