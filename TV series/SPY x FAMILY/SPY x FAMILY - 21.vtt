00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:15.307
[SYLVIA] Regarding Twilight's
mission next week.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.519
[SYLVIA]
To cover all our bases,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.646
we're assigning
you to it as well.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:24.274
As proposed, it is now
a joint operation.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:28.195
[SYLVIA]
Don't let us down.

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:29.780
[FIONA]
Yes, ma'am.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:33.242
[NARRATOR] Fiona Frost, a clerk
at Berlint General Hospital.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.744
Her true identity, a WISE agent.

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.163
Relay the update
to Twilight as well.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.958
You two can work out your
plan of attack together.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:41.917
[FIONA]
Yes, ma'am.

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:45.087
Make sure none of this gets
in the way of Operation Strix.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.422
This comes second.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.883
[FIONA]
How is Strix progressing?

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.301
[SYLVIA]
Slow and steady.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:55.138
But it was always expected
to be a long-term plan.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.015
I must apologize.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.893
If only I'd been available
when the mission started.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.939
I could've supported Agent
Twilight by playing his wife.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:06.984
Though perhaps
it's not too late.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.110
[SYLVIA]
It is.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:11.822
Eden will find it suspicious
if he suddenly remarries.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.282
Plus, his current
wife is a local,

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:16.118
so that has its own advantages.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.537
The family will stay as is.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.915
Don't get distracted from the
mission you've been assigned.

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:24.793
But if the Forger wife just
happened to abandon the role,

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.045
then we'd have no choice.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.046
[SYLVIA]
Hm?

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.465
Don't go getting any
ideas, understand?

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.093
Excuse me.

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.511
[SYLVIA]
Hey!

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:41.977
Damn scary.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.894
You hear that?

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.314
She's trying to insert
herself into Twilight's op

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:47.316
to steal the glory
and get ahead.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:50.777
She'd stab anyone in the back
to make a name for herself.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.404
[NARRATOR]
They call her ruthless,

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.531
cold-blooded, and brazen.

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:56.700
She pursues her missions
with a face of stone,

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:59.870
showing no hint of emotion.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:05.917
Codename: Nightfall.
A woman driven by ambition.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.602
[sighs]

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.354
I keep thinking I'll
nail breakfast,

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.690
and then keep screwing it up.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.158
[TWILIGHT]
Uh...

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.160
Which leads to Loid making
lunch for us again

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.912
because I'm such a failure.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.707
I need to figure out how to make
something other than stew.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.250
[doorbell rings]

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.421
[YOR]
I wonder who that is.

00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:16.089
Coming!

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:26.141
Hello. And who might you be?

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.350
[FIONA]
I beg your pardon.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.311
I'm a colleague
of Doctor Forger's.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.480
My name is Fiona Frost.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.607
Oh, you work with Loid.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:36.568
I'm sorry. My husband
is out walking our dog

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.196
with our daughter at the moment.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.489
[FIONA]
Is he?

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.575
[FIONA] Yes, I'm well aware.
That's why I'm here.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.076
Your daughter left
something behind

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.871
when she came to visit the
hospital the other day.

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:49.790
I wanted to return it.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.042
[YOR]
Oh, her magnifying glass.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.086
Thank you, this is
very thoughtful.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.423
Uh, since you came
all this way,

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.967
why don't you wait
for him inside?

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.179
Well, if you insist,
I won't say no.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:08.683
[YOR]
Here you go.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.477
Thank you.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.616
[YOR]
Wow. She's so beautiful.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:25.951
Yes, what is it?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.202
Nothing!

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.162
[FIONA]
Your home is quite lovely.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:29.913
[FIONA]
What, does she think

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.249
I'm her husband's mistress
or something?

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.001
Though I suppose I do plan
to steal the role of his wife,

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:37.003
so she's not entirely wrong.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.965
The decorating was
my hu-my husband.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.466
[FIONA]
Yor Briar.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.426
If you're delaying
Operation Strix,

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.471
I'll personally see to
it you're disposed of.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:49.599
But with the skill with which
this woman carries herself,

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.560
I may never find an opening.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.478
[YOR]
Outside of Yuri and Franky,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.897
this is the first guest
we've had over.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.774
I'm so nervous!

00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:01.319
I'm a housewife.
A regular housewife.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.196
[FIONA] Attempting to take
care of her myself

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.532
would be too risky anyway.

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:09.452
Far better to make her leave
this house of her own volition.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.249
[FIONA]
Your daughter, Anya, was it?

00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:17.502
She seems rather lively.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:21.131
Yes, if nothing else,
she's always a bundle of energy!

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.799
That must be quite difficult.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.844
Raising a child like
that can be exhausting.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.138
[FIONA] After all, she's
only your stepdaughter.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:31.725
You could free yourself of that
burden whenever you wanted.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.561
Difficult, huh?
Why would you say that?

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:37.230
I love that she's so
energetic all the time.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.232
Now, if she were down in
the dumps around the clock,

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.276
that would be a real challenge.

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.360
I'm lucky that the two of us

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.946
are able to have so
much fun together.

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:48.074
[FIONA] Hm. So she sees
herself as the girl's mother.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:51.745
Well, actually, parenthood does
seem a bit challenging for Loid,

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.581
considering everything
he has to do for work.

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:57.500
And around the house
because of me.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:58.752
[FIONA]
Exactly.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.129
You need to acknowledge
your inadequacy.

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:04.174
You aren't fit for this mission.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.469
Oh, right, that. Well,
since you brought it up.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.971
I often hear Doctor
Forger complain.

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:11.932
Something about
his wife always--

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.934
We have returned safely!

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.226
[BOND barks]

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.103
Welcome back!

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.440
[TWILIGHT]
Oh.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:23.109
Hi, Fiona. What are
you doing here?

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.153
Hello, Doctor. Good to see you.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.447
[FIONA]
I thought I had more time.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:28.823
[YOR]
She came by to return something

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.618
that you left behind
at the hospital.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.620
Yay, my magnifying glass!

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.789
I see. Well, thank you.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.499
[TWILIGHT] She came all
the way to my home?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.959
Is there an emergency?

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:41.419
That wasn't a very
long walk, was it?

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.671
[TWILIGHT] It was starting
to look like rain,

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.882
so we cut it short.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.885
You could've just
given me this at work.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.472
I was out running a few errands,
and it was on the way.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.893
[ANYA]
Whoa, this lady's a spy, too?

00:07:56.935 --> 00:08:00.188
I see. The local supermarket?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.648
[TWILIGHT]
What is she up to?

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.735
Agents are supposed to avoid
unnecessary contact.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:09.781
Yes, that's correct.
Their onions were on sale.

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:14.369
Oh, I had no idea!
Maybe I should go pick some up!

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.662
[FIONA] They've also
got their pumpkins

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.288
and pasta at a discount.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.624
There was a long line
at the register.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.836
[TWILIGHT] I recommend
their shrimp. It's good.

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.879
[FIONA] I must have never
told you this, Doctor,

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.799
but I'm actually
allergic to shrimp.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:34.264
[inaudible]

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:37.809
[ANYA] I think Papa and
this new lady are fighting.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:42.647
Is she a bad guy spy?
Her face is scary.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.984
[FIONA]
Agent Twilight.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.527
I love you.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:48.903
[ANYA]
Huh?

00:08:54.117 --> 00:09:03.960
[FIONA]
I love you!

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.305
[TWILIGHT] Mmm!
This is delicious, Nightfall!

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:16.848
I'm glad to hear it.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.600
[TWILIGHT] You can even
cook and do laundry?

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.060
You're just the best!

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.269
[FIONA]
You flatter me.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.688
Oh, Twilight, here are my
earnings for the month.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.273
Use them however you'd like.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.816
[TWILIGHT]
Nightfall, you're just--!

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.777
[FIONA] Oh, I've also
extensively researched

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:30.236
your enemies
for your next mission.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.113
What kind of weapons they
use, their names, ages,

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.698
and even how many gray
hairs they have!

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.367
Absolutely incredible
as always, Nightfall!

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.495
How perfect can you be?

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.789
I don't need that dimwit
of a wife anymore.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.664
[YOR crying]

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:46.169
For the sake of world peace,
let's get married, Nightfall.

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:47.629
Oh, dear Twilight!

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.840
I'm all yours, and not
just for the mission!

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.472
[NARRATOR]
Codename: Nightfall.

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.390
A woman driven by ambition.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:02.602
Specifically, to marry Twilight.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.062
[FIONA]
I'm far more qualified

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.563
to be his wife than her.

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.232
I'd give him all the
support he needed,

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.984
both on his missions
and at home!

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.904
We would honeymoon on a
romantic, tropical island.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.073
[TWILIGHT]
What is she thinking?

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:15.990
[YOR]
Oh!

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.992
How about I pour us
all some coffee?

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.662
Would you like a cup
of hot cocoa, Anya?

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.997
Anya, are you okay?

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.230
Well, since you brought it up.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.732
I often hear Doctor
Forger complain.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.360
Something about
his wife always--

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.904
She's just always so
clumsy and useless.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.157
Maybe I'll report her
to the authorities.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.534
Hey, Fiona, wanna be
my wife instead?

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:00.910
Wait, are you serious?

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.955
Sure, I guess I could
come over sometime.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.546
[YOR] But even if he does
feel that way about me

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:15.967
and wants me gone,
I can't exactly blame him.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:19.429
I can't even make breakfast
without burning it.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:22.807
[YOR]
Here you go.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.934
Cocoa time!

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.728
I got milk if anyone needs it.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.605
Great, I appreciate that.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:31.566
[FIONA] Hmph. Twilight
prefers his coffee black.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.611
I've never seen him add a drop
of milk in my entire life.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.362
You've been playing his
wife this whole time

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.323
and you didn't even notice?

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.075
Pathetic. It should be me.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.620
What? That's impossible.

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.289
Could family life have
changed Twilight's tastes?

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.458
Does that mean there's a side
of him I don't know about?

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:51.127
A side he only shows this woman?

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.587
Oh, I see.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:55.215
This is just part of his
"Loid Forger" character.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.716
He's so committed
to his performance

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.134
that he lets his circumstances

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.220
affect his food and
drink preferences!

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.180
It only makes me love him more.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.556
[TWILIGHT]
Hopefully the milk will lessen

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.892
the damage to my stomach.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.938
Actually, maybe I should ask her
to make me decaf going forward.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.357
[ANYA]
This lady is crazy.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.149
[ANYA]
Uh.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:14.400
Hey, be careful!

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.069
[YOR]
Are you all right, Anya?

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.403
You didn't get burnt, did you?

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.447
I'm sorry. I made a mess.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.908
[FIONA]
Hmph. What a careless child.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.701
If Twilight had
properly trained her,

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.245
she would've been able
to catch the cup

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.039
well before it hit the
table and spilled.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.708
But he's far too busy fixing
their mistakes for that.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.793
Stay back, Bond!

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:36.381
Don't you dare lick that up.
It's poison to you, understand?

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.966
[FIONA]
In that case.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.510
It falls upon the wife to
raise a strong daughter.

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:45.431
But this woman won't even scold
the child, much less train her.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.183
If I were her mother,

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.435
I'd manage her schedule
by the minute.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:53.523
I'd whip that girl into shape,
both physically and mentally.

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:55.358
I could turn her into
a Stella-winning machine

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.610
in but a month's time.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.031
[ANYA] I definitely do
not want this mama!

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.284
Cocoa does have some
nutritional properties,

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.785
so this was a good choice.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.161
[ANYA gasps]

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.540
[YOR]
Uh?

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.332
[ANYA]
Uh.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:14.877
Oh, Mama, sometimes I
just love you so much!

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.880
[YOR] Huh? Where's this coming
from all of a sudden?

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.841
The way you cleaned
up my hot cocoa

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:22.427
shows you're the best
mama in the whole world!

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.971
[YOR]
Anya!

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.848
[TWILIGHT]
What kind of reason is that?

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.892
[FIONA] Hmph. I can be
loving, too, you know.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:33.271
[FIONA] Oh, Anya. I have some
delicious, imported cocoa.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.856
Want me to bring it next time?

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.399
[yells]

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:37.650
[FIONA]
My word.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.444
Sorry about that,
maybe she's nervous

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.112
because you've only just met.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:45.325
Anya, why don't you go
play with Bond somewhere?

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.578
[ANYA] My mama and papa
get along so good!

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.997
And I got Bond here, too!

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.959
I'm so lucky I get to be the
daughter of the Forger family!

00:13:55.001 --> 00:14:00.214
Oh, boy, I'm just so happy.
For real. Not lying.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.595
Listen, Loid, I'm gonna
try even harder!

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:08.139
I'll do everything I possibly
can for this family!

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:12.268
I'll clean up all the hot cocoa!
I swear, okay?

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.853
Huh? Okay.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.104
[FIONA] You should be
teaching the girl

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:16.814
not to spill anything at all.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.191
It should be me.

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:19.859
[TWILIGHT chuckles]

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.820
You already work
hard enough, Yor.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.864
That's why Anya
loves you so much.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:29.118
Seriously, I couldn't ask
you for anything more.

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:32.789
Do you mean that?

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.168
I'll try to be better!

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.254
I just said you're fine
as you are, silly.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.883
[FIONA]
Look at that fake smile.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.510
[TWILIGHT]
Listen, Nightfall.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.639
A spy must never show their true
feelings, no matter what.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.765
Understood, Twilight.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.976
Kill your emotions.
Show no weakness.

00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.853
[FIONA]
Understood, Twilight.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.272
I'll strive to have a
poker face for all my life.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.734
You mean... on missions.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.903
[FIONA]
Lionel in national defense.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.822
Lawrence in the black market.

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.324
Robert, a government
official's attache.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:13.246
I've seen Twilight in countless
roles over the years.

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:17.083
I know that masterful
fake smile of his.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.465
[FIONA] But there's a hint of
real emotion beneath this one.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.935
[FIONA] Oh, I just realized
I forgot to buy those potatoes

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.854
I meant to get.

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.523
I should probably take my leave.

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.692
[YOR] Uh, you're more
than welcome to wait

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:43.651
until the rain dies down--

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.403
[FIONA]
Excuse me.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.990
[ANYA]
She left.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.368
[sighs]

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:59.917
I didn't see an umbrella on her.
I'll walk her to the station.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.210
[YOR]
That's a good idea.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:04.046
Be careful! See you
in a little bit.

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.771
[TWILIGHT]
Hey, Fiona!

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:23.816
[TWILIGHT]
Want this?

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.611
[FIONA]
Good timing.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:29.280
There's something I forgot
to tell you back there.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.949
For your next mission,
you require a partner,

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.368
so Handler has assigned
me to accompany you.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.579
[TWILIGHT] Uh. How could you
forget to mention that?

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.789
It should be top priority.

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.463
Are you okay?

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:51.344
[FIONA]
I'm glad it's raining right now.

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:53.513
[TWILIGHT]
Nightfall?

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:54.597
[FIONA]
I'll hide these feelings

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.682
for as long as it takes.

00:16:56.724 --> 00:17:00.061
[FIONA] I'll brief you on
the details at the hospital.

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:03.564
[FIONA]
Because that's what spies do.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:07.401
Because that's what
you taught me to do.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:11.572
I have to--until
this cold war ends.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.449
But for now...

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:18.913
[FIONA]
Twilight.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.541
[FIONA] Even being your fake
wife would be enough,

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.751
as long as I'm with you.

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.963
[FIONA] Playing house for
so long has made you soft.

00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.339
[FIONA]
On our next mission,

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:31.551
I'll show you just how
capable I really am.

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:35.429
So try not to hold me back
on our next operation.

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:38.432
[FIONA] I'll make you realize
that I'm the only one

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.017
fit to be your wife.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.061
No one else.

Okie.

I don't know about surveying
the enemy base, captain.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.012
Could be dangerous!

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:43.432

kinda looks like you.

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:58.007
[BOND]
Penguin bad. Stole Anya.

00:20:58.048 --> 00:21:01.427
[ANYA]
So it was you, Bond!

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:02.261
How dare you!

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:04.805
[TWILIGHT]
Calm down!

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:08.851
I can't believe you,
Bond! I hate you!

00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:18.110
[YOR]
Aww, poor Anya. Don't worry.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.989
I'll sew him right up
and make him all better.

00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:25.201
[ANYA]
My penguin will be alive again?

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.873
Wait, what?
Why's his head detached?

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:31.832
It wasn't like that earlier!

00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:34.877
What happened to him?!
He's even deader than before!

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:36.712
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:38.214
It's okay, Anya.

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:40.382
I can always just buy
a new one for you.

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:45.137
Nuh-uh! This Mister Penguin's
special; he's important to me!

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:48.724
You gave him to me,
Papa. I want him!

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:51.519
[TWILIGHT] All right.
I'll fix him up, then.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.688
Go eat something and maybe
do so some homework.

00:22:20.214 --> 00:22:21.590
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:26.887
[ANYA crying]

00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:29.640
[knocking]

00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:30.975
[TWILIGHT]
He's all better, Anya.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.476
[ANYA gasps]

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:38.274
[ANYA] He looks kind
of Frankenstein-y.

00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:40.985
[TWILIGHT]
Yeah, couldn't avoid that.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:45.239
Um. Scars are like
medals of valor.

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:48.450
Sure, Agent Penguin got hurt,
but they're honorable injuries

00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:50.661
he received in the line of duty.

00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:52.454
Whoa, medals?

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:56.041
[TWILIGHT] Yup. His scars are
nothing to be ashamed of.

00:22:58.127 --> 00:23:01.005
Evil Bond! What do
you want from us?

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:05.384
[ANYA]
Huh? Peanuts?

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:11.056
[ANYA]
Are you saying sorry to me?

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:15.436
I think he wants
you to forgive him.

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:18.230
How 'bout it? Remember
what Bondman said?

00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:21.525
"Yesterday's enemy is
today's ally," right?

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:24.194
[ANYA]
That's from episode 18!

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.413
[ANYA] Um, I was really
hurt pretty bad,

00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:36.624
but I'm willing to
call a cease-fire

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:40.502
on behalf of your generous
gift of these truce peanuts.

00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:47.092
Also... I'm sorry I said
I hate you. I didn't mean it.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.763
[ANYA yelps]

00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:54.558
[ANYA laughing]

00:23:58.145 --> 00:24:01.482
With this, the peace
treaty's officially signed!

00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:08.155
[ANYA laughing]

00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:09.657
[TWILIGHT] I wish things
could be this easy

00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:12.076
for the East and West.

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:20.125
