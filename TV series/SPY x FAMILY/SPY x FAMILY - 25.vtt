00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.778
[STATE SECURITY A] Pardon me.
ID and invitation, sir.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.532
Ah, Mister Hamilton.
Please go on ahead.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.750
[NARRATOR] Eden College's
premiere social gathering.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.169
A traditional get-together
held every half-term,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.546
open only to Imperial
Scholars, their parents,

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:11.423
and a handful of alumni.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.050
Effectively, a meeting
of the nation's

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.594
political and financial leaders,
prominent scholars,

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.055
engineers, artists,
and athletes.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:21.058
The lineup is always impressive.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.395
[ATTENDEE A] The security is
as intense as ever this year.

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:28.106
To be fair, there's a lot
of VIPs in attendance.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.941
But having the State
Security Service here

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.778
does make me a little nervous.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.945
[TWILIGHT]
The security is on par

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.697
with that of a summit meeting.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.533
I'm prepared of course,
but it is a bit of a shock.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.243
This'll be difficult.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.870
It would be a simple mission
if it weren't for

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.623
the whole Imperial
Scholar prerequisite.

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.708
But there's no point
in thinking about that.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.626
If we were that lucky,

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:51.546
we wouldn't need Operation
Strix in the first place.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:52.756
Every infiltration attempt

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:55.717
by Western agents
so far has failed.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.720
And the more that happens,
the tighter security gets.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.598
It's a moving target.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.226
The venue is the
Tower of Wisdom.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.185
One door in the front

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.771
and a handful of fixed
windows throughout.

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:08.980
There's a garden on the roof,

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.024
but any attempt to slip
through from above

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.818
would draw too much attention.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.530
No viable ways in
from below, either.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.282
At the lone entrance they do
a thorough identity check,

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.867
pat you down,
and pass you through

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.370
a cutting-edge
security detector.

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:25.580
Which rules out any
attempt to wear a disguise

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.250
or plant a listening
device on someone.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.627
And since none of the nearby
buildings are taller,

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.505
there's no vantage
point for reading lips.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.717
Perhaps there's a way to sneak
into the building days ahead.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.927
No, that would pose
quite a risk, too.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.722
Is there no way to get inside?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.515
Well, with a little
bit of force,

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.976
I can make my way
into most anywhere.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.853
But it would only work once.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.813
If my mission were to
assassinate Desmond,

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:52.524
that would be an option
worth considering.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.192
But the purpose
of Operation Strix

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.528
is continuous
interactions with him--

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.906
to get into his good graces
and extract information.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.117
Even if I cleared all hurdles,

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.121
posing as someone else
could be disastrous.

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.289
[DONOVAN]
Well, hello again.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.083
Uh. I actually wasn't
here last time.

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.419
[TWILIGHT] Famous people
would be easy to trace.

00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.672
And children are
surprisingly perceptive.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.966
You're so weird today, Papa!

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.469
[TWILIGHT] And if I went
as school staff or a waiter,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.471
I wouldn't even be
able to speak to him.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.390
I can't do anything
to arouse suspicion.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.058
Desmond is extremely cautious,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.145
so there's a possibility
he'd never attend again.

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.022
Looks like my best bet
is to interact with him

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.523
as Loid Forger.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:37.319
All I can do for now is make
preparations for next time.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.820
There will rarely
ever be a chance

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.281
to encounter Desmond
outside the tower,

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.825
but I'll look into
any possibilities.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.414
[MATH INSTRUCTOR A] And with
that, class is over for today.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.500
Remember, the social
gathering is this evening,

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.043
so the school will be closed.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.377
Any students who
are not attending

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.505
should leave immediately.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.257
I wonder what it's like.
Someday I wanna go, too!

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.927
I heard all kinds of
celebrities show up.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.763
Apparently, the cosmonaut
Yachayka is giving a speech!

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:06.223
That actress Amy, too.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.141
Whoa, are you serious?

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.435
Hey, Damian! Isn't
your dad a big deal?

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:11.520
Is he gonna be there?

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.606
Plus your older brother's
an Imperial Scholar, right?

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.317
It's so nice we only
have a half-day today.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.778
Uh, Earth to Damian.

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.451
[DAMIAN] This is Damian
Desmond from Cecile Hall.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:30.038
Could you connect me to
Demetrius Desmond please?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:32.874
[DEMETRIUS]
What?

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.960
[DAMIAN]
H-Hey, Bro.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.127
[DEMETRIUS]
What do you want?

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.839
[DAMIAN]
Uh, sorry. It's about tomorrow.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.132
You're going to the
social gathering, right?

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.759
[DEMETRIUS]
Yeah.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:43.927
[DAMIAN]
When you see Father,

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.346
could you tell him I was hoping
I could meet with him?

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:50.058
Like, after the event,
even if it's just for a minute.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.645
I'll be waiting in the
courtyard of Library Two.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.398
[DEMETRIUS] I'll tell him,
but don't get your hopes up.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.400
Father's busy.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:00.485
[DAMIAN]
Yeah.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.153
[DEMETRIUS]
Is that all?

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:02.988
[DAMIAN]
Yeah.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.240
[DEMETRIUS]
All right. Bye.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.122
[GIRL H] Hey, can you
introduce me to your father?

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.165
My father's gonna pick
me up today, too,

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.584
so they can meet, 'kay?

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.254
What? No fair.
Hey, Damian, let me come, too!

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:22.674
Leave me alone.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.093
[EWEN]
Lord Damian!

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:28.555
[ANYA] Is the Second Son gonna
meet with the evil boss today?

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:31.850
Hey, want to use this
time to go shopping?

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:32.726
[ANYA]
Okay.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:36.938
Didn't win him over with
fashion, so new plan!

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.943
[ANYA] If you meet my papa,
good stuff'll happen.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.069
[ANYA]
Oh?

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.906
[ANYA] I'll follow him and
fight the evil boss myself.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.450
You've been even weirder
than normal this week!

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.201
You sure know how
to creep a guy out!

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.286
Stop following me!

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:52.704
Hold on, Lord Damian.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.581
You think she's after
you for something?

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:56.458
Uh. How do you mean?

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.751
Perhaps she wants to use you

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.586
to get in your
father's good graces.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:00.587
[DAMIAN gasps]

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.590
Yeah! She's no different
than those other idiots!

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:07.010
You're such a stupid uggo!
Grow some legs, uggo!

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.428
Well, that's rude.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.725
Don't ever come near me again!
You creepy gorilla-stalker-girl!

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.227
Okay, I think I should
pro'ly punch him again.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.813
Great idea if you're
trying to get expelled.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.523
[TWILIGHT] I was afraid she
still wasn't getting along

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:21.483
with Damian.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.193
Plan B might be in trouble, too.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.945
[ANYA]
Uh! Papa?

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.863
[TWILIGHT] Or is that her trying
to make friends with him

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.157
in her own strange little way?

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.825
I can appreciate that.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.327
Anyhow, I need to
go follow Damian

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.828
in case he runs into his father.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.457
[ANYA] Ah! Wait for me! We can
fight the evil boss together!

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:41.086
What? Let's go home!

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.421
Hey, are you going to
the meeting spot already?

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.466
Your father won't be there until
after the social gathering.

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.426
That won't be for a few hours.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.429
[TWILIGHT] So he is meeting
with his father. Excellent.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.222
[EMILE]
Since we're here,

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:55.266
should we get closer to the
venue and check it out?

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:07.028
Whoa. Kinda intimidating, huh?

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.782
So many Imperial Scholars!
I hope I don't pee my pants.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:11.783
[EMILE]
And just think!

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:15.328
Even among all these VIPs, your
dad is like, super important!

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.998
Which means you are, too,
since you're his son!

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.666
Is something the matter?

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:22.002
I'm gonna tell Father
not to bother coming.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.128
[EWEN, EMILE gasp]

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.255
[TWILIGHT]
What? That's not good!

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:28.675
[DAMIAN] You're right, my
father's amazing. And busy.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.302
He doesn't have time to
waste on people like me.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:35.515
I'll call my brother,
tell him to cancel the meetup.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.308
[ANYA]
Not happening!

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.771
[DAMIAN] Thought I told
you to get lost, stalker!

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:45.066
I know you're scared.
Don't try to deny it.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.985
[DAMIAN grunts]

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.153
[DAMIAN]
What's with her?

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.363
Is she reading my
mind or something?

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.783
[gasps] Uh, I mean that
you're scared 'cause, uh,

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.994
because I know that you
only got 50 points

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.121
on the last language
test we took.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.831
[DAMIAN]
What? How'd you know that?

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.833
Wait, that has nothing
to do with this.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:02.667
[ANYA chuckles]

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.294
[ANYA]
I peeked over your shoulder.

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.672
[BECKY] She's starting to
exhibit actual stalker behavior.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.424
You're scared that your
dad's gonna find out

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.468
how bad you did on
your test, right?

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.554
I totally understand 'cause
I only got 17 points on it.

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.598
[DAMIAN] Those are very
different grades!

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.975
[ANYA] I don't really know
if my papa likes me or not,

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.061
so I'm a little scared, too.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.437
He always gets mad at me.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.730
[TWILIGHT]
Anya.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:27.358
[ANYA] But... I believe in him,
because I love him.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.277
And so...

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.071
I always show him
all of my tests,

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:34.074
even if I did really,
really bad.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.996
What were we talking about?

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.123
Uhh...

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:42.707
Damn it!

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.626
Lord Damian,
where are you going?

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:46.628
[DAMIAN]
This is dumb.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.546
[DAMIAN] I'm gonna wait for
Father in the courtyard.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.756
[EMILE]
You changed your mind?

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.299
[DAMIAN]
Well, I'm not scared!

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.884
[ANYA]
Hmph.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.219
[TWILIGHT] I'm not quite
sure what happened,

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.054
but well done, Anya!

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.431
Whatever you did worked
out in my favor!

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.442
Huh? You're waiting? Why?

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:13.154
My car's already here;
let's go home!

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.073
[BECKY] Wait, is she planning
to meet his parents

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.200
because she wants
to marry him someday?

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:20.954
You're really serious
about this. Good on you!

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.748
All right, Anya.
Then I'll wait here with you!

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:27.168
I wanna see the big moment
with my own eyes!

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:30.505
[BECKY]
Guess I was wrong.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.590
She's not serious
about this at all.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.802
Martha, carry Anya to the
car. We're going home.

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.596
Yes, that seems wise.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.224
Maybe Anya's too much
of a free spirit.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.226
Oh, goodbye, sir!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.311
[TWILIGHT]
Yes, have a good one.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.438
[BECKY]
Anyway, she was being so silly!

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.525
[TWILIGHT] I'm glad I thought
to make this replica.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.823
[TWILIGHT]
Looks like it's over.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:11:00.201
Now I know the security layout,
their equipment, and protocol.

00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:04.038
Definitely worth it. Next up...

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.249
Yup. That's Desmond.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.668
Let's see, where's he headed?

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.920
Got it.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.964
[EWEN]
I wonder if they're almost done.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.091
[DAMIAN]
Hmm...

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.513
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:23.266
But have you boys seen
a sheep key chain around?

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.560
Apparently, my daughter
loves that thing.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.645
But she thinks she
dropped it nearby.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.439
She begged me to
come look for it.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.901
Oh, is this it?
It was on the ground.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.277
[TWILIGHT]
Yup, that's it!

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.361
Thank you, you're a lifesaver!

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.906
Wait, isn't that her key chain?

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.617
Hey, old man, are you
Anya Forger's dad?

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:41.618
[TWILIGHT]
"Old man"?

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:42.911
I am.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.496
Oh, you must be her
classmates, then.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.498
Hold on, sorry if I'm wrong,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.542
but would you happen
to be Damian Desmond?

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.212
Yep. That's me.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.631
I'm so terribly sorry!

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:58.551
I feel horrible for what my
daughter did at orientation.

00:11:58.593 --> 00:11:59.802
[DAMIAN]
Uh, okay.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.387
[TWILIGHT] I went to your
house to apologize,

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.264
but you and your parents
must have been out.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.642
It's been on my mind
all this time.

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:08.019
[DAMIAN] I mean,
I live in the dorms.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.230
[TWILIGHT] I'm responsible
for my daughter's rudeness,

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.689
so I'm truly sorry.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.399
Uh, it's fine.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.527
[TWILIGHT] I would still like
to apologize to your parents.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:19.530
[EMILE] Speaking of,
your dad's over there!

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.824
[TWILIGHT]
I'm sorry to do this, Damian.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.243
But for the sake of my mission,

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:27.163
I'll be crashing your reunion
with Papa for a bit.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.251
Father, you're--

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.211
[BODYGUARD A] Young Master,
who is that man?

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.381
Uh. Oh, he's my classmate's dad.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.757
[TWILIGHT]
Um, hello.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.134
You must be Chairman
Desmond, then.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.804
Please, step back.
You need to leave.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:46.975
It's fine. What's on your mind?

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:48.393
I've been meaning to apologize

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:50.770
for my daughter's rudeness
toward your son.

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.814
I've reprimanded
her for it since.

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:57.026
Oh, I skipped introductions.
Let's fix that.

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:01.197
My name is Loid Forger.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.872
[WISE AGENT A]
Council Secretary Byron,

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.958
Colonel McNeill of
the national army,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.836
Prosecutor Farnham,
Cosmonaut Yachayka.

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.963
Even the Chairman of
the National Unity Party

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.424
Donovan Desmond is there!

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.134
This private school
social gathering

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:23.678
is a gold mine of intelligence!

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.805
I know Twilight's
amazing and everything,

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:28.558
but shouldn't we be sending
him some kinda backup?

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.852
[SYLVIA]
Well, do you want to go?

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.688
Set foot in that building and
the State Security Service

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.691
will be all over you
in five minutes.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.651
And they'll be torturing
information out of you

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.945
in a back room in 30.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.324
Sending inexperienced agents

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.993
would be like serving them
up on a silver platter.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:50.872
Don't forget, we're right in
the middle of enemy territory.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:55.543
Right now, that school is the
front line of this cold war.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.212
It's a pleasure.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.506
I'm a doctor at a Berlint
Central Hospital.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:03.259
And again, it's Loid Forger.

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.844
I would like to
formally apologize

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:09.140
for my daughter's violent
outburst on your son, Damian.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.517
I'm sure it must have been
an upsetting experience

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.895
for him and your family.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:17.106
[TWILIGHT] Chairman Desmond
of the National Unity Party.

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.232
I've studied everything

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.318
that might give me
insight into his life.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.238
Quotes in newspapers, TV
broadcasts, books he's written.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.324
But I've been unable to
learn much about his time

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.534
since he disappeared
from the public eye.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.661
How can I get closer to him?

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.456
How can I get him to show
any interest in Loid?

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:37.001
What does he relate to?
What enrages him?

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:40.046
I'll have to find out
in this conversation.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.964
And then, eventually,

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:47.178
learn the most important thing
of all: His plans for war.

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.555
[TWILIGHT]
I'm truly sorry.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.140
And I would like to
visit your residence

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:54.310
to formally apologize
as well, if I may.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.270
I see, so you're the father.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.856
My staff informed me
about that incident.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.485
I've been so busy I haven't had
time to address it. Apologies.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:06.614
[DAMIAN] Wait a second,
he was worried about me?

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.367
Expect a gift soon.
I'll bring it myself.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:12.078
Oh, there's no need for that.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.205
It was merely a spat
between children.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.706
Sure, but--

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:19.168
Father! A member of the Desmond
family was assaulted!

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.003
Doesn't that bother you?

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.589
I must admit,
I agree with your son.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.216
Whatever the circumstances,

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.301
my daughter put
her hands on him.

00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:29.095
I promise to make it up to you.

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:30.471
Really, it's all right.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.348
I thank you for your
courtesy, though.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.267
[TWILIGHT]
Instant rejection.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:37.562
You are truly too kind.
Thank you, sir.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.856
[TWILIGHT] Being too
persistent will backfire.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:41.357
If he finds me
at all suspicious,

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.859
the operation's over.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.235
Gotta be careful.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.611
[DAMIAN]
But, Father.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:48.239
[DAMIAN] So he really
doesn't care about me.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.782
[DAMIAN]
It was humiliating!

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.577
My face even swelled up!
But you don't--

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:56.706
[DAMIAN] Why don't you care?
You should be angry for me!

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:06.632
[DAMIAN]
Uh, never mind. I'm sorry.

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:12.221
No, you have every right
to be angry, Damian.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.265
We'll make sure this
never happens again.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.434
On that, you have my word.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.602
Though, to be honest,

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.729
my daughter's behavior
is so bizarre--

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.273
I just don't know how
to handle her sometimes.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:25.193
[ALL]
Poor guy's got it rough.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.152
[TWILIGHT]
Of course, I understand

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:29.363
that I'm responsible for her,
but I've become painfully aware

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:32.825
that it's impossible to
completely control kids.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.827
We can't just assume that
because they're our children

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:36.370
they'll do what we want.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.290
That's only going to end in
disappointment for everyone.

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:44.170
You understand. Raising
kids sure is a challenge.

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.255
I agree with you there.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:49.008
They may share our blood,
but they aren't us.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.718
They're essentially strangers.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.555
And it's impossible to know
what a stranger is thinking.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:59.101
In the end, people can never
truly understand one another.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.686
[TWILIGHT]
Is that why you're using force

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:03.105
to bring other nations
to their knees?

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:06.192
Have I uncovered a core
belief, Desmond?

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:09.111
You couldn't be more
right about that!

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.575
[TWILIGHT] Specifically,
my field of study is psychiatry.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.953
But sometimes, I wonder
if I'm able to understand

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:19.330
even half of what my patients
are truly feeling.

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.456
[TWILIGHT]
He's not wrong.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:22.959
"Talking it out"
is idealistic at best.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.337
It's almost arrogant to
assume that's even possible.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:27.421
[TWILIGHT]
But...

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.882
The important thing is
to meet them in the middle

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.676
in spite of that.

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.761
Very little of what my
daughter says and does

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.555
makes any sense to me.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.598
I'm gonna go free
some sugary hostages

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.433
at the candy store
with this coupon.

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.811
Oh, yeah? Good luck.

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:45.106
But by playing along, even when
I'm kind of flying blind,

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:48.276
it creates opportunities
for me to talk with her.

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:51.946
Not that it always works out,
but it's my preferred approach.

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.657
[TWILIGHT] I'll never stop
seeking to understand others.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.243
I am a spy, after all.

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.578
[TWILIGHT]
You get it.

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.663
That's why you took time
out of your busy schedule

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.416
to meet with your
son today, isn't it?

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:08.963
Ah. Yes, I suppose
you could say that.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.675
[TWILIGHT] And I know how much
you look up to your father.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.803
Anya told me about it.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:16.721
You remember.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:19.348
You had an assignment
about possible careers.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.726
[inaudible]

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:25.021
[TWILIGHT] Anya was very moved
by your presentation.

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:27.815
It was all she could talk
about when she got home.

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.984
[DAMIAN]
Really?

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.194
Did you ever get a
chance to hear it, sir?

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:32.987
[DONOVAN]
No.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.156
Oh, my, that's such a waste.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.158
I only heard it second hand
through my daughter,

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.909
but I could still sense how much

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:41.329
he respects and
understands your work.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.872
It was touching.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:46.876
He's quite the wise
and devoted young man.

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:48.628
Is that so?

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.588
[TWILIGHT] I must admit
that I've had some concerns

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.133
about the National Unity
Party's platform in the past,

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.509
but hearing about the passion

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:57.595
with which you look out
for our nation's interests

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.138
through your son's report,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.600
well, it's made me want
to give it second chance.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:05.936
In fact, I was thinking about
attending one of your lectures.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.147
Maybe I'm too easily influenced.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:11.025
But seriously. His report
was that impressive.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.152
All right, that's enough.
Just stop, old man.

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:15.029
Heh. Sorry.

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:17.782
[DONOVAN] I have to say,
you're an interesting fellow.

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:21.118
What was your name again?
Ah, yes, Forger.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.872
Oh, dear. Time flies when
you're having fun, they say.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:26.457
[TWILIGHT]
I guess that's the end.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:29.210
He knows my name now,
so I'll call that a win.

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.338
Plus, I've memorized his
security's faces and builds.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.966
I'll leave you to your business.
Thank you for speaking with me.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:39.261
Oh, and by the way,
would you do me a favor?

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.889
Let's keep the fact that we
spoke about Anya a secret.

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.684
She can be quite the
little contrarian.

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:45.935
I know it may seem that way,

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:48.562
but I don't think she
actually dislikes you.

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:51.565
I'd be grateful if you
two became friends.

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:55.778
Oh, well, uh...
It's not like I don't want to.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.655
[EMILIE, EWAN]
Uh?

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.869
Shut up, forget it!
I don't have time for her!

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.162
And I don't hang with peasants!

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:07.289
Oof, that was hard to hear.

00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:10.334
I'll just have to raise
our status, I guess.

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.837
Well, you take care.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:22.388
Now then, what is it
you wanted from me?

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.474
Oh, it's, uh...

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:28.602
[DAMIAN]
Nothing.

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:31.147
[TWILIGHT] The important thing
is to meet them in the middle

00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:33.315
in spite of that.

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:36.235
[DONOVAN] If that's the case,
I'll be on my way.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:38.612
[ANYA] I don't really know
if my papa likes me or not,

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:40.656
so I'm a little scared, too.

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:43.659
I always show him my tests,
even if I did really bad!

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.494
[BODYGUARD B]
Sir, we should get going.

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:46.537
[DONOVAN]
You're right.

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.164
[DAMIAN]
Father!

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:53.836
I-I earned a Stella
on our midterms!

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.296
I know it's only one,

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:58.758
but I got really close
in other subjects, too.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:02.803
But I got a 50 on my
language test the other day.

00:21:02.845 --> 00:21:07.224
And... Oh! I got the grand prize
for my griffin sculpture!

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.852
And, uh, what else?

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:13.355
I see. Well, good for you.

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:17.485
Can I ask why you decided
to come today?

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:20.029
It was just a whim,
think nothing of it.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.281
But, Damian,
continue working hard

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.534
so as to not shame the
Desmond name, won't you?

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:27.161
Okay!

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.712
[TWILIGHT] It wasn't
much of a conversation,

00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:38.839
but I got a decent idea
of the relationship

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:41.175
between the Desmonds.

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:42.676
The closer they are
to each other,

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:43.886
the better it'll be for us

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.722
if we have to fall
back on Plan B.

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.599
As for the man himself,

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:51.310
that Donovan Desmond's
a tough nut to crack.

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:55.105
I'll just have to keep laying
the groundwork for now.

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:58.526
I need to take the intel
I gained today back to HQ.

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:04.573
[BOYS] Stella! Stella! Stella!
Stella! Stella! Stella...!

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.837
[TWILIGHT]
I'm back.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:19.839
[YOR]
Welcome home, Loid.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.760
She's been zonked out
since she got home.

00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:26.679
Not totally sure why.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.140
Special delivery for you.

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:31.642
Wait, Papa.

00:22:31.684 --> 00:22:35.688
I'm gonna come fight
the evil boss with you.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:39.900
[TWILIGHT] This girl doesn't
have a care in the world,

00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:41.485
I swear.

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:46.657
And as usual, I have no idea
what she's talking about.
