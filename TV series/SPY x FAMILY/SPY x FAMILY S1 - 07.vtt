WEBVTT

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.059
[TWILIGHT]
My target is a threat to peace

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.395
between East and West:
Donovan Desmond.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.605
To infiltrate his circle,

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:24.650
the first step was to enroll
Anya in Eden College,

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.194
the exclusive school
his son attends.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:29.154
The next step is to
secure an invitation

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.782
to his social gatherings,
and to do that,

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:35.327
Anya must acquire eight
merits, or Stella.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:39.831
Once those are collected, she'll
become an Imperial Scholar.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.043
[TWILIGHT]
However, at Eden,

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:46.296
that accomplishment will
prove very difficult.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:50.425
So I devised plan B:
The Friendship Scheme.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.302
That plan hinges on
Anya getting closer

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.972
to Desmond's son, Damian.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:55.556
Which in turn,

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:59.434
should prove to connect
the target and I as parents.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:02.312
But on the very first day,
she punched him.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:06.233
Now she has a Tonitrus Bolt
and possible enemy.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:12.364
[TWILIGHT]
Well, the mission must proceed.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.616
We're only getting started.

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:53.048
Good morning, Loid.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.385
[TWILIGHT] Morning, Yor.
Breakfast is ready.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:00.097
[TWILIGHT] Seems the three of us
are getting used to family life.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:03.558
Guess Anya must still
be in bed, huh? Hm?

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.148
[TWILIGHT] She's embarrassed
about the fight.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.109
Come on, Anya. I'm not mad.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.403
Now hurry, so you won't be late.

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:20.867
I'm really sorry I'm
already so bad at school.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.328
Actually, I think
that was my fault.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.288
We can't go back and change it.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.917
Just be good and try not
to get into more fights.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.213
All right? So cheer up.
Your classes start today.

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:36.717
That's sweet, Loid.
How understanding.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.427
[TWILIGHT] Focusing on
our next move forward

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:42.347
is far more constructive than
dwelling on past mistakes.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.891
Not to mention, we need to
keep her attitude positive

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:48.103
about school so she
still wants to go.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:49.813
Meaning that for the
sake of this mission,

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:54.276
her school life needs to go
as smoothly as possible.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.528
Oh, please make
sure you apologize

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.113
to Damian at school today.

00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:58.947
Okay, Anya?

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.075
Yeah. Gonna go now.

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.539
Do your best like a good girl!

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.750
I guess it's time for
us to go to work, too.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.960
[TWILIGHT]
Mm-hm.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.422
[TWILIGHT]
I'm counting on you, Anya.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:19.342
World peace rests on
you two making amends.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.513
Gonna do my best.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.480
[DRIVER A]
Have a wonderful day, milady.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.317
Wow, "milady," huh?

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.736
[BECKY]
Hello, Anya. Lovely morning!

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.322
[ANYA] Bet you live in
a big castle, milady!

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.491
'Course not, don't be silly.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.868
Did you actually take the school
bus here this morning?

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.661
How 'bout I have my
driver give you a ride

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.747
to and from school
with me from now on?

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.833
Would that make me
your "sister milady"?

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:55.295
[BECKY] It's just a ride,
we're not adopting you.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.924
Ah, I'm jealous of the dorm
kids who can stay here.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.551
[ALL gasp]

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.595
Ugh.

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:06.014
Quit givin' us the stink eye,
you rude little uggos!

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.475
[BECKY] Jeez. How can you be
this obnoxious this early?

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.227
What's your problem, anyway?!

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.353
Know your place!

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.562
Ugh! Stop!

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.732
[TWILIGHT]
Make sure you apologize.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.567
[ANYA]
Um...

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.737
I... I, uh... Yesterday, I--

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.697
[ANYA yelping]

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.033
[BECKY] Let's go, Anya.
Classes are about to begin.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.284
Wait a second!

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.870
We should go in case being
a moron is contagious.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:31.873
[ANYA]
What about world peace?

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.626
[TWILIGHT]
Ugh.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.712
That Blackbell girl needs
to get out of our way!

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.965
Although I recall that Blackbell
and the Desmond Group

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:43.009
are business partners.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.637
She could be under orders
from a rival organization

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.557
to sabotage our mission.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.184
Calm down. That's ridiculous.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.894
First impressions are crucial

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:55.272
when forming a group
of friends at school.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:58.817
This absolutely must
be handled today.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.285
This feels off.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.746
That girl, she's the one
who snapped, right?

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.540
Oh, my. She's so scary!

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:15.458
And the one with her
must be bad, too.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.961
I heard that she just lost it
and hit him for no reason.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:19.087
She's crazy!

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.214
[STUDENT C] I don't want to
be in the same class as her.

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.633
[STUDENT A] I'm so scared
that she's gonna hit me, too.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.553
[STUDENT D] How's she back
already? Stay away from her.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.889
[ANYA]
School is scary.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.099
I swear, people
can be so shallow.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.809
They'll believe any
little thing they hear

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.020
if it makes somebody
else look bad.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.688
You're really smart, milady!

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.441
Aw, I'm normal, but I
appreciate it. Thank you.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.819
And I'd rather you call
me Becky, not "milady."

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.446
[MATH INSTRUCTOR A]
Class, please be seated.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.282
I hope that we can become
best friends, Anya.

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:48.992
I'd bet I'm probably
the only one here

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:51.119
who knows just how nice
you can actually be!

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.495
[STUDENT B] Those girls
are gonna be trouble...

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.997
[STUDENT E] I won't talk
to those two psychos.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.626
[ANYA] School is scary,
but maybe it'll be okay.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.961
Hey, look! This is
really cute, huh?

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:01.338
Eww.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.506
You should put them in
their place, Lord Damian.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.258
They're too cocky.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.802
[DAMIAN] He's right. I'm Damian
Desmond, after all.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.221
The second son of one of
the most powerful families

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.056
in the country.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.432
I always get what I want.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.518
My older brother never even
hit me once in my life.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.520
In fact, no one has
ever defied me before.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:18.688
Master Desmond.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.147
[DAMIAN]
Not until...

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.565
[MATH INSTRUCTOR A]
Master Desmond!

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.692
I'm here.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:26.321
[DAMIAN] This is the first time
I've had to deal with such a--

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:30.033
She's just so... so...

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.284
[ANYA gasps]

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.077
[MATH INSTRUCTOR A]
Johnny.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:32.911
[JOHNNY]
Here.

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:33.870
[MATH INSTRUCTOR A]
Jesse.

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.121
[JESSE]
Here.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:35.914
[MATH INSTRUCTOR A]
Carl.

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:37.207
[CARL]
Here.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.291
[MATH INSTRUCTOR A]
Well, today will be

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:39.751
our very first lesson together.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.252
This is the starting
line for all of you

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.089
who worked so hard to get into
this school, and my hope...

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.132
As you can see in
the example given,

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.385
when this and this
are like this,

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:53.723
and that's why this turns out
like this, and this is this.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.559
So this gives you this answer,
and you can use this method

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:59.396
to get this answer over here.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:07:59.980
[bell rings]

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.690
[MATH INSTRUCTOR A] She fell
asleep in the first class

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:02.983
on the first day?

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.026
And she hit someone?
She's trouble.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:08.822
[BECKY] Anya! We have science
class next. Wake up!

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.993
[ANYA] Second son! Gotta say
sorry to the second son.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:16.371
To who? To Damian?
That jerk left already.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.498
I'd just leave him alone, Anya.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.250
[ANYA] But we gotta
make up for world peace!

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.835
It's important!

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.295
You mean it'll be bad

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:27.048
for your peaceful school
world, don't you?

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.341
I suppose there's no telling

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:31.177
what a boy like
that will try to do.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.139
Don't worry, Anya.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.850
Because you've got me
on your side all the way!

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.062
And no matter what,
I'm gonna help protect you!

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.397
[ANYA]
Oh, it's okay, then.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:42.981
[BECKY]
Yes.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.108
[TWILIGHT]
No, it's not!

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.860
[ANYA]
Uh! Papa?

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.987
[TWILIGHT] I need to find a way
to tell her how important

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.905
that apology is!

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:51.990
[SCIENCE INSTRUCTOR A]
As you can see,

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:55.410
you can reflect the sun's rays
by simply using a mirror.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:59.372
And notice that the spot where
the light hits will feel warm.

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:03.376
Next, let's try an experiment
where we use two mirrors...

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.628
[ANYA]
Message from God?

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:12.218
[TWILIGHT] Apologize, Anya.
Patch things up with him.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.722
[ANYA] I'm feeling a lot of
pressure all of a sudden.

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:18.808
[STUDENT F] "And that's when
John made up his mind.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.228
Even if his friends would
never forgive him for it,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.523
he was going to stick up
for what he knew was right.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.818
And for the rest of his life,
John never apologized"...

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.695
[ANYA] I think I have
a different textbook

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.239
than everyone else.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.284
[bell ringing]

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:37.786
[BECKY]
It's finally time for lunch,

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.788
so let's go to the cafeteria.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.539
This school is
pretty tough, huh?

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.793
The lessons are harder than what
I expected on the first day.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.420
Ugh. I'm exhausted.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.638
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Welcome, new students.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.890
Our top-tier chefs will
make you whatever you like

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.642
from our world-class menu.

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:01.392
[BECKY]
Huh.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.937
Well, they're nowhere near
as talented as my chef.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.981
[ANYA] Ooh! I wanna
eat some omelet rice.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.945
How odd. I'm never
ordering that.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.492
[ANYA]
Uh! Second son!

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.953
[BECKY]
Ew, go eat in your dorm!

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:20.954
[ANYA]
I gotta pologize.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.706
No, Anya. It's their
fault, ya know!

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.208
[TWILIGHT]
Meddling brat!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.253
That's it, I'm getting
her away from Anya.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:32.590
[WAITER A] Hey, new guy!
Where are you going?

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.053
[tone chimes]

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.054
[TWILIGHT]
Attention.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.140
Becky Blackbell from
Class One-Three,

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.475
come to the student hall
in Tower A immediately.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.352
Can I come after
I finish eating?

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:45.186
[TWILIGHT]
Immediately!

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.272
[BECKY]
Ugh!

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.107
[ANYA]
Now's my chance!

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:52.443
[DAMIAN, EWEN gasp]

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.536
[EWEN]
Hey, what do you want?

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:02.871
You here to fight again?

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:03.788
[ANYA]
I, uh--

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.540
The only reason Lord Damian lost

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.709
is because you sucker
punched him, weirdo!

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.793
[ANYA]
Listen!

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.254
Just shut up, you two.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:15.091
So you can personally teach
this brat yourself, right?

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.932
[DAMIAN] Why do I always
get tongue tied

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.809
whenever she's right
in front of me?

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.186
Are you okay?

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.604
[DAMIAN]
Why does my heart act like

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.064
it's gonna jump out of my chest?

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.276
[ANYA]
I'm feeling kinda weird.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.612
I better pologize, then run.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.405
[EMILE] I bet I know
what's going on.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.949
Lord Damian's gotta be thinkin'
of the perfect insult

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.368
to rip this creepy
little girl to shreds!

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.162
[EWEN]
I wonder what he'll go for.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.455
Call her a "shrimp"?

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:48.666
No, that would be too
babyish for him. Super...

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.543
So, uh...

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:51.628
[EWEN]
Psycho gorilla girl?

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:56.382
Yesterday, I, uh...

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.634
[EWEN]
Stubby legs!

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.761
[EMILE]
Stubby little legs!

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.889
She's even got those lame hair
things that look like cow horns.

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.432
[EWEN]
Raccoon-faced demon!

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:05.600
[EMILE]
Go away, raccoon,

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.644
before you give us
your commoner germs!

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:10.146
[EWEN]
Get lost, stinky raccoon face!

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.439
[EMILE]
Stupid stubby legs!

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.900
[ANYA]
I'm, um...

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:18.988
I'm really... I'm really
sorry... for hitting you!

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.406
[gasps]

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.075
[ANYA]
All I wanted was...

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:26.871
I just wanted to be friends
with you, I promise!

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:34.128
[ANYA] I'm sorry...
for having stubby little legs.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.715
[DAMIAN] She felt so bad that
she's actually bawling?

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.301
She really means it.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.094
[TWILIGHT]
Hmm...

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:43.763
Maybe I didn't need to pressure
her so much after all.

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:46.557
Well done, Anya. Solid apology.

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.811
Lord Damian,
your face is so red.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.354
Of course it is, dummy!

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.899
'Cause I'm angry!
Yeah, that's it! I'm angry.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.485
[DAMIAN]
That's right. This girl hit me.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.570
What's worse, she defied me!

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:02.615
Yeah, she came right up to me,

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:06.869
looked deep into my eyes,
and... and then...

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.624
[DAMIAN] No! Stupid heart,
stop pounding like that!

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.043
That's not what's going on!

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.461
She's a commoner!

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:20.967
I would never! Never ever!
It's too embarrassing.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.388
Leave me alone!

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.515
I would rather die
than let you win!

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:31.102
I will never forgive you!
My pride won't let me!

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.437
Tell her, Lord Damian!

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.480
You won't fall for
a woman's tears.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:37.191
You're off the hook today,
but watch out.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.193
Lord Damian!

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.200
[TWILIGHT]
How could this happen?!

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:49.203
He totally rejected her apology?

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:54.125
[TWILIGHT]
Plan B is DOA.

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.465
Lord Damian, why are we running?

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.925
Shut up!

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:07.513
School's so scary.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.474
Help, Becky!

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.351
Hello?!

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:17.148
Whoever called me way out here
better start talking, okay?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.234
[TWILIGHT] The denominator
is three, so one third,

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.029
and if you had three thirds,
it would be equal to one.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:23.821
Easy, huh?

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:27.241
Uh, you know, maybe it's time
to take a little break?

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.119
Not now. We have to get
through all of this today.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.037
[ANYA gasps]

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.413
[TWILIGHT]
With their rocky start,

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.207
plus that scene yesterday,

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.417
I think we can forget about
the Friendship Scheme

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.295
getting us in with the Desmonds.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.130
That ship has sailed.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.383
So the only solution at the
moment is to double down

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:47.845
on the more orthodox method of
Plan A and earn those Stella.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.305
Finish this, Anya,

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:52.642
or you can't watch your
spy cartoon tonight.

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.685
Well? What's this answer?

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.146
[ANYA] I'll just hafta
read Papa's mind for it.

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.898
Come on. You use this
formula right here.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.982
[TWILIGHT]
There are a few other ways

00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:03.361
to get the eight Stella needed
to become an Imperial Scholar...

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.863
To avoid getting Tonitrus
Bolts from bad grades

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.240
and prevent expulsion,

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.492
we're going to need to get
her academic skills up.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.868
I could enter the faculty room

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.453
and alter her academic
documents,

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:13.621
making her appear more--

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.832
Oh, Anya, are you okay?

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.126
[ANYA]
I'll read her mind instead.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.545
Mama, can you help me?

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:23.339
Well, why don't we
look it over together?

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:24.590
[YOR]
Let's see.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:27.802
The denominator is five,
so that's one split into five.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:28.511
Okay.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:32.306
For visualization, let's rip
all four limbs off of a torso.

00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:34.892
Hmm, but then the head's
getting in the way.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:38.062
Huh? Um, five. Five?

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.648
Kinda weird how it
looks like an S.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.612
[YOR]
No! Anya, what's wrong?

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.532
There a problem? Well?
Why can't you solve this?

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.075
[TWILIGHT] I can't figure
out for the life of me

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.660
what she's not getting.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:55.580
[ANYA]
I don't wanna study anymore!

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.915
[TWILIGHT]
Hey! Wait a second!

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.542
[YOR]
Um, Loid.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.627
I don't think it's a good
idea to be too forceful

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.254
at times like this.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:07.049
Okay, but to be an Imperial
Scholar, she has to study.

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:08.134
Yes, I know.

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:11.596
Though is that actually
what Anya wants, or you?

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.557
Well, uh...

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.643
[TWILIGHT]
It's what the mission requires.

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:20.897
Personally, I want Anya
to enjoy school

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:22.899
and be excited to be there.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.192
Obviously, she'll have to study

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:27.612
and keep her grades up
and all that, but...

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.363
Of course, you're right.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:30.990
[TWILIGHT]
She's still so young.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:34.577
I'm sure getting good grades and
honors aren't her main concerns.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:36.245
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:39.248
Not really my place to butt in
between you and your daughter.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.085
No, it's fine. I appreciate it.

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:46.714
I do lose my cool a
little bit sometimes.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.675
[YOR] I'm sure other parents
go through the same thing.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.845
Let's try to relax.
I'll make some tea.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:17:00.228
[TWILIGHT]
Anya, we made you some cocoa.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.232
Seems she's holed up in there.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:07.401
Yeah, well, she's just
pouting a little.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:17.286
[ANYA] I promise,
I'll do my best at school!

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.832
[YOR chuckles]

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.377
She reminds me of my brother
when he was a kid.

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:27.004
She'll come out before long.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.756
Oh, yeah, speaking of him,

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.883
he works for Foreign
Affairs, right?

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.843
Must've made good grades.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.638
So did you help him out
much with his homework?

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.182
If you have any tips for me.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.183
Oh, no.

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:41.686
And honestly, Yuri was always
a much better student

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.312
than I ever was.

00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:45.856
Kind of embarrassing,
but he probably taught me

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.233
more than I taught him.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.485
Whenever we would
study together...

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.861
[YURI]
No, you might think so,

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:54.073
but spiders actually aren't
insects, they're arachnids.

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:56.659
They have eight legs,
and insects have six,

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:57.868
and their bodies are split up

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.580
between their head,
thorax, and abdomen.

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:03.165
[YOR]
Wow. You sure know a lot, Yuri.

00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:04.542
[YOR]
Whenever I complimented him,

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.460
his smile would
light up the room.

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:10.256
[YURI] Ooh! Next, I wanna
teach you about history!

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:11.591
[YOR]
Yeah, okay!

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:14.552
I think he truly loved sharing
his knowledge with me,

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.971
because he'd study on his
own without me pushing.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:20.099
[YURI] Hey, Sis, wake up!
I learned my times tables!

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:20.891
Check it out!

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.727
[YOR groans]

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.103
I understand.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.896
Your approval made
a big difference.

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:28.107
It gave him a little
extra motivation.

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:30.151
Can't take credit for it all.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:32.361
But if you think
that's what helped,

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:35.031
I don't know, maybe
you could try to play

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:38.075
a more supportive role
like that for Anya.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.827
Praising her for little
accomplishments

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.162
could make a real impact,

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:44.665
and it's hard to see what
the downside would be.

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:48.711
Know what I mean?
It'd make her happy.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:52.673
Do you think so?
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:55.468
[TWILIGHT] But I'm not
even her real father.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.305
[TWILIGHT]
Doesn't matter.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:02.725
I need to be the best
father I can for her.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:06.395
It's a crucial part of
the role I'm playing.

00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:09.649
It's the foundation of
the mission, after all.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.941
And I don't think
I've been taking

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.402
that part of it
seriously enough.

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:17.490
I mean, as a father,
I've been less than ideal.

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:19.909
[YOR]
Don't worry, Loid.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.786
And have a little
faith in yourself.

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.205
You remember what Anya
said about us, don't you?

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:27.458
That we're a perfect 100 points.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.377
Anya thinks you're
a wonderful father,

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.712
and that's what really matters.

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:36.050
You reminding me of that
means a great deal to me.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.009
[YOR gasps]

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:38.552
I'm butting into
your family again

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:40.680
and telling you how to
raise your daughter.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:43.140
Not true at all.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.185
You're not a stranger,
you're a part of this.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:50.523
You should know, you're the
mother of the Forger family.

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.734
You provide all the things
that I never could.

00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.611
Yeah. Guess that's right.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.321
I forget that I'm
your wife sometimes.

00:19:57.363 --> 00:19:58.239
[TWILIGHT chuckles]

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.617
Try not to say those kinds
of things outside the house.

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:02.910
You know, it would be great

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.912
if you looked over
Anya's homework, too.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:08.124
Oh, of course, if you think
that would be helpful.

00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:10.626
We'll work as a family,
slow and steady.

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:14.004
[TWILIGHT] Don't panic and
take your time, Twilight.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:17.216
If all this could be fixed by
simply assassinating Desmond,

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.884
I'd have countless options,

00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:21.929
but we're looking
for a real solution.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:25.349
Most things that truly
matter take time.

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:28.185
You need to know your target's
thoughts, their desires.

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:32.356
Use that to gain their trust so
you can observe their actions.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:36.318
Patience and determination
are essential to spy-craft.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.531
But first, I need
to understand Anya.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:41.240
[clock chimes]

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:42.950
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.493
Oh my, look what time it is.

00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:47.329
I think I'll go in and have
a little chat with her.

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:50.166
[YOR] Go ahead.
I'll take care of the dishes.

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.087
Hello? Hey, Anya?

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:57.673
Your spy cartoon's
about to start.

00:20:57.715 --> 00:20:59.341
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:00.801
Let's watch your show first,

00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:02.219
and then we can
figure everything out

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.846
with your studies.

00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:08.768
Anya?

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.861
[TWILIGHT] She fell asleep.
That can't be comfortable.

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:23.783
[TWILIGHT] She was in here
studying on her own?

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:29.371
[ANYA] I gotta get really good
grades. Do good for Papa.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:35.503
[TWILIGHT] Guess I'll just
record her show for her.

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:38.631
No, Mama. You can't kill Papa.

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:42.551
Huh? What kind of
dream is she having?

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.639
The spy man.

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:52.978
[TWILIGHT] She thinks I'm
a wonderful father, huh?

00:21:56.148 --> 00:22:00.778
[TWILIGHT] How would it feel...
to have a real family?

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.627
[DOMINIC]
Hm?

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:42.087
Heya, Yuri! Been
working hard, huh?

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:46.175
[YURI]
Oh, Dominic! Long time no see.

00:23:46.216 --> 00:23:47.676
They've got me so
tied up at work

00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:49.762
I haven't even been home.

00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:52.806
Sounds like the life of
a Foreign Affairs elite.

00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:54.600
Oh, yeah.

00:23:54.642 --> 00:23:57.728
I'm curious, how was the
party the other night?

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.438
Was my sister's date cool?

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.856
How's her date?

00:24:00.898 --> 00:24:03.734
Well, uh, guess I
should say congrats.

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:06.737
Hold on, have you not
met her husband yet?

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:09.281
[YURI]
Huh?

00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:13.911
What'd you say?
My sister got married?

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.916
[inaudible]
