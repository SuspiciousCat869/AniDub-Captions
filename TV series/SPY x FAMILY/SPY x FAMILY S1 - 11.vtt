WEBVTT

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:52.029
[COMRADE A] Impossible.
All of our pursuers are--!

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.448
[BONDMAN] Let's go back
to our hideout and regroup.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.159
I have a bad feelin' about this.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.622
[COMRADE A]
Ugh. No way.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:05.167
Bondman, this
can't be happening!

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.793
[BONDMAN]
I don't believe this!

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.211
Hey, hey! Wake up!

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.713
So, about your grades...

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:12.549
Anya isn't here right now.

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.551
[BONDMAN]
This is awful!

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.973
[ANYA]
Ah! No! I don't wanna study!

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.184
Hold it right there.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:25.354
We made a deal,
5 PM is study time.

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:27.397
[ANYA]
You're a demon!

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.068
[TWILIGHT]
Operation Strix, Phase Two.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.654
In order to infiltrate
my target's inner circle,

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.448
we need to earn our way
into his social gatherings.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.826
And do to that, Anya must
become an Imperial Scholar.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:43.121
It's for that reason that I need
to ensure she gets good grades

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.958
and receives the required
Stellas as a reward.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.258
[TWILIGHT] I've told you
this before, remember?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.053
That's spelled with
an "E," not an "A."

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.932
[YOR]
Uh, you know what, Loid?

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.267
Her math score's pretty
good, considering.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.312
Very well done, Anya.
Keep it up!

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.357
He's got two-eights
of his bullets left.

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.150
[TWILIGHT]
From her cartoon.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.778
[TWILIGHT] Oh, look, this
proverb here is the same one

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.031
that Bondman was
saying in episode 16.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.283
I don't remember.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.535
[TWILIGHT]
Well, try to!

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.746
You know, it's the episode that
guy with the sideburns was in.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:25.706
[ANYA]
This stinks.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.249
I only did so bad on this test

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.627
'cause I read the wrong
kid's mind in class.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.380
From now on, I'll do some
investigating first.

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.132
I'll figure out which of
my classmates are good

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.884
at which subject and
read the right minds.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.970
That way, I can
accomplish my mission

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:44.015
and get perfect
scores every time.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.601
I sound just like Papa.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.979
[TWILIGHT] It'd be easy to
make all her scores an A+

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.022
using underhanded methods.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.691
But if she suddenly
scored that high,

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:57.028
the school and her classmates
would become suspicious.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.156
In order to make a move
like that seem natural,

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.909
I need her to actually
improve first.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.662
Plus, if she started to look
like a genius out of the blue,

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.873
her peers might begin
to resent her.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.040
[ANYA gasps]

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:09.791
[TWILIGHT]
Can't have her hating...

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.753
[ANYA] If I read everyone's
minds and get hundreds,

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.713
they'll all hate me?

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:17.090
Hey, how could you've
possibly known that answer?

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.885
She's a freak,
like some kinda witch!

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:27.058
[TWILIGHT] On second thought,
maybe I'm pushing her too hard.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.144
With her studying against
her will like this,

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:33.148
I'm unlikely to see any
significant progress.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.401
There are ways of earning
Stella besides academics.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.945
Maybe she could use
a change of pace.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.281
[TWILIGHT]
All right.

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.742
Why don't we take a break
and do some drawing?

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.660
[ANYA gasps]

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.788
[TWILIGHT]
Maybe art's her thing.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.956
[TWILIGHT]
That looks neat!

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.416
Is it a cheetah?

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:55.295
Or, no, wait.
I bet it's a panda!

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:59.424
It's a cow. The one that
went wild at school.

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.388
[TWILIGHT]
How about music?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.307
I've got this violin
for children.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.437
[violin squeaking]

00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.606
There's always sports!

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.321
[yells]

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:26.785
[wailing]

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:28.453
Come on, don't cry.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.163
[TWILIGHT]
Patience, Twilight.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.249
This is a marathon,
not a sprint.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.335
Don't forget she's
only in first grade.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.295
I have to figure out
what she's good at,

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.965
help her excel in it, and maybe
she'll earn some Stella.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:44.094
Why don't we play with the
jump rope? It's a lot of fun!

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.887
[TWILIGHT]
I can't rush this.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:50.433
Desmond isn't going to make his
move right away. Don't panic.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.602
It takes a long time
to begin a war,

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:55.063
and even longer to plan one.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.523
But...

00:05:57.566 --> 00:06:00.819
HQ estimated that she'd need
to acquire her eight Stella

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.863
in about four months.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:06.199
[TWILIGHT] Can I really be sure
we have that much time to spare?

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.409
[ANYA grunts]

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.121
[ANYA]
Papa, I'm gonna do my best.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.833
[ANYA]
But first, untie me.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.127
Oh. Yeah.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:22.924
Anya, how about we go
somewhere tomorrow?

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.885
[ANYA]
An ooting?

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:32.809
[TWILIGHT] In addition to arts,
sports, music, and academics,

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:37.564
there's another way to earn
Stella--community service.

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.900
Thank you all very much
for agreeing to volunteer

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.484
here at our hospital today.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.361
You're quite a generous bunch.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.448
Now then, I have a list of tasks
we'd like your help with.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.950
They're not pretty,
but that's the job.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.660
We'll have each family
handle one or more...

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.621
[TWILIGHT]
It's not unheard of.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.956
Many students have done
long-term volunteer work

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.167
to earn their Stella.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.753
Though uncommon,
helping apprehend criminals

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:04.549
or rescuing people in danger
earned some kids theirs as well.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.551
We could get some
personnel from HQ

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:10.180
to manufacture such an incident,
but considering the risks,

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:13.600
that's not an option
I'm eager to pursue.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:16.561
And even if volunteering
doesn't pay off anytime soon,

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:20.231
it wouldn't hurt to foster
a social conscience in Anya.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.318
First off, if I could
have the Forgers

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.487
clean this dressing room
right around the corner,

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.863
that'd be great.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.782
Whoa, they have a pool!

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.743
I'm sure it's just
for physical therapy.

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:34.788
[crash]

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.457
[TWILIGHT]
Uh. Uh...

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.168
Seems cleaning was too much
of an undertaking.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.463
How about you tidy up
the books in the library?

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.053
Excuse me, sir,
but could you do something?

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:55.266
I think it'd be best
if you helped elsewhere.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.769
[ANYA screams]

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:03.733
[ANYA]
I'm bored with chores.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:07.362
I wanna do the job where I give
the doctors their scalpels.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.114
I'mma go to the operating room!

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.908
Hey! Come back here!

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.620
[ANYA yelps]

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.547
I've had enough! Will you leave?

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.799
You're doing more
harm than good!

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.220
[ANYA]
Papa, I'm sorry.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:35.056
[TWILIGHT] It's okay,
everybody makes mistakes.

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:36.307
[TWILIGHT]
So much for my idea

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.727
of getting a community
service Stella.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:39.728
Now what?

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.147
So is physical therapy,
like, hard?

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.523
I won't say it's easy.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:44.733
But if it'll help you run again,

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.235
it's gotta be worth it,
don't you think?

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.112
[KEN]
I guess.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.159
[SWIM INSTRUCTOR B]
Three more minutes.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.413
Aw, man. Is the water
in the pool cold?

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.206
Don't worry about it.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:03.793
Go and put your swimsuit on.
I'll do the same.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:08.798
[SWIM INSTRUCTOR B]
Okay, one, two, one, two...

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.759
[KEN] I guess that
pool's for grownups.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.011
[SWIM INSTRUCTOR B]
Remember to focus on your toes!

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:17.932
One, two, one, two, one, two,
one, two. You're almost there!

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.269
[KEN]
Of course. I knew it'd be cold.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:22.812
[gasps]

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.731
Ken? Where are you?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.235
That's weird. I wonder
if he's still changing.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:39.454
[TWILIGHT] Hm... Might have to
ask HQ to change our timeline.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.873
[KEN]
I can't... breathe!

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.709
My leg won't move!

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.297
The pool! Papa!

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.883
Huh? You just went
to the bathroom.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.843
Somebody's drowning in the pool!

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.471
What? How could you know
that from way over here?

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.765
Exactly who are you?

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.059
[ANYA grunts]

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.937
[KEN]
Someone... help me!

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:10.401
Papa, I know I'm bad
at volunteering, so I...

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.239
[ANYA] I'm gonna become a pro
swimmer and get Stars that way,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.825
so I hafta go practice
in the pool!

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.535
[TWILIGHT]
What?! Come back!

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.745
I told you, that's not
meant for recreation!

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.330
[knocking]

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.583
Ken, you okay?

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:29.129
[sighs] He's more scared
than I thought, the poor guy.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.297
[ANYA screaming]

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.466
[SWIM INSTRUCTOR A]
Whoa! Where are your parents?

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:37.887
Wowee! This pool looks
super-duper fun!

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:40.473
I wonder what's going on.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.517
[ANYA]
Where are you, drowning person?

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:43.935
[KEN]
I'm...

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:48.648
[KEN]
...gonna... die.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.413
[SWIM INSTRUCTOR A] Ah! What
are you doing, little girl?!

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.552
[ANYA]
I can't!

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.524
Are you two all right?

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:32.942
[SWIM INSTRUCTOR A]
Ken!

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.277
[ANYA coughs]

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:40.491
Papa, I... I was just trying to
swim and saw this boy sinking.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.578
[SWIM INSTRUCTOR A]
Ken!

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.371
Hey! Can you hear me?

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.206
[TWILIGHT]
Calm down, miss.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.749
Are they okay?

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.210
[SWIM INSTRUCTOR A]
Ken! Ken!

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.800
How could none of us
here have noticed him?

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:58.801
I didn't hear a thing!

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.346
I had no idea you were
in there! I'm sorry!

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.473
[TWILIGHT]
That's just how it happens.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:07.352
When kids are drowning like
that, it tends to be quiet.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:10.480
Many die because nobody
notices they're struggling.

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.274
Please make sure you
keep your eye on him.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.110
Good job spotting him, Anya.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.113
I just saw a bunch
of bubbles comin' up.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.199
But you were pretty
reckless, too.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.284
Thank you! Thank you so much!

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:26.788
Well done, little missy.
You saved his life!

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:45.431
[HEADMASTER] First-year student
Anya Forger of Cecile Dorm

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:49.435
has earned a Stella for rescuing
a person in trouble.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.984
Holy cow, you're amazing, Anya!

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.986
You're the first in
our grade to get one!

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:01.030
Ultra-amazingly elegant,
Miss Forger.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.031
Very well done.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.408
Ugh.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.536
She beat me to it.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.460
[KEN laughs]

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.968
You did such a good job, Anya!
What an amazing girl.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.928
I am so happy for you!

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.015
[TWILIGHT] I never expected her
to earn a Stella this way.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:30.935
An excellent result.
But it's strange...

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.856
I feel like when I've thwarted
a terrorist attack.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:37.483
I'm proud of her.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.152
Nice work.

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:44.324
[ANYA] I can't believe my powers
actually helped someone.

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.413
Thanks, Papa!

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:52.707
[YOR]
All right!

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.960
I'm gonna cook you something
special tonight to celebrate!

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.005
[ANYA] You should probably
cook instead, Papa.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.882
[YOR grunts, gasps]

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.522
I heard that your daughter
earned her first Stella.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.733
That's good news,
Agent Twilight.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:23.029
Agreed, Handler.
Against all odds, she did it.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:24.280
[HANDLER]
Though I was thinking,

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:27.408
couldn't we simply "create
additional opportunities"

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.035
for her to earn
the rest of them?

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:31.371
We've certainly got
the resources.

00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:33.289
[TWILIGHT]
People would get suspicious,

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:37.251
and we shouldn't send the other
agents on unnecessary missions.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:40.922
It'd up the chance of
their cover being blown.

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.633
You do have a point there.

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:46.219
Is HQ getting impatient?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.261
No.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.430
But there are several businesses
linked to Desmond

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:53.851
that are making shady financial
transactions as of late.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.104
This is no time to relax.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:59.732
Try to make contact
with Desmond fast.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.193
Just give your daughter
some candy or something

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.028
to get her motivated.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.280
[STUDENT A]
Morning!

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.616
[STUDENT B] Did you see
that thing yesterday?

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.202
[STUDENT H]
Aww, I forgot my homework!

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:32.515
[STUDENT chattering]

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.225
[ANYA]
My new star is shining so bright

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.519
that I'm the talk of the school.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.529
[BECKY]
Good morning, Anya!

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.449
[ANYA]
Ah-ah-ah.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.325
[BECKY]
Uh?

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:54.495
From now on you'll call
me "Starlight Anya."

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:57.540
[BECKY]
Uh. Sure!

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.963
Seriously, you're like
a celebrity now!

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:05.548
Bet everyone looks up to you!

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.009
You could make, like,
a hundred friends today!

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.010
[ANYA gasps]

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.596
[ANYA] Bam! I was completely
wrong about you, Anya!

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.139
Wanna be my friend?

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.016
You should totally
come over to my place

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:17.143
and bring your dad, too!

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.978
[ANYA]
Bam! Well done, Anya!

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.564
The mission's now a success!

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:25.193
[NARRATOR]
And so, the world was at peace.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:27.945
Don't get a big head, kid!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:28.821
Hmph.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.490
[EWEN, EMILE]
Hmph.

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:32.658
What's their problem? Ugh!

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.245
[ANYA] That didn't go well.
Guess the world's doomed.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.748
C'mon. Let's go, Anya.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:47.215
[BECKY]
Let's go... Starlight Anya.

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.217
Okay.

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:51.260
[BECKY]
This'll be fun.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:55.973
[STUDENT K grunts]

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.225
Look at her.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.394
Yeah. What, does she think she's
hot stuff now or somethin'?

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.271
She keeps showin' off
that stupid badge

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:03.898
like any of us should care.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.274
Who comes to school wearing it?

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.360
It's like she's shoving it
down all our throats.

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.529
I, for one, don't believe
it for a second.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.114
She's too violent
to be some big hero.

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:14.367
They told us she saved
a kid from drowning,

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.160
but she probably kicked
him in there herself

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.662
and watched him sink.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:18.913
Now that I'd believe.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:19.580
Who knows?

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.207
Maybe her family really
paid the school

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.000
a bunch of money for her Stella.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:26.754
You think? She certainly
doesn't look that rich to me.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.090
Oh, no.

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:33.511
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're all just jealous of you.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:37.056
Damian, I bet you agree
with everyone, don't you?

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:39.767
She totally cheated, right?

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.103
Do you really think we go
to some third-rate school

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:45.773
that would hand out Stella to
someone who doesn't deserve it?

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.942
This is Eden College.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:50.194
Uh, no, I know.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.904
If you've got a problem
with our school,

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.991
then why don't you take the
transfer exam and leave?

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:58.244
[EWEN]
Spoken like a true man. Bravo!

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:00.121
[EMILE]
He is so cool.

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.539
[DAMIAN]
The fact that she didn't cheat

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.791
is why I'm so mad about
that little shrimp

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.168
getting ahead of me somehow!

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:08.254
Didn't expect that.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.132
Maybe there's more
to him than I thought.

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:13.551
Let's start class, shall we?

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.771
[BECKY]
By the way, have you decided?

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:29.984
What's your reward gonna be,
Anya? I mean, Starlight Anya?

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.110
My reward?

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.278
That's what I said!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.239
Whenever you do well on a test
or a recital or something,

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.408
you're supposed to
get a reward, right?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.076
You mean I can get peanuts?

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.746
Sure, but don't waste it
on something so cheap.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:44.040
Like, remember that test
we had the other day?

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:48.210
My reward for that was
a cute dress and a tiara.

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:52.882
But I guess they haven't given
me that many cool things.

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:54.258
[ANYA gasps]

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.885
Is your family, like,

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:58.763
part of a secret organization
that controls the world?

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:02.391
What do you mean?
They just run a normal company.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.021
[ANYA]
All right, I want a castle.

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:09.565
Okay, that might be a
little too much to ask for.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.859
Where would you even put it?

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:15.863
[ANYA]
Then... peanuts for, like, ever?

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.698
That's probably super doable,

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.826
but is that what
really you want?

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.789
[ANYA]
Rewards are hard.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.415
Yeah, I get that.

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:28.626
I think the reward that
made me the happiest

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.378
is my sweet little Wiesel.

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.505
Oh, that's the name of my puppy!

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:34.548
The cutest thing
you've ever seen!

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.758
Weezy!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.885
[WIESEL barks]

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.679
Mister Dog.

00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:45.893
Do you have a dog,
too, second son?

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.436
[DAMIAN]
Hm?

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.813
What? A dog?

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:51.816
What are you asking
a jerk like him for?

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:57.405
You're the best, Max!
I love you so much!

00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:01.450
Who cares? And don't
talk to me, okay?

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.788
Look, I have a dog now, too!

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.414
[ANYWA]
Oh, yeah?

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:09.542
Well, I bet my Max is ten
times cuter than your dog!

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.085
Why don't you come to
my house and find out?

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.837
And bring your dad.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.382
[ANYA]
Why, hello, Mr. Forger.

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:17.883
[ANYA]
It's time to stop this war.

00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:19.844
Don't you think, Desmond?

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:23.472
[NARRATOR]
And so, the world was at peace.

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:24.390
Heh.

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.183
Huh?

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:28.894
[TWILIGHT]
You want a dog as a reward?

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:30.479
[ANYA]
Mhm.

00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:32.523
Having a dog will bring peace.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.276
You mean... peace of mind?

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.235
Hmm.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:39.989
Well, I was thinking of buying
something for you soon anyway.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:44.577
Now, Anya, taking care of
an animal is hard work.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:48.789
It's not a game, understand?
It's a very big responsibility.

00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:51.417
[ANYA]
Responsibility.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:52.835
[TWILIGHT]
Hmm...

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:58.215
A dog. Yeah, maybe.
I'm open to discussion about it.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.425
Really?

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:00.885
Really?

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.636
[TWILIGHT] A properly trained
dog could provide

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.972
some nice security
for the apartment.

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.891
Not a bad idea.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.059
[YOR]
Dogs can be so violent, though.

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.353
It might rip Anya to shreds
if we get the wrong one.

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.939
[ANYA screaming]

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:18.527
I think I want a cute
puppy, please. A tiny one.

00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:21.363
Uh. Oh. Okay.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.575
[ANYA groans]

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.827
[TWILIGHT] Ah, well, I'm sure
we can find a small dog

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:28.162
that's still capable.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.790
I'll see if HQ can help later.

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.083
[TWILIGHT]
All right then,

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.711
we'll visit some pet
shops this weekend.

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:43.302
[SMUGGLER A]
Got any buyers lined up?

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:47.014
[SMUGGLER B] Eh, it's a
tough market right now.

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:50.851
But we got some punks who think
they're revolutionaries.

00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:54.063
[SMUGGLER A] What, they
gonna use 'em as bomb dogs?

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:56.482
These little guys
sure have it rough,

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:57.608
goin' through all that crap

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.820
just to end up as toys
for some humans.

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:05.032
[dogs barking]

00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:05.950
[SMUGGLER B]
Shut up!

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:08.702
If you want food,
quit your yappin'!

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.120
[SMUGGLER A]
They don't seem any smarter

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:13.165
than your average
mutts, honestly.

00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:16.210
Do Numbers Three and Five
look weaker to you?

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.420
[SMUGGLER B]
I dunno. Who cares?

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.134
[SMUGGLER A]
God, it always reeks in here.

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.970
[SMUGGLER B]
Yeah, let's bounce.

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.972
[SMUGGLER A]
Heh. Yeah.

00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:37.439
[ANYA]
I want this one. Or this one!

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.359
Thank goodness,
they all look gentle.

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:19.625
