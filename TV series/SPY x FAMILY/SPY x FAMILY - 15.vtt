[inaudible]

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:44.253
[DOG A barks]

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.002
[gasps]

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.379
[KEITH]
He's sunk his teeth in!

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.007
This is it! Time for
this pig to go boom!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.264
[KEITH]
What?

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.225
Why in the hell is
the bomb in the river?

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.061
Did the old guy toss it?

00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:08.271
[TWILIGHT]
Sorry about this, pup!

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.402
[TWILIGHT] Now be a good boy
and I'll let you out later.

00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:16.405
[KEITH]
How'd the geezer pull that off?

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.825
Wait, who the hell is that?

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:24.830
[KEITH] That's not even him!
What's going on here?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.331
Damn!

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.963
[TWILIGHT] Besides us having
your plate number,

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:36.299
good luck not getting noticed
in that bullet-ridden car.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.511
Your little revolution is over.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.055
[YOR]
Anya!

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.766
Anya, where are you?!

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.101
[YOR]
This is bad.

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:48.687
Did she go back to that
pet store to find Loid?

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.606
Those terrorists could see her
and snatch her up again.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.775
I've gotta track her down!

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:54.651
[YOR gasps]

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.777
[YOR]
That's him!

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.155
You never should've
messed with little Anya!

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.115
'Cause I'm gonna make you pay!

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:02.200
[KEITH] Huh?! She jumped
off the damn bridge?!

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.494
Get outta the road, dummy!

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.592
[YOR]
Um. Yes, hello, police?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.219
I just found another one of
those alleyway terrorists.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.055
Seems he had a car accident
behind Northtown Park.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.808
You think you can come get him?

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.603
Me? Uh, I'm the housewife
that called earlier.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.229
I gotta go!

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:36.777
[YOR]
Anya! Where'd you run off to?

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.112
Anya!

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.199
[SENIOR AGENT A]
Well, it wasn't easy,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.075
but that's a wrap on this one.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.912
Gonna be feelin'
that for a while.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.330
[SYLVIA]
Thankfully, we were somehow able

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.332
to avoid a huge commotion.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.042
The East wants to
keep this quiet,

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.377
so they'll clean up
any lingering mess.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.047
[SENIOR AGENT A] Are we gonna
hand over these dogs?

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.590
Not on our agenda.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.508
So we'll keep them here

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.968
until the higher ups
tell us otherwise.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.053
But there will surely have to be

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.639
some kind of plan
in place for them.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.599
All right, I'll be going now.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:10.519
I need to get back to my family
as soon as I possibly can.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.021
Good work, Twilight.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:20.862
[gasps]

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:26.952
I'm surprised to run
into the two of you here.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.912
What happened with
the big adoption event?

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:31.706
You took so long on the crapper,
I had to check on you.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:35.293
And I was worried about Anya,
so I thought I'd follow her.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.963
And... what about the dog?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.257
Borf!

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.718
[YOR] Since we had to deal
with all that crazy stuff,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.221
we kinda ran out of time
to find a puppy.

00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.347
[TWILIGHT]
I hate to think about them

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.432
getting dragged into this.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.686
I'm sorry, didn't realize I'd
take so long in the bathroom.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:53.603
Oh, Loid!

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.230
That breakfast I made
for you this morning

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:57.607
really did a number
on your stomach!

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.985
I'm so sorry about that!

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.195
[TWILIGHT]
And you, Anya.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.030
How many times do I have to
tell you that running off

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.198
on your own is dangerous?!

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.826
I'm so sowwy, Papa!

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.496
[sighs]

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.623
But you're okay, right?

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:18.628
Only because Mister
Doggie protected me!

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.256
[TWILIGHT] I suspect he's
another test subject

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:22.799
from Project Apple.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:27.345
If that's true, we can't have
such a creature running around.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:42.903
Thanks for all your help today.
You saved her life.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.404
[SYLVIA]
'Scuse me.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.198
State Security.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.327
Investigating the incident
that occurred in City Center.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.955
Do you mind answering
a few questions?

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.665
I see.

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.250
Then it's safe to
assume that this dog

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.837
was also one of the animals
trained by the terrorist group.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.797
Which means we'll be
taking him with us.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.215
[TWILIGHT]
Please, take good care of him.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.926
This is a delicate matter.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.887
Given the tenuous relationship
between East and West,

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.430
we'll need to keep
this under wraps,

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.098
so your silence is crucial.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.308
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.392
[gasps]

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.186
Since all that's over now,

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.396
why don't we go and look
for a puppy together?

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.315
Sounds good. Come on, Anya.

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:23.693
No way! I wanna
keep Mister Doggie!

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.320
Uh. Listen, Anya--

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.030
[ANYA] I wanna take care
of Mister Doggie!

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.240
You can't. That dog
belonged to the bad--

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.452
[ANYA] I don't care who he
was with! He saved me!

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:35.914
I understand. But didn't you say
that you wanted a small dog?

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:37.582
[ANYA] Well, now I want
this Mister Doggie!

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.667
It's okay he's big!

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.710
You're being difficult!

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:43.463
If you don't let me keep him,

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.257
then I'm gonna turn bad
and stop going to school!

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.050
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:48.885
But why would you do that?

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.304
This has nothing
to do with school!

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.264
You need to behave, Anya.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.432
[YOR]
He'll be fine!

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.142
Very well. He's yours.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.686
But, Handl--I mean, ma'am!

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.063
So, it's okay?

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.232
[SYLVIA] I highly doubt one
of these dogs going missing

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:03.566
will cause an issue.

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.694
The terrorists have been
taken into custody,

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.696
and this particular pup
didn't cause anyone harm.

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:08.822
[TWILIGHT]
Still, we--

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.199
[SYLVIA] We can't risk putting
Operation Strix in jeopardy.

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.450
Our hands are tied.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.202
[TWILIGHT]
That may be, but--

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.330
This also means that you'll
be able to keep an eye on him.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.208
We'll have plenty of dogs to
keep our investigators busy,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:20.875
so take him.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.836
[TWILIGHT] You don't think
I have enough on my plate?

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.380
What about all those
other Mister Doggies?

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.633
Will the police ociffers
be mean to them?

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.765
Don't worry, you sweet thing.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.226
The dogs are gonna be
well taken care of.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.228
They'll all be given
soft beds to sleep in

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.772
and nice, yummy food to eat.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.441
But this pup here,

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.277
he didn't have an easy
life before he met you.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.778
So it's very important

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.989
that you're always
extra good to him.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.324
And I know he'll be good to you.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.160
Can you do that?

00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:00.582
Fanks a lot, boss lady.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.421
She's such a good girl.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.673
You don't know what
she puts me through.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.884
[SYLVIA]
I've got a pretty good idea.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.344
I once had a daughter her age.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:17.098
That's great news, huh,
Anya? And Mister Doggie?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.186
[ANYA laughing]

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:30.278
What matters is
peace won the day.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.365
[TWILIGHT]
You're right.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.286
[SYLVIA] We do need to
take the dog with us

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.454
for the night, however.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.456
Give him a thorough
health screening.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.874
And once he's been cleared,

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.168
we'll bring him over
to your family's home.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.171
Works for me.
Shall we head back?

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.631
Definitely.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:52.383
I'm feeling pretty tired after
all of that excitement today.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:56.221
This field trip's not over till
we're home. If we make it alive.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.264
[TWILIGHT] Is that something
you picked up at school?

00:09:58.306 --> 00:09:59.599
Stop being silly.

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:01.726
[YOR]
Don't you worry, Anya.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.771
They got the bad guys,
so we'll be okay.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.114
[chuckles]

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.657
[YOR] If anybody found out
that I was the one

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.909
who beat the bad guys
and saved the world,

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.536
they would be so shocked!

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:20.745
[ANYA laughs]

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.164
[ANYA] They caught that
bomber-man all fanks to me.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:26.334
Papa is safe and world peace
didn't get disruptured.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.335
[TWILIGHT groans]

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:30.171
[TWILIGHT] We barely kept the
peace between East and West.

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:34.050
I'm drained. Now my stomach
actually does hurt.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.218
[YOR giggles]

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.261
[ANYA chuckles]

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.139
[TWILIGHT groans]

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:43.059
And on to our next story...

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.520
[ANYA] ♪ Please come
home, Mister Doggie. ♪

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.939
♪ Please come home,

Calm down. He'll be here.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.194
And you're blocking the TV.

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.071
[doorbell rings]

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:57.574
Evening, folks!

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.951
[ANYA]
Mister Doggie!

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.206
Take care of him, please.

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:10.044
[YOR] He's checking out
his surroundings.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:15.175
Wellycome to Anya's
house, Mister Doggie!

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.594
And now, it's your house, too!

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.053
[TWILIGHT]
You know, I think it's time

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.471
to give him a proper name.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.098
[ANYA]
Oh, a name!

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.976
[RESEARCHER A]
Number eight. Let's go.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.311
It's time for your medicine.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.730
Hold still! Stop your squirming!

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.066
[RESEARCHER C] Here's your food.
Better slop it all up.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.611
[RESEARCHER D]
Raise the voltage.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:35.737
[RESEARCHER E]
He can't take it.

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:36.696
[RESEARCHER D]
So what?

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.908
We've got plenty of
other dogs, now don't we?

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.706
Hm? Are you okay, puppy?

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:50.668
You don't gotta be nervous!
You just need a treat!

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.839
Everything's okay.
You're one of the Holgers now!

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:04.182
[ANYA laughs]

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.600
Borf!

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.270
[ANNOUNCER A] The summit
that began last evening

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.106
is beginning its second day,
and disarmament negotiations

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.859
appear to be off
to a good start.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.325
So I beat the bad guys
and saved the world,

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.202
but they won't give me a Star?

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:27.956
'Fraid not. We have to keep
the whole thing a big secret.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.541
It's the only way for East
and West to stay friendly.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.835
So don't say anything
about it at school.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.128
The police will arrest you,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.922
and you might not ever
come home again.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.257
[ANYA gasps]

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.971
This is how they treat
world savers, huh?

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.974
All right, Anya,
it's time to go to school.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.936
[ANYA] If they won't give me
more Stars for that,

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:53.564
I gotta go back to the
Friendship Scheme!

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.733
I'll get Second Son
to invite me over

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.944
and save Papa's
mission that way!

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.113
Say what?! Your folks
let you have a dog?

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:00.989
[ANYA]
Mh-hm.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.408
I bet you mine is a whole
lot bigger than yours!

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.909
Bring him over!

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.244
[chuckles]

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.787
[ANYA] Guess I'm just
gonna save the world

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.415
over and over again.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.794
Good morning to you, Anya!

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:17.130
Good morning, pwease.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.423
[BECKY]
What a relief.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.592
She's not still trying to make
me call her "Starlight Anya."

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.719
[ANYA]
Guess what, Becky?

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.511
[BECKY]
Hm?

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:26.431
They gave me a dog as a reward.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.182
[BECKY]
Wow, really? That's great.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.517
What kinda dog is it?

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.978
[ANYA]
Huh? The white kind?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.521
[BECKY]
Well, how old is it?

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.606
[ANYA]
Dunno, but he's real big.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.651
I wonder if he's as cute
as my precious little Wiesel.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.278
Maybe they could play together.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.863
[ANYA]
It actually works!

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:44.907
Hey, how about I come over
to your house, and we--?

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.909
Uh, hello?

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:50.538
[BOYS]
Huh?

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.335
What do you want from me?

00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.381
I have a dog.
He's big and fluffy.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.719
And why should I care?

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.512
[gasps]

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.059
[BOYS gasps]

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.644
[ANYA]
The world is doomed.

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.938
You brought that stupid
peasant to her knees.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.733
Way to be savage, Lord Damian.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:19.984
[DAMIAN]
I wasn't trying to be mean.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.320
[EWEN]
You've got razor sharp wit.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.947
[EMILE] Probably some
fleabag from the street.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:29.786
[EWEN, EMILE laughing]

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:32.330
So, uh, what's its name, huh?

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.623
[ANYA]
Huh?

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:39.462
My dog's name?

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:42.423
[DAMIAN]
Yep, that's what I asked you.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.343
Doggie?

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:51.557
[DAMIAN]
You don't deserve to have a dog.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:52.975
What a waste of time.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.811
[ANYA gasps]

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:03.069
[BECKY] Huh? You mean you
don't know how to name a dog?

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:07.657
Hmm. What about a cute name,
like after a food or a flower?

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.326
Food name, huh? Peanuts?

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:13.871
Isn't your pup big, though?
"Peanuts" is weird.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.082
What kinda name fits
the way he looks?

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.709
Lemme see. Old Fluffy?

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.420
[BECKY]
Uh.

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.295
Maybe you should see

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.090
what your mom and dad can come
up with and go with that.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:27.093
[ANYA]
Uh! Am I that bad?

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.728
[ANYA]
Hey, Papa! Hey, Mama!

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.772
I have returned!

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.359
[ANYA yells]

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.111
Welcome back home!

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.697
Wow! The puppy sure
is glad to see you!

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:50.575
[ANYA] Help! Help!
He's trying to wolf me up!

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.660
[TWILIGHT] Maybe we should
take him for a walk.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.162
Walkies?!

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:57.331
[YOR] There's a dog park near
the library we could go to.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:03.671
Borf, borfie, borf-borf.
Borf, borfie, borf-borf.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:06.716
Papa! I wanna hold Mister
Doggie's leash, too!

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:10.428
I don't think you're quite
ready. He'll drag you around.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.432
He may be somewhat trained,
but he still needs discipline.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.851
You've got some training
of your own to do, Anya.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:20.021
Learn how to feed him,
reward him, scold him--

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:21.147
things like that.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:24.984
He's your responsibility to care
for until the end, you know.

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:25.818
[ANYA]
Yeah.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.904
[TWILIGHT] Speaking of,
do you have name for him?

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.990
[ANYA] No, because
I'm really bad at that.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:33.201
[TWILIGHT]
Oh. Well.

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:35.453
We want a name that's simple
enough for us to say

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.371
and for him to understand.

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:38.831
And according to my sources,

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.083
dogs have a hard time
telling consonants apart,

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:43.711
so we should probably give him
a name with a strong vowel.

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:47.089
Something with A, U, or O.

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:48.716
That's kinda rough.

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:52.553
[YOR] Did he say they can't tell
"causes of death" apart?

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.305
[YOR] Should I make
you bleed to death?

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.891
Or maybe crush you instead?

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.185
Stop being so unreasonable.

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.979
[TWILIGHT] Perhaps when we get
to know his personality,

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.397
we'll have an idea.

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:04.941
[DOG barks]

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.490
[gasps]

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:15.535
Park full of doggies!

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:20.331
[ANYA yelling]

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.666
[ANYA]
Yay!

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.627
You gotta run around and play!

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:28.005
If you don't, it's just
a normal Anya park!

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:31.592
[WOMAN A]
You ready, Leo! Go!

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.471
[gasps]

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:38.432
Whoa! We should try to do that!

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.646
Go!

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:54.907
Maybe this will only work
if you have a name.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:57.910
[ANYA]
Hey, 'scuse me!

00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.245
Huh?

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.040
I wanted to know the name
of your Mister Doggie.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:06.210
How'd you choose its name?
Tell me your secret!

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:09.547
Be careful not to run
off too far, okay?

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:13.593
I think that we should
decide to name you

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:17.138
Lucky Vanilla
Princess the Third!

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:20.308
Then how about Atomic
Angel Charlie General?

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.018
[chuckles]

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:25.021
She sure is having fun, huh?

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:30.276
[TWILIGHT] "Your responsibility
to care for until the end."

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.402
Sure.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.614
[laughing]

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:37.825
[TWILIGHT]
How can I even say such a thing?

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.243
Once this mission is over,

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.330
the quote "Forger
family" is over, too.

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.415
I may never see them again.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:48.878
I'll do my best to make sure
they're taken care of.

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.672
But this recent terrorist
situation reminded me

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:53.591
just how thin the
veneer of peace

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:56.677
between the East and
the West actually is.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:00.014
We must do all we can to bring
this cold war to an end.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.099
That's the best
outcome for everyone.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.225
And bring it back, you see?

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.645
[TWILIGHT] All right,
you two, time to go.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:09.190
You've got studying to do.

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.399
Ah!

00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:15.029
Uh, hold on. Lost my gloves.
Where'd they go?

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:18.240
I just had them and
now they just went poof!

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.242
[YOR] You probably just
dropped them somewhere.

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:23.329
[ANYA]
Those are my favorite pair ever!

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.629
[YOR]
I'm not seeing them around.

Hm?

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:43.557
Ah! Doggie's got my gloves!
Gimme back!

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:46.102

Oh?

Bad dog! What are you
doing to my sweet baby?

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:10.334
Shoo, you mangy ol' stray!
Did that monster mutt scare you?

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.088
Thanks, Mister Doggie.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.174
I've recovered the tummy warmer
stolen by the League of Evil.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.635
I'm always glad to help
you, Princess Honey.

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:22.179
Ah! Thank you so much, Bondman!

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.389
This was a very special gift

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:26.016
given to me by my
dear late mother.

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:30.020
You're a lot like Bondman.
You saved me and found these!

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:33.524
And look! You've got
gloves like him, too!

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:35.651
[ANYA gasps]

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:38.070
Is something wrong?

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:41.407
Papa! I just found a great
name for Mister Doggie!

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:42.700
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.790
Mister Doggie's forever
name is Bond!

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:53.002
Like "Bond" from "Bondman."
Well, seems to suit him.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:53.878
[ANYA laughs]

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.671
You're tickling me!

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:59.925
It looks like he likes the name!
And the collar fits, too!

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.346
Hello, Bond.

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:06.974
It's time for me to give
you your first mission.

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:10.478
You gotta eat up all the
doggie chow in the bowl!

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.024
[TWILIGHT]
Don't overfeed him.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:24.867
Not bad, but not good.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:29.497
Oh, you gotta potty.
Please follow me, Mister Bond.

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:34.502
Look here, this is
your very own potty.

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:36.879
If you go anywhere else,
Mama will get mad

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.380
'cause she wants things clean.

00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:41.300
So make sure not to spill, okay?

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:49.225
[BOND farts]

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.894
Poopoo time. Stinky.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.232
[ANYA] Bond, your next mission
is to watch this cartoon

00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:58.108
so you can learn
about your roots.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.902
[BOND barks]

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.655
Hey, I thought I
told you to study.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:06.242
You'd better be cracking open a
book when I'm out of the bath.

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:09.161
--[ANYA laughing]
--[BOND barking]

00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:10.996
You kidding me?

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:15.292
[YOR humming]

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.544
[YOR]
Hm?

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:19.088
[TWILIGHT sighs]

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:23.592
Loid. Loid, come here a second!

00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:26.595
You gotta see this!

00:22:26.637 --> 00:22:28.764
See what?

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:32.643
[YOR] They wore themselves
out playing today.

00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:37.606
She looks like a precious
little angel, doesn't she?

00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:40.067
[TWILIGHT] We can give
her a pass tonight.

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:42.069
[YOR]
She's earned it.

00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:21.210
[inaudible]
