[MATH INSTRUCTOR A] Now, can
anyone answer this problem?

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:49.943
Miss Anya Forger.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.741
It's three-thirds, sir!

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.121
Ah. Profoundly incorrect.

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:08.378
[bell tolls]

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:11.632
[HANDLER] Your daughter's
academic progress.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.217
Give me your honest assessment.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.513
HQ estimated that she'd need
to acquire her eight Stella

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.058
in about four months.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.269
Yes. Won't be a problem.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.980
[HANDLER] Interesting. Your
deceptive skills have dulled.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:29.691
[TWILIGHT] She could get eight
Tonitrus Bolts in half the time.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.194
[HANDLER]
Anyway, moving on.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.945
Our embedded informant
in City Hall

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.281
was compromised this morning.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:38.700
Clearly the enemy's
increasing the pressure.

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.619
So be on your guard, Twilight.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.371
Without his information,

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.623
we'll know even less about
from where enemy eyes

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.166
will be watching you.

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:48.210
This country's
counter-intelligence agency

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.462
is quite draconian.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.006
[EMPLOYEE C gasps]

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:57.761

Um, what can I do for
you gentlemen today?

[FIRST LIEUTENANT A]
State Security Service.

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.602
Jim Hayward, correct?

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:08.105
You're being detained on
suspicion of espionage.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.857
Me? A spy? That's just absurd!

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.903
Hey, what the--?! Stop!
Get your hands off-- Ah!

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.781
[FIRST LIEUTENANT A]
You can plead your case at HQ.

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.540
Can you believe what
happened this morning?!

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:29.584
Oh, that was absolutely
terrifying to watch!

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.670
I heard the guy they
took from finance

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:34.506
was apparently leaking
documents from this office.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.425
Sounds like a real bad guy.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.218
[CAMILLA]
Morning, all.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.178
[MILLIE]
Good morning!

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.098
[YOR]
It's good to see you, Camilla.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.642
Oh, by the way,
that reminds me.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.687
My boyfriend ran into your
brother and broke the news.

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.732
You never told him
you got married?

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.192
Oh my gosh! It totally
slipped my mind!

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.945
Uh, really? For like,
a whole year?

00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.822
Well, what am I gonna do?

00:03:58.864 --> 00:03:59.865
[CAMILLA]
Better think fast,

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.951
'cause he said that he's gonna
be calling you here today.

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:03.744
[YOR]
That's right!

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.079
I haven't given him the number
for my new place yet.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.290
Part of the reason I got married
was to get him off my back,

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.458
but I spaced out.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:13.837
So... is your
brother handsome?

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.922
Wow, he is a looker!

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:19.301
Aw. I've always thought
that Yuri was adorable.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.470
He's really been sweet
to me and so attentive,

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:22.637
like a little puppy.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.140
[MILLIE] So he's got
issues, huh? Pass.

00:04:25.182 --> 00:04:26.683
[SHARON]
If he's that "attentive,"

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:27.642
how could you not tell him

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.228
you got hitched for
an entire year?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.898
[FIRST LIEUTENANT A] Let's start
again from the beginning.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.318
How many files did you
pass along? Which ones?

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.946
Who exactly were you selling
the purloined information to?

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:42.491
Where and how often did
you meet with them?

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.868
Please let me go home.

[NARRATOR]
The State Security Service.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.585
An organization whose goal
is to maintain domestic order,

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.755
mainly through spy purges
and public surveillance.

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.049
To complete their missions,
they rely on violence,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.676
wiretapping, intimidation,
and torture.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.012
This fearsome group is
commonly referred to

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.056
as the "Secret Police."

Why'd they bring in

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.202
such a starry-eyed kid, anyway?

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:30.872
I hear he's a natural talent,
but he's just so green.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:34.084
Some hotshot from Foreign
Affairs who flew up the ranks.

Yeah? Okay, then.

[FIRST LIEUTENANT A]
Sounds crazy,

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.059
but maybe that's just
what we need right now.

And like you said,
he's a natural talent.

Plus, he doesn't mind
getting his hands dirty.

--Maybe you know her.

She's beautiful and kind,

Ah, it's been way too long
since we've seen each other.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.581
But I'm gonna go celebrate
her recent marriage tonight!

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.625
What I'm sayin' is, I wanna
wrap it up and get outta here.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:18.086
So just spit it all
out and we're done!

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.630
Look! I don't know anything!

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.343
[YURI] Yeah, well,
these photos say otherwise.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.596
That is you, isn't it,

Second Lieutenant!

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.140
How long were you holding on

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.433
to such important
evidence like this?

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:34.644
My apologies.
I forgot to submit them.

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:37.772
Do yourself a favor
and be honest, okay?

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.070
[HAYWARD] Truth is,
I just gave them some papers

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.947
in exchange for cash.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.408
Look, only thing I know is,
he's from the West.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.743
I don't even know
the guy's name.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.286
I never asked him.

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:53.288
[YURI] Was there anything
awkward or memorable

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.665
about this man's
looks or speech?

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:59.127
Perhaps he didn't act his age,
or something like that?

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.837
No, can't say.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.172
[YURI]
Ah, I see.

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:07.594
Tell me, the name "Twilight,"
that ring any bells for you?

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.346
Hm? No, not really.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:13.350
[YURI] He's a spy from the West.
A master of disguise.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.561
A key figure in the plot to
bring chaos into our world.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.105
Which makes him
my greatest enemy.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.774
[HAYWARD]
If I helped you catch this guy,

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.193
could we call it even
and forget all about this?

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.945
So you do know
something, do you?

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.822
[HAYWARD] Uh. I dunno.
Let me think about it.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.367
Lying to me would only
add to your charges,

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.410
so think carefully now.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.120
I just wanted some extra cash

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.830
to spend on the
ladies, you know?

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:36.748
All there is to it!

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.792
You are a married man,
right, Hayward?

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.419
[HAYWARD] Look, I'm no saint,
but you gotta believe me.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.506
I'm not a spy, I was just
trying to have a little fun.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.050
You know how it gets
for us guys! Come on.

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.386
[YURI] We all have our secrets,
Mister Hayward.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.972
Take me, for example,
I haven't told my sister

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.349
that I work for the
State Security Service.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:56.017
And I don't plan to.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:08:00.021
It's a pretty dangerous job,
so it'd just worry her.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.232
More than that,
I don't want her to know

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.901
how much dirty work
I have to do.

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.444
Mister Hayward,

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.823
you need to understand that
what you've done is treason!

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.617
Maybe you just saw it as
selling scraps of paper,

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.369
but you put the lives
of our citizens

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.538
and peace itself in jeopardy.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.790
Do you get that now?

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:23.211
Unlike you, I love my family--
my sister means the world to me.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.380
I will do anything to
protect this country.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.675
The land my dear
sister calls home.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.970
And I mean anything.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.096
[BONDMAN grunts]

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.724
Go on and torture
me all you want!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.727
I'm never gonna rat out my
friends, you hear me, swine?

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.730
[ENEMY A] You're gonna regret
bein' so stubborn, Bondman!

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.481
[TWILIGHT] If she would just
put this concentration

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.649
into her studies.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.943
[BONDMAN]
I only got two bullets left.

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:49.904
How many bullets can
Bondman's pistol have?

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:50.739
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.157
Well, if I remember correctly,

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.159
I believe that it
holds eight, right?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.660
He's got two-eighths!

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.538
Uh. It is! Good job!

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.540
He's got two-eighths
bullets left.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.792
So you actually know
what that means?

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.753
[TWILIGHT] She's learning
something from the cartoon.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.171
[door opens]

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:10.050
Loid, we've got some
serious trouble brewing!

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.509
Welcome home, Yor.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.721
There's two-eighths

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:19.434
Yuri, he's coming!
Here, tonight! Here!

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.977
Here?

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:28.276
[YOR] Now he knows, so of course
he insisted on coming over.

[YURI] Those ribs that she broke

she wait a whole year

Well, allow me to take
your coat and things.

Naw, don't worry about it.
I'm fine, thank you.

what the political
climate's like these days.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:09.289
Single women are regarded
as suspicious now,

No! No way!

Yuri's always been extremely
sensitive, to put it lightly.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.257
Which means, if-if he found out

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.718
that I got married to someone
I wasn't in love with,

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.012

Look, I just forgot, okay?

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.879
[YURI] Huh? Really?
'Cause that seems...

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.423

But when I talked to you
on the phone the other day,

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.968
you said "your date."

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.345
Why didn't you tell me then?

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:06.721
[YOR]
Just, ya know,

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.140
'cause I forgot that I had
forgotten to tell you

have to take your word for it.

Okay. I gotta cool it
with the attitude.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.338

more than food to win me over,

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.978
[YURI] Oh, yeah, I brought
over some wine to share.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.589
and he said that you'd
recently gone to Hugaria.

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:51.135
Oh. Yeah. Still just
for work stuff, though.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.013
I mean, the city was
really beautiful.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.932
Wish you could've been
there with me, Sis.

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:57.683
Tons of cafes.

00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:00.353
There's an old one in particular
that the empress would go to.

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:01.687
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.648
In the capital Obda, right?

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:06.192
It has a bunch of
excellent restaurants.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.193
Spent some time there

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:09.278
back when I was still
a medical student.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.823
[YURI] Really? I ate at
Kalpatia a few times.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.576
The old man who runs the place
makes a killer goulash.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.663
[TWILIGHT]
Yes, that was to die for! Ah.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:21.582
Now I see, this wine's
from Hugaria, huh?

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:22.959
It's great stuff.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:23.543
[TWILIGHT]
The wine.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.211
Yeah, isn't it?

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:27.380
[TWILIGHT] "Got it at a
shop on Hedger Street."

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:30.550
I picked it up at a tiny
little shop on Hedger Street.

00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:32.635
It must've been pricey.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:33.886
[TWILIGHT]
Around 200 dalc.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:37.181
Naw, about 200 dalc or so.

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:38.808
[TWILIGHT]
I knew it.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.810
Well, that's fancy
enough for me.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.937
I appreciate the gesture.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.939
[TWILIGHT] This conversation,
it's straight out of

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:47.191
the Ostanian Intelligence
Agency's manual

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.859
for the art of deception.

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.903
A template used
to fabricate a story

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.738
about going to another country.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.158
Which means, the whole
trip is a lie.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.620
Besides, the owner of Kalpatia's
son runs the shop these days.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:03.499
And a poor harvest bumped the
price of the wine to 300 dalc.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.502
You can fool a regular person
with this, but not me.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:09.922
I'm not your mark, Yuri Briar.

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:11.465
I was suspicious
as soon as I heard

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.926
he worked for the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.887
A common entryway to espionage.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.514
So I had Franky do some digging,

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.600
and there are records showing
he worked at the ministry

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.143
up until a year ago.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:23.269
That must've been
around the time

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.771
he was scouted by intelligence.

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.732
Putting it all together,
I'd say he works for

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.151
the domestic
counter-intelligence agency.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:33.654
WISE's mortal enemy,
the Secret Police.

00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:36.032
Still, though it's dangerous,

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:38.367
as long as he doesn't find
out who I really am,

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:40.786
this relationship
could prove useful.

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:42.371
If I play my cards right,

00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:44.624
he could be a powerful
source of intel.

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.959
I guess the drinks will
be on us next time.

00:18:47.001 --> 00:18:50.338
Oh, it's just great you have
a cool older brother now, Yuri!

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:53.382
[TWILIGHT] Seems he's concealing
his identity from Yor, too.

00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:56.927
That could provide me some
with leverage on him.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:58.429
[YOR]
Yuri?

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.641
I don't recall ever
giving this my blessing!

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:04.352
This guy is not my brother,
you understand me?

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:06.354
[YOR]
Don't be so rude, Yuri.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.272
[YURI]
You're right about me.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:11.233
I made a name for myself,
I have a respectable career,

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:12.985
and I can buy nice
bottles of wine,

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:15.154
but that's all
'cause of my sister!

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.698
We lost our parents,
and we had no money.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.784
We couldn't even afford
to buy school books,

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.160
so she went out and--

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.995
Sis is super late.

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:26.457
Is she still at her
part-time job?

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.250
Yuri, I'm home!

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.835
[YURI]
Sis!

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:31.921
What's wrong with you?
You're covered in blood!

00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.589
Did something happen at work?

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.883
What? Oh. No, I'm okay.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.885
[YOR]
This isn't my blood.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.346
[YOR] But check this out.
A little something.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:43.391
Ta-da! It's the encyclopedia
you wanted!

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.642
They paid me extra this time,

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.144
so I went and picked
this up for you!

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:50.898
Oh, Sis, I--

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.607
Ta-da!

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.109
[YURI]
She'd always work herself bloody

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.362
just to try and make me happy.

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:57.905
So I made up my mind.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:58.781
When I was old enough,

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:02.118
I'd work to be the kind of man
who could protect my sister.

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.869
She's the only family I have,

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:06.414
and the most important person
in the world to me.

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:07.665
Think about it!

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.583
Can you even begin to
imagine how it feels

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.544
when some random guy
just comes outta nowhere

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:15.005
and takes away the one
you care about most?

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.340
Yuri.

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:17.550
[YURI] I mean,
of course I wanted you

00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:20.261
to get married someday
and find true happiness.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:22.012
But he has to be the right one!

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.514
He's gotta be someone
who's more capable

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.850
of looking out
for you than I am!

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:29.687
Are you saying you're the guy
who can do that?! Loidy?!

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.814
Uh.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:36.777
[YOR] All I want to do is put
my brother's mind at ease.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:39.697
[TWILIGHT] Listen, I love Yor
just as much as you do,

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.116
if not more!

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.910
And my daughter loves
her very much, too.

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:45.578
[YOR]
Don't forget.

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:48.330
This is all just an elaborate
ruse to fool Yuri.

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.249
[TWILIGHT] She is already
a part of my family.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.584
And if spears or bullets

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.545
or even meteors rained
down from the sky,

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:58.299
I would risk my life
in order to protect her.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.051
[NARRATOR]
The man was an exceptional liar.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.219
[gasps]

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.138
[YURI]
Wait a sec, meteors?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.264
I could do spears or bullets,

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.683
but I never dreamed
of anything like that!

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:10.519
Is he like, crazy powerful?
How could he?

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.188
Yeah, well, talk is cheap,

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:14.064
so you can say
whatever you want.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:17.526
You liar! I can tell
by your liar face!

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:18.611
[YOR]
Oh, no.

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.780
You got yourself all worked
up for no reason, Yuri.

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.323
[TWILIGHT]
My "liar face"?

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.785
Has he seen through me?
No, there's no way.

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.244
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:30.122
[YURI]
Huh? Weird.

00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:32.583
You two've been married
for a whole year now,

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.710
and you do that when
your hands touch?

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:37.797
Wait, are you really married?

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:41.342
Uh. What are you talking about?
We're head over heels in love.

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:42.968
Yeah, madly.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.303
I don't know...

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:45.930
If you're as married as you say,

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.390
you're gonna have to
prove it to me somehow.

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:50.392
Do you need to see
our marriage license?

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.645
[YURI]
That's not what I mean!

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:55.898
You gotta kiss her
right here and now.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.234
Should be easy if
you're "madly" in love.

00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:01.195
But you're making it awkward.

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.613
[YURI]
Just one kiss, okay?

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:03.781
Then I'll leave it be.

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.866
But if you can't,
I'm going to City Hall

00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:08.035
and having them
annul your marriage!

00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:09.829
[TWILIGHT] This is bad.
What are we gonna do?

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.706
Calm down, Twilght.
You're the top spy in Westalis.

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:14.250
You've had relations
with countless women

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.334
for the sake of the job.

00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:18.170
What's one simple kiss to
save the entire mission.

00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:19.630
Well, if that's all it takes.

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:23.217
Huh?! Hold on, Loid.

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:27.555
Come on, Yor, we kiss
every day, right? So...

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:32.017
[YOR] We need to for the sake
of our fake marriage, but--

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:33.477
[YOR gasps]

00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:42.820
[YOR squealing]

00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:17.623
[inaudible]
