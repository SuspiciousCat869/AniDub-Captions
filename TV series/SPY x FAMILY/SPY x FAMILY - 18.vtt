WEBVTT

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.471
Students, your midterm
exams are scheduled

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.139
for the week after next.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.933
You will be tested
on four subjects,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.893
and the top two scores
in each grade

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:20.187
will be awarded one Stella each.

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:24.149
Bear in mind, any failing grades
will be given a Tonitrus Bolt,

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.485
so preparation is crucial!

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.320
On that note, I will now return

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.073
your most recent
history quizzes.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:31.949
Alice Paulette...

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.786
[sighs] This test sounds
kinda scary, huh?

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:36.870
Not to me.

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.331
Because I've been studying
really hard lately.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.416
[HENDERSON]
Anya Forger.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.260
Dreadfully inelegant score.
See me after school.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.307
[DAMIAN chuckles]

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.434
Heh.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.937
[EMILE] That impression
is spot on, Lord Damian!

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.399
[EWEN] You've got her
stupid look down to a T.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.861
[ANYA] Second Son ticks me off,
but I have a great idea!

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.322
If I read his mind during
the history exams,

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.324
then I'll get a good score, too!

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.994
Since you find this
amusing, Miss Forger,

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:20.372
how funny would some
extra homework be?

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.707
[ANYA]
I'm getting home really late

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.586
all because the
teacher was mean.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:29.339
Mister Moon is already
peeking out to say hello.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:30.799
[ANYA gasps]

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.511
[ANYA]
Papa! Papa!

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:36.096
Hey there, Anya.

00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:37.431
Is there something wrong?

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:40.934
Do you know how much of Mister
Moon will be out in two weeks?

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.811
The lunar phase?

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.147
In two weeks,
it'll be the new moon.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.815
Are you planning
to go stargazing?

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:48.358
Uh-oh!

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.736
[TWILIGHT] Your exams are
in two weeks, aren't they?

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.780
Well, let's do some
studying before dinner.

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.742
Try to shore up any weak spots.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.577
Come on, let's hit those books!

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.203
[ANYA]
I'm a superpowered telly-path

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:01.872
who saved the whole world,

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:04.374
but even I have a
big ol' weak spot.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.793
The mean men in the lab
called it an "eclipse"

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.337
or something like that.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:09.838
It's not good.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.050
On the one day each month
Mister Moon goes away,

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:17.179
my cool, mind reading
superpower goes away, too.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.390
If the tests are gonna be on
that day, then that means,

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:23.894
I'm not gonna be able
to cheat on 'em!

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:28.899
Oh, no. This is my biggest
challenge ever!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.108
Help me out, Bond!

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.737
Look into the future and tell me
what all the answers'll be!

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.825
[ANYA]
Hamburg steak?

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.994
We're gonna have Papa's
famous Hamburg steak

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:42.329
for dinner tonight!

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:43.830
Yippee!

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:46.917
Wow, how'd you know?
Must've peeked in the fridge.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.960
Guess we could eat now.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:58.470
I passed out and still don't
know anything for the test!

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:01.807
That's why I wanted to study
before dinner last night.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.394
I'm off work today,
so I can still help you.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.566
[TWILIGHT] Since her midterms
will cover four subjects,

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.027
that means we'll potentially
have four Tonitrus Bolts

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.362
to dodge at once.

00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:18.532
I've given up on her earning
any Stellas this way.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.409
And with finals further
down the line,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.787
there's a possibility she'll net
eight Tonitrus Bolts in total.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.580
I have to make sure she
doesn't get expelled

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.125
before I can get
close to Desmond.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.960
To prevent that,
we'll need to bolster

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.336
her academic fundamentals,

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.255
then infiltrate
Desmond's circle.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.215
[ANYA] I can't concentrate
on studying at all

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.884
because Papa can't
make his mind shut up.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:38.802
[TWILIGHT]
Hmm.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:41.930
If only I could figure out
what's so hard for her.

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:43.473
Oh, you know what?

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.058
The other day,
I happened to ask Yuri

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.185
if he was interested
in tutoring Anya,

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.396
and he seemed pretty
open to the idea.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.356
Do you think I should try
giving him a call?

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.358
Sounds like a plan,
if he doesn't mind.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.026
Unkie!

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:59.948
Hey! I'm here.
Li'l bro to the rescue!

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.574
[TWILIGHT]
Quick.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.117
Thanks so much for coming.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.202
Long time no see, Yuri.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.120
[TWILIGHT]
Maybe we should just leave

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.038
all that "happy
couple" gear out.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.999
[YURI]
Hmph. Why's he here?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.585
He can work on
the weekends, too.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.839
This is my younger brother.
His name's Yuri.

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.758
[YURI] So that's the
little hellspawn, eh?

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.386
I am Papa's child named Anya.
Much peased to meet you.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.389
[ANYA]
Secret Police ocifers are scary.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.892
[YURI's mind racing]

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.561
[YOR] Come on and
introduce yourself, Yuri.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.691
I think I've got a case
of heartburn. Hurp.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.735
Poor thing. I'm sorry
to hear that.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.361
Maybe you should take
a tiny little break

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.114
before you start studying.

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.699
So how have you been?

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.743
Considering the major
summit we just had,

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:46.912
I'm sure the Ministry
got hectic.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.079
[TWILIGHT]
Give me some intel.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.831
Huh? Oh, yeah.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.917
[TWILIGHT] By now,
the SSS must've realized

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.460
that the minister was Twilight.

00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:56.087
A risky move, but my
only real option.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.507
[YURI] Is he mocking us
for delaying the summit?

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.217
There was a terrorist attack!

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.302
I won't let you make me look
bad in front of my sister,

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.304
you piece of crap.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:05.555
[TWILIGHT]
I need to be on guard.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.934
[ANYA] A spy versus a Secret
Police guy. So cool!

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.394
And Unkie doesn't know
Papa's true identity!

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.064
Papa wins!

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:18.485
You're excited. Must be
ready to start studying.

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.195
[TWILIGHT] Rather than
be in anyone's way,

00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:21.613
perhaps I should
go out shopping.

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:22.906
Sure!

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.075
[TWILIGHT] Gives me time
to take another mission.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.702
[ANYA]
What about Papa versus Unkie?

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.663
[YOR]
Guess we should get started.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:35.168
[YURI] I agreed to do this
because Yor asked me to,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.795
but I really don't
wanna try to teach

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.797
this slow-witted little gremlin.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.424
[YURI] How 'bout you
try solving this one?

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.094
[YURI] This stupid brat gets
to spend all day with Sis.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.136
It's time I bust her bubble

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.181
with some insanely
tough questions!

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.392
[YURI] What? You didn't
miss a single one?

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.893
Wow! Great job!

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.520
[ANYA chuckles nervously]

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.106
Maybe you just know it all
and don't need to study.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:56.857
[ANYA]
Uh-oh!

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.608
I can't cheat on the
day of the tests,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.236
so I actually need
to study for real!

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:04.531
That was just crazy dumb luck.
I was making guesses.

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:08.618
Uh, well, that kinda
makes sense, but does it?

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.537
No! Wrong!

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.665
Are you trying to be this dense,
or what? This is serious!

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.166
I'm trying real hard!

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.253
[YOR] Yuri, please,
be gentle with poor Anya.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:22.340
It would be a terrible tragedy
if she got expelled over this.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.801
[ANYA]
But I do wanna go to school.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.929
Because it was her
mother's dying wish.

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.472
So what do you say, Yuri?

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.017
I'm counting on you
to help her. Please?

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.520
[YURI] Yes! I'll do
anything for you, Sis!

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:36.646
Yeah, okay.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:39.983
But she really doesn't seem
to know any of this.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.776
I'm gonna do my bestest!

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.528
So I can become
an Imperel Scooter,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.155
and then grow up to
be really important

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.281
so I can take care of Mama

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:48.825
and feed her all of the
yummy stuff forever!

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.327
--[YURI] She'a an angel!
--[YOR] Awww.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:52.162
[YURI]
Where did she come from?

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.080
And what's an Imperel Scooter?

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.498
Oh, Anya!

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.709
Hang on, I'm gonna go
and fix you some snacks!

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:58.793
[ANYA]
Yes!

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.421
[YURI] She really loves
my sweet sister.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:02.839
Slow down, Yuri.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:04.674
She's probably trying
to steal her, too.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.551
Don't believe her lies.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.178
But if this little gremlin
aces her tests

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.890
because of my help, Sis will
say, "I love you, Yuri!"

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:15.435
All right, fine.
Let's do this thing.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.522
Hold up, you sure
about that one?

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.565
[ANYA gasps]

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.192
Look, it's fine.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.152
The most important thing
is for you to understand

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.487
why you got it wrong.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.238
You don't have to figure
everything out.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.115
Just try to concentrate
on the verb.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.408
[ANYA]
Verby verb.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.284
[chuckles]

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.328
This brings back
some good memories.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.204
See, Sis?

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:37.082
Do that, and then you're
done. Easy, huh?

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.125
Uhh...

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.003
[YURI]
Come on. You got this.

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.840
Do you not like to study?

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:46.758
I hate it.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.594
Why? Do you like it, Unkie?
'Cause that's weird.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.346
I'm not "Unkie."

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:54.849
For me, I felt powerless
when I was a kid,

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.935
and it was super frustrating.

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.270
I wanted to help Sis out
as soon as I could,

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.107
so I studied extra hard.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.317
I loved the feeling of
getting an answer right.

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.820
It was like I got
taller or something.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.446
I focused on language.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.698
I thought I could
become a journalist

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.157
or lawyer if I was eloquent,

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.492
and make this world
a better place

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.286
for my sweet sister to live in.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.956
I worked extra hard in
chemistry and biology.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.625
I thought, with an understanding
of the body and medicine,

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.211
I could heal any of her
wounds or ailments.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.588
And I also worked hard
in math and physics,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.424
because they're at the
root of everything

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.635
that could give her a
safe and stable life.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:33.346
Although I ended up in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.849
everything I learned back
then still helps me.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.767
Whoa.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.728
Long ago, there was
a very wise man.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.521
He said, "Knowledge is power."

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.898
If you really wanna become
someone important,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.235
studying will unleash
your brain's true power.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.862
[ANYA]
No leash is power?

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.238
[YURI]
No.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.407
Study hard and I
can make medicine?

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:53.158
That's right.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.993
And make some cool rockets, too?

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:55.785
If you want!

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.787
And I could even conquer
the whole world?!

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.331
I don't-- Well, uh, sure--

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.626
You wanna conquer the world?

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.669
Whatever you want!

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.589
Let's go! The test you
face now doesn't matter!

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.884
Envision yourself doing
well on all future ones!

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.510
Aye-aye, sir!

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.471
[YURI]
Envision Sis's beautiful smile

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.722
beaming at you in the future!

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.432
[ANYA]
Aye-aye, sir!

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.935
Don't teach her a bunch
of weird stuff, Yuri.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:29.277
Well, kiddo, whaddaya think?
You mastered grammar yet?

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:30.737
What do you mean by "grammar"?

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.156
[YURI]
What a freakin' waste of time!

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.533
I can't take this! I'm gone!

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.077
Wait!

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:40.038
[YURI] Yeah. I have my
own studying to do.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.706
It's obvious.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:45.418
If I knew more then, I could've
had Twilight in a cell that day.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.379
And the threat from the
West would be gone.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.048
I'm still powerless.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.009
Not strong enough to protect
my sister or my country.

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:56.262
[YURI]
Sorry, Sis. I gotta go.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:02.393
Good grief. He's still so
impatient after all these years.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:06.314
And now I've made way too many
cookies for just me and Anya.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.529
[YURI]
So good!

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.907
[YURI retching]

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.118
[YOR] Well, I suppose
that solves that problem.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.370
I'll go and make another batch.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:24.207
[ANYA] Don't worry.
I'm still pretty full right now.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:29.504
[ANYA] If I would've been able
to read the clock's face,

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.673
or disarm the bomb that day,

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:36.302
I could've really helped Papa on
his mission to save the world.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.639
Mama, I'm gonna
go study in my room.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.517
That's an excellent idea.
Go get 'em!

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:43.685
[BOND groans]

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.103
I'm home.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.437
Oh.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.523
[YOR]
Nice to have you back, Loid.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:51.568
Little Anya is working
very hard on her studies.

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.319
[TWILIGHT]
Really? That's great.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.280
Let's see here.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.073
Huh. Foreign languages?

00:10:57.115 --> 00:11:00.785
That's right! She was putting
everything she had into it!

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.078
[TWILIGHT] None of this
stuff will be covered

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.206
on the midterms, though.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.166
Heh.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.834
[YOR]
Huh?

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:13.131
[TWILIGHT] I'm afraid Operation
Strix may be doomed.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.384
Well, today is the big day,
Anya. Are you ready for this?

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.136
[ANYA chuckles]

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.512
You are gonna be so surprised

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:22.348
when I show you that
"no leash is power," Becky.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.767
[BECKY] Huh? What is that
supposed to mean?

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:28.855
Anyway, I guess you seem ready.
I'm gonna ace 'em, too!

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.315
[HENDERSON]
And now,

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:35.695
we begin your very
first midterm exams.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:37.906
Good luck!

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.078
[STUDENT A] I can't believe
I bombed the math exam.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.832
[STUDENT B] I got an 80 on
grammar. Could've been better.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:48.958
[INSTRUCTOR A]
How'd the first graders do

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.169
on the first round of midterms?

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:54.214
Not too well, it seems.
At least from what I saw.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.382
Perhaps the questions
were a little advanced.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:59.385
Exactly as they should be, then.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.262
[INSTRUCTOR B] I'd be willing
to bet a few dalc there'll be

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:04.140
some parents trying to buy
their kids a passing grade.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:07.977
No way the headmaster would
indulge such things, though.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.479
[INSTRUCTOR C] Well,
those students at the top

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.649
of their classes will be
Ostania's future leaders.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.900
So selling points
in such a manner

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.819
would be doing society
a disservice.

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:18.821
That's why it's important to
keep these completed tests

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.199
under lock and key
until they're all graded.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:25.119
The nation's continued success
and security is at stake.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.080
[TWILIGHT]
I'm Twilight,

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:29.499
a spy currently conducting
Operation Strix

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.210
to maintain peace
between East and West.

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.378
And now, I'm afraid there are

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.713
some storm clouds
on the horizon.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.423
Will these midterms mean we feel

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.509
the painful strike
of Tonitrus Bolts?

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.219
Or will Anya somehow dodge them?

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.888
Pretty sure I absotootly
nailed it!

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.599
[TWILIGHT] We're doomed.
There's no way she passed.

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:47.767
Unlike the entrance exam,

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:50.395
we didn't have Anya memorize
possible answers,

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:53.856
which means I'll have to rely
on some questionable methods.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.317
I'm basically taking a more
direct route this time,

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:58.069
infiltrating the school grounds

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.155
and altering her answer sheets
before they're graded.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.782
Have a good night, professor.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.158
Uh-huh.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.243
[TWILIGHT]
I'll just have to get past

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.245
the school's security force.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.122
That's not such an
easy feat, either.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:10.999
The presence will be heavy
at the north tower

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.333
where the safe's located.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.669
It'll take some time
to get in there.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.087
And of course,
I can't do anything

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.673
that would raise suspicions
with the staff, either.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.842
It's crucial that I leave
absolutely no trace

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.552
of my involvement.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.053
Hmm.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.140
[TWILIGHT]
Who is that?

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.017
Doesn't look like any
staff member I've seen,

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.477
and he's definitely
not an instructor.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:36.024
Not to mention...
he's incredibly suspicious.

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.150
[DAYBREAK]
I'm Daybreak,

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:40.737
an elite spy conducting an
operation for a certain client.

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:44.365
My mission today is to alter a
certain student's answer sheets.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.242
Talk about child's play.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.244
How'd I get my cool
name, you ask?

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:51.122
Apparently, a master spy
from the West named Twilight

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.749
has infiltrated our country,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.917
so I decided to take
on the challenge

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.712
and be the rising star
fighting against him.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:00.256
Twilight of the West,
Daybreak of the East.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.967
We'll see who the
true master is.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.927
So this is my first mission.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:08.473
You're bearing witness to
the birth of a legend, folks!

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.308
[TWILIGHT] Seems he's heading
toward the north tower.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.310
Don't tell me he's here
for the same reason.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.395
What's with all the tumbling?

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:17.315
Hard to believe, but he must
be some kind of spy.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:18.191
If he botches this,

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:20.568
I'll have to deal with
the blowback, too.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.862
You fool! You can't go that
way at this time of day!

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.238
Ya know, that cute
math teacher...

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.907
[DAYBREAK]
And here comes security!

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:27.325
This is bad.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.202
A chick like that is
outta your league, man.

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:31.329
Aw. You don't know what the
heck you're talking about.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.830
I'm tellin' ya, man,
all I gotta do

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.166
is ask if she wants to go grab
some dinner Saturday night,

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.417
and I'm in.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.294
[TWILIGHT]
They didn't even notice him!

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:42.548
How is that possible?
Some kind of camouflage?

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.717
So strong, and so bold!

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.052
Does he have an
advanced understanding

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:47.804
of human perception?

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.765
Is he a type of superhuman spy?

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.186
[DAYBREAK]
It's locked!

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:56.813
[TWILIGHT]
So what now?

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:58.064
If he's going to interfere,

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.858
it might be better to eliminate
him before he gets in.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.861
Perhaps while he's still
fiddling with the door.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.446
Whoa! That's completely insane!

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:07.824
Surely somebody will
notice all the racket!

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:10.034
Is he even a spy,
or just a burglar?

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.161
He's not prepared
for either job.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.746
Leaving evidence of
a break-in like this

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:15.706
puts my mission at risk as well.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.333
I'll just make it look
as though the soccer club

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:18.960
got too rowdy during practice.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.670
Sorry, guys.

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.425
[DAYBREAK] The north tower,
the north tower.

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:26.134
[TWILIGHT]
Jeez.

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:28.636
He's just blithely waltzing
through the halls.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.012
As much as I'd like
to take him down,

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:32.056
I'm not sure what
he's capable of.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.641
And what in the
world is he after?

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:35.268
And has he never
heard of stealth?

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.227
[DAYBREAK gasps]

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.812
[TWILIGHT]
Hmm...

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.647
[DAYBREAK]
Oh, are you kidding me?

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.483
No one told me there'd
be some guy in here!

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.610
And it looks like the only way
I'm getting through that door

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.195
is if he opens it for me.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.114
Aw, man.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.908
Now what? I don't
see another way in.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.160
[gasps]

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.079
Hey, what're you doin' here
at this time of day?

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:58.166
[DAYBREAK] Me? Um, I just had
a little business in there.

00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:01.377
You mean the safe? Are you a
part of the faculty or staff?

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.545
Let's see some ID.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:05.256
Oh, ID, huh? Hey, look.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:08.176
Uh, you don't recognize me from
the informatics department?

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:09.719
I'm kinda famous around here.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.346
[SECURITY OFFICER C] Either
show me some ID, or leave.

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:15.141
[DAYBREAK] Aw, come on, pal.
Just let me in for a bit.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.517
[SECURITY OFFICER C]
I'm callin' the police.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:16.976
[TWILIGHT]
No!

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.270
If the police show up,
this will be a real mess!

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.606
Informatics. Informatics!

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.024
[DAYBREAK]
Relax, bud, I'll just--

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:23.900
[TWILIGHT]
Pardon.

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:25.818
I found this ID on
the floor over here.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.904
Might it be yours by any chance?

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:29.697
[TWILIGHT] Thankfully,
I've brought spare ID's

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.199
from every department.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.576
Huh? I'm pretty sure I
didn't drop anything--

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.412
Ahem. Yeah. You're Brown,
the new hire?

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.122
This will get you
through that door.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:41.334
Whoa. You're right, I was
wondering where that went.

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.503
Silly me. Thanks a bunch, bro.

00:16:43.544 --> 00:16:45.338
Of course. Oh.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.006
[TWILIGHT] Did he actually
write down mission notes

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:48.007
on his hand?

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:49.967
This must be some kind
of trap or setup.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.094
Nothing else makes sense!

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:53.971
[SECURITY OFFICER C]
Please, go right on in, sirs.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.598
You're a lifesaver.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.349
[TWILIGHT grumbles]

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.142
[TWILIGHT]
I saw two student numbers.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.436
Seems he's altering
some test scores.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.730
So he must be in
my line of work.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.440
And those two numbers...

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.526
They belong to the
Desmond brothers.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:08.319
Does that mean his client is--?

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.280
No, I don't know enough
to make that assumption.

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.908
[DAYBREAK] So here we are.
Safe number seven.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.451
Glad I was smart
enough to write down

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.620
that handy-dandy code here.

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.663
Wait.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:21.374
Did I write down the wrong
numbers or something?

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.418
Gotta hit the crapper
real quick, so go on.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.003
I'll be back.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.589
[TWILIGHT] There's not even
a public restroom in here.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.800
Boggles the mind to
think Operation Strix

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:34.345
could be in jeopardy
because of this clown.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:37.098
Honestly...

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:40.142
[DAYBREAK] Thanks for
all the help, chump!

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.604
Just take a nice
little nap, all right?

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:47.066
[DAYBREAK] Gonna drag him inside
so the guard doesn't see.

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:49.610
[DAYBREAK]
Lemme see.

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:53.614
First grader tests,
first grader tests.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.533
[TWILIGHT] Probably safer
to complete my mission

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:56.909
once he's done.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.120
He's unbelievably careless.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.747
Man! Don't tell me
this is locked, too!

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.083
I just need to get this
little bugger open.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.085
[TWILIGHT]
Get on with it.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.879
[DAYBREAK]
Yes! Mission accomplished!

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:12.216
Perfect! I'm even trembling
at my own genius!

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.301
Move over, Twilight,

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.553
because there's a new
master spy in town.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.096
It's the dawn of Daybreak!

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:17.805
[DAYBREAK]
Yes!

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.056
I was gonna make pork tonight,

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:21.267
but this calls for
a big juicy steak!

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.060
[TWILIGHT]
Why did he mention my codename?

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.895
I wish he would be
done and leave.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:28.190
Now my rep'll be through the
roof and I'll get all the jobs!

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.025
[chuckles]

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:31.736
Bet they'll even put
my name in the paper.

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:35.990
No way, that'll never happen.
I'm in the spy biz.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:39.577
A big part of the gig
is the mystery involved.

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:43.080
Well, while I'm changing these,

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.374
I'll throw in a nice autograph
from Agent Daybreak.

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:46.000
What?!

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.711
Spies aren't supposed to behind
leave any clues, you imbecile!

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:49.587
--[DAYBREAK] Huh?
--Uh.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.881
Hey, now, you should be napping.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:53.382
[TWILIGHT]
Uh-oh! I couldn't keep myself

00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:55.551
from yelling about
what an idiot he is.

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:58.054
Please forgive me, all right?
I swear, I didn't see anything.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:59.472
And I promise I
won't tell anyone,

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:01.474
so please, don't kill me!

00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:03.684
[TWILIGHT] May have to
take him out after all.

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:06.479
[DAYBREAK] Hey, do you
even know who I am?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.107
Tell everyone! The world
needs to know about me!

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.692
[TWILIGHT]
Huh?

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:14.111
Yes! I am known as Daybreak!

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.821
I'm counting on you
to tell the masses

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:17.615
what a super cool spy I am.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.826
And about how I infiltrated this
place like it was child's play.

00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:22.244
Feel free to spice it up.

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:23.913
Like, you can say I
walked through walls

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.831
and stopped a bullet
with my teeth.

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:28.876
Oh, but try to keep the
details a secret, yeah?

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:32.338
Toodles then, bro. Ta-ta. Adios!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.508
[laughing]

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:43.140
[TWILIGHT]
Where did he come from?

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.768
And are the Desmond brothers'
grades in that much danger

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.146
they'd have to hire
that fool to fix them?

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.273
Seems it's the opposite.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.734
He was changing them
to be failing grades.

00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.277
Which means,
his client must've been

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:59.407
a business rival or political
enemy of Desmond's.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:02.368
It'd be a problem for me
if they were both expelled.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.829
I should change these back.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.206
I need to figure out what
the erased answers were

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.125
and copy their handwriting.

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:12.378
Damn it. That buffoon made
my job even harder.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.462
All done.

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:15.715
Seems both brothers
are quite sharp.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:18.968
The older one got perfect
scores in almost everything.

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.594
And then we have Anya.

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:25.224
Anya, Anya... Here we go.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.393
Seriously?

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:33.482
[STUDENT D] I heard they
posted the test scores

00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:34.650
in the courtyard!

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:36.610
[STUDENT E]
Let's go look!

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.950
So where did Lord Damian
rank in all this?

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.285
[DAMIAN gasps]

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:48.330
[EWEN] He's in 11th place
overall and second in our class!

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.374
Plus a 94 in history!

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:54.920
That means you snagged a
Stella Star, so way to go!

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:56.922
[EWEN]
That's amazing, Lord Damian!

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.925
[BECKY] Ah, darn.
I'm down in 46th place.

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.761
I guess it could be
worse, though.

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:04.680
I don't see your name, Anya.
Wonder where you placed.

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:07.433
Start searching at
the bottom of the list.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:09.977
[ANYA] Actually, I already
know where I placed.

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.228
'Cause I read Papa's mind

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.272
after he snuck in here
on his mission.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:16.150
Oh. I see you. Right there!

00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:21.614
[BECKY]
213th.

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:24.408
Hey, don't let it get you
down too much, Anya.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.243
Better luck next time.

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:29.538
Um, good for you.
You managed to pass somehow.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.373
Almost not worth laughing at.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:34.877
[ANYA] Yes! I didn't get hit
by a single Tonitrus Bolt!

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:36.170
[ANYA chuckles]

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:37.671
[TWILIGHT]
Good job! I'm so proud of you.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:41.091
[ANYA] I made sure Papa's
mission is a little bit safer.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:41.967
[ANYA chuckles]

00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:45.054
Wait, how can she smile
after doing that poorly?

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:49.350
I love your positive outlook!
Yeah! Keep your head held high!

00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:53.437
[ANYA] See, Papa? I worked
really hard on my tests!

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.941
You just barely managed
to avoid failing

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.944
every single subject
and you're proud?

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.695
I thought you'd be happy.

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:02.947
[TWILIGHT]
I need to be much stricter

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.824
when finals come around.

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:06.617
What an amazing job, Anya!

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:09.328
It's over a hundred
if you add them all up!

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.957
[TWILIGHT] I suppose she did,
in fact, <i>pass</i> all her exams.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.124
Didn't expect that.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.837
She's doing good.
For her, at least.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:20.422
Which means my mission
is safe for now.

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:22.883
Perhaps I should thank her.

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.347
[TWILIGHT] You should be
reflecting on your mistakes.

00:22:28.389 --> 00:22:29.557
We'll see if you're
still smirking

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.308
after tonight's study session!

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.977
[ANYA wails]

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:35.062
What?! You say the
mission failed?!

00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:37.022
No way! I did everything you--

00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:40.651
Wait! Fired?
Hold on, man. Hey! No!

00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:44.238
This is supposed to be
the "dawn of Daybreak"!

00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:20.501
