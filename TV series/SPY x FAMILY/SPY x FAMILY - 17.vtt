00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:52.738
[bell ringing]

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.656
[BECKY]
Good morning, Anya!

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.700
Good morning to you,
please, Becky.

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:59.244
Did you watch the new
<i>Berlint in Love</i> yesterday?

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:00.871
Can't believe those
two got back together

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.748
after all that bad
stuff between them.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.625
And then when Vincent threw
his arms around her,

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.919
I seriously thought my heart
was just gonna explode!

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.714
I really only watch
cartoons, you know.

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:14.217
Oh, Anya, still clinging
to childhood, huh?

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.346
You're probably not even
interested in romance, are you?

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.140
Maybe you're not as mature
as I thought you were.

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.601
Is romance, like, being flirty?

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.729
It seems you're too young
to understand, Anya.

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.147
Love can give you power.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.274
It can even make you
fly through the sky!

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.484
[ANYA]
Nuh-uh. Liar.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.152
Jeez, they just got here

00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:35.405
and they're already all worked
up over some stupid stuff.

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:37.449
With our midterms
coming up soon,

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.826
those two should get
serious and study.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.453
Whoa. Second Son.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.163
[BECKY]
Hm?

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.332
[ANYA]
Previously on <i>Spy x Family</i>,

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.668
Second Son didn't get
how awesome Bond is,

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.004
so trying the friendship scheme
again was a big time fail.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:53.340
[ANYA] If you can somehow come
up with a super cool name

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.092
for your new dog,
then I'll reward you

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.595
with an invitation to
my family's mansion.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.349
[ANYA] Will Anya overcome
the no-mercy-having bully

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:05.143
and complete her mission
for world peace?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.854
Anya's battle continues today!

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:11.525
Fanks for watching, everybody!

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.235
[ANYA]
So to pull off my mission,

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:16.321
I brought the ultimate
secret weapon with me.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:20.200
I had Papa get a new family
photo with Bond taken yesterday.

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:24.204
All I gotta do is show
it to Second Son.

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:26.665
[ANYA] Holy cow,
this dog is crazy huge!

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:28.417
We should see who's
got the strongest one,

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.503
and by the way, I'm so sorry
I was rude to you before!

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:34.589
[ANYA] His name is Bond,
just so you know.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.388
[chuckles]

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.931
[ANYA]
Whoopsie daisy.

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:46.643
I dropped my super cool picture
of me with my super cool dog.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:51.648
I am such a clumsy girl.
Let me just pick that up now.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:53.567
[DAMIAN]
It's going to be tough

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.235
to narrow these test
questions down.

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:58.155
[EMILE]
Yeah, seriously!

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.783
[gasps]

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.077
Gosh. Who cares
about those dummies?

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.204
This is why you wanna
find a nice, mature guy

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.290
and not a bratty little boy.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.876
Huh? It looks like you
dropped something.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.378
Here let me help.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.629
Hm.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.506
[gasps]

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.260
[BECKY]
He's amazing!

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:21.803
Who is this tall, blonde,
and dreamy man

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.430
with you in the photo, Anya?

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.682
Is your father seriously
this good looking?

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.058
Why have you never
introduced me to him,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.935
or even told me about
him before now?

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.479
What's his name?
What does he do?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.939
What's he like?
And is he single?

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.982
[ANYA stammers]

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:37.569
His name is Papa and he's
actually married to Mama!

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.905
Okay, but I'll be keeping this.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.823
[laughing]

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.283
[BECKY]
Thank you!

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.912
[ANYA] Give it back! I need
to show it to Second Son!

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.664
They're super obnoxious.

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:55.879
[HENDERSON] It is time for
your arts and crafts class,

00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:57.714
but sadly, Master Rodin
seems to have

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.382
come down with something.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.886
So I will be leading the
class in his place today.

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:05.472
You will be creating a
three-dimensional model

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.516
out of the materials provided,

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.519
keeping with the
theme of "animals."

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.312
You've been randomly
divided into groups

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.189
and given a limited
number of resources

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.857
at your respective tables.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:19.861
You will need to discuss how to
use them amongst yourselves.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.155
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.533
[HENDERSON]
Group one. Herman Clark...

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.368
This sounds like a lot of fun!

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.577
What'll you make?

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:28.453
I was thinking maybe--

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.705
[DAMIAN] Hmph. This is
some dumb baby stuff.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.332
I've got better things to do.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:35.043
Oh, yeah, you're
absolutely right!

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.253
Someone from class two

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.588
was telling me a few
of the school's top dogs

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.882
will be coming here to
look at our projects.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.344
[BOY B] Whoa! It might go
on our permanent records!

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:48.807
Hm. Maybe I should
take this seriously.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:49.724
Hey, listen.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.143
If we end up in the same
group, don't hold me back.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.812
[EMILE, EWEN]
U-Uh...

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.981
And as for group four.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:59.442
We have Damian Desmond
and Anya Forger.

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:00.986
[gasps]

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:01.987
[ANYA]
Now's my chance!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.154
Aw, dang it!

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.074
Ugh! I knew something
like this would happen!

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.367
You'd better not
even think about

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.286
getting in my way, you hear me?

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:14.791
Seems like we ended up in
different groups, huh, Anya?

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.794
Gimme my picture.
I gotta show it off.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:21.089
Huh? But you said I could
have it, didn't you?

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.674
[ANYA]
Nu-uh, you big ol' liar!

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.842
[BECKY] If you gimme
one with just...

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:28.054
[HENDERSON] Stop running
and sit down this instant.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:31.766
[ANYA] Well, I guess I'll just
have to use this stuff.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:36.062
I'll make a cool Bond sculpture
and show it off to Second Son.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.481
[HENDERSON]
All right, children, begin.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.025
[GIRL A]
I'm gonna make a bunny!

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.568
[BOY C]
Yeah, me, too!

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.446
[BOY D]
Do you have enough paper?

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:46.698
[BOY A] Can I have that
pen when you're done?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.741
[HENDERSON]
It goes without saying

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.951
that their creativity
and artistic prowess

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.953
will have a large bearing
on their marks,

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.164
but what this exercise
will truly show

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:57.250
is how well they can
share limited resources.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.295
Cooperation, flexibility,
assertiveness, and individuality

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.964
are also rather elegant traits.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.591
[HENDERSON]
Hmm?

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.512
Becky Blackbell, what
is that you're making?

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.972
Uh.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.558
This is Anya's dreamy daddy!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.728
[HENDERSON] What? This is
taking creativity too far!

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.438
[BECKY]
Look, you can even dress him up

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.191
in a Blackbell combat suit.

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:25.236
It's like an optional,
special item.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.197
Creativity is an elegant trait,

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.950
but that does not fit the
"animal" theme of the challenge!

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.952
Start over, please!

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:37.040
You know, humans are
a kind of animal.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:40.669
[HENDERSON]
Ah! 'Tis true!

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.753
[HENDERSON]
TouchÃ©.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.506
I'll allow this, Blackbell.
You win this time.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.050
But my sweet Loid is very
intellectual and evolved,

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.886
so he's definitely
no mere animal.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.221
I'll make something else.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.681
[GIRL B gasps]

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.143
[ANYA]
All done.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.561
[ANYA]
Hm?

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.277
Huh?

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:19.916
This guy? His name is Bond.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:25.005
Wow, I've never known anyone
to name garbage before.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.923
[ANYA gasps]

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.428
Operation Doggie
has already failed.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:32.929
[EWEN]
What operation?

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:35.390
And was she trying
to make a dog?

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.726
What are you constructing,
Lord Damian?

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:38.935
Huh?

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:42.731
A griffin. You know,
like in my family crest.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:46.401
[EMILE] That is a seriously
outstanding choice, I'd say!

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.195
[ANYA]
Griffin?

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.865
Are they related
to Mister Chimera?

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.034
I'm going to need a
lot of paper today,

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.369
so you guys better
not use it all.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:56.911
[GIRL C]
Huh?

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.205
You got it!

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.541
[DAMIAN] This is the symbol
of my family's honor,

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.418
so I have to make
it look amazing.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.672
If it's good enough,
who knows? Maybe...

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.840
[DAMIAN]
See, father?

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.091
Today, I made a likeness

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.635
of the Desmond family's
heraldic beast!

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.680
[DONOVAN] Oh, my. This is
quite the accomplishment.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.058
You've expertly captured
the dignity and elegance

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.976
our family carries.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:24.105
Damian, you truly are the pride
and joy of the Desmond family.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.774
[gasps]

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.820
[DAMIAN]
It could happen.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.323
[ANYA]
Don't worry, Second Son,

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:35.700
I can help you make
Mister Griffin!

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.786
[ANYA] Really? That is so nice
and thoughtful of you!

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.370
Thank you so much!

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.623
Look, Father! Isn't
this griffin amazing?

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.833
The cute and sweet Miss Anya
made half of it for me,

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:45.043
because she's the best!

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:48.296
[ANYA] Uh! I must say, you have
remarkable taste, Anya!

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:49.547
I would love to meet the parents

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.883
that raised such a cool
and talented little girl.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.052
They must come over!

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.890
[ANYA]
Mission accomplished.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.936
[ANYA] Operation Dog is
now Operation Griffin.

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.647
I'm a genius!

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:08.942
[DAMIAN] I'm afraid I won't have
enough time to finish it all.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:11.277
Those wings alone are
gonna be a pain in the--

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.821
[ANYA]
Second Son.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.823
[DAMIAN]
Huh?

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:18.576
I will gladly help
you make your thing.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.745
You can even use my paper.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:24.415
Huh? What are you talking about?
Make your own, okay?

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.708
[ANYA]
I'm done.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.794
[DAMIAN] You're really
going to turn that in?

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.337
Are you insane?

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:32.132
[ANYA] I just really want
to help you, that's all.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.759
[DAMIAN]
Uh-Uh...

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.803
Fine, whatever!

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.054
[BECKY]
Oh!

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.765
So that explains what's been
going on with Anya today.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:45.395
The girl is obviously completely
obsessed with that Damian kid!

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:48.940
[DAMIAN] Well, then I guess
you can make its hind legs.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.692
[ANYA]
Okey-dokey.

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:51.901
[HENDERSON]
Oh?

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.903
So it seems they'll
be working as a pair

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.864
to create a masterpiece.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:11:00.785
Teamwork is extremely elegant,
Forger and Desmond.

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:03.872
[ANYA]
All done!

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:07.709
Huh? What are those?
I said to make legs.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.376
Yeah.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:12.172
But I wanted to make some cool
jet engines so it can go zoom!

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:18.094
Nobody asked for stupid
stuff like that!

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.597
Just give it some
regular feathers, okay?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.265
[ANYA]
Leave it to me.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.267
Ta-da!

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.562
Don't "Ta-da" me!
These things are super sloppy!

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.606
Do you think it can fly
with that few feathers?

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:30.315
[ANYA]
It's okay.

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.025
It'll fly 'cause of
the jet engines, duh!

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.776
It's not supposed to have those!

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.821
Look, just butt out would ya?
And stop wasting all the paper!

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.323
You're worse than useless!

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.824
[gasps]

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.869
You really don't have to be
so nasty about it, Damian.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:46.831
Shut up! And hand over
your paper, too!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.209
[HENDERSON]
This aggression cannot stand!

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.085
That was extremely inelegant!

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.962
[DAMIAN gasps, whimpers]

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:54.631
[HENDERSON]
Would you describe your actions

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:57.967
as "gentlemanly,"
Master Desmond?

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:02.430
[DAMIAN] But I--
Ugh, it doesn't matter.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.140
That stubby little
uggo messed it up,

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.850
and there's no time to fix it.

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:09.938
I really wanted Father to see
this and be proud of me.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:14.317
No need to get flustered.
It won't help you.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:19.656
At this point, it's up to you to
do your best with what you have.

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:22.700
[DAMIAN]
It still won't be good enough!

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:29.874
[bell rings]

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.209
[HENDERSON]
Time's up, children.

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:35.129
Please take your creations and
display them in the hallway.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.799
[EMILE] Heh. Your giraffe's
legs are super stubby.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.970
[EWEN] Well, that mane on your
lion is absolutely ridiculous!

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.597
[BECKY] Obviously, mine in
the best one in the class!

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:49.644
[ANYA] Second Son, I'm sorry
I was worse than useless.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:53.398
So instead of the feathers,
please take this.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:58.278
Huh? You're giving that to me?
Some sloppy garbage you made?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.947
[ANYA] But I turned it
into a girl griffin, see?

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.199
You can make it form
a pair with yours!

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.450
Huh?

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:08.413
Why would I need a second
one of them, anyway?

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.039
Uhh...

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:14.669
It's 'cause love can make
you fly though the sky.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.254
[DAMIAN]
Huh?

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:20.967
[OFFICIAL A]
I see.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:24.345
These must be the art projects
from our first graders.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:27.765
Quite an adorable collection,
wouldn't you say?

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.311
Huh? Hm...

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:35.189
Now, what have we here?

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.484
[DAMIAN]
Really?

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:50.413
You're telling me my project--
that thing--won first?

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.874
[HENDERSON] One of the officials
from the board of trustees

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.584
was quite taken with it.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.086
They said, "Despite
its plucked wings,

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.880
it stands regal and proud.

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:03.468
A reminder our country will
persist and recover from war."

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.470
Uh-Uh, yeah.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.013
[DAMIAN] They actually
saw it, didn't they?

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:08.931
Wow! Great job, sir!

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.642
Skillfully done!

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.728
[HENDERSON] Apparently,
when he saw the corpse

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.105
of the innocent baby
griffin lying next to it,

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:20.318
the poor fellow was unable
to hold back his tears.

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.282
[ANYA]
Well, that's wonderful news.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:29.327
Now, you can show it
off to your father.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.621
[ANYA]
My plan is working!

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:34.374
Huh?! No. I could never show

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:37.377
that pathetic-looking piece
of junk to Father!

00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:41.089
[gasps]

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.843
[ANYA] Operation Griffin
has failed, too.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.979
[DAMIAN]
Hello? Yes, Jeeves, it's me.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.482
Yeah, did you see that
crazy-looking elephant thing?

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.944
[DAMIAN]
I'm fine, thanks. Is Max okay?

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.195
[JEEVES]
He is.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:07.615
Will you be returning for
the break, Master Damian?

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:13.788
No. Father won't be at
home anyway, will he?

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.124
[JEEVES]
Your father will not.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:19.502
But I've heard that Master Demmy
is planning on returning.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.255
[DAMIAN]
I have exams coming up,

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:25.383
so I should stay here to
concentrate on my studies.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:28.219
[JEEVES] Brilliant.
Such a dedicated student.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:33.349
Hey, listen. Today, in my arts
and crafts class, we were-- Uh.

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:37.311
It looked totally ridiculous!

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:38.563
[JEEVES]
Hm?

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:42.442
[DAMIAN]
No, never mind.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:46.028
Jeeves, you told Father

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.782
about what happened at
orientation, didn't you?

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.577
Did he say anything about it?

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.620
[JEEVES]
Oh, yes, he did.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:58.124
In fact, he was quite
worried about your health.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.962
[DAMIAN]
Such a liar.

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:07.300
I appreciate his concern.
I should be going now.

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:18.686
[DAMIAN] Father has never
actually worried about me.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.904
It just so happened
to work that way!

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:29.238
[DAMIAN]
Ewen, Emile.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.406
Yeah, what is it?

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:32.575
All done with the telephone?

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:33.451
Yep.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.621
After dinner, we should go
and study with the dorm tutor.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:37.914
Sounds good!

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:39.123
We should work on grammar,

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.751
since that appears to be
your weakest subject.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.753
Shut up.

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:47.965
[DAMIAN]
It looks to me...

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:52.220
...like I really will have to
become an Imperial Scholar.

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:55.223
[HENDERSON]
The top prize.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.809
[HENDERSON]
The top prize?

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.732
[NARRATOR]
Sylvia Sherwood.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:07.026
Handler for the Westalis
Intelligence Services

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.529
Eastern-Focused
division, or WISE.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.241
Age, [bleep]. Single.

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:15.159
Officially, she's employed
as an attachÃ©

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.537
at Westalis's embassy
in the East.

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.289
Unofficially, she commands a
number of intelligence agents

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.208
despite being under
strict surveillance

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.919
by the Secret Police.

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.505
Due to her consistently
flawless performance,

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.674
she's often called
the "Fullmetal Lady."

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:33.177
At least by her
awe-struck subordinates.

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:49.110
[EASTERN AGENT A]
Don't forget, this is just

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:53.322
a surveillance operation on
Westalis's Secretary Sherwood.

00:17:58.202 --> 00:17:59.787
[SYLVIA]
Well, they're quite persistent,

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:02.623
I'll give them that much.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:10.381
The same clothes. The same
shop. The same route.

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:15.886
Every Wednesday, without fail,
I go to the public pool.

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.980
[SYLVIA] This pattern has given
them a sense of routine,

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:31.402
and their slow little minds
come to a dead stop.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.614
The pool again, huh?

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:36.824
[EASTERN AGENT A] She's gonna be
in there for at least an hour.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.368
Let's grab a bite to eat.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.204
[SYLVIA] As long as I can
create some open time,

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.999
it's possible for even
me to act freely,

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:49.754
despite being in
enemy territory.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:53.382
Now, it's off to the meeting
spot with Twilight.

00:18:53.424 --> 00:18:55.926
And then he tripped
and fell flat on his face.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.721
I'm tellin' ya, he's an idiot.

00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:05.686
[SYLVIA] This coat is pretty
nice. Glad I picked it up today.

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:08.939
A real idiot is one who
lets their guard down.

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:12.485
Carelessness can be
a death sentence.

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:17.031
[SYLVIA] Good day, or perhaps
good evening, Agent Twilight.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.368
This report contains
current holdings

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:23.329
from the Desmond group's
financial statements.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.498
One of them is a paper company,

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:28.709
and though their public
numbers are relatively low...

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.920
[TWILIGHT]
I have to hold my tongue.

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.588
Can't tell her that
her brand-new coat

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.257
still has the tag on it.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:39.011
No way. It's simply
not my place.

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:42.515
I wouldn't dare correct
the Fullmetal Lady.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:51.816
[NARRATOR] Loid Forger.
Code name, Twilight.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.235
A WISE agent whose
relentless drive for peace

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:57.738
means he always
gets the job done.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.657
A spy who made the
choice to throw away

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.992
any chance at a normal life.

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.411
[TWILIGHT]
Every meeting with Handler

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:07.498
puts both our lives at risk.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.585
Which means vigilance
is crucial.

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.880
We can't have the
enemy following us.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:23.097
[SYLVIA] Two to the north,
and one to the east.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.141
[TWILIGHT]
Shall we cancel?

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:29.103
[SYLVIA] No, let's meet
at Point C instead.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:31.063
And take care of this quickly.

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:33.399
[TWILIGHT]
Roger.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:34.734
[TWILIGHT]
This is how we continuously

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.528
exchange information
to preserve the tenuous peace

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.072
between East and West.

00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:45.119
[SYLVIA] Good day, or perhaps
good evening, Agent Twilight.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.454
Without further ado,

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:50.499
please report your progress
with Operation Strix.

00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:54.754
Latest news,

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:58.758
my daughter can clear two
levels on the jump box.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:02.845
Apparently, she can also jump
rope five times in a row.

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:08.976
[SYLVIA] What? Why in the world
is he telling me this?

00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:47.992
[YOR] Yuri! I just cooked
something new for you!

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.535
Try my omelet rice!

00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:52.371
Whoa! It looks amazing, Sis!

00:22:52.413 --> 00:22:54.582
I would've never guessed
that's what it is!

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:56.917
Down the hatch!

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:03.007
[grunting]

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:07.261
[YURI]
Yummy!

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:09.805
It's amazing!

00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:12.516
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that!

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:15.477
From now on, I'll be making
you home-cooked meals!

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:17.730
How 'bout some pasta
with cream sauce?

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:21.859
[YURI] Whoa! Are you telling me
that stuff is pasta? Incredible!

00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:24.945
[YURI vomits]

00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:26.947
[YOR]
Ta-da! Time for cake!

00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:29.825
[YURI] Whoa! I didn't know
cake could be this blue!

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:31.285
Thanks so much!

00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:34.246
[YURI vomits]

00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:38.042
[YURI groaning]

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:41.629
You're probably, like,
the best cook in the world!

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.839
I bet that you'll get
married off in no time!

00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:46.884
Huh?! Oh, you're being so sweet!

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.261
Cut it out, Yuri!

00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:52.431
[YOR giggling]

00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:59.063
[NARRATOR] That's how this man
built up an invincible body.

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.064
You were dizzy

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.399
because you'd stayed up
for four nights straight,

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.735
and that's when the
truck ran you over?

00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:06.695
Be careful.

00:24:06.737 --> 00:24:09.323
[YURI]
I'm perfectly fine.

00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:18.540
[inaudible]
