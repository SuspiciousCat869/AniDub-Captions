WEBVTT

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.848
[DIPLOMAT A] I need to be
at the embassy ASAP.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.935
[DRIVER A] I should have you
there in about 20 minutes, sir.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.853
Huh? The brake's not-- What?

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.104
What's going on?

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.815
Driver, you keep your
eyes on the damn road!

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:29.780
[MEMBER A] Apparently, one
of our diplomats in Ostania

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.324
has died in a car accident.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.326
Though we suspect
he was assassinated

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.746
by the east's far-right
political party.

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:40.249
It's becoming clearer by the
day they're trying to push us

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.000
into an all-out war.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.460
To protect the people
of Westalis,

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.963
we need to know exactly
what they're planning.

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.256
Let's put him on the job.

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.257
With stakes this high,

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.717
we need to use the best
agent in our roster.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.261
"Twilight."

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.472
[DETECTIVE A] Just as promised,
photographic proof

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:57.891
that the foreign minister
wears a toupee.

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.643
Negatives, too.

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:01.770
Very nicely done.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:04.606
Yeah, he'll be forced
to resign now.

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:07.276
Well, until next time.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.112
[EDGAR]
Hey!

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:13.907
So how 'bout you hand over
those goods you promised me?

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:17.286
[DETECTIVE A]
Huh? I, uh-- But you were just--

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.706
[DETECTIVE A]
He set me up!

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.292
[NARRATOR]
Code name: Twilight.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.336
A spy of the highest caliber.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.424
[NARRATOR] While the nations of
the world waged a fierce war

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.217
of information in the shadows,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.053
this master of disguise,
man of a hundred faces,

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.348
survived only by the
skills he's honed.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.977
[KAREN] Daddy's been in
such a foul mood lately

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.855
because someone stole his
toupee pictures, or something.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.524
I mean, honestly! What a bore.

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.276
Robert, are you listening?

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.612
Hm? Yes, how unfortunate.

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:52.904
[KAREN gasps]

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:57.409
Oh, would you look at that?
Could that be us one day?

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.910
[TWILIGHT]
Karen, let's break up.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.662
Huh?!

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.873
[TWILIGHT] I'm afraid you're
just not that intelligent.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.082
Bye. Best of luck to you.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.710
[KAREN]
Robert! Hey!

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:09.838
You can't walk out on me!
Come back here!

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.797
[TWILIGHT]
Sorry, Karen,

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.176
but I have no further use
of you, or your father.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.512
As of tonight, I'm also
done with "Robert."

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.223
Dreams of marriage
and a normal, happy life?

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:23.018
I threw those away the
day I became a spy.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.479
Along with my true identity.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.201
[CONTACT A]
Meow.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.161
[TWILIGHT]
Must be Cipher C.

00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:42.412
[TRAIN ANNOUNCER A]
The train bound for Berlint

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:45.248
is now departing on track five.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.962
[CHIEF] Good day, or perhaps,
good evening, Twilight.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.382
Excellent work on
your last assignment.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.591
For the good of our country,

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:58.387
the minister lived to see
another day, all thanks to you.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:01.056
Now then, here is
your next mission.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:03.809
Your target is the head of
the National Unity Party:

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.060
Donovan Desmond.

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:08.271
A grave threat to the truce
between East and West.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.398
You'll need to get close to him

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.775
and probe for any
seditious activities.

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:13.026
In order to achieve this,

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.821
you must get married
and have a child.

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:17.989
[TWILIGHT]
Say what?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.741
[CHIEF]
Due to his suspicious nature,

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:22.077
Desmond is almost
a total recluse.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.870
His only social appearances
are at events

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:26.873
held at the elite private
school his son attends.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.500
They serve as informal
get-togethers

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.960
for the upper echelon--

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.129
politicians and
industrial leaders.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.964
You will have your child
enroll in this school

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.758
and infiltrate one of
these social gatherings.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.053
However, the enrollment
deadline is drawing near.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.431
In one week, to be precise.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:46.309
I'm supposed to have
a kid in seven days?

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.104
Ahem. Sorry.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.314
[CHIEF] We're calling
it Operation Strix.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.484
It's the key to maintaining
peace between East and West,

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.737
and perhaps the entire world.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.281
You're the type of hero
who casts no shadow.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.867
Your great deeds never
seeing the light of day.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.578
Although you won't receive any
medals or public fanfare,

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.205
don't forget that your
blood, sweat, and tears

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:11.501
make everyone else's
day-to-day lives possible

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:12.961
[TWILIGHT]
All right.

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:16.298
I threw away my identity
when I became Twilight,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.925
so I'll take on the
role of "father"

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:22.387
if it means the world
will be a safer place.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.351
[REALTOR A] This is one of
our single-family apartments.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:31.813
The unit comes furnished,
has central heat and air and--

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:32.939
Um, sir?

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.485
[TWILIGHT] No wiretaps,
securable escape routes.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.611
I believe I'll take it.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.070
Excellent, Mister Forger.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.031
Now, if you'd sign
these documents.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:45.160
[TWILIGHT] Loid Forger.
Occupation, psychiatrist.

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.078
That's the role I'll be playing.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.831
A man with a loving family
and a happy home.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.459
[REALTOR A] I'm sure you and
your family will love it here.

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.586
So, tell me, do you
have a boy or girl?

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:57.464
[TWILIGHT] Ah, guess I'll
be deciding that soon.

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:58.340
[REALTOR A]
Huh?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.718
[TWILIGHT] It all sounds like
a real burden for a spy.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.762
[doorbell rings]

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:07.098
Hm? So, ya wanna adopt, do ya?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.141
[TWILIGHT]
Indeed, I do.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.727
I heard that your orphanage
was looking for families.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:11.770
You see, my wife and I--

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.522
[DIRECTOR A]
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.774
Just grab whichever
one you want.

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.651
They're right this way.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.736
[TWILIGHT]
What a horrible environment.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:20.821
But a place this shady

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:23.323
is more likely to have
incomplete records.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.909
It'll be easier to come
up with a backstory.

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:29.746
I'll make this mission work
even if it involves a child.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.123
I would've preferred
to handle it on my own,

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.209
but no matter how
skilled I may be,

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:37.337
disguising myself as a child
is out of my range.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.006
I should mention, I'd like a
child who can read and write,

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.091
if that's possible.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.218
Yeah? I gotcha.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.345
Anya here's the
smartest one we got.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.390
She don't talk much,
but she's a good kid.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.600
[DIRECTOR A] I'd love to get
this weird, creepy little brat

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.769
outta my hair once and for all.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.522
C'mon, Anya, say hi.

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.358
[TWILIGHT]
Uh. Excuse me.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.444
[TWILIGHT] Eden College only
accepts students six and up.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.864
This girl looks no older
than four or five.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.366
Six. I'm six!

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.119
[DIRECTOR A]
You're six years old? Heh.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.913
[TWILIGHT]
She's quite small for that age.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.419
[TWILIGHT]
Hm? The newspaper?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.004
Ah, but the crossword puzzle

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.798
would be too
difficult for a child.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.843
Of course, for me, it's
more like "child's play."

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:29.431
One down is "homeostasis."
One across is "causal closure."

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.517
The one below that is
"symplectomorphism."

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.689
[TWILIGHT]
She completed it?

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.357
With that kind of intellect,

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.193
Eden's entrance
exam'll be a breeze!

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.280
Sir, I'll take her.
About the paperwork...

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:48.199
[DIRECTOR A] Don't sweat it.
Just take her home already.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.076
[TWILIGHT] As a spy, getting
that part of the mission done

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.828
so easily worries me.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.955
So, is this okay with you?

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:57.709
[ANYA]
A spy on a mission? So cool!

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.045
[NARRATOR]
This little girl is a telepath.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.088
Test Subject 007.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.883
She possessed the ability
to read people's minds.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:07.385
This gift was accidentally
created in an experiment

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.304
by a certain organization.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.263
Since fleeing them,

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:13.558
she's been without a
place to truly call home.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.601
[TWILIGHT]
Listen, little girl.

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:15.435
[ANYA]
Anya.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.978
[TWILIGHT]
Listen, Anya.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.980
Starting today,
you will be my daughter,

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.942
but if anyone asks, you've
always been my daughter.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:22.984
Do you understand?

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.402
[ANYA]
Yep.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.447
So please make sure that
you address me as "Father."

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:28.198
Papa!

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.032
[TWILIGHT]
Close enough.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:30.367
Hello there, young lady.

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.410
Aren't you the most
precious little thing?

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.579
We're the Forgers,
and we just moved in.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.374
[ANYA] I'm Anya. I've always
been Papa's daughter.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:37.832
Oh...

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.542
[TWILIGHT]
Didn't need to say that.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.419
[TWILIGHT]
Come on, let's go inside.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.713
[ANYA]
This is my house now?

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:44.464
[TWILIGHT]
It is.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.675
[ANYA]
A TV!

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.593
You can turn it on.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.096
[TV ANNOUNCER A] <i>Spy Wars</i>,
an animated adventure!

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.223
I really like this show.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:55.308
[TWILIGHT]
Coincidence?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.144
[BONDMAN] A pistol with a
silencer, huh? You're not...

00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.604
It's so cool!

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.272
[TWILIGHT] I'll secure
everything we need,

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.359
which includes a
forged ID for her.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.735
I'm stepping out for a bit.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.654
Just sit tight and
watch your show.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:10.365
[ANYA]
Uh! An adventure!

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:13.493
It's not an adventure--
it's a shopping trip.

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.708
[ANYA] Papa! I wanna
pistol with a silencer!

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.043
[TWILIGHT]
Sure, if there's one on sale.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.336
[TWILIGHT]
To be a master spy,

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:26.089
one must act normally and
not draw any attention.

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.383
Today, we're a regular,
inconspicuous family.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.135
[ANYA]
Papa! Please! Save me!

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.386
[TWILIGHT]
That's not inconspicuous!

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.262
[LADY A]
Now, now, sweetie.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:36.016
Make sure you've got a good hold
on your daddy's hand, okay?

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.229
[TWILIGHT] Having one hand
tied up will make it tough

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.399
to counter an enemy ambush,
but I can manage.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.234
[ANYA]
An enemy?!

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.360
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.907
What're you doing?

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.200
I'm hiding!

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.453
[TWILIGHT] Did I do something
to make her hide from me?

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:59.456
Maybe I held her hand too
early. Does she hate me?

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:00.415
This is bad.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.250
I need to maintain a good
relationship with her

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.543
until the mission's over.

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.421
Basic diplomacy dictates
that I know more about her.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.591
Understanding the other party
is the first step toward peace.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.802
[ANYA] Understanding me means
we'll have world peace?

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:17.891
Um, I really like to eat
peanuts, but carrots are gross.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.852
Oh! Bacon from bakenries!

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:24.481
[TWILIGHT] A bakery. I'm afraid
they don't sell bacon.

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.859
[ANYA]
This one, please.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:31.237
[TWILIGHT] That costs a dalc.
A ten-pent coin isn't enough.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.451
[TWILIGHT] Maybe the crossword
puzzle was a fluke.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.536
She honestly doesn't
seem all that bright.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.996
I wonder if I can trade her in--

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:43.458
[ANYA]
No, Papa. Don't leave me!

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.793
What is wrong with you?

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:49.964
[ANYA] I promise I'm a good
bargain! Don't get rid of me!

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.424
[TWILIGHT]
Now what?

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.593
I'll get you peanuts
if you stop crying!

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.386
I love peanuts!

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:03.645
[ANYA] Papa, I feel so tired,
I can't walk anymore.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.523
[TWILIGHT]
It's not working.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:10.819
I don't understand why
she behaves like this.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.197
I think I need some sort
of instruction manual.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:18.493
"The key factor in
child raising is trust.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:19.702
Rather than scolding them,

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.163
look at things from
their perspective.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:25.083
Children have trouble putting
how they're feeling into words.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.918
Try to understand them."

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.462
No interrogation tactics?

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:30.672
Are all the parents out there

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:33.925
always on such
difficult missions?

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.011
"Nurture their self-esteem to
give them a better future.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.055
By giving them the ability
to think for themselves,

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.057
their lives will"...

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:44.978
[TWILIGHT]
Soon as this mission's over,

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.230
I'm sending her back
to the orphanage.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:50.108
That's how far our future goes.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.283
[ANYA]
No! Papa, I don't wanna!

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.742
Don't make me study!

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.870
I need to accurately
measure your intelligence

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.496
before you take
the entrance exam.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.624
But I don't need to study to
take some stupid ol' test.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:07.959
I'll just read people's--

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.210
[ANYA]
I'll read their minds!

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.087
I hope you're not
planning on cheating.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.590
Listen. if you don't get
into this school, then...

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.800
[TWILIGHT]
...my mission fails.

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:19.262
Okay.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.181
[ANYA]
Hm?

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.600
I'm stepping out.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.768
And you're staying right here!

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.563
You're not coming
with me. Not today.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:37.739
Huh? Hey! I said, stay put!

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.575
I see you! You think
you can hide from me?

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.076
There!

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.203
There!

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.580
[ANYA] Papa is so good
at hide and seek!

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.040
This is fun!

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:50.126
[TWILIGHT]
Ha-ha! Try and get outta that!

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.003
Wow. That's why you're late?

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.213
[TWILIGHT]
I ended up putting a barricade

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.840
in front of the door
and trapping her inside.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.676
[FRANKY] Hopefully you don't
get busted for child abuse.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.095
How could anyone know
what children are thinking?

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.347
And the whole tactic of crying

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.432
until they get their
way is maddening.

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.727
I hate to break it to ya, pal,
but crying's like, their job.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.646
Anywho, here's what you wanted.

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.105
An application,
exam appointment,

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:12.899
and a copy of the test.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.151
I went through hell
getting these.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.361
I appreciate it, Franky.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.447
If she can memorize the answers,
we have a real shot at passing.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.032
Got some intel on the girl.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:24.410
Dug up some records, stuff
the orphanage didn't have.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:26.162
Not a thing about
her birth, though.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.164
Or her real age,
or parents, either.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.083
It's strictly
from the last year.

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:33.461
It says that she's been adopted
and returned four times now.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.588
She's on her third orphanage.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.384
"Anya Williams,
Anya Levski, Anya Roche."

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.843
[FRANKY]
Changes names like you.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.554
You guys are a perfect match!

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.849
Relax, I'm just kidding.
Focus on your mission.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.142
She may be a cute little kid,

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.770
but watch that you don't get
too attached to her, you know?

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.480
[TWILIGHT]
Your concern is touching.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.607
What the--? Hey!

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.109
Stiffed me.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.654
Forget kids, who in the hell
knows what spies are thinking?

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:06.953
[ANYA]
This is boring.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.372
I thought spies were
a whole lot cooler.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.083
Like we'd be looking
for bombs and stuff.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.294
[TWILIGHT] I can't have her
messing with my spy equipment,

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:15.878
so I'll have to lock it all up.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.714
The code is 6, 1...

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:19.173
[ANYA]
...1, 0.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.676
[ANYA]
Bomby-bombs! Bomby-bombs!

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.428
Hm?

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.804
Huh?

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:30.101
[ANYA]
Bomby-bombs! Bomby-bombs!

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:33.730
Ahh! A spy radio!

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.274
Sending secret messages.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.358
[beeping]

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.820
[HENCHMAN A] Boss! We've
intercepted a new transmission.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.488
[EDGAR]
Using the West's cipher?

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.490
No, doesn't seem to be.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.869
Wait, it's saying,
"This is Twilight here."

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.329
Hang on, Twilight?

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.373
This is the frequency
Western intelligence uses.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.376
Oh, there's more.
"Catch me if you can."

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.338
[EDGAR] Get a location
on the source, stat!

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.008
[sighs]

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.343
[gasps]

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:07.055
Now you know I'm a spy,
I'll have to make you disappear.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:11.142
[ANYA] If he finds out
I do telepathy...

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.353
...he'll make me leave.

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.229
[RESEARCHER A]
Anya, you can't tell anyone

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:18.232
about your power, remember?

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.318
It's time for you
to study again, Anya.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.487
[ANYA]
Aww, but I wanna draw.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.906
Don't concern yourself
with childish things.

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:25.740
We need to figure out

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:28.743
how to use your special
power for world peace.

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.411
There's no time for tears.

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:33.498
Playtime's over,
and you need to study.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:42.548
[TWILIGHT] I hope she hasn't
trashed the apartment.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.510
Oh, yeah, gottta move this.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.677
Huh?

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.909
The hell are these guys?

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:11.744
Anya!

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.162
Anya!

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.457
Kidnapped.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:19.877
Who sent these thugs
here? And why?

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.005
[TWILIGHT] I've gotta find her.
Okay, calm down.

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:25.299
Obviously, this location's
been compromised.

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:29.262
So first off, I need to
secure somewhere safe.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:33.057
As for Anya, there are lots
of other children out there,

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.810
just have to start over
from square one.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.648
[EDGAR]
Who the hell's the brat, anyway?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.650
Is it Twilight's kid
or something?

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:43.734
[HENCHMAN C]
No clue.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.821
She was where that message
came from, so we nabbed her.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.030
[ANYA]
'Cause of the secret message?

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.490
[HENCHMAN C] She was
holed up in the apartment

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.492
with a barricade out front.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:52.535
Do you know why?

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:53.578
[HENCHMAN C]
Beats me.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:54.704
[EDGAR]
No matter.

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:57.748
I think she still might prove
useful to us as a hostage.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.208
We could force Twilight to steal

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.836
the foreign minister's
toupee right off his head.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:02.712
[HENCHMAN D]
Boss.

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:05.798
Maybe we should ditch
the whole toupee thing.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.134
[EDGAR] Transparency is
essential in government,

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:09.802
so toupees are a no-go.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.596
[ANYA]
A pistol with a silencer.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.097
[EDGAR]
Plus, the minister's a traitor

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.057
who's been secretly
backing the West.

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:19.103
And anyone who takes a traitor's
side must be a traitor, too!

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:22.148
[ANYA]
He's gotta be a pro bad guy.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:23.900
Boss!

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:27.403
Looks like Nguyen and his crew
are back from the apartment!

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.030
[NGUYEN]
We got him.

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:32.116
Nicely done.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.994
This dude sure as hell
moves like a pro.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.370
He's the real deal.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:38.080
[HENCHMAN E]
Get yourself together, man.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:41.209
[EDGAR] Now that I have
your attention, Twilight,

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.420
why don't you return those
photographs you stole from me?

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:46.130
[grunting]

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.548
What's goin' on? He was just--

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.008
[HENCHMAN C]
The kid's gone!

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.052
[EDGAR]
He got me again!

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.470
[TWILIGHT]
This was a mistake.

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.264
Going into enemy territory
put the mission in jeopardy.

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.600
I'm not fit to be a spy.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.185
[NGUYEN]
Shut up kid, you're okay.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.229
I'm not gonna hurt ya.
You don't have to be scared.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.147
[ANYA]
Papa!

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.441
[TWILIGHT]
This is why kids suck.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.736
Yeah, I guess I know why
the sound of them crying

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.655
makes my blood run cold.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:14.450
Because it reminds me of
my own rotten childhood.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.411
Not a single person out there
ever tried to save me.

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:20.540
I was completely alone and
powerless in the world.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.209
Only thing I could do was cry.

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.586
I thought I'd left all
that baggage behind me,

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.463
but you can't do that forever.

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.299
Something's gonna
trigger those memories.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.636
Now listen to me, little girl.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:34.720
[ANYA]
Anya.

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.389
So, listen, Anya.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.017
Me and my pals there,
we're all pro tag players.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.311
When we see someone who
looks like they can play,

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.605
we challenge them to a game.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.440
[ANYA]
Oh. Papa is a liar.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:47.358
Look.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.403
If you start heading straight
down this street and turn right,

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:51.988
you'll find a police station.

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.490
If you can hand this paper
over to a police officer,

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.575
you win the game.

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:56.534
You got that?

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:57.577
[TWILIGHT]
If she shows them this,

00:17:57.618 --> 00:17:59.412
they'll put her in
a better orphanage.

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:01.998
I can't have a kid mixed
up in this mission.

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.791
Gotta rework the whole plan.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.669
Okay? Now, run!

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.963
[TWILIGHT]
I'm not cut out to be a spy?

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:12.800
No. I just should've never
put this kid in danger.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:16.220
How could I forget I'm working
to create the kind of world

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.931
where kids won't have
to cry like that.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.559
<i>That's</i> why I'm a spy.

00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.478
[banging]

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.022
[HENCHMAN C]
Don't let him get away!

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:27.231
[HENCHMAN E] We're gonna
drag him outta here

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.859
and show his face to the whole--

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.862
[HENCHMAN C]
A trap? When did he--?

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:35.406
[HENCHMAN E]
Ugh. This flour, or--?

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.991
That Twilight?

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.410
Don't shoot! It'll blow!

00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:44.332
[HENCHMAN F grunts]

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:46.083
[HENCHMAN G groans]

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:50.838
What in the--?
You're kidding me.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.675
Turn around and you're dead.

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:56.552
[EDGAR]
Twilight.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.055
[TWILIGHT] Good day, or perhaps,
good evening, Edgar.

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:01.057
Tell me, how's Karen doing?

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:03.392
[EDGAR] How do you know
my daughter's name?

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:06.020
[TWILIGHT] It's my job.
That's what spies do.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:09.273
I know her height, weight,
shoe size, favorite foods,

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.942
and the location of
every mole on her body.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.778
She's got nothing
on your rap sheet,

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.696
but I know all the times
she's broken the law.

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:17.114
That's absurd!
My Karen would nev--

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.950
[TWILIGHT] Edgar, I also
know how much you care

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.244
about your daughter, so listen.

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:23.871
If you want your
precious girl to have

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:28.167
any kind of a normal life,
you'll leave me the hell alone.

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:33.047
[TWILIGHT]
If you want that, go home now.

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.396
Huh? Anya?

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:51.649
Papa! Papa!

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.484
Uh. You're still here.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.570
I mean, what are you doing
outside of the house?

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:59.657
I, uh, just came down here
to do a little shopping,

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.325
but I guess they're
out of business.

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.452
[ANYA]
Papa is big-time liar.

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:06.122
I was just out playing
tag with some old guys.

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:09.125
[TWILIGHT]
Oh. Did you have fun?

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:11.961
[ANYA]
It was kinda scary.

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:17.091
I wanna go home.
Back to our place, Papa.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.802
You do? You're sure?

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:22.930
[ANYA] If you leave me
behind, I'm gonna cry.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:26.308
[FRANKY] She's been adopted
and returned four times now.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:31.647
[TWILIGHT] Anya Williams,
Anya Levski, Anya Roche.

00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:35.651
[TWILIGHT]
Okay. Well, let's go home, then.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.365
[TWILIGHT] But we should move
out of that dangerous apartment.

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:43.117
I actually saw a
venomous snake there.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.161
[ANYA]
I don't like snakes.

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:47.496
[ANYA] Papa might be
the world's biggest liar,

00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:49.832
but he's a cool liar.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:51.584
I wanna live in a castle.

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.836
[TWILIGHT]
Sure, if there's one to rent.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.713
Once we're there,
you've got to study.

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:56.422
[ANYA grunts]

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:57.882
[TWILIGHT] As long as you
memorize all the answers,

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.384
it'll be fine--easy enough.

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:08.559
[bell tolling]

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:13.397
[INVIGILATOR A]
All right, children, begin!

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:18.444
[TWILIGHT] I'm counting on you,
Anya. You've got this!

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.154
[overlapping voices]

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.572
[BOY B]
This is so hard!

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:22.990
[BOY C] I don't know
any of these answers!

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:26.076
[GIRL A]
Um, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:42.760
[TWILIGHT]
K-212. K-212.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.890
It's there!
You passed! Way to go!

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.350
I did good?

00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:51.936
You did really good! You--

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.188
[ANYA]
Ah! Papa!

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.564
[TWILIGHT]
I relaxed for a second

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:57.983
and all my exhaustion
hit at once.

00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:01.821
I relaxed? How did
that even happen?

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:03.322
What the hell's wrong with me?

00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:06.617
[ANYA]
Please wake up!

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:05.801
Well, he's dead.

Um, I'm Anya Forger.

00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:16.145
Could you please give this
to your mommy or daddy?

00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:17.271
There is no Mama.

Oh, I mean, sorry.

00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:23.569
Papa! The mailman
brought this for you!

Ah! What are you doing?
Are you trying to kill me?

00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:47.927
[TWILIGHT] Can't believe I fell
asleep in front of someone.

00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:49.845
That's unacceptable.
I gotta get a grip.

00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:51.430
There's mail!

00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:56.769
[TWILIGHT]
A letter from Eden College.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.437
