00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.907
That's the place
where I saw Papa die!

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.201
We have to stop it!

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.249
To prepare for
the upcoming summit,

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:10.003
here in Berlint's city center,
security is very tight.

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:12.589
Not only has traffic
flow been restricted,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.842
but press access as
well, unfortunately.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.603
[ANYA]
We made it to the clock place!

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.609
[ANYA] I can't figure out
where Papa's gonna die.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:37.780
Mister Doggie! Let me see into
the future with you again!

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:38.740
[gasps]

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.408
[ANYA] Right before
everything blew up,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.952
I'm pretty sure the
clock went "bong"!

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.622
One of the hands was
pointing to the top!

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:48.708
That means we have till, uhhh...

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.587
[ANYA]
I can't read the clock!

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:55.465
What do the long hand and
short hand mean, anyway?

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:58.551
Which one is which?

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:01.304
[ANYA]
Excuse me, sir.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.891
How many more minutes will it be
till that clock goes "bong"?

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.685
[OLD MAN A] Oh, you mean
the bell in the tower?

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.021
It's supposed to ring at
the top of every hour,

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:13.233
so we've got about 30 minutes
until the next one.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:14.943
[ANYA]
Fank you fery much!

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:18.780
Thirty minutes. We gotta hurry!

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:22.242
So how long is 30 minutes?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.495
[ANYA yelps]

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.293
Hey. What's wrong,
Mister Doggie?

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:41.177
[ANYA]
Uh! That's the bad guy boss!

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.685
[KEITH]
No! Stay in the car!

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.359
[ANYA]
He found us!

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.707
[KEITH] Get back in there
right now, you stupid mutt!

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:13.084
I'm in a hurry, damn it!

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.711
[ANYA sighs]

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.212
[KEITH] Gotta get the
hell outta here quick,

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.506
before anybody sees me!

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:26.222
[KEITH] I threw that thing
together, so I hope it works.

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:29.183
At least now, the trap is set.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:33.396
[gasps] He's the one that
causes the esplosion!

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:36.649
[KEITH] Just try and come
after me, you idiotic swine.

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:39.986
The moment you set
foot in there, kaboom!

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.155
It's in that building!

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.952
[KEITH] The explosion is bound
to cause some collateral damage,

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:51.331
but sacrifices like
that are just part of it.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:54.792
Hmph. At least they'll be
dying for our country.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.587
They should consider
it an honor.

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:05.678
[ANYA]
This is bad!

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.972
We gotta do something
about that bomb!

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:08.765
Let's see.

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:11.142
The big hand went
from six to seven,

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.436
so I'm pretty sure there
seven minutes left.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:16.939
Anyway, umm, we gotta hurry up!

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.411
[ANYA]
I think that's it.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.042
--[DOG barks]
--Oh, right!

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:39.587
If I open the door,
we are gonna go boom-boom!

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:47.929
[ANYA] I think I can climb
through that little window.

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:53.434
[ANYA]
Will you push me, Mister Doggie?

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.026
[ANYA]
Uh! There's the bomb.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.783
[ANYA] If I can disarm it,
I can save Papa!

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:17.417
Uh. But how do you...
disarm a bomb?

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:19.377
[ANYA] On TV, they keep
'em from blowing up

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.921
by picking a red or blue wire.

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:25.425
They cut it, and that's it.
Which one, though?

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:29.971
Uh-oh, all of the
wires are black!

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.473
I don't have scissors
for the choppy chop.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:37.019
What do I do?
I'm gonna run outta time!

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:40.314
If Papa comes here,
I'll tell him he can't come in.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:42.358
But then he'll figure out
that I'm not normal

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.444
and he pro'ly won't
want me anymore.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:46.696
But if Papa dies, I'll be sad

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:50.032
and world peace will
be in big trouble!

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.131
That must be point B-one.

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.592
The northernmost room
on the third floor.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.720
All right, time's runnin' out.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:16.934
[SENIOR AGENT A]
What the--? A message in blood?

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.687
Wait, do you smell that?
I think it's ketchup.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:22.982
"No eggplant doorknob"?
Some new kinda code?

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.234
I don't believe there's
anybody still here,

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.986
but let's proceed with caution.

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.989
We don't have time to sit around
second guessing ourselves.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.657
The minister's heading
out any minute.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:35.620
I'm not lettin' some college
punk get the drop on us.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:47.173
[ANYA] Papa, did you see
the message I wrote in blood?

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:49.884
He's too far away for
me to read his mind.

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:52.887
I really hope he's okay.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.141
[ANYA screams]

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:06.484
[ANYA] That's what time it
was in the future, I think!

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:09.487
Is it gonna blow up?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.908
[ANYA]
It didn't!

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.035
Did we do it?

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:31.175
I saw Papa again!

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:35.680
So... you and me
saved the future!

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:38.766
Something feels off.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:43.854
This code is here for a reason,
so we can't act rashly.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.280
[TWILIGHT]
As I suspected, it's a trap.

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.740
Opening that door would've
sent us sky high.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:58.411
So this thing is supposed to
be a bomb and not an eggplant?

00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:00.288
Too close for comfort.

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:03.332
I guess that means somebody
must've been expecting us.

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:06.877
Well, then who drew this
weird warning message?

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.505
I don't think we have time
to figure all that out.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:12.341
The Secret Police have
arrived on the scene.

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:13.968
We should leave the
message up on the door

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.053
and let them disarm the bomb.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:19.015
We need to get away
from here, quickly.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.685
[JUNIOR AGENT A] We never found
Keith, though, did we?

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:27.189
Hard to investigate with the
Secret Police snooping around.

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.859
Then let's head to
the minister's location.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.694
We threw a wrench in their plan,

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:35.448
so our suspect may resort to
more desperate measures.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.492
[SECRETARY A] Minister Brantz,
it's just about time.

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:40.244
Let's head to the
reception area.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:43.414
Some of their Foreign Affairs
agents will escort us.

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:45.875
[BRANTZ]
Can't seem to take a step

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:48.753
without the eyes of
the state watching.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.923
Well, there has been
some terrorist activity.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:56.469
You're telling me WISE hasn't
eliminated the suspects yet?

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.471
Talk about a worthless bunch.

00:18:58.512 --> 00:18:59.347
[knocking]

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:01.349
Huh?

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.475
[TWILIGHT]
Pardon me.

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:04.935
I'm with the
intelligence service.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.567
Minister, step into the car

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:14.445
and my team will
drive on ahead of you.

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.991
[BRANTZ]
Hmm...

00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:22.662
Right this way, sir.

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.956
[BRANTZ] No, I'd rather
take a car on my own.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.708
[DRIVER A]
Uh, sir?

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.127
[BRANTZ]
Why don't you all go home, now?

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.671
[DRIVER A]
Sir!

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.223
[TWILIGHT] I should be
far enough out of sight.

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:43.933
So that must mean
he's using the dog

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:46.060
to track my scent and follow me.

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.688
What in the hell is
going on here, Sylvia?!

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:50.231
One of your boys
showed up to my room

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:53.776
and proceeded to steal all
the damn clothes off my back!

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.528
I need that suit, please.

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.405
[gasps]

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:59.824
[BRANTZ] You running some
kind of clown show, or what?!

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:03.953
I apologize, sir, but urgent
action was necessary.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:08.541
I presume he needed your scent
to throw the dog off your trail.

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:12.128
Our agent should be at a safe
distance with the enemy in tow.

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:14.338
So leave now, while you can.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.382
Oh, but put on
some clothes first

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:19.176
to spare an international
embarrassment.

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:22.847
Huh? What in the--?

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:27.268
[KEITH]
He changed his route?

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.898
Is he changing it up again?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.655
Something's not right.
Why's he keep going in circles?

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:48.247
Got eyes on Keith.
Car, gray coupe.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:51.250
From what I can tell,
he's got one dog with him.

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:54.670
We'll start boxing
him into Blue-four.

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:57.298
[KEITH] Wait, he's heading
back to the hotel?

00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.383
No, he's going to the river.

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:02.136
Shouldn't be many people around.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.054
Perfect!

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.682
[KEITH gasps]

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:12.813
Damn it!

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.905
No, no, no!
Hit the brakes, right now!

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:26.035
He got us good.

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.746
Still packing serious firepower.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.123
Be careful,
he's heading your way!

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.756
[gasps]

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.299
[KEITH]
Where'd he go?

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.097
[KEITH]
Bingo!

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:51.435
Idiot. Guess I should thank him
for makin' this easier for me.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:52.853
[KEITH]
Go!

00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:57.066
[KEITH] The moment those
fangs start biting down,

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:59.443
it's boom time!

00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:10.830
[KEITH] You're not getting away
from a trained dog, old man.

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:23.259
No way! The minister's
moves are just insane!

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.928
I thought he was some
frail old geezer!

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.764
Damn it! I'll lose
sight of him!

00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:35.604
[TWILIGHT]
I'm truly sorry.

00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:37.481
I'm sure the last thing
you wanted in life

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:42.027
was to get dragged into some
