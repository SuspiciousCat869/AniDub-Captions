WEBVTT

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:51.028
Really? Well, you don't say.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.989
Yes, really! Of course,
I've been saying it all along.

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.199
Oh, good morning, Misses Forger.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.535
You look rather blue,
is something wrong?

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:02.331
Am I just gonna be thrown
away like a piece of trash?

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.207
I got so worked up
over that tennis game,

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.419
but it won't make any
difference in the long run.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.630
What in the world?

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.840
Obviously her husband
cheated on her.

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.133
Not a doubt in my mind.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:17.095
My word, what kind of
despicable person is he?

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.056
I've always said that
you can't trust a man

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.223
that looks that good.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.768
The women flock to him
like flies on sugar.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.895
[NEIGHBOR A] Maybe she should do
like the lady in apartment 15

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.105
and have the Secret Police
teach him a lesson.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.440
[NEIGHBOR A laughs]

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.734
[TWILIGHT] Is Yor getting
suspicious of Nightfall?

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.694
This could be very bad.

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.072
Not only would my cover
be put in jeopardy,

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.824
but if she talks about
it to her brother...

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.451
He hurt my feelings, Yuri.

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:42.454
I knew this would happen!
I'll get every agent on it!

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.122
He's gonna hang for
what he did to you!

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.416
[TWILIGHT] It's an
extremely likely scenario.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:47.876
[ANYA]
Whoa!

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:49.336
[BOND barks]

00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:51.797
[laughs] Got you now, Bondman!

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.174
Curse you, King Scruff!

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:55.217
[FRANKY laughing]

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:58.136
[ANYA yells, laughs]

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.304
I wanna draw now.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.305
[FRANKY laughs]

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:04.017
This magical color-changing pen
I invented should come in handy!

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.310
Oh, yeah! I even
brought a Frisbee

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.521
so the pup can play, too!

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.189
[ANYA]
Woo-hoo!

00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:13.151
Okay, well, thanks for looking
after the place while I--

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.904
How many times do
I have to tell you

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.156
I'm not a babysitter anyway?

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.826
And I told you, Franky,
I have to clear up

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.828
Yor's misconceptions
about my colleague.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.037
The mission's in trouble.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.872
[FRANKY] Then have a
family meeting at home!

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.457
[TWILIGHT] There are some
things I don't want to say

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.418
in front of the you know who.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.669
And so...

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.170
[FRANKY] You can't just
throw money at me every time

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.798
I have a legitimate
concern, ya know?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.591
Okay, guys, it's party time!

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.010
Let's go to the park!
Sound like fun?

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.138
[ANYA]
Yay!

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.639
[BOND barks]

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.439
[TWILIGHT]
Yor!

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.065
[YOR]
Sorry, work got a little hectic

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.859
so I had to stay kinda late.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.361
Oh, it's okay.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.989
So, uh, tonight, we're...

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.450
We're going to relax
and have some drinks.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.493
I know the perfect spot.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.753
One Red Queen for the lady.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:13.920
Thank you.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:17.507
Scotch, as usual.
And leave the bottle.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.763
I appreciate all you do.
For Anya, and the house.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.306
So cheers.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:27.893
Oh. Cheers to you!

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.853
[YOR]
This is kind of weird.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.396
I get the feeling Loid
has something

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.565
he wants to talk to me about.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.776
[TWILIGHT] Anyway, I just
wanted to say thanks.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.903
But I'll still trade
you in for Fiona.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:38.987
[NIGHTFALL]
Good evening.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.072
[TWILIGHT chuckles]

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.116
[YOR]
That's gotta be it!

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.994
And by the way, about that whole
thing with Fiona yesterday--

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.079
Yeah?!

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.206
[TWILIGHT]
You okay?

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.458
[YOR]
I'm fine. Sorry.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.376
[YOR]
What am I gonna do?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.753
If he wants me
out of the family,

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:58.340
that's gonna be a
real problem for me.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.550
But still, I knew going in

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.011
this was a marriage
of convenience.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.472
What Loid wants to
do with his life

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.724
is really none of my business.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.267
So, uh...

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.020
[YOR] If he has romantic
feelings for her,

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.189
then I shouldn't stick around.

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.192
I need to just try to leave with
as much dignity as possible.

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:18.860
[YOR]
Listen, Loid.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.904
If this is really what you want,

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:27.452
then I'd be happy to...
to just, um... I, uh...

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.580
[YOR]
What's wrong with me?

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.083
[YOR]
I...

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.668
[YOR] It's like the words
are getting caught

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.795
in my throat or something.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:40.006
Because I want this
to last? Or what?

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.132
Get real.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.301
Loid deserves to be
happy, and honestly,

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.179
he doesn't owe me anything.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.015
Okay, booze! Give me strength!

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.976
Or just knock those words
right outta my mouth!

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:54.396
Still not enough!
Let me have yours, too!

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:58.567
Hang on! Drinking all that
at once will kill you!

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.277
[YOR]
Loid...

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.778
Huh?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.739
Just who in the hell
is that woman anyway?

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.952
Are you in love with her, Loid?
What's the deal? Huh?

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:11.621
[TWILIGHT] That's exactly what
I wanted to talk about, Yor.

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:16.042
Oh? Yeah? So you were in a
relationship, huh? How long?

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.836
Well, I just wanna
say I wish you both

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.462
all the happiness
in the whole world,

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.464
and I don't even know what the
hell I'm even saying anymore!

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.924
[TWILIGHT] Fiona's just
a colleague of mine

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.259
and nothing more!

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:26.678
I promise you,
that's all there is to it!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.973
[BARKEEP A] Must be tough
to be so handsome.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:34.436
[YOR] I can handle it.
I know I'm a big ol' zero.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.146
And I'm not as pretty
and don't have...

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.148
Are you even listening to me?

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.524
[TWILIGHT]
Wait a minute.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.278
[YOR] But you said before
that I was pretty, too.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.072
I guess you were just lying
to me to get your way.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.157
[TWILIGHT]
I had thought she was worried

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.867
about our arrangement
coming to an end

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.578
because she'd lost faith
in her domestic abilities.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.246
But this feels like jealousy.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:56.625
But you've just gotten
sick of me, haven't you?

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:00.295
[TWILIGHT] I think Yor actually
has romantic feelings for me!

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.048
[TWILIGHT]
It's fine, I'm Twilight.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.674
I've had relationships
with countless women

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.052
for the sake of my missions.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.096
[TWILIGHT] I didn't mean to
make you worry. I'm sorry.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.473
[TWILIGHT]
If she really feels this way,

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.642
I have to use it for the
sake of <i>this</i> mission.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.310
Time for Operation Honey Trap.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.646
Please, Yor. Please
don't lose faith in me.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.689
Huh?!

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.733
You don't hate me now, do you?

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.737
[YOR] Hate, uh? Uh, no.
I wouldn't say that.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.823
Look, Yor, the time
we've spent together...

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.409
...has made me realize
my true feelings.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:36.748
[stammering]

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.251
So I say let's get
married for rea--

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.630
[YOR screams]

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.011
Huh? The hell'd I just do?

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.101
[TWILIGHT]
I couldn't've been more wrong!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.811
That kick doesn't lie.

00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:00.605
That wasn't embarrassment.
It was true rejection!

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.691
Not even a hint of
romance in there!

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.568
I got cocky and completely
misread the situation.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.904
I'm so sorry, Loid!
Are you okay?

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.823
[TWILIGHT] But what was she
so upset about before

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.282
that she almost killed me?

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.659
Was it some kind of reverse trap

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.703
to get me to initiate
my honey trap?

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.329
Is Yor a spy, too?

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.957
No, that's ridiculous.
I need to calm down.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.501
I really mucked up that
emotional assessment.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:24.879
Maybe being with Yor's
thrown me off my game.

Time to rise and shine,
my little sleepyhead.

[TWILIGHT]
Where in the heck are we?!

And how long was I out for?

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.463
We just went to the
little park by the bar.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.840
The big meanie bartender said
we were being too loud

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.133
and kicked us out.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.177
You were only asleep
for like five minutes.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.470
[TWILIGHT] I haven't been
knocked out like that

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.888
since my training days.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.931
Have I really let myself
get that sloppy?

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.393
Also, why I was I using
her lap as a pillow?

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:24.522
I'm sorry, Loid. For everything.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.732
Of course you'd get sick

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.276
of a clumsy, muscle-headed
woman like me.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:32.030
I'm so bad at all the normal
lady kinda stuff.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:48.129
When I was a little kid...

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:51.091
Although I can't remember
her face anymore,

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:54.135
I loved being in
my mother's arms.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.930
There could be bombs falling
outside in the distance

00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.141
and I'd still sleep soundly
when I was with her.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:04.354
Because she was so strong.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.023
One of Anya's favorite
things to tell me

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.858
is that she doesn't have
to worry about much

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.237
because her mama
will always save her.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.698
She wouldn't be so
happy and energetic

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.285
if you weren't around
to make her feel so safe.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.538
[TWILIGHT] We WISE agents are
trying to rebuild the world

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.540
through blood, sweat, and tears.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:27.752
But we need true strength
like hers to keep the peace.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.505
You're incredibly strong, Yor.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:33.591
Given our situation, it might
be kind of odd to hear this,

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.177
but you're already
a wonderful mother.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.596
[YOR] I think he means a
different kind of strength

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.181
than what I have.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.600
I have no intention of
replacing you in that role,

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.018
so you don't need to worry.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.772
But what about Piona? She seems
like a strong lady, too.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.608
I'd never even considered
asking her to do that.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.570
Seems like she'd have
zero parenting skills.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.738
[YOR]
But in my case,

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.700
I'd just been taking care
of Yuri for so long

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.743
that I tried to do
something similar.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.788
[TWILIGHT]
But that's just it, though.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.290
It's something you've
been perfecting

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.457
since you were little,

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.376
so of course you're
the best at it.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.545
You should be proud.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.547
That's why I'd love nothing more

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:16.050
than for you to keep being
a great mother to Anya.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:22.765
And obviously,
keep being my wife.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.395
Well, I humbly accept, Loid,

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.856
if you both still want
me around that is.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:33.109
Heh. Of course.
Your nose is running.

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:36.196
Thanks. I'm sorry
'bout all that, Loid.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.488
Shall we head home?

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.199
[YOR]
Oh, definitely.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.410
I'll make you some hot
tea once we get there.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.079
Mama and Papa are late.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.040
Must be off shacking
up somewhere.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.626
[FRANKY] Where did you learn
to say things like that?

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.419
[ANYA]
Mostly from Becky.

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.379
I hope they're home soon.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:57.175
Anya, honestly, do you
like your mom and dad?

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.510
Huh? I love them.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.638
I see.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.099
[door opens]

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.726
[TWILIGHT]
We're home.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:12.315
Mama and Papa are
flir... ting...

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:13.775
[FRANKY laughs]

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:14.442
[FRANKY]
Holy cow!

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.069
Did you put the moves on
her and get clobbered?

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.404
No, no! It's not like that!

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:19.822
[ANYA]
Big 'ol chin monster.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.532
[FRANKY] Why don't you
take a gander up close?

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.327
Stop! No way! Don't touch it!

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:27.038
[YOR]
It's all a big surprise for me.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.456
Because growing up,

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:33.127
my only real attachment
in life was to Yuri.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.214
I never imagined that
I would feel this way

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:40.009
about anybody or anything else.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.263
[NARRATOR]
The next day...

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.057
Oh my gosh! Why is there a
chin monster on your face?

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:49.978
Wait, you mean you forgot
everything about yesterday?

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:52.939
[NARRATOR] ...they had the same
conversation all over again.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.906
[DAMIAN] So that little get
together is next week.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:02.573
Well.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.410
That's not really
applicable to us just yet.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.746
I'm planning on getting eight
Stella as soon as possible.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:09.914
[EWEN]
You will!

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.583
[ANYA] Papa is on a mission
called Operation Sticks

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.836
to be friends with
Second Son's papa.

00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:17.005
I can help by being
an Imeperel Scooter

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:20.258
so we can go to
the fancy meetups.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:25.930
The thing is, I kinda gave up
on getting eight Stella Stars.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:30.893
Studying's hard.
I'm still bad at sports.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:34.397
And I'm really tired of
not being good at stuff.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:38.151
So I gotta go all in on Plan B,
the Friendship Scheme,

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.153
to get closer to Second Son,

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:41.904
but it hasn't been
working too good so far.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.740
What are you looking at, uggo?!

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.825
Go beat up some patients
with your dad.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.535
I'm running out of patience.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.287
I don't know if my heart
can take much more

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.331
of watching you like this.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:52.665
I know what you're
going through.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.042
It's a classic dilemma.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:56.919
Telling someone you love them
is such a tough thing to do.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.004
Love who?

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:05.386
I love Papa. I love Mama.
I love peanuts. I love cartoons.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.430
But Second Son...

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.307
No way. No how.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:12.560
Aw, it's cute that you're
shy, but get real!

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.980
Okay, I know! I'm gonna help
you make him fall for you.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.815
He won't have a choice.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.524
[ANYA]
Hm?

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.318
Boys are suckers for cute girls.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.320
So we just need
to make you cuter.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:23.863
We'll get you in
the perfect outfit

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.115
and he'll be putty
in your hands.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.033
[ANYA]
Huh?

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:30.203
So this coming weekend,
you and I...

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:32.121
...are going shopping!

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:35.833
[ANYA] I've never been in a
car this fancy! It's so cool!

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.252
I mean, yeah, it's
good enough, I guess.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.587
But what's the deal?

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.881
I went all the way to your
apartment to pick you up

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.050
and my darling Loid
wasn't even there!

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:47.470
Loid, oh Loid!
Wherefore art thou, Loid?

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.473
Thank you so much for looking
after our daughter today.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:52.642
[ANYA]
Papa had a 'mergency at work.

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.770
[BECKY] And of course Mister
Dreamy Loid's wife is so pretty.

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.563
I'd say she's a worthy rival.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.108
[MARTHA] You mustn't
commit adultery, my lady.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.235
That pochette is
really cute, Anya.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.112
What did you bring?

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:07.031
Oh. A stack of cold hard cash.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.033
[TWILIGHT] Being on good
terms with the Blackbells

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.910
will be extremely advantageous.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:13.788
Surely WISE will approve
a bit more in the budget.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.580
Here you go.

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.124
Oh, wow!

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.375
[ANYA]
My allowance.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:20.044
[BECKY]
Oh, he is such a sweetheart.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.712
Could've given you more, though.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.756
[MARTHA]
Kids these days.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.551
[ANYA] How many peanuts do you
think I could get with this?

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.970
[BECKY] We're not buying
peanuts, silly.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:32.974
We are getting you into some
cute and stylish looks.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:46.654
[EMPLOYEES] Welcome, Miss Becky.
It's good to see you today.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.197
We've prepared
quite a few pieces

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.450
from the Berlint
Collection for you.

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:52.118
That's perfect.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.204
Is your dad some kind of evil
mastermind or something?

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.498
How much cold hard cash you got?

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.127
Oh, I've never carried cash
on me in my entire life.

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.379
Usually, the shops
bring stuff to me.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.256
But today, I wanted to
have the experience

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:06.507
of shopping with you,

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.177
so I rented out this
whole department store.

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:11.471
Just try on as many
outfits as you can.

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:14.849
And we'll find the one
that'll capture his heart!

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.819
Yes! It's all super
adorable, Anya!

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.739
But cute as you may be,
I'm still way cuter!

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.324
You're breaking out
of your shell.

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:34.118
We're seeing a fabulous,
brand-new you emerge!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.663
Uh... Might need to crawl back
into the shell a little.

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:40.333
On the other hand, high
fashion takes courage!

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:42.877
Oh, now that is insanely
fashionable, Anya!

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.086
It's like you went
so far out there,

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:45.880
you managed to break through
the barriers of style

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:48.299
and got freaky!

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.552
[ANYA]
Fashion is really hard.

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:52.970
You got that right.

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.889
We don't really know
what Damian likes,

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.766
so it's kinda hard
to narrow it down.

00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:57.975
But when I go to school,

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.436
I have to wear the same
ol' thing every day.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.772
How will I get to
show him what I got?

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:05.483
[BECKY] Well, yeah, we have to
wear our uniforms to school,

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:06.984
but if the teacher
says it's okay,

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.986
we can wear our own clothes
to the big dorm party

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.363
at the end of the semester.

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:13.074
And that'll be your
time to wow him!

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.408
[BECKY]
Hang on a sec!

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.202
If the parents are
invited to the party,

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.120
then it could be my chance, too!

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:20.206
[TWILIGHT] You're such
a lovely young lady.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.542
I'm Anya's father, Loid.

00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:23.876
What am I even doing?!

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.753
I've wasted so much time
shopping for Anya,

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.214
I forgot about me!

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:32.760
Okay, what kind of style
is my dreamy Loid into?

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.930
[EMPLOYEES cheering]

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.640
[EMPLOYEE B]
So cute!

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.725
[BECKY] Should I go for the
classic, tried-and-true,

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:40.935
cute-as-pie look?

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:44.355
[EMPLOYEE A]
Aww! Miss Becky!

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.442
[EMPLOYEE C]
How lovely!

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:50.861
[BECKY]
Or is he a fan of couture?

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:53.114
[EMPLOYEE D]
You look amazing!

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.700
Maybe something like this?

00:17:56.784 --> 00:18:00.413
Or perhaps... I'll show
my sophistication.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.125
Or maybe... I'll try
something more familiar.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:05.293
[EMPLOYEES chattering]

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:07.211
[EMPLOYEE C, EMPLOYEE D]
You're too cute!

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:08.546
[BECKY]
Hmm...

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.257
I'm just being pulled in
so many directions today.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.843
And every one of them
looked fabulous on you.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:16.137
I guess I'll have to buy
all of them, then.

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:18.681
Thank you very
much, Miss Becky!

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.474
[BECKY] Which one are
you getting, Anya?

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.436
My tummy's too full to
look at any more outfits.

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:27.607
[BECKY] Huh. Well, do you
wanna go look at some shoes?

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.253
[BECKY] I'm starting to feel
a little tired, too.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:52.882
Uh-huh. I think I almost
shopped myself to death.

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:55.718
[BECKY] You'll live.
Stop being dramatic.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.803
[MARTHA] My lady, I'm afraid
you've bought too much.

00:18:57.845 --> 00:19:01.307
Martha?! Are you somewhere
in all those boxes?

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:02.308
Oh.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.227
Wait. Anya, you still haven't
bought anything yet.

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.772
I don't have a clue
about what I want.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.941
I told you, fashion is hard.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:16.072
Be honest, Anya. Did you have
fun shopping with me?

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.239
Oh, yeah!

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.574
[gasps]

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:21.369
This is my very first time to
go out shopping with a friend!

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.995
It's so cool!

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.122
I'm your friend?

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:28.334
Well, in that case,
let's get right back into it.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.836
And that means we need to focus
on what you really want to get!

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:33.673
What I really want is
cartoon toys and stuff!

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:36.926
[BECKY] They don't carry
anything like that here, though.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.639
I think there may be
a plushie shop nearby.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.349
[ANYA]
Who is this Mister Sheep?

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.936
[BECKY] Uh. Oh, he's the
department store mascot.

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.146
[BECKY]
You see that?

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:52.983
Apparently, this place started
off selling wool, so...

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.528
So cute. I want one!

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:58.197
[BECKY] Huh? You're talking
about a key chain?

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.741
Maybe you're not as
mature as I thought.

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:03.369
I just wanna remember
my shopping trip with you.

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:04.161
[BECK gasps]

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.539
[ANYA] As proof that
we lived through it.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.583
Umm. Then maybe I should get--

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:10.584
[BECKY'S FATHER]
Don't forget.

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.169
A daughter of the
Blackbell family

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:15.715
should only wear
the finest of things.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.633
[BECKY grumbles]

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.596
[ANYA] Here! I got an
extra one for you, too!

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:24.682
[gasps] Wait, seriously?

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.809
[ANYA]
I wanted to be a big sister.

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.060
I don't know...

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:30.104
[MARTHA] Your friend
is being quite generous.

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:33.691
Please don't rebuff her.
It'd tarnish the Blackbell name.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.777
I'm positive that's what
your father would say.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:40.114
Uh, then I suppose I
don't have a choice.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.200
It's a bit embarrassing,
but I'll take it anyway.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.285
Thank you.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.662
And now you should
try getting real.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.664
[BECKY] So why did we even
go shopping today

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:49.623
in the first place?

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:50.750
[ANYA]
I forgot.

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.711
[BECKY]
Well, whatever. Let's go home.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.933
[GIRL A cries]

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.603
Becky is the meanest girl
in the whole wide world!

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:13.397
She's always saying mean things!
She's just a big ol' bully!

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:14.273
Oh, yeah?!

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:17.109
I'm just calling you a brat
because that's what you are!

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:19.195
That's quite enough,
young lady!

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.238
Eden College? No way!

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.240
I heard about that
in nursery school.

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:26.535
I don't wanna be lumped in with
all those ill-bred commoners.

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:28.537
I hate it. But whatever.

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:29.997
I guess growing up
means you have to do

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.165
what other people want

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:33.417
and keep smiling
through all the bad stuff.

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:36.504
Now. my lady, don't fool
yourself into believing

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.589
you have it all figured out.

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:40.674
Once you admit to
what you don't know,

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:44.345
you'll be on your way to
becoming a proper adult.

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:48.140
[BECKY]
Listen to this, Martha!

00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:50.392
There's a really funny
girl in my class!

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:53.687
Maybe school's not
so bad after all!

00:21:56.023 --> 00:22:00.027
I'll get you something
next time.

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:04.323
Well, I'm very proud
of you, my lady.

00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:08.369
This little thing was 300 dalc?

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.412
It's me and Becky's
special treasure!

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:12.456
[BOND]
Jealous.

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:16.043
[BECKY]
Good morning! Hey, Anya!

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.212
Good morning, please.

00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:22.091
Look, we match!

00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:24.051
We both have extra cuteness!

00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:26.387
I hope the teachers
don't get mad at us.

00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:27.304
It'll be cool.

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.848
[BECKY]
Ha! Yeah, we're fine!

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:33.727
[BOTH laughing]

00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:38.983
Is something the matter,
Lord Damian?

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:42.069
[DAMIAN]
No, nothing! Jeez!

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.876
[inaudible]
