WEBVTT

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.769
The time has come at last.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.896
Have everything?

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.148
All clear, sir.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.025
[TWILIGHT]
Appearances in order?

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:50.819
All clear, sir.

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:52.738
[TWILIGHT] And how will
you be speaking today?

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.532
Like this, please!
Got it, please.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.827
[TWILIGHT] I certainly don't
feel good about this,

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.163
but we've done all that we can.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:08.879
[TWILIGHT] Onward to the
Eden College interview!

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:11.882
[YOR]
It's huge!

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.259
[TWILIGHT] It is the country's
premier prep school.

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.054
[YOR] And there are
so many applicants.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:18.930
[TWILIGHT]
You mean rivals.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.266
Will you be okay
in this crowd, Anya?

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.685
Think so, please!

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:26.146
Let's move.

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:29.524
[TWILIGHT]
This feeling, I know it well.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.736
There's no mistaking it.

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:34.780
Someone's watching us.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.449
Perhaps an enemy hidden
in the crowd?

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.575
[ANYA]
An enemy?

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:40.786
[YOR]
I feel someone's gaze.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.913
[TWILIGHT]
No, that's not it.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:46.041
We're not the only
ones being watched.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.126
It's unpleasant, regardless.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.462
Hm? Gotcha.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:53.757
Four overhead,
four in the bell tower,

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.468
and more in the
windows to the sides.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.595
I've gathered intel on
the majority of the staff

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:03.642
at this school, and who's
watching are the instructors.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:06.186
They're observing every action
that each applicant takes

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:09.731
and scoring them to see
if they're worthy of moving on.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.610
In other words, the exam
has already begun.

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:15.612
I need you two to
be on your guard.

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.489
The examiners are everywhere.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.699
Huh?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.784
[TWILIGHT]
Just stick to the plan.

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.577
[INSTRUCTOR A]
D-68, fail.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:23.995
[INSTRUCTOR B]
A-12, fail.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.248
[INSTRUCTOR G]
G-114, pass.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.834
[HENDERSON] We've some poor
examinees this year.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.753
They all lack any true elegance.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.339
[INSTRUCTORS] Good morning
to you, Housemaster.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.800
[HENDERSON] To think their
crude feet are trudging upon

00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:39.469
the blessed ground
of our school.

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.097
Elegance is at the
root of tradition.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.975
Elegance is what will bring
about a better world.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.936
Fail any family without
it immediately.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:49.646
[INSTRUCTOR C]
Yes, sir.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.314
[HENDERSON]
Hm?

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:53.900
[HENDERSON]
Oh.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:01.491
[HENDERSON] It appears that
not all hope has been lost.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.743
Hm?

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.996
They are paying respects to
the statue of our late founder.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.290
[TWILIGHT]
I am a man of a thousand faces.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.375
My very existence
relies on being

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.753
exactly who my target
wants me to be.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:13.795
Like this.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.088
[YOR]
I haven't the slightest clue

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.590
as to who this gentleman is,

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:20.302
but if I follow Loid's lead,
everything will work out, right?

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.596
[ANYA]
Baldy-baldy!

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:27.768
Why... that was elegant!
Very elegant, indeed!

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.770
Who is that family?

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.481
[INSTRUCTOR D]
K-212. The Forgers, sir.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.900
Their daughter Anya just barely
passed the written exam

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.735
with a score of 31.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:40.781
[HENDERSON] Inelegant in
score and in handwriting.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.199
Oh. Ahem.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.992
So the father's remarried?

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.995
Could they be a fake family
for the sake of admission?

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.706
I don't know.
We'll have to find out.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.084
We must ascertain whether or not
they have true elegance.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.294
[INSTRUCTOR H]
We'll confirm your interview

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.504
appointments here!

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.381
[INSTRUCTOR E]
G-114, continue on to Hall One.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:02.344
Uh, A-12? You're
over in Hall Two.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.679
[TWILIGHT]
They're already classifying us.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.098
[INSTRUCTOR E]
You're K-212, huh?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.143
It's straight ahead to Hall One.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:13.146
We're still being observed.
Keep your guard up.

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.899
It's so nerve-racking
being watched like this.

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.734
[ANYA]
I kinda gotta pick my nose.

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:18.819
No, you do not.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.362
[BOY A]
Oh, no!

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.864
I've accidentally fallen
into the gutter,

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:23.824
and now I can't get out!

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.369
[TWILIGHT]
Hm. An obvious test.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.081
No one's approaching him.
They're suspicious, too.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:34.000
But if I'm right, then we
need to deal with him.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.585
[BOY A]
Oh, woe is me!

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:36.795
[gasps]

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.505
[ANYA]
Papa! Mama!

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.466
Someone needs our help, please!
Let's save him, please!

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.050
Anyone?

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.135
[TWILIGHT]
Are you all right?

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.429
[BOY A] Ah! I've slipped
and I cannot get up...

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.266
[BOY A] Remember,
you need that extra credit!

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.559
[HENDERSON chuckles]

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.603
[HENDERSON] Precisely, you're
heading to an interview.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.939
You wouldn't sully your
clothes with sewage.

00:05:55.981 --> 00:06:00.318
Now, how will you elegantly
get past this obsta--?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.736
[BOY A yelps]

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.447
[gasps]

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.867
So, are you hurt?

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.077
Here's my hanky, please?

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.788
You should go to the
nurse just in case.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.707
[HENDERSON]
I expected too much.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.960
In the end they're just
some commoners.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.588
No one sets foot in
our garden of learning

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.007
wearing soiled clothes.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.135
[HENDERSON]
Throw K-212 out immediately.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:25.844
[BOY A]
Aww, man.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.763
These nice people are
gonna fail because of me.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.265
Hey, um, I'm really sorr--

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:32.392
[YOR]
Glad we anticipated this.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:33.184
What would we have done

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.103
if we hadn't brought a change
of clothes with us?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.354
[HENDERSON]
Who in their right mind

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.399
would ever anticipate
something like that?

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.526
Besides, now that we've
seen everyone else,

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.778
I think your grey
suit fits in better.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.447
Yes, if we hadn't changed,

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.949
I'd have looked like a
commoner for the interview.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.536
Thank you for giving us the
opportunity to reevaluate, lad.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.829
[gasps]

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.916
[HENDERSON] On top of that,
they even thanked the boy!

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.835
Brilliant! Such an
intelligent move!

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.962
And so very elegant!

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.256
Curse your cunning, Loid Forger.

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.967
Housemaster,
we're testing the child?

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.387
[HENDERSON] Silence!
Children emulate their parents!

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.098
Which means, if she's
worth 31 points,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.892
then so are they!

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:17.103
I'll make you reveal
your true identity yet!

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.523
[bell clanging]

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:21.608
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.109
[MAN A]
Oh, no!

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.529
The animals have escaped
the farmhouse!

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.866
[TWILIGHT] Bit much for
a test, don't you think?

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.369
[WOMAN A]
Hey, don't push!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.204
[TWILIGHT] Maybe they think
we'll show our true colors

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.622
in an emergency.

00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:38.625
We'll be playing right into
their hands if we panic.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.585
Don't break Formation D.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:43.588
We'll handle these
animals with grace!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.508
[HENDERSON] Hey. Whose
ridiculous idea was this?

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.885
Wait, it wasn't yours?

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:54.349
[HENDERSON] Don't tell me...
Is this an actual crisis?!

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:57.102
There are very important people
among the examinees!

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.020
Go stop this mess
before they're hurt!

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.398
[VICE MINISTER A] I'm number two
at the Ministry of Finance!

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.692
[BANKER A] So what? I'm the CEO
of the Central Bank!

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:07.195
Wait for me! Father!

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.532
Ah! Well done, young man!

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.993
You're safe.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:15.912
Loid! It's happening again.

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.456
[TWILIGHT]
The mass panic must've hit her.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.334
[TWILIGHT] I've had it up
to here with these tests.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.754
[TWILIGHT] That must be
the leader of the herd.

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.506
I need to stop them.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:29.843
I do have my gun, but...

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.636
[YOR]
Watch Anya for a moment.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.138
[TWILIGHT]
Yor?

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:52.449
[gasps]

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.783
[YOR]
It's not what you think!

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:54.951
I learned about the
pressure points

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:57.746
connected to movement in
yoga classes years ago!

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.582
I thought they might
work on cows, too!

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.208
Don't look at me like that!

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.376
[gasps]

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:07.547
Ms. Cow? Are you scared?

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.466
Uh! Stay away from it!

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:10.884
[gasps]

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:17.557
S'okay, please.
Don't be afraid.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:20.894
What did I say?

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.395
Ah.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.359
They're all going home now.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.737
[TWILIGHT]
Hm. Apparently so.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.031
We're lucky that
no one was hurt.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:37.160
[HENDERSON]
S-S-S-S-Such ele--!

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.745
[HENDERSON screams]

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:42.499
Such elegance!

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.500
[HENDERSON screams]

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:44.584
[INSTRUCTOR C]
Housemaster?

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.211
[HENDERSON]
Forger!

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.465
[TWILIGHT] I recognize him.
One of the housemasters.

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:53.134
Is he in charge of this exam?

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.845
I thank you for your assistance.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:10:00.558
Also, you have bested
me for today.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.353
To give us all time to collect
ourselves after this chaos,

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:06.147
we'll be briefly
delaying the interviews.

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:07.816
Return to the hall once
you've had a moment

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.275
to tidy yourselves.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:14.197
After today, your family has the
right to apply to our school.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.031
Sir?

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:18.451
[TWILIGHT] Looks like we
haven't failed just yet.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.328
[TWILIGHT]
I thank you for your generosity,

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.915
but there's no need for a delay.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:28.837
We anticipated this and prepared
another change of clothes.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:32.006
[HENDERSON] Uh! This is
no longer about elegance!

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.175
These people are just scary.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:41.141
[NARRATOR] And so, the Forgers
made it to the actual interview.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.476
[SWAN]
These are basic questions.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.770
Why even apply if you
can't answer them?

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:46.646
[BOY C]
Huh?

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.857
Cat got your tongue, boy?

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.568
I-- Um, uh...

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.197
[FATHER A]
Thank you all very much.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.992
Come on, what kind of a
pathetic answer was that?

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.785
[BOY C cries]

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.871
[TWILIGHT] I've been a spy
for over a decade,

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:06.833
and for the first time,
I'm actually nervous.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.501
I've gone undercover
in a dangerous

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.253
terrorist organization.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.172
I've stopped a nuclear
missile from launching

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:15.216
with only one second
left on the countdown.

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:17.552
But nothing compares to this.

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:21.556
Hinging my success on civilians
is truly terrifying.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.310
Next family. The Forgers.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.769
--[TWILIGHT, YOR] Here.
--[ANYA] Yes!

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.149
[TWILIGHT]
There's no doubt.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:35.278
This is the most crucial
moment of Operation Strix.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.654
[TWILIGHT]
Thank you for having us.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.865
[HENDERSON]
There you are.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.742
[TWILIGHT]
This is information warfare,

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:44.245
and the Forgers
will not be outdone.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:47.332
[EVANS] Well then, we usually
like to start these off

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.043
by asking a few questions
of the parents.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:53.129
[TWILIGHT] The housemaster of
Malcom Hall, the fifth dorm.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.757
Mild-mannered, sincere,
and conservative.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:58.092
The students are
very fond of him.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.095
As long as we respond with
earnest, logical answers,

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.264
we'll score highly with him.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.892
[EVANS] I was informed that
this is your second wife.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.894
May I ask how you two met?

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.812
[TWILIGHT]
Straight to the point, eh?

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:12.774
Eden College does care
about family values.

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:14.609
We met at a tailor shop.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.987
The very one this school uses
for its uniforms, in fact.

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:21.574
I was in awe at how gracefully
she carried herself.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.327
Having lost my first wife, and
with a daughter to take care of,

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:27.664
I was hesitant to pursue
a new relationship.

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:28.623
But the more we spoke,

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:32.418
the more I knew we
were kindred spirits.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.047
She's truly kind and cares
dearly about family.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.591
I could tell she would get
along well with my daughter.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:41.427
[EVANS] Ah, and what
do you think of him?

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:45.265
Well, I think Loid's
a great person.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.809
He loves his daughter
more than anything.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.853
And he's quite considerate
of me as well.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:51.896
[EVANS]
Hmm.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.607
I'm happy to hear you have
such an affectionate family.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:57.151
Why would an attractive
young woman such as you

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.195
even want to marry
a man with baggage?

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.657
That was rather uncouth,
Master Swan.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.576
[TWILIGHT] Housemaster of
the second dorm, Cline Hall.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:09.497
He's the only son of the former
headmaster, and a legacy hire.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.292
Arrogant, greedy, and callous.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.168
His wife filed for
divorce last month,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.214
and he just lost custody
of his daughter as well.

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.717
Judging by his demeanor in
the previous interviews,

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.635
he's clearly jealous
of other families

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.054
and treats them poorly.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.557
It's best we avoid
provoking him.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:29.434
Now onto our next question.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:33.187
Could you tell us why it is you
chose to apply to our school?

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.439
For one reason.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.065
[TWILIGHT] To get close
to my target, Desmond!

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.567
The instructors at
this establishment

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.402
are second to none.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.363
Obviously, you're all very
knowledgeable and cultured,

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:43.364
but more importantly,

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:47.493
I want my child to stand
among this country's elite.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.829
And the faculty of the
prestigious Eden College

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.708
is the most qualified to
prepare her for greatness.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.710
[HENDERSON]
Elegantly done, Loid Forger.

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:58.087
I knew I saw potential in you.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.838
I see.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.007
I would love to hear one of
you describe your daughter

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.550
in your own word next.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.260
Strengths, weaknesses.

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.429
Your honesty is a
given, of course.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.513
[TWILIGHT]
Of course.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.433
Anya is an extremely
curious child.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:13.811
I suppose one could argue that
her nosy nature is a weakness,

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.938
but it stems from
her intelligence.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.357
[HENDERSON]
Her intelligent?

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.733
[ANYA gasps]

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.401
Sometimes she sees
right through me,

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.487
and I'd swear she's
reading my mind.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.572
It keeps me on my toes.

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:27.408
I'd say her main flaw
is she's a picky eater.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.493
[EVANS]
Hmm.

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.036
And would you be so
kind as to illustrate

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:32.705
your parenting style
for us, madam?

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.124
[YOR]
Just like we practiced.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:39.212
As you are already well aware,
I'm not her biological mother,

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:41.214
so at first, I spoiled her.

00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.841
I hoped it would help
me win her favor.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.386
But I've had to learn
to be a bit stricter.

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:47.720
Now I strive for balance

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.680
so she'll grow into
a fine young lady.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.099
Your husband just
mentioned your daughter

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.559
is a bit of a picky eater,
which begs the question,

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.020
what kind of meals
do you cook at home?

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.482
Huh? What meals
do I cook? I, uh--

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.901
I actually do most
of the cooking.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.736
Of course, when I'm too busy to,

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.863
my wife's kind enough
to fill in for me.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.240
[TWILIGHT]
Not that that's ever happened.

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.282
[SWAN]
You're joking!

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.993
What kind of wife doesn't
even cook for her husband?

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:13.246
You should probably be
stricter with yourself

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.164
before you worry
about that child.

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:17.792
Everyone has strengths
and weaknesses.

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:21.087
She is extremely tidy and
keeps our house spotless.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.131
She's also an excellent
mother to my daughter.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.842
[SWAN] Yes, well, those are
all things I'd hope a woman

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.552
would excel at, don't you agree?

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.302
That's not--

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.263
It's okay, Loid. Don't worry.

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:30.888
[EVANS]
Now, now.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.849
[TWILIGHT]
Yes. Calm down.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.017
Why are you getting so
irritated, Twilight?

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:38.312
I mean, she's not
even your real wife.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.275
[SWAN] Tch. Look at these
pretty little lovebirds.

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:43.693
I could puke.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:46.612
I'll just keep jabbing away
at them until they slip up.

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.824
If these smug idiots don't fail,
there's no justice in the world.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:52.243
[ANYA]
He doesn't like Papa and Mama!

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.870
I gotta pick up the slack!

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.664
[EVANS] Uh, anyway, why don't
we ask the child herself

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.040
a few questions now.

00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.000
[TWILIGHT]
Here it comes.

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.879
[EVANS] First, could you tell us
your name and address, please?

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.755
My name's Anya Holger!

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.508
And my address is in Berlint.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:12.346
West District,
120... 8 Park Avenue!

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.514
[EVANS]
Thank you very much.

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.516
And what do you do
on your days off?

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:18.352
[ANYA]
We go to museums and eat operas.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.147
[TWILIGHT] Good. They're asking
questions we prepared for.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.482
[EVANS]
What would you like to do

00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:24.400
once you get into this school?

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.319
I, uh, maybe...

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.403
[ANYA]
What was it?

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:28.905
[TWILIGHT]
I know what I'll do.

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.407
Get close to Desmond, boss
of the enemy organization,

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:34.202
at a social gathering and
find out what he's planning.

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.162
I'll find out what the
organization boss is planning!

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:38.080
[TWILIGHT]
Wait, what is she saying?

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.624
[EVANS]
The organization boss?

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.042
Perhaps you meant
the headmaster.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.418
[TWILIGHT chuckles]

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.005
I apologize. My daughter is
rather ambitious, you see.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.007
She's very curious about
the lives of people

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:49.717
in leadership positions.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.177
[HENDERSON]
Oh, she wants to learn

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.763
from her predecessors
at such an early age.

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:56.390
That's quite elegant.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.894
Then I trust you know the name
of our headmaster, young lady?

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.188
Oh, yeah. Be-- Be--

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.816
[TWILIGHT]
Yes. Benedict Ivan Goodfellow.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.277
Mister Benedick
Advent Goodhellow.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:08.903
[HENDERSON]
Hmm.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:12.156
How about this, do you
truly understand how hard

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:16.244
one has to work to
succeed as he has?

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:18.829
It's like trying to get through
a jungle with no supplies,

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.165
or dancing with death over
and over to get brave,

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.376
like disarming bombs and stuff!

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:25.253
[TWILIGHT] She just described
that training montage

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:27.046
in your spy cartoon.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.090
[HENDERSON]
Such incredible resolve!

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:32.176
It appears I've underestimated
this young lady.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.095
I don't think it would
be that tough,

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:35.638
but you've got the spirit.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.557
Anyway, on another topic,

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:39.559
what does your father
do for a living?

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.521
He's a sp-- Father's a
spectacular psychiatrist.

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:46.148
[EVANS] A little stuffed
up are we? Poor thing.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.359
Now then, you've
got a new mother,

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:49.986
how do you feel about her?

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.280
[ANYA]
She's very nice.

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.615
But she's scary sometimes.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.909
If I were to ask you to
give your parents a score,

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:57.868
what would it be?

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.288
Out of anything.

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.248
A perfect hundred points.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.585
They're so much fun, and I
love them very, very much.

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:08.588
I wanna be with them forever.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:11.632
[SWAN] Ugh. God, no one
needs this rubbish.

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:14.176
Well, between your
new and old mother,

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:15.720
who would you give
a higher score?

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.263
Master Swan.

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.180
[SWAN]
What?

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.349
May I please request
a different question?

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:24.061
You may not. She answers
or loses points.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.731
[TWILIGHT] I don't know how she
ended up in that orphanage,

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.817
but there's a good chance
her parents are...

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:38.200
Mom... my...

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.370
Anya.

00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:42.163
[ANYA]
Mommy.

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:44.290
[SWAN]
Well, that answers that.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.500
So you do prefer
your old mother.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.585
This is cruel!

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:48.711
Let's calm down, Yor.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.379
But she--

00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:52.214
[TWILIGHT]
Remain calm for the mission.

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:55.551
[SWAN] The students in our dorms
rarely even see their parents.

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.720
We don't need crybabies.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.221
If that brought her to tears,

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.182
she'll never survive
at our establishment.

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:04.435
[TWILIGHT] Who cares if
he's being slanderous?

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:08.064
We're nothing more
than a pretend family.

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.649
This doesn't matter at all.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.734
Whoa, Misses Second Wife.

00:19:11.776 --> 00:19:14.445
Don't snap at me just because
she loves you less.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.365
[SWAN
Now I feel better.

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:20.618
[TWILIGHT]
Stand down... Twilight!

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.495
[thud]

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:32.672
Sorry. There was a mosquito.

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.173
Thank you very much
for your time.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:38.928
Where do you think you're going?
The interview's not over!

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.930
If this is what you
call education,

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:43.557
belittling a child's
feelings like that,

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.726
then we've chosen
the wrong school.

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:46.644
[gasps]

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:47.436
[SWAN]
What?!

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.647
You dare disgrace Eden College?!

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.482
[TWILIGHT]
Come along, you two.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.817
Please excuse us.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:56.320
You'll never set foot in my
school again, you hear me?!

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.531
[HENDERSON] Master Swan,
that is quite enough.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:01.033
Are you taking issue
with my processes?

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:02.702
He may not be the
current headmaster,

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.954
but my father still
has sway here.

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:08.791
It'd be wise for you to
watch that mouth of yours.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:12.378
Now, hurry up and
call the next one in!

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.672
[TWILIGHT] And the faculty of
the prestigious Eden College

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:19.343
is the most qualified to
prepare her for greatness.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.595
[HENDERSON] Those who grovel
at the feet of the powerful

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:24.724
have no right to call
themselves educators.

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:27.935
[HENDERSON] He was not the one
who disgraced our school today.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.311
Huh?

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:37.570
[HENDERSON] Hmm. All things
with elegance, I say.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.864
And with that, I can face
you with the pride

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:44.785
of an Eden College
educator, Forgers.

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:49.999
[TWILIGHT]
That's it, we failed.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.878
[YOR]
Um, I'll go make us some tea.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.380
[TWILIGHT]
Again, I've failed as a spy.

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:59.383
I let my feelings get in
the way of the mission.

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:02.762
[ANYA]
Papa. I'm so sorry.

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:06.474
I shoulda done better
at the interview.

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.768
I'm really sorry.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:12.521
[TWILIGHT] It's all right.
You have no reason to apologize.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:16.358
You don't want to go
a school like that.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.693
Huh?

00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:20.821
[ANYA]
But I do wanna go to school.

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:23.324
[ANYA]
'Cause if your mission fails...

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.452
[ANYA]
I have to go to school there.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.538
[ANYA] ...we won't be
together anymore.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.540
Anya.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:33.292
[YOR]
If she isn't accepted,

00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:36.712
then our life
together will be over.

00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:38.631
But it's not as though
that matters.

00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:41.675
I'm just worried how this could
affect my work, is all.

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:45.930
Yeah, to be totally honest,
things aren't looking so good.

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:47.348
[ANYA gasps]

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:50.893
No. I'm sure it'll be okay!
Everything will work out!

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.895
The grandpa with the
glasses and the grandpa

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.897
with the half-glasses
were really nice!

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:58.317
[YOR] Yes, exactly!
I know they'll vouch for us!

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:00.486
We just have to believe.

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.240
[TWILIGHT]
Spies don't believe in anyone

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.658
other than themselves.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:10.579
They always expect and prepare
for the worst-case scenarios.

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:13.499
[ANYA]
I wanna be with them forever.

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:17.795
[TWILIGHT]
But maybe it wouldn't hurt.

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:21.382
[TWILIGHT] Yeah. Well, it's out
of our hands now anyway.

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:24.301
All we can do is celebrate
our hard work.

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:29.473
[TWILIGHT]
For now, I'll just enjoy this.

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:32.810
To our family's bright future!

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:36.397
Uh! Something fell!

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:38.858
[YOR] That doesn't seem
like a good omen.

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:40.192
It does not.

00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:43.737
[NARRATOR] What will become
of the mission now?

00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:20.542
[inaudible]
