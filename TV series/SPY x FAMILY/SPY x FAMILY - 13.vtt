00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:10.677
[NARRATOR]
While the nations of the world

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.514
waged a fierce war of
information in the shadows.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:16.767
There were two countries
particularly at odds.

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:21.647
Ostania in the east,
and Westalis in the west.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:22.648
In order to keep an eye

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.942
on a leading figure in
Ostania's government,

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.944
Westalis began a
top-secret mission

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:30.155
called "Operation Strix."

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.658
With the master of disguise
known as Twilight at the helm,

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.826
phase one of the plan
has been completed--

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.662
creating a false
family as a cover

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:41.208
and enrolling his "child"
in the esteemed Eden College.

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:44.670
[NARRATOR]
The father, a spy.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.130
The mother, an assassin.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.466
The daughter, a telepath.

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:51.093
To ensure the success
of the mission,

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.762
this trio must hide
their true selves.

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:56.640
Anya's heroic deed has
earned her a Stella Star,

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.267
the first of eight
required to become

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:01.436
one of Eden's exclusive
Imperial Scholars.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.605
Now the mission moves
on to phase two--

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:05.857
securing an invitation
to attend the gathering

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.318
that will place Twilight
right next to their target,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.445
Donovan Desmond.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:57.177
[KEITH]
All right. Locked and loaded.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.471
Let's get this started.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.516
[ANNOUNCER A]
Now for our top story.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:03.600
Yesterday afternoon,

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:06.311
Foreign Minister Brantz and
his entourage from Westalis

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.648
were greeted by top officials
at Berlint Airport.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.526
The much-anticipated ministerial
summit begins tonight,

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:16.196
where the parties will talk of
peace between East and West.

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:27.165
[YOR gasps]

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.500
Oh, no, are you okay?

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.170
[TWILIGHT] Anya, careful
not to eat too quickly.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.256
[ANYA]
Fanks for the food!

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.509
Come on, Mama and
Papa, it's time to go!

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.386
[TWILIGHT sighs]

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:41.680
So much energy.

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:44.558
Can you blame her, though?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.685
Today's the big day.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:52.357
[ANYA] Borf, borfie, borf-borf.
Borf, borfie, borf-borf.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.985
I'm glad to see you so happy.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.904
Hey, you think Mister
Doggie eats peanuts?

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:01.158
I'd be careful trying
to find that one out.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.745
Puppies have special
food they like.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.288
[TWILIGHT] What appears
to be a family outing

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.373
is part of Operation Strix.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:12.335
Our destination: A pet shop.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.587
And here we are.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.338
[ANYA gasps]

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.591
[TWILIGHT] Anya has expressed
wanting a dog as reward

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.051
for earning her first Stella.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:22.763
[TWILIGHT]
She needs seven more

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.681
to get us into Desmond's
social scene,

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.808
so it's crucial that we
do whatever it takes

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.435
to keep her motivated.

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:31.813
[ANYA] Good doggie.
Borf, borfie, borf-borf.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.857
[PET SHOP OWNER A]
Welcome.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.738
[PET SHOP OWNER A]
Well, sir, what do you think?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.823
I assure you, the dogs
have all been through

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.116
a rigorous training regimen.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.826
[TWILIGHT] This pet shop
works with our agency

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.870
selling war dogs.

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:48.705
I thought it'd be best
to get a guard dog

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:53.001
for numerous reasons, however...

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:53.502
Wow!

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:57.714
What a bunch of smart and cute
puppies, huh? Don't you think?

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:02.636
[TWILIGHT]
That's a no face!

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.222
She doesn't want any of them!

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.932
Uh, do you have any
smaller models

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.767
that may be a tiny bit adorable?

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:09.976
[PET SHOP OWNER A]
Hmm...

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.647
I suppose I could consult
with a breeder that I know.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.819
Apparently, a shelter
is putting on

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.904
a big adoption event right now.

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:23.448
[TWILIGHT] Good, we'll try
our luck over there.

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:29.329
[TWILIGHT]
Looks like I've got a new order.

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:34.167
Uhh... something's really not
agreeing with my stomach.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.920
You two go on ahead to the
shelter by the train station.

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.421
I need to find a bathroom.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:41.675
Uh, oh, Loid, are you okay?
We can wait for you!

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.844
Papa takes a whole lotta
time in the crapper,

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.804
so we should probably go.

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:48.974
I didn't consider that.
Let's go on, then.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.059
You should watch your
mouth, young lady.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.395
[TWILIGHT] I appreciate
the cover she's given me,

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.231
but at what cost?

00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:57.649
[TWILIGHT]
Wait, you didn't say anything

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.485
about taking me all the
way to headquarters.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.029
If I'm gone too long, they'll
start getting suspicious.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:07.826
Well, you can take that up with
Handler. This is an emergency.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:11.746
[TWILIGHT] A plot to kill
Foreign Minister Brantz?

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.290
It's very likely
they're planning

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.833
to target tonight's event.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.752
We believe it's a group of
isolationists, all young people,

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:21.089
mostly students who are
attending Berlint University.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:24.384
The Secret Police has had their
eyes on that group as well.

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.345
Luckily, we picked up one
who was casing the embassy.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.472
He's currently
being interrogated.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:33.018
But he's not talking, won't give
up any info on his cohorts.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.521
Right. And that's the
reason I was called in?

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.398
Bein' an agent and a dad,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.942
sounds like a tough
balancing act to me.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:44.070
Being a father is a big
part of the mission.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.741
Not sure if I'm changing,
or it's just the times,

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.743
but a kid like this
being a terrorist

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.412
is a hard pill to swallow.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.706
[door opens]

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.461
[KRIS] Keep coming back all
you want, I'll never talk.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.922
I won't rat out my friends.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.343
That's fine. You're no
longer necessary.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.054
At least, now that we've
captured your leader.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.513
[gasps]

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.896
Ah! It's Keith!

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.606
Hey! That's the guy!

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:21.775
He's the one who planned
the entire thing!

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.152
He tricked everybody else
into helping him do this!

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.278
[KRIS gasps]

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.656
What the hell are you saying?
You know it wasn't me!

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.866
I'll tell you everything, okay?
I'm willing to make a deal...!

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:33.078
Shut up, will ya?
Keep walkin', punk.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.208
[KRIS] No way. Is he really
gonna try to pin this on me?

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.044
[HANDLER] Some friend he
turned out to be, huh?

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:45.090
Honestly, we don't care which
one of you is the leader.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:50.011
We just want to talk to whoever
gives us the intel we need.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.013
Now what shall we do with you?

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.724
Please, give me chance!
I'm not the one in charge!

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:57.185
I swear on my life,
all of it was his idea!

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.562
He's the mastermind!

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:03.316
Perhaps we can have a
nice conversation, then.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.151
[KRIS] Like I said, Keith
planned the whole thing...

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.028
[SENIOR AGENT A] I gotta say,
it was a stroke of luck

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.071
that we had some footage

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.824
of this Keith character
to go off of.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.826
It'd be luckier to have
a bit more footage

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.286
so I could play
the role perfectly.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.999
A true professional
would've been on to us.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.126
[KRIS]
And there's Kevin and Kim,

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.086
who're engineering students.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:25.547
Those are the only names
that I actually know.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:28.800
We've got two safehouses--
one's a warehouse near campus,

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.553
the other's above
a bar on 11th.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:35.181
How was the assassination
to be carried out?

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.853
With dogs.

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.855
Don't know how many they got,

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:45.775
but the plan was to strap some
bombs onto a dozen or so dogs,

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:49.279
and then they'd ambush him
while he was on the move.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.448
You're using bomb dogs?

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:52.866
Doesn't bode well.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:55.869
Stopping trained dogs'll
be no easy task.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.162
It's impossible.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.539
The kind of money all
that would involve...

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.124
For the cost of
training one dog,

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.293
you could purchase
a small missile.

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:05.003
I can't imagine
ordinary students

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.047
having those resources at hand.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.841
[SENIOR AGENT A] They must have
some deep pockets backing them,

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.301
like a far-right group,

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:14.929
or maybe even another
foreign government.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.097
[HANDLER]
As you heard,

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.017
we've got a real
problem on our hands.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.477
We'll have to make
the first move

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:23.438
in order to head off the attack.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.565
[TWILIGHT] Could they just
cancel the summit?

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:26.441
[HANDLER]
Doubt it.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.360
Not only would it be an
embarrassment for Ostania,

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.614
it gives the opposition
exactly what they want.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.325
Covertly leak this intel
to the ruling party.

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:36.451
I'm sure they're in no mood

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.787
for this kind of
international incident.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:39.496
Ma'am.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:43.124
[HANDLER] Sorry, but we'll need
your help for a bit longer.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.834
Understood.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:48.296
[HANDLER] East-West relations
are on exceedingly thin ice.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.883
If this reaches the public, even
a failed assassination attempt

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.427
may cause that ice to break.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:58.014
Whatever it takes,
we'll stop them.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:08.817
I'm gonna grab us some
coffee. Be right back.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.236
You pups better behave, ya hear?

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:14.906
[TERRORIST B] Heh. Wow, these
dogs are definitely smart.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.118
Though maybe a bit
long in the tooth.

[BOY A laughing]

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:31.297
[MOTHER A] Hey!
Careful not to trip and fall!

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.549
[BOY A]
Woo-hoo!

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.591
[TERRORIST B grunts]

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.260
Get back here!

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.933
[BOY A]
No! He's tryin' to eat me!

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.143

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.564
[PASSERBY A] That sign
just fell off the building!

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:50.108
[PASSERBY B] Thing nearly
took that kid out, too.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.277
Wow, you really saved
my life just now.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.154
Thanks a lot, doggie.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.196
[barks]

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:57.157
I'm so sorry about
my dog, ma'am.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.492
I told ya not to run
off, ya fleabag!

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:00.285
What's the matter?

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.580
[TERRORIST B]
Stupid mutt just bolted on me.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.957
I dunno, are these
dogs gonna work?

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:09.043
[TERRORIST A] Well, it's too
late for a change of plan now.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.044
Staked out the location

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.131
and got all the logistics
squared away.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.718
Plus, if we piss off Keith,
we'll be in a world of hurt.

[gasping]

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:30.398
[YOR] Wow, I never imagined
we'd see so many animals here!

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.108
Although I wonder why
didn't Loid suggest

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.278
checking this place out first.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.488
[ANYA]
Tiny li'l doggies!

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.616
And kitties!

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.825
And fuzzy bunnies!

I'm afraid you'll get
lost in the crowd!

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.998
Listen, Anya.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.585
Promise you won't leave this
area with the doggies, okay?

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.253
I promise.

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:55.673
[YOR]
Ah, that dachshund is adorable!

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.717
Look at its stubby little legs!

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:02.931
It's cute even with stubby legs?
So that means I'm cute, too.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:06.643
A Chew-wa-wa! A Pomper ray-nyan!

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:10.313
Are you looking to
adopt a dog today?

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.650
Is there a breed you'd say
is easy to take care of?

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.571
[gasps]

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:22.116

[TERRORIST B]
Keep movin', ya mongrel!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:41.302
[ANYA]
Did I read Mister Doggie's mind?

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.098
Well, there's toy poodles.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:47.642
They barely shed, so you won't
have to worry about that.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.352
[gasps]

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.062
Hey, Mama,
there's a doggie out there

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.439
that knows about our family!

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:57.318
Um, what in the world
are you saying?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.362
[gasps]

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.655
Shih Tzus are small,

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:04.158
not to mention incredibly
sweet and cuddly.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.999
[ANYA]
I'll be back in a minute.

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:15.211
[ANYA]
Some weird business?

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:21.092
[ANYA]
Where did he run off to?

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.435
Mister Doggie.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.527
[ANYA]
Who are you?

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.238
[KEITH] You better not
have done anything

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.157
to draw attention to us.

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.616
[TERRORIST B]
Don't worry, Keith.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.327
Place was crawlin' with
people and their dogs

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:49.912
'cause of that adoption thing.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.790
The big day's here at last.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.959
Once our plan goes down,
the facade of peace

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.794
between the East and
West will explode

00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:00.048
right along with the
Foreign Minister.

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:03.843
If we wanna restore Ostania
to its former glory,

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:05.678
it's clear what has to be done.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.557
Give Brantz the honor of being
the catalyst for war.

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:12.852
We'll bring those arrogant pigs
of the West to their knees!

This little brat heard
everything you just said!

What's a kid even
doin' here, anyway?

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.252
[TERRORIST B]
So, uh, what do we do?

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.545

Not so fast!

[TERRORIST C] Hey, calm down,
okay? She's just a kid, man.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.443
And if she tattles
to her parents,

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:05.947
we can kiss our plan goodbye!

doesn't scream.

[TERRORIST B] This one's got
a real problem with listening!

[TERRORIST A]
Maybe instead of training him,

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:23.798
we should put him down.

We can't have you

But what about all
the noise he's making?

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.241
Nobody's gonna notice that.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.368
I mean, with all
the dogs over there,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.371
this one barking
isn't a problem.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:00.793
Um, excuse me,

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.671
did you happen to see a little
girl who looks kinda like this?

I dunno.

[PATRON C]
Not that I remember.

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:23.733
[YOR] I don't see her. Like
she's not even here anymore.

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:27.653
Oh, no. I hope one of these
dogs hasn't eaten her!

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:32.158
No, get a hold of yourself.
That is extremely unlikely.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.119
Well, if that's not it,
was she kidnapped?

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.621
[ANNOUNCER A] There have been
a string of kidnappings

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.873
in Central Ariane
involving young women

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.833
who were abducted and
forced into marriage.

No! What am I gonna do?

Poor little Anya's gonna be
forced to marry some creep!

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.849
And Loid isn't even
here to help.

00:16:56.891 --> 00:17:00.478
Oh, what do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.438
I hope you're done in
the bathroom soon, Loid!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.440
We need you!

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.784
[HANDLER] Both of those
locations he fed us

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.953
had already been abandoned.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.579
Any luck on your end?

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.081
I believe so.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:23.042
They rented two vans under
the name of Kevin Knowles.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.878
Seems to be one
of the terrorists.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.296
The plate numbers are--

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:30.633
Excellent. We will
follow up on that.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:31.634
As for the dogs,

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.761
looking into where they
may've been sourced,

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:37.223
we discovered a lead that
could prove to be fruitful.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:40.393
I'm sure you've probably
heard of it before.

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:44.063
[HANDLER]
It's called Project Apple.

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.856
It was a research
initiative developed

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.150
under Ostania's previous regime,

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:50.695
with the goal of producing
highly intelligent animals

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.989
for military purposes.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.490
I'm aware of it.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.743
I'd heard they performed some
extremely reckless experiments,

00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.786
but the government collapsed

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:01.747
and the project was scuttled,
for good, it appears.

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:05.793
The ultimate results were far
below their intended goals, too.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:06.877
[HANDLER]
Right.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.672
And there are rumors swirling
that the dogs and other animals

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:13.676
wound up on the black market
instead of being put down.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.177
[TWILIGHT] And you suspect
that the terrorists

00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:16.971
got a hold of them?

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.348
[HANDLER]
It's a possibility.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.351
The experiment they survived
may have been a failure,

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:24.020
but in all likelihood,

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:27.398
they're still highly intelligent
and well-trained dogs.

We have no idea what
they may be capable of.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.241
Now just step away from
the dog, you little brat.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.327

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.948
But we just got word our
safehouses were raided!

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.660
Yeah? You think it might've
been the Secret Police?

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:24.288
What the hell?
Did someone rat on us?

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.791
I haven't seen or heard
from Kris all morning.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.251
Kinda thought something
might be up.

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.545
[TERRORIST C] Good thing
we changed locations.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.506
I want everybody
to keep it cool!

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:37.343
This just means we gotta
switch over to Plan B and--

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:40.888
The hell?! Where'd
she run off to?!

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.724
[KURT]
What? Uh. Hey!

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:48.437
[ANYA yelping]

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:50.523
Is Mister Doggie
really my friend?

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:51.732
[DOG barks]

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:54.110
[ANYA] Hey, how'd you know
the phone was gonna ring

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:56.487
before it happened?

00:19:56.529 --> 00:20:00.574
[ANYA] Is it 'cause...
you can see the future?

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:04.954
Is he like me?
Does he have a superpower?

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:11.001
[ANYA] Wait, go over into
that building, Mister Doggie!

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.046
We'll find Mama
and she'll save us!

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:16.674
You're going the wrong
way! Turn around!

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:17.133
[gasps]

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:20.177
[ANYA screaming]

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:22.513
Was that Anya just now?

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.473
[KEITH growls]

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.016
What are you dumbasses doing?!

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.601
[TERRORIST D]
I got distracted by the phone.

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.895
[TERRORIST A] It's not like
she can do anything.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.063
Let's get on with the plan!

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:33.941
You kidding me?!
She's seen all our faces!

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:37.319
Let's go, Kurt!
We'll take one of these mutts.

00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:39.155
You're going after her?

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.906
[KEITH]
Tear that map off the wall.

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.867
We gotta vacate this dump, too.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.494
You guys go on to the
location and spread out.

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.121
[TERRORIST F]
Got it.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:50.291
Doggie! Please stop! Let me off!

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.626
Someone! Please save me!

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.879
I'm being chased by
a bunch of bad guys!

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.964
That's the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

00:20:57.006 --> 00:21:00.634
Looks like an intense
game of tag!

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:04.054
[ANYA]
Mister Doggie runs super fast!

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.807
It's kinda scary.

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:17.026
[ANYA]
And so cool!

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:19.945
[ANYA]
Okay, Mister Doggie!

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.155
Let's just keep on running

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.699
and go straight to
the police ociffers!

00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:26.035
It's me and you.

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.454
We'll work together as a
team to beat the bad guys

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.790
and save the day!

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:34.752
And when we do,
Starlight Anya will shine again!

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.212
[DOG barks]

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.216
[DOG barking]

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:43.135
[ANYA]
Huh? Huh?!

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:50.559
You saved us a lotta trouble.

00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:53.437
You took us back there, Doggy!

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.272
Turn!

00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:02.196
You're not getting
away, pipsqueak.

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:04.323
Do it. And do it quickly.

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.700
Uh, okay.

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:14.124
Now don't take this
personally, kid.

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:20.422
[KURT yells]

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.143
[YOR] You think you'd
get away with this,

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:36.480
you kidnapping pervert?

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:40.150
No! Little Anya is too
young to get married!

00:24:15.913 --> 00:24:19.917
