WEBVTT

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:12.054
[NARRATOR] Everyone has
a secret side to them,

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.056
one they don't show anyone else.

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.516
Not to their friends,
their lovers,

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:18.185
or even their own
flesh and blood.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:20.395
Hiding their true
feelings behind a mask

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.064
of smiles and bravado,

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.483
and keeping their real
selves a mystery.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.693
This is how civilization
is able to maintain

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:30.280
its thin veneer of
peace and sanity.

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.491
While the nations of the
world waged a fierce war

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.159
of information in the shadows,

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.371
there were two countries
particularly at odds.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:40.582
Ostania plotted to turn up
the heat on this "cold war."

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.543
And Westalis hoped
to douse these flames

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:43.794
before they ignited.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:46.338
To keep an eye on a leading
figure in Ostania's government,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.133
Westalis began its top-secret
"Operation Strix."

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.844
The agent in charge of this
plan is known as Twilight.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.304
This master of disguise
was assigned

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.265
an identity most foreign to him.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.976
That of a family man.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.866
You made it. Is this everything?

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:20.909
It is!

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.203
[TWILIGHT]
Not much to contend with.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.505
[YOR] Loid, about the
sleeping arrangements.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.632
We're in separate
rooms, of course.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.468
We'll share one for appearances
if we have guests.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.804
Right, good thinking.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.348
I wanna welcome you
to Anya's house!

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.851
What a lovely welcome.
Thanks, Anya.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.770
[NARRATOR] Anya's house is home
to a rather unusual family.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.440
The father, Loid Forger,
is a psychiatrist.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:56.528
His true identity, spy.
Code name: Twilight.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.865
The mother, Yor Forger,
is a civil servant at City Hall.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:04.828
Her true identity, assassin.
Code name: Thorn Princess.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.874
The daughter, Anya Forger.
Her true identity, telepath.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.501
[ANYA] I'm so happy to
finally have a Mama!

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:12.544
Mama?

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:13.670
I'm gonna help you.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.173
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.340
My friend the judge was able

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.469
to backdate our marriage
certificate to last year.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.513
[TWILIGHT]
Meaning Franky forged it.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:24.806
[TWILIGHT] We'll figure
out what our story is

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.516
for why we didn't live together.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.810
I'm sure your brother
will ask, at least.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.645
Excellent idea.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.063
[TWILIGHT] Plus, the
school's approval board

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.648
would be suspicious
if we got married

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.609
just before the interview.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.527
[YOR] The shopkeeper said
this was all right,

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.155
so I don't have to
worry about that.

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:41.615
[ANYA]
So cool.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.742
[NARRATOR]
Father, mother, daughter.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.786
The trio created this
fictitious family

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.454
to further their own ends,

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:49.456
and now live under
the same roof

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:51.458
as they continue to keep
their true selves

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.543
hidden from one another.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.754
I'll show Mama around, Papa!

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:56.630
Once you're settled in,

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.466
we'll get prepped
for the interview.

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:02.928
[ANYA] Here's the kitchen!
Papa cooks real good!

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.846
[YOR]
Wonderful.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.644
There's the potty and bathtub!

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.896
Oh, it's very nice.

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:18.860
I can clean up all by myself!

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.196
[YOR]
Aren't you a big girl?

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:28.662
[ANYA] Dun-duh-duh-dah!
And this is my very own room!

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:32.624
[YOR] I love it Anya.
It's absolutely adorable.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:36.002
[ANYA] I want you to meet
my friend Mister Chimera.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.047
[ANYA]
My name's Chimera.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.675
It is a pleasure to
meet you, ma'am!

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:46.680
Aw, the pleasure is all mine.
I'm Yor, Miss Anya's Mama.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.891
This one is Papa's room!

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.103
Loid certainly does keep
things nice and neat.

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.149
And this room
over here is yours.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.654
[ANYA]
Come on in, Mama.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.532
[YOR]
Oh, why, thank you.

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:08.410
Oh, wow. It's lovely.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.543
Much nicer than the
place I was living.

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.461
Glad you like it.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.422
This should be everything.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.799
Hopefully the layout
works for you,

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.759
and I made sure
it's nice and clean.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.678
Thank you. Everything is great.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.638
[ANYA]
I helped Papa clean, too!

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.725
Oh, did you now?
You did such a good job.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.853
Yeah, I did! Thank you. See?

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:39.232
[ANYA yells]

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.526
You know all you did was
knock over the mop bucket.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.236
[ANYA gasps]

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.738
[YOR laughs]

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.364
[YOR] I appreciate
all your hard work,

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.575
but I don't know what
to do with myself.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:51.870
What do you mean by that?
Please just make yourself cozy.

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:55.665
After all, it's your home, too,
so do whatever you need to do.

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.375
Thank you.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.337
I'll grab the boxes
when you're done.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:03.632
[gasping]

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.801
I'm all done now.
You can come grab the boxes.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.054
Wow, you're quite efficient.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.600
Ah. This must be the younger
brother you mentioned.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:15.310
Good guess. That's him.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.854
You said he's a civil servant
as well, is that right?

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.147
That's correct.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.316
We've only spoken
on the phone lately.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.693
His job's kept him
busier than usual.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.779
I can really see
the resemblance.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.907
Once this entrance exam is over,
I'd love to meet him.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.408
Yes. That's right.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.160
About the interview,

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.496
I don't believe I have an
appropriate outfit ready

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:35.914
for that kind of thing.

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:37.791
[TWILIGHT]
Well, that's no problem.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:38.959
We'll go to the tailor.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.752
[YOR]
That would be wonderful.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.630
♪ Help Mama with the boxys. ♪

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:47.008
Uh, n-no, Anya, please!
I'll take care of that!

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.801
[ANYA]
Huh?

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.219
[YOR] I've got all
my weapons for work

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.721
and poison that's strong enough
to kill an elephant in there.

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.139
[ANYA gasps]

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:56.935
[YOR]
Want anything, Loid?

00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.562
[TWILIGHT] Coffee, please.
I take it black.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:02.565
[ANYA]
Ooh! I want some hot cocoa!

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.234
With sugar and milk, of course.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.069
[ANYA]
Yummy!

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.783
Oh, my goodness. They look
and smell wonderful.

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:15.036
Hope they taste good,
too. It's my first batch.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.956
I just followed a recipe.
It made the most sense.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.583
I hope you find them
to your liking.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.460
Here we go.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.171
[YOR]
They're amazing!

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.132
Anya's right, you can cook!

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:27.966
It's nothing, really.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.468
I helped Papa in
the kitchen, too!

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.429
You're such a good girl!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.973
[ANYA sneezes]

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.769
By helping, do you mean
getting flour everywhere?

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.230
Or was it when you stopped
to eat some peanuts?

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.773
[ANYA gasps]

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.608
[YOR chuckles]

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.319
It's time to start
the interview prep.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.868
Eden College is perhaps the
top school in the country.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.870
The interview's not
just for the child,

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.788
but for the parents as well.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.707
It's an evaluation of
their social standing

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.917
and level of culture,
understood?

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.836
Before I begin with
the questions,

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.006
I'd like you to please state
your full name and address.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:11.760
I'm Anya F--uh, Horger? Address?

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:12.594
[TWILIGHT]
Where we live.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.345
Ah! Anya's house!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.764
That's not what I meant.

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:19.517
Um, so tell me, Miss Anya,
how do you spend your days off?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.228
Sometimes Papa has
to lock me up inside,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.773
so I just kinda watch TV
all alone and sad.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:28.109
[TWILIGHT] Really, now.
Sounds horrifying. Madam?

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.360
Who, me?

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.530
[TWILIGHT] Why Eden College,
and how do you plan to pass?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.032
What's a normal way to pass?

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.701
I've seen people pass
from a lot of things.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:40.413
Maybe cardiac arrest or losing
an excessive amount of blood?

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.957
Or compound fractures
all over their body.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.168
Sometimes their skulls
get caved in.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.630
[TWILIGHT] Terrible. Describe
your parenting philosophy.

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:51.925
Uh. Well, I...
First to strike wins?

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:55.637
[TWILIGHT] How did her brother
not become a total psychopath?

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.639
I've been a spy
for over a decade,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.641
with countless missions
under my belt,

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:02.352
but this has me
beginning to lose heart.

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:03.436
[TWILIGHT]
This is pointless.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:06.272
Forget passing, I'm not sure
we'll survive the interview.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:07.524
No way she's getting in.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.441
[YOR]
Loid!

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:12.153
You can't just give up on your
late wife's wishes like that!

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.781
[TWILIGHT] Perhaps we jumped
the gun on this mock interview.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.991

Let's step out for a bit.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.827
We can broaden our horizons,

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.496
become versed in upper-class
cultural lexicon,

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:25.333
and experience their world
together as a family.

La, la, la, la, la! ♪

Mama, wanna hold hands?

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.343
Yes. That sounds delightful!

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.054
[TWILIGHT] Glad to see
that Anya likes her.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:39.556
The plan is working.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:42.976
After today, we'll have the
appearance of a normal--no,

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:45.770
we'll be seen as a fine,
upper-crust family.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:46.771
[YOR]
Aw.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.398
This reminds me of when
my little brother

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:51.985
was still so small and cute.

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.404
Of course, there was that
time I hugged him too hard

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.865
and ended up breaking
two of his ribs.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.950
Heh. Can't do that again.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.368
[YOR gasps]

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.164
[TWILIGHT] Well, perhaps
I spoke too soon.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.418
Hey, where are you
taking us anyway?

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:09.961
My connection at
work got us tickets

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.130

[OPERA SINGER singing]

[TWILIGHT] Eden values tradition
and social status over all else.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.609
We must get accustomed
to the finer things,

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.194
for a lack of cultural
refinement

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.738
could prove to be our downfall.

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:46.289
[TWILIGHT]
All right, next stop.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.292
[TWILIGHT] Anya, please remember
not to yell while we're here.

[TWILIGHT]
You'd like to draw? Sure.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:24.285
Well, Yor, why don't we sit down
and rest our legs for a bit?

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:25.787
Sounds good.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:28.623
Anya's cool 'cause she
lives in a cool big castle.

Sounds good.

[TWILIGHT] Hm? Wow, that's
a real masterpiece, Anya.

I can see a pig in a forest.

And there's Bondman.
That is him, right?

[ANYA]
Uh. Yeah.

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:08.204
[TWILIGHT] Just like the spy

I take it the witch-looking

Oh, dear, that middle
part is rather lurid.

to do all this on your day off.

in the slightest.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.231
Aw, thank you.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.775
This is my first ooting
in my brand-new ootfit!

Oh, really? It must
be a good day, then!

A good day for a good ooting!

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.031
Since you look so nice,

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.449
why don't we have
our picture taken?

Yes, ma'am.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.664
If you're looking for
a semi-formal dress,

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.875
I think this color
would do nicely.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:55.001
You like it?

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.003
It's beautiful, but to
be perfectly honest,

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.129
I'd prefer red or black.

but we want you happy.

[TWILIGHT] Judging from
her lack of luggage,

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:07.972
I'd just assumed she had no
interest in buying clothes.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:10.767
I guess you're a stickler about
color-coordination, are you?

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.853
Who, me? I wouldn't
say that exactly.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.063

I love the color.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:18.066
But there's no way I could hide
any kind of blood spatter on it.

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:19.359
[ANYA gasps]

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.990
I'm so happy Yor
finally found someone.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.867
Hopefully he's the one.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:31.704
But already having a child
is a big no-no for me.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:32.955
[TWILIGHT]
Looks like the extra outfits

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.916
will be ready by
the interview, too.

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:37.126
I'm sorry you had
to get so many.

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.921
Well, you look nice in colors
besides red and black.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:42.465
And we'll be going out
more often from here on.

Surely we'll keep
shopping there.

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:49.389
So the next time we're in,

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.016
how about we tell the ladies
that we're a married couple?

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.394
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:12.912
We in the Nationalist Party
believe there's a road to peace.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.330
Treating Westalis as an enemy...

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:17.291
[TWILIGHT] Patriotism is also
highly regarded within Eden,

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.503

on politics and history.

pick the nuts off the top,

In all my years of spying,

through more missions
than I can count,

00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:07.049
I've never had this kind
of sinking feeling.

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:08.593
S'okay, Papa.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.635
[TWILIGHT]
What?

00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:13.890
[TWILIGHT] Ugh. Yeah, I
definitely picked the wrong kid.

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.057
No, that's not it.

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:16.976
The problem is having the
success of the mission

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.228
rely on outsiders
in the first place.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.313
They're both just civilians,

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.190
they don't have the
background or training.

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.524
But I do.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.151
I need to consider
all the variables,

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.611
come up with an ironclad plan,

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:29.197
and execute that
plan to perfection.

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.491
Which means that I need to make
a list of every question

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.326
the interviewer
could possibly ask,

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:36.037
then have them memorize
each perfect answer.

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.539
Or create a system to
feed them the right ones.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.375
[YOR]
Loid, just a thought,

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.754
but maybe we should go
and get some fresh air.

How did I not know about
this park before today?

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.150
[YOR] I never came here
very often, myself.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.904
Usually just whenever work had
me feeling at my wit's end.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.572
Seeing the city like this

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:14.325
reminds me that what I do
helps all these people

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.327
and it makes me feel better.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.496
It rejuvenates me.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:19.705
I'm sorry.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.458
I'm making this place sound
so boring, forgive me.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.544

than those big crowds!

catch him for you!

[YOR] I left Loid
and Anya up there.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:15.136
[TWILIGHT]
Agh. He blended into the crowd.

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:18.931
I'm sorry, Yor, but I doubt
you'll be able to find him now.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.727
[MAN A]
Man, I'm starving.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.437
[WOMAN B]
It's so cute, I could die!

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:26.480
[MAN C]
Think I'm gonna pee my pants.

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:27.815
[WOMAN C]
My feet hurt.

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:33.070
[overlapping voices]

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:36.157
Oh. Anya. It happened again.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:40.870
[THIEF A] Ha! Yes! Man, that
old bag was rollin' in it.

00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:42.747
[THIEF A chuckles]

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:43.831
Papa!

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.166
Yeah, what's the matter?

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:46.792
I wanna eat some cake!

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:48.169
[TWILIGHT]
What?

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.296
But we barely just
left the restaurant.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.048
Oh.

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:54.050
[TWILIGHT]
I see.

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.177
You may have changed
your clothes,

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.929
but changing the way you
walk isn't that easy.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.139
You're not getting away
from me, you fiend.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.099
[YOR]
Hey, Loid!

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.267
[ANYA]
Mama's back.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.019
[TWILIGHT]
Yor, watch Anya for me.

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.020
[chuckles]

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.855
[THIEF A] Man, I'll be livin'
the high life for a while

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:10.566
with this much cash.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.818
I'm gonna eat like a king!

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.695
[THIEF A yells]

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:18.616
[TWILIGHT] A filthy pig like you
deserves the foulest meal.

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.618
[WOMAN B]
What the heck was that?

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.078
[MAN L] Some guy just
dropped outta the sky.

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:23.371
[TWILIGHT]
Spies are careful.

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.831
We can't draw attention
to ourselves.

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:28.292
[WOMAN C]
Did he fall?

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:30.920
Sorry, but this man right
here is a purse-snatcher,

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:34.131
so someone call the
police to arrest him.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.217
[WOMAN D]
A purse snatcher?

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.095
[WOMAN A]
Thank you for walking me here

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:40.429
and getting my money back.

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:43.057
I was going to buy a present
for my grandchild.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.643
I appreciate it.
You saved the day!

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.771
Oh, well, he was the one
who got it back.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:52.024
That's my husband--
he's, like, a hero.

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:53.109
No, Yor.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.737
Without you, I probably wouldn't
have even gone after him.

00:19:56.779 --> 00:20:00.074
Thank you. What a fine,
upstanding gentleman you are.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.867
[TWILIGHT]
Really, I--

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:04.537
[CHIEF] You're the type of
hero who casts no shadow;

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:07.873
your great deeds never
seeing the light of day.

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:10.501
[WOMAN A]
Thank you so much.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.920
[TWILIGHT] Gotta say, getting
thanked once in a while

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.088
wouldn't be so bad.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.882
[ANYA]
Papa's a big softie.

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.343
[TWILIGHT]
And thanks to you, Yor.

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:22.722
Today helped me
feel rejuvenated.

00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:26.225
It never would've happened
if it weren't for you.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.023
Papa and Mama are flirting.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.108
[TWILIGHT, YOR gasp]

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.484
[TWILIGHT, YOR]
No, we are not!

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.320
[ANYA] Aren't you gonna thank
me for doing stuff, too?

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:40.197
[TWILIGHT] Well, I guess
we did find the thief

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.699
because you were hungry again.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.492
So, thank you, Anya.

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:45.077
[chuckles]

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:49.165
[WOMAN A] Oh, my, you certainly
are a lovely little family.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.585
[WOMAN A]
This is for you, sweetie.

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:53.753
Candy!

00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:56.297
Now you thank her.

00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.719
[ANYA]
The big ooting's over!

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:04.013
[TWILIGHT]
What a long day.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:11.645
[ANYA] Mama! I want a
big cup of hot cocoa!

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:13.856
That sounds lovely.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:20.696
Hey, Anya, what do you say

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:23.991
we take another crack
at the mock interview?

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.410
Now, how do you spend
your days off?

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:28.412
We go to the opera,
the art museum,

00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:30.289
and eat at fancy restaurants.

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:31.207
[TWILIGHT]
Yes!

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:34.502
Okay. That's good. Don't forget
to talk about today!

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:36.796
Moving on. Now,
the next question:

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:38.214
You're out on a walk
and happen to see

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:40.382
one of your classmates
do something naughty,

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.259
what do you do?

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.429
Uh...

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:47.431
I would jump on them,
beat them up,

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:49.266
and mush their face
in the ground.

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:53.229
[TWILIGHT] Hmm. Yeah,
pretend you never saw that.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.649
[TWILIGHT] Ugh. That
sinking feeling is back.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.276
But why? You were so cool,
Papa! Whooshy whoosh!

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:00.986
[YOR]
He really was, wasn't he?

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.614
[ANYA]
Ka-bam! Dat-dah!

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.408
It's the foulest meal for you!

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.090
I really like cocoa.

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:25.970
[WOMAN A] Oh, my, you certainly
are a lovely little family.

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.721
[sighs]

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:30.641
[TWILIGHT]
If she saw us that way...

00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:34.770
...my preparations are
about 1% complete.
