WEBVTT

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.981
[GEORGE'S FATHER] We've
officially come to an agreement.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:48.483
Effective on the 10th
of next month.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.819
I see. I'm sorry, boss.

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:52.946
Heh. The boss, huh?

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:55.741
You won't have to call me
that for much longer.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.618
[SUBORDINATE A]
The Desmond Group, they--

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.038
This is just how it is.
You can't fight the times.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.542
Our business had become like a
candle flickering in the wind.

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.961
Though I wish I knew
what to tell my son.

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.506
How am I supposed to break
the news that in a few weeks

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:15.969
our Glooman Pharmaceuticals
will be no more?

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.140
[bell tolling]

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.183
[BECKY sighs]

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.018
[BECKY] Everything feels
so calm and peaceful

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.478
after those midterms.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.312
It does.

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:28.690
And Papa is peaceful since
I didn't get any Tonitrus Bolts.

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:31.318
Oh. I thought my Loid
would always be sweet,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.486
but what's he really like?

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:33.362
A monster.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.571
[ANYA]
About his mission.

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:37.366
I mean, a per-fec-tronist.

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.659
I feel you.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.910
I guess it can be pretty rough

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.245
when your parents'
expectations are so high.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:45.791
Though... Monster-man Loid
still sounds dreamy to me!

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:51.880
[DAMIAN]
Desmond-Style... Rolling...

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:53.173
...Sweep!

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.300
[BOTH coughing]

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.135
Heh.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.638
[EMILE] Way to sweep away
the trash, boss man!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.057
You're really cleaning
things up around here.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.058
[SARA]
Wow, Damian.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.519
You're like the master
of the broom, too!

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.062
So much spinning!

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:10.357
Well, what do you expect?
He did get a Stella after all.

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.109
Heh. You're right about that.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.735
[JESSE] Hey, why don't we
have a study session

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.738
at your place next time so you
can teach us a few things?

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.699
Yeah, I think that's
an amazing idea!

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.076
Just look at all those
dummies kissing up to him.

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:22.536
He may have done well
on the midterms,

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.329
but he's still a big-time jerk.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.083
I would definitely like to study
at Second Son's house.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.837
[BECKY]
Yeah, I almost forgot

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.381
that you kinda have
a thing for him.

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:36.091
I have a what kind of thing?

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:39.219
[BECKY] I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have called him a big jerk.

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:41.096
[GEORGE]
I hate him.

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.556
I can't wait till
you can check out

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.391
my Fire Strong Axel Final Strong
Dustpan Super Move...

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:46.560
[GEORGE] I will never
forgive you, Desmond.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.229
I'll hate you for
as long as I live.

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.565
[GEORGE] I've brought you
a dustpan, Damian.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.899
Oh, great, thanks.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.443
Who is that guy there?

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.153
[BECKY]
Hm? You mean George?

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:59.489
That's George Glooman.
He's one of our classmates.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.951
[GEORGE] I don't understand.
How'd he get a Stella?

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:04.661
How did my plan fail?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.622
I mean, I specifically had
my butler hire a master spy

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.167
to change all his test
answers so he'd fail them.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.252
[GEORGE] I want you to hire
the best spy you can get

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:14.796
for three months' worth
of allowance, you got that?

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.757
Yes, sir. As you wish.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:17.841
[ANYA gasps]

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.719
[ANYA] One of our classmates
is a real spy boss?

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.764
That must've been the guy
that Papa out spied.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:24.598
Hey.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.143
I wanna know what you actually
like about Damian anyway.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:31.021
I'm curious about the other guy.
What's his deal?

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:31.646
Huh?

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:34.232
Oh, wow, I guess you're just
boy crazy in general,

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.942
aren't you, Anya?

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:40.280
I wouldn't bother with
him, he's... gloomy.

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.783
[GEORGE]
I can't give up already.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.035
I'll find a way to
get him expelled.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:48.497
[ANYA] He's trying to get Second
Son kicked outta school?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.208
[GEORGE]
This should do the trick.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.043
Hold on.

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.630
Looks like a cigarette butt.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.174
Wow, Damian.
I thought you knew better.

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:01.718
Huh? I've never smoked
in my entire life.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.471
Professor! Can you
please come here?

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:05.722
[DAMIAN]
Hey, stop it, would ya?

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.766
That thing isn't mine!

00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:11.478
[GEORGE yells]

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.148
What's the matter with you?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.358
[TEACHER A]
Explain yourselves!

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.152
I found a cigarette butt,
and when I tried to tell you,

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:22.113
Damian ran up and
sucker punched me.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:22.864
What?

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:23.990
Is this true?

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.951
If you've done what Young
Master Glooman claims,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.994
you're in serious trouble.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.789
Lord Damian would never
sucker punch somebody, sir!

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.041
That George Glooman
is a filthy liar!

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.584
[TEACHER A] You two are
his little flunkies,

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.420
so I can't trust your version
of the facts on this.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.130
[EMILE, EWEN gasp]

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.259
The Second Son wouldn't do that.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.846
I saw the whole thing.
That boy threw himself down.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.347
[gasps]

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.140
[TEACHER A]
Uh, what in the world?

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.685
It's like this girl can see
right through everyone.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.520
And on top of that,
she's the one

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.314
who received a Tonitrus Bolt
during orientation!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.650
Thirty-years in the teaching
field and my intuition

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.278
are both telling me
this girl is bad news.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.073
Uh. Stop this horseplay
and leave me be!

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.993
You've got cleaning
to do. Honestly.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.077
Why'd you--?

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.078
Heh.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.373
I'm not gonna let you get
expelled while I'm watching.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.250
[ANYA]
It'll mess up Plan B.

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:17.460
You were so unbelievably
cool, Anya!

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.046
I couldn't help but
let out a big squee!

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:20.964
A squee?

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:24.926
I'm positive Damian knows
how you feel now. Yeah?

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.013
Hey! Stop staring at me!
The heck are you talkin' about?

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.640
No one asked you to help!
I coulda handled it myself!

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.393
He's right! Why did you
have to get in the way?

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:34.144
Uh.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.103
Wait, what?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.606
Hold on. I've got a
problem with you, too!

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.065
Who you think you are?

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.984
And why do you wanna
get me in trouble?

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:45.447
Because it's all over.
My whole life is over!

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.782
Huh?

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.243
Your family's company
went bankrupt?

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.662
That's right. Today, officially.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:55.290
Well, sorry to hear
that, I guess?

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.709
But all of that doesn't have
anything to do with me.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.504
It was your family's company.
You pushed us over the edge.

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:02.255
What?

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.882
Yes, that's right.

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.342
I remember hearing
something about

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.677
the Desmond Group and
Glooman Pharmaceuticals

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.221
on the news recently.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.932
[GEORGE] I thought that
if you failed the exams

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.392
and gotten expelled
from school altogether,

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.478
then maybe your family
would be too freaked out

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.438
to bother crushing us.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.648
"Crushing" you?

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.859
That is not the way my family
does business, understand?

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.486
And besides, it's not
like I'm the one

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.112
who's making those decisions.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:29.157
He's right. You'd better
leave him outta this!

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.242
I suppose that you have a point.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.703
But still, I'm gonna be forced
to drop out of school

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.081
all because of these adults.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.624
[DAMIAN]
Wait, you're dropping out?

00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:40.168
[GEORGE] If I can't stop the
company from going bankrupt,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.544
my family will lose it.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.630
We'll be flat broke afterwards.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:46.633
And that means I won't be
able to keep going here.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:50.053
Heh. To be honest,
I actually envy you, Damian.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.223
You're a popular kid
from a prominent family.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.308
Of course you'd get
all the Stellas.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.269
A piece of garbage like me
never really had a chance.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.856
Hey! Lord Damian got his Stella
because he deserved it!

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.400
Not because of his family!

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.401
That's true!

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:07.487
Maybe you'd be popular too if
you weren't such a gloomy loser.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.698
That's the reason why
nobody likes you!

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:10.532
[GEORGE]
Uh.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:11.366
Come on.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.451
His flunkies are jerks, too.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.078
Just shut up, all of you!

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.123
No one could ever understand the
kind of stuff I'm going through!

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.416
My dream was to spend

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:22.794
the few spring-time years of my
life at this amazing school!

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:26.464
But that won't happen now,
so that means my dream is over!

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:27.924
If I'm dropping out after this,

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:31.845
why am I even bothering with
cleaning the stupid courtyard?

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.347
But I guess it's kind of
poetic in a way, isn't it?

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:38.601
Garbage like me deserves to
take care of the other garbage.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.604
Listen, nobody thinks
that about you, okay?

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.482
So calm down.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.569
Why me? Why does
the world hate me?

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.571
Cheer up. It's not that bad.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.489
How about I buy you
some juice or something?

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.449
[GEORGE grunts]

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.286
Um. Guess that won't
really help. Sorry.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.204
[GEORGE]
I'd love a drink right now.

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.164
[DAMIAN]
Huh?

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.290
[GEORGE]
It'll help.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.001
Since today's gonna be
my last day at school,

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.837
I should accept it
while I still can.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.922
So should I grab something?

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.675
Uh, sure.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.263
Thank you.
I feel a tiny bit better.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.389
That's good.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.766
[GEORGE gasps]

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.642
[GEORGE]
Although...

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.395
I never got to order
the deluxe caviar bowl.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:25.940
I always wanted to get
that from the cafeteria.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.484
And now, it's looking like

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.444
it'll just be another
one of those regrets

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:33.656
that eats away at my soul
for the rest of my life.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:43.416
That was so good,

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.251
but I've always wanted to
know what it feels like

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.420
to wear a Stella Star.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.339
Will someone lend me theirs?

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.632
[DAMIAN grumbles]

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:51.633
Well, you see,

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.844
I had been working myself half
to death trying to earn one.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.846
But I couldn't concentrate
on my studies

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.641
after hearing about
the bankruptcy.

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:00.850
And it was wrong,

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.895
but I put all my energy into
getting revenge on Damian.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.564
What a fool I've been.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.901
Woo-hoo! Somebody please
take a picture of me!

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.402
Give it right back.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.029
And what I'd like next...

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:16.199
Listen up, kid,
you're pressing your luck!

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.034
Around this time next month,

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:20.829
my family probably won't
have a dalc to our name.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.704
Before you know it,

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.165
I'm pretty sure I'll get
trafficked into Westalis

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.251
and end up being sold
on the black market.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.627
I'll spend the rest of my life

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.796
being somebody's
sad little slave.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.005
Woe is me.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.175
Can I at least enjoy these last
few moments of happiness

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.427
before a lifetime of sorrow?

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:40.181
Or am I so worthless,
I don't deserve that, too?

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:42.684
[GEORGE gasps]

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:47.021
Don't worry. The West
isn't such a bad place.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:50.441
[ANYA] Papa and his boss
lady are both nice.

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:55.071
[GEORGE] She doesn't know
a thing about Westalis.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.782
Is she trying to console me?

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.410
Everyone's being so nice.

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:04.164
No one's ever treated
me like this before.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:10.753
Hold on. Why is this salty water
pouring out of my eyes?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.630
[GIRL A]
George.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.383
[GEORGE] Can I please just
ask for just one more thing?

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.969
I was really looking forward
to the choral performance

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.054
at the end of the school year.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.306
That was gonna be my chance

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.224
to connect to you
all through song.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.227
No, never mind.
I'm asking too much.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:30.106
[ALL]
So... what does he want?

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:35.403
[singing]

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.529
Uh, Becky, for real?

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.034
[BECKY, DAMIAN singing]

00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:44.913
[ALL singing]

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.831
You guys.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:51.836
[ALL singing]

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.397
[GEORGE]
Thank you all so much.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:16.236
I will treasure this memory
for the rest of my life.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.663
[DAMIAN]
Hey, George.

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:29.040
Here, take these.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:32.627
My own personal stationery.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.003
They're not cheap.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.755
But even if you have
to leave school,

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.882
you won't have to
forget about us.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:41.135
Damian, I--

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.137
Everyone's here.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:46.057
[GIRL B] George, I'll let you
have my favorite book.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.226
And you can have my watch.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.436
[GIRL B]
Please, take good care of it.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.438
I found this leaf on
the side of the road

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.148
that you can have, too.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.859
[BOY A] We wish you the best
of luck at your new school.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:13:00.196
[SARA] The kids from Class Three
will always be together!

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.532
[GEORGE]
Thank you. I'll do my very best!

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:05.285
I'll turn this pain in
my heart into strength.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:08.913
And even though my life is full
of sorrow and hardships,

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.416
I promise I'll never give up!

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:14.294
[GEORGE]
Goodbye, my friends.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:20.133
[GEORGE]
Goodbye, my beloved Eden!

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.152
And then he walked away.

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:41.112
[YOR]
Such a beautiful story!

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.905
Yes, indeed.

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:46.743
Although Glooman Pharmaceuticals
isn't going bankrupt.

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.953
They just got bought out.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.830
[GEORGE]
What?

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.498
We were close to going under,

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.501
but the Desmond Group
swooped in and saved us.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.296
The leadership will change,
but I was given an assurance

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:01.466
there would be a place for me
and the entire R&amp;D team.

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.259
Honestly, I've been
pleasantly surprised

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.970
with how Desmond
has handled this.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.388
I won't be the CEO,

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.557
and it won't be called
Glooman anymore.

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.392
I've had the hardest time
trying to figure out

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.478
exactly how to break
the news to you.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:17.982
[GEORGE] So, wait, I won't have
to live as a slave in Westalis?

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.817
And what about school?

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.320
[GEORGE'S FATHER]
Huh? What the devil do you mean?

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:25.156
And of course you'll go to
school every day like normal.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.741
Now don't you have
homework to do?

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:32.038
[KIDS whispering]

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.083
I thought he quit.
Why is he here?

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.596
Listen, Gloomy. You better
give us all our stuff back.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:49.639
[GEORGE gasps]

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.182
You owe me some juice, kid.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.725
[GEORGE gasps]

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.791
[knocking]

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:20.670
Anya, you need to get up,
or you'll be late for school.

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.965
Your breakfast is all ready,
so go wash up and get changed.

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:26.801
[ANYA]
Okey-dokey.

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:37.728
[ANYA]
Uh-oh! I slept too late!

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:41.732
[ANYA] The day hasn't started
and I'm already...

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.068
[TWILIGHT] You know better than
to talk with your mouth full.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.278
[TWILIGHT sighs]

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:46.737
If you wantna stay
out of trouble,

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.157
show up on time and
bring what you need.

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:52.452
Eight Tonitrus Bolts and
you're out, so be careful.

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:55.496
Uh, wow. The school's so strict.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.334
Thank goodness she
made it in time.

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:03.045
Well, I should be heading
over to the hospital now.

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.172
Leaving soon?

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:05.590
I have a half day today,

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.426
so I don't have to be at City
Hall until after noon.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.720
Maybe you'll be able
to relax this morning.

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.388
I'll be on my way.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.933
[YOR] Have a great day.
We'll see you back at home.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.938
[door opens]

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:24.484
[chuckles]

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:28.196
Looks like Mister Bond got to
sleep in a little this morning.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.365
Hang on.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:36.704
Sorry, don't want to intrude.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:46.130
[YOR] Oh, no!
She forgot her gym clothes!

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.590
[HENDERSON]
Anya Forger!

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:51.969
For your crime of forgetting,
you shall be expelled!

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.764
[screams]

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.560
[YOR]
No! Anya! Wait!

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:03.481
Please don't go!
Poor Loid will be so sad!

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.107
[BOND barks]

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.359
[YOR gasps]

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.319
[YOR] I can't afford
to waste any time.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.405
I have to get this
to Anya, ASAP!

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:21.207
[YOR]
Uh, the bus stop's right here.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.042
But since it's not a school bus,

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.753
I'll have to make a
transfer somewhere.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:29.799
Wait. What's faster?
The trolley or the bus?

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.386
Ugh. This is impossible.

00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:36.722
Ah! I'm running out of time!

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:39.433
I have to make it there
before her gym class!

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.435
What should I do?

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:44.647
[gasps]

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:49.735
[YOR]
Hup!

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.489
[sighs]

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.007
[YOR]
Excuse me! Beg your pardon.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.224
[YOR] I'm coming as fast
as I can, Anya!

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:23.477
[bell tolling]

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:29.025
[YOR] Okay, I made it. I wonder
where Anya is right now.

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:31.777
She does switch rooms
between classes,

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:34.572
so that makes it a
bit more difficult.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.032
[TWILIGHT] If you wanna
stay out of trouble,

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:38.367
show up on time and
bring what you need.

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:40.661
Eight Tonitrus Bolts
and you're out.

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:41.912
[YOR]
That's right!

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.372
I can't let them know
that she didn't have

00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:45.333
what she needed for
school this morning.

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:48.794
So that means I can't ask
anyone where she is.

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:51.005
I'll just have to
find her on my own!

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:53.174
[YOR gasps]

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:55.343
I think it turned
out really good!

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:57.887
Maybe I'll show my mom
when I get home.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:03.976
Hey, did you hear?

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:06.312
Apparently, there's a
ghost up in Tower B

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:09.357
called "The Mysterious
Spider Woman"

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:14.153
Stupid. You know that stuff's
not real. No way.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:22.453
Ah! It's the Spider Woman!

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:28.334
[YOR] I can't draw any
attention to myself.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.796
Hmm... I don't wanna get
kicked out for trespassing.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:35.257
I know! Maybe I could
wear a disguise.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:38.135
I can look for her without
worrying about being caught.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.137
[KIDS]
Ma'am!

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.847
[KIDS chattering]

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:44.266
[YOR]
Well, I, uh...

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.812
[YOR] Bad idea. There's
gotta be another way.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.605
[cow moos]

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.153
[YOR]
Oh! I remember these guys.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.864
They were there during
the entrance exam.

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:06.747
[chuckles]

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.547
[gasps]

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:20.261
[YOR] Oh, no! Somebody's
gonna see me here!

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:22.972
That's Yor! What's
she doing here?

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.974
Did she follow me here
because she figured out

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:28.853
that I was only using work as a
cover to infiltrate the school?

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.771
No, that can't be it.

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.690
Hm? Looks like she's
holding something.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:37.653
[bell tolling]

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:40.948
[YOR]
Anya, where could she be?

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:49.206
[YOR]
I don't see her.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.374
Oh, there you are!

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:51.751
[ANYA]
Mama!

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.338
Shh! Quiet.

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:01.093
You're here, Anya.
Oh, I'm so relieved.

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:04.805
I found you. Silly,
seems you forgot this.

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:06.640
[gasps]

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.058
Something the matter?

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.228
I got here before you had
gym class today, didn't I?

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.730
[ANYA]
Hmm...

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:15.024
[YOR]
What's that look about, Anya?

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:19.111
Well, we don't have gym
class today. So...

00:21:19.153 --> 00:21:21.655
...I didn't need to bring
my gym clothes.

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:23.949
[YOR screams]

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:26.619
[YOR]
Oh, no.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:33.584
[YOR]
That was a waste of time.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.670
But at least she didn't
actually forget anything.

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:37.922
[TWILIGHT]
Yor!

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.632
Uh, Loid, it's you.

00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:41.926
I thought you had gone
to the hospital.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.261
[TWILIGHT]
I did. For a little bit.

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:47.932
But then I had to make a house
call on a patient of mine.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.851
What are you doing out
and about anyway?

00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:53.646
Well, actually...

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:58.901
I see now.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:01.403
You were worried Anya
had forgotten something.

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.280
That's very thoughtful of you.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.407
[TWILIGHT] I was wondering
what was going on,

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:08.744
but I guess I didn't need to
actually run into her to check.

00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:09.537
[YOR]
No.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.288
Truth is, I was just wrong,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.457
and I ended up wasting
a bunch of time.

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:17.711
I mean, if I'd checked her
schedule, I'd've seen--

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:18.712
I'm a bad mom.

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.339
[TWILIGHT]
That's not true!

00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:21.882
[TWILIGHT] If she gets
too upset about this,

00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:23.843
it'll affect the mission.

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.302
[TWILIGHT]
I know.

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:26.720
Before I go back to work,

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:29.765
I was thinking of maybe
grabbing a bite somewhere.

00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:33.519
So what do you say?
Care to join me for lunch?

00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:35.271
Yeah!

00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:36.689
[TWILIGHT]
There's actually a place nearby

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.566
that has a wonderful menu.

00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:41.360
[YOR]
Great, I'm hungry.

00:24:15.037 --> 00:24:17.039
[inaudible]
