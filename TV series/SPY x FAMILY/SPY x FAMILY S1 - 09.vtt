WEBVTT

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:09.927
[YURI] If you're as
married as you say,

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:13.180
you're gonna have to
prove it to me somehow.

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:15.641
You gotta kiss her
right here and now.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.100
Well, if that's all it takes.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:18.685
Huh?

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:22.940
[YOR]
Wait, we're doing this?

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.650
I don't know what to expect!

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.527
Oh, actually, I think
I read somewhere

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.779
that your first kiss
tastes like lemons.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.863
Well, that's lucky!

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.367
It'll go great with
this marinated fish.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:37.496
Uh! Calm down, Yor!
Get a hold of yourself!

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:38.664
Shall we?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.583
We certainly shall
in just one second!

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.340
[YOR] There's no way
I can do this sober.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.009
Sorry 'bout the wait, honey.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.764
Oh, uh, it's fine. We don't
have to if you don't want to.

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:58.809
Yeah, yeah, but I gotta keep up
'ppearances too, y'know?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.935
Let's just do it.

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.895
[YURI] Whispering isn't
helping your case!

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.689
Are you two gonna
do this or not?!

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.984
I want you to prove that
you're really a married couple!

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.571
[YOR]
Be quiet, Yuri.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.406
If y'just shut up and watch,

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.742
we'll show you exactly
how in love we are.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:19.329
Here I come. Close your
eyes for me, darling.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.582
Wait, I didn't mean--!

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.670
Uh, okay then, Yor.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:15.153
Wait a second! Why are
you being so obscene?

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.658
[YURI]
Hey, Sis!

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.618
[YOR]
Hm?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.536
Check it out!

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.788
I scored the highest
in my whole class!

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.998
That's wonderful!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.710
You deserve a reward.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.462
[gasps]

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:36.049
[YURI]
Sis, um, when I grow up...

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.384
[YOR]
Hm?

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:39.511
...I really wanna
marry you, okay?

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.012
[YOR]
Aww.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.766
Well then, better grow
up soon! I'll be waiting.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.606
[YURI]
No, I take it all back!

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.066
You can't go through with this!

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:56.153
I can't bear to see you kiss
another man in front of me!

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.613
Stop it!

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.074
[YOR]
Ah, I knew it.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:04.202
[YOR]
I just can't!

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.292
[YOR]
No!

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.383
Izzit the end of the world?
Or like, a bomb?

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.097
Uh! Um, Yuri?

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.312
[YURI]
I see how it is, Sis.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.397
You would even hurt me
for trying to stop you

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.858
from kissing him.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.901
Guess that's just how badly

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.488
you wanna to smear your
lips all over the guy!

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.073
I was a fool to think
I was testing you,

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:46.244
when what was really being
tested were my own feelings!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.247
Hey, uh, you know
you're bleeding, right?

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.794
Loid Forger. For now,
my sister's lips are all yours.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:57.756
What?! What are you
talking about?!

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:04.387
[YURI]
Well, I let you win this round.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.639
But don't forget--!

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.182
Bleeding, still.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.518
[TWILIGHT] Is this just
normal for the Briars?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:13.104
[YOR] Are you all right, Yuri?
You're about to fall over.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.023
--[TWILIGHT] You're one to talk.
--I'm doin' fine.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.275
But you're about to collapse.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.777
[YOR]
Huh?

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.781
Should I call you a taxi?

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.868
I said I'm fine.
You are such a worrywart.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.997
[TWILIGHT]
Whoa, there!

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.792
[growls] What's with
the damn smirk?

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:36.253
Are my failures
that amusing to you?

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.923
Oh, no. I was just
admiring your bond.

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:43.552
You must've always been
there for each other.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.888
Yuri, thank you for
protecting Yor until now.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.516
I know it can't have
been easy for you.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:51.810
[YOR gasps]

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:53.186
Now she'll have me
supporting her

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.355
with everything I've got, too.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:59.150
Let's work together to give her
the happiness she deserves.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.405
Why would I ever want
help from a guy like you?

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.282
I'm going home!

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.909
[TWILIGHT]
Feel free to come back anytime!

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:10.620
I know Yor would like that,

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:13.164
and next time, maybe my
daughter will be awake.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.001
Poor Anya, she tried so
hard to wait up for you,

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.377
but she just couldn't!

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.672
She's so adorable.
I know you'll love her!

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.549
[YURI]
Oh-ho-ho, I'll be back!

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:23.925
And not because you invited me!

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.552
It'll be to prove that
you tricked my sister

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:27.554
into marrying you, understand?

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.931
[YOR] I am not being tricked!
Have some faith!

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.725
Listen to me, Loid Forger.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.102
If you make my sister
cry a single tear,

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.646
then I'll have you execu--

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:40.150
Um, well, you-you get it.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:44.154
Just know that you'll rue
the day, y'hear me?

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.906
Be careful getting home!

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.867
And stop yelling, you'll
disturb the neighbors!

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:53.121
[TWILIGHT] Was he gonna say
"executed"? That's a concern.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:02.172
[TWILIGHT]
No signs he bugged the place.

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:06.259
We got lucky; the Secret Police
are capable of anything.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:10.347
And Yuri's got a grudge.
I'll have to keep an eye out.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.808
By the way, Loid,
I wanted to thank you.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.269
After the way he behaved,
it means a lot

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.439
that you'd still welcome
my brother into your family.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:25.862
[TWILIGHT] It's obvious that
Yuri loves you very much, Yor.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.198
As someone who doesn't
have close friends or family

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.910
except for my daughter, I admit,
I envy you two a little.

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.286
Is that true?

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.580
[TWILIGHT] And she's not
even my real daughter.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.248
Well, in any case,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.669
I'm glad that he didn't find
out about our big secret.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.048
Yeah.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.093
Boy, all the exhaustion
must be hitting me at once.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.262
Why don't we finish cleaning
and head to bed?

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:55.350
Hold on! I forgot to fix
this. Gimme a minute.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.143
Yeah. Okay.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:02.565
You can do it. You gotta
save the world, Papa.

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:07.362
[YOR] Yuri, if you hit Loid,
I'll be so mad.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:16.454
[TWILIGHT] I can't remember
the last time I felt envious.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:21.543
Eh. I'm sure I'm just tired.
Too bad my mission never sleeps.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.176
[YURI]
'Scuse me.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.386
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.762
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.182
Which way's the station?

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.517
[BOTH]
You don't need a train, buddy,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.811
you need an ambulance!

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.403
I'm awake. G'morning, please.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:51.531
Oh, you're looking greener
than usual, Papa.

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:54.909
[TWILIGHT] I'm over here.
Go wake yourself up.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:08:59.622
[YOR]
Huh?

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.416
Good morning, Anya.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.922
[YOR] It's too bad you didn't
get to see Yuri last night.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.174
[ANYA]
Huh? Who is that?

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:13.094
[YOR] Huh? But she was so
excited about meeting him!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.723
[TWILIGHT] That certainly
was an eventful evening.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.308
I'm sorry about that.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:19.559
[TWILIGHT] Who'd have
thought Yor's brother

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:20.685
would act that way?

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.270
[ANYA]
Right! Unkie!

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.813
[TWILIGHT] And he's in
the Secret Police--

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.483
my greatest foe as a spy.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.860
[ANYA]
The Secret Police?!

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.780
[ANYA]
What's that?

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:36.493
[ANYA]
"Secret" plus "police"?

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.495
That sounds so cool!

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.914
Why didn't you wake me
up and introduce us?!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.208
I can't believe I missed
my cool Unkie!

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.710
[TWILIGHT]
It meant that much to you?

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.296
[TWILIGHT] Well, at least
the storm's passed for now.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.007
I need to focus on
Anya's education.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:54.594
Now hurry up and eat
or you'll be late.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.850
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll meet him soon.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.478
[TWILIGHT]
But is the threat really over?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.606
Yor's brother is a
Secret Police member.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:10.318
We never uncovered anything
suspicious about her though.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.070
She doesn't seem
aware of his job,

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.864
and my gut says
she's still clear.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.700
I mean, if she knew he worked
at the State Security Service,

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.785
she wouldn't be worried about

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.995
how they see her
"single" status.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.249
No, it's dangerous to
act like I'm certain.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.377
What if it was all a ruse
to get closer to me?

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:31.506
[TWILIGHT]
Suspect everything, Twilight.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.801
Papa, Mama is--

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:35.760
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.554
She's what?

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:42.016
Mama is... bad at cooking.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.727
Come on, I didn't even tell you
I made breakfast this morning!

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.479
Was it really that obvious?

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:50.525
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I tried my best.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.321
By the way, Yor.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:56.781
What is it?

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.825
[TWILIGHT]
Uh, I just...

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.577
[TWILIGHT] Maybe putting
a listening device on her

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.912
is going too far.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.415
No, I need to
silence any doubts.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.709
Hesitation could mean death.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.837
And not just for me, but for
tens of thousands of people.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.464
I need to do this to
prove she's innocent.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:17.177
You've just got something
on your collar.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.388
Huh? Thanks for catching that.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.598
[YOR]
That scared me.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.725
I thought he was about to
give me a kiss goodbye!

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:25.351
[ANYA gasps]

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:30.106
[YOR] I guess I'm still
shaken from last night.

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:33.776
I can't kiss. I can't cook.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.904
Loid managed to smooth
things over with Yuri,

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:41.701
but I'm sure my attempts at
seeming wifely were a disaster.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.536
I could be imagining it,

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:47.040
but it's no wonder he
seems so distant today.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.334
Maybe he's gotten sick of
me for being so useless

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.295
when the chips are down.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.380
[TWILIGHT]
Gotta be on guard.

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:06.100
Is something wrong?

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:09.979
Mama, Papa, you two need
to be good and get along.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.776
It's not like we're
fighting or anything.

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:16.569
Yeah, everything's okay.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:17.528
[TWILIGHT]
While we're on the topic,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.198
you need to get along
with your classmates.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.866
[ANYA]
'Kay.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.535
We should be on our way.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.537
Yeah, let's go.

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:31.167
[TWILIGHT] Children are so
curiously perceptive at times.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.845
[FIRST LIEUTENANT A]
Hey, Yuri.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.764
You're looking pretty rough.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:48.226
Weren't you just visiting
your sister yesterday?

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.229
I don't really remember
what happened.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.355
[FIRST LIEUTENANT A]
You probably got drunk

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.899
and picked a fight
with her husband.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.901
You really need to
quit drinking, kid.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.903
[YURI] Well, a guy like
that doesn't deserve her.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.989
[FIRST LIEUTENANT A]
Was he that bad?

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:10.331
[YURI]
I think... he was... a good guy.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:13.459
But con men and spies always
try to act like good people.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.296
Yeah, hopefully he's a spy,
then I can lock him up!

00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:18.840
You gotta calm down.
Have any proof?

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.133
[YURI]
Shit!

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:21.592
I can't believe I totally forgot

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:25.179
to bug their living
room and bedrooms!

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.597
No, no, no!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.266
If I'd done that and it
picked up on the sound

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.018
of Sis making <i>those</i>
kinda noises,

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.394
I wouldn't be able to handle it!

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:34.355
Now I get it. Self-inflicted.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.569
[FIRST LIEUTENANT A]
You need to get over your sister

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.238
so you can concentrate
on your work.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.782
Our objective is to catch spies,

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.827
and that Twilight character's
at the top of the list.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.495
Think of it this way.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:53.291
When the country's safe,
your sister's safe.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.001
[YURI]
Yes, sir, I know.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:59.005
[YURI] But Loid Forger,
the day you make my sister cry,

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:01.716
you won't be safe anywhere.

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:07.388
What's up with her?

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.683
I think she said, "I'm a failure
of a wife," or something.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:11.559
Morning.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.519
Oh. Hey, Sharon.

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:15.438
[SHARON]
Huh?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.316
Are you really asking how
to become a good wife?

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.151
Why, is there
trouble in paradise?

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.278
I don't think I'd
say that exactly.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.907
It's just, this is my first time
being with a man in general,

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:29.410
so I'm not sure if I'm,
you know, acting right.

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.662
[TWILIGHT] Our investigation
into Yor's past connections

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:35.124
left me wondering if she'd had
any previous relationships.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.793
Guess not.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:39.712
[YOR] I'm just worried things
will fall apart at this rate.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.339
It doesn't help that
I'm a horrible cook

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.508
on top of everything else.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.885
[TWILIGHT]
Anya's words really got to her.

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.388
It would seem that Yor is
trying to be more wife-like

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.557
for the sake of our
pretend family.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.560
On the other hand, she could
also be trying to act like

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:57.563
the perfect wife to
pull one over on me.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:58.815
[CAMILLA] Must be rough
when your husband's

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:00.900
clearly so far out
of your league.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.819
[MILLIE] Why don't you
just break up already?

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.113
[YOR]
Uh, I'd like to avoid that.

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.699
[TWILIGHT] Yor's relationship
with her coworkers seems a bit--

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:09.700
what's the word?

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.452
[SECTION CHIEF A]
Hey, what are you doing?

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.955
That's enough talk,
back to work.

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.665
[CAMILLA]
Yes, sir!

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:17.083
[SECTION CHIEF A]
Say, Yor.

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.418
Do you think you could
go drop this off

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.545
at the post office for me?

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.296
[YOR]
Sure thing.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:23.965
[TWILIGHT] Guess I'm not
gonna get a clear answer

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.218
until I take matters
into my own hands.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.560
[YOR]
Come to think of it,

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.397
Loid and I have separate
bank accounts.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.607
Maybe if I contributed
a bit of the money I make

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.068
from my real job to the family,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.779
I'd be a little more
useful to him.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.490
But I don't want him
suspicious of me either.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:50.867
And I don't think
he ever mentioned

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:53.995
needing extra financial
support with our arrangement.

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:57.457
[FIRST LIEUTENANT A] You there,
could we have some of your time?

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.543
We have some questions.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.004
[YOR]
Th-The Secret Police!

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:06.048
I'm sorry, did I do
something wrong, sir?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.842
[YOR] Was it suspicious
that I was looking at ads

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.135
meant for families?

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:12.221
Am I such a bad wife
I don't even look taken?

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:15.141
[YOR] I-I-I'm married,
just so you know!

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:18.144
We're not hitting on you.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.645
What are we even doing?

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.481
You call me outta nowhere
to come play dress up

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:23.858
so we can give your wife
the third degree?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.943
[TWILIGHT] Just be quiet
and follow the plan.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.028
It's part of my mission.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:29.906
[FRANKY]
Yeah, and I'm not!

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:33.284
As a part of our postal
inspection duties, we read this.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.369
You just tried to
mail it, didn't you?

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:38.873
We believe it contains a coded
message intended for the West.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.375
Is the sender, Burns,
your superior?

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:42.835
Um, that's correct.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.086
[FRANKY]
What's your name?

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:48.257
[YOR]
Yor Bri-- It's Yor Forger.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:52.386
Well, wouldja look at that?
Yor Forger, eh?

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:55.139
That name is listed right
here as a "collaborator"!

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.391
That is quite the coincidence.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:59.227
[TWILIGHT]
He's hamming it up.

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:01.354
[TWILIGHT]
So you're in on it together.

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.315
Wait, in on what?
There must be some mistake!

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.609
[FRANKY] Lying's only
gonna make this worse.

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.320
We apprehended someone in the
City Hall finance department

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.780
just the other day.

00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.491
It seems the corruption there
spreads far and wide.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:16.244
I heard about what happened
to that guy--nasty stuff.

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:18.454
Apparently, the torture
left him so messed up

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:19.747
that when he got
back to his cell,

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:22.124
he offed himself by tearing
out his own tongue.

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.377
And you know, there was another
chick just about your age

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:26.128
who got brought in last month.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.172
That official's secretary?

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.341
[TWILIGHT] Don't go too
far with this, Franky.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:31.676
Oh yeah, her.

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:35.346
She had a family member
in the SSS. We let her off.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.139
[FRANKY]
One of the perks of the job.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.766
Pretty cool that
our family members

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:42.144
can be let off the hook
for most allegations.

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:45.481
[TWILIGHT] Anyway, we're gonna
need to take you downtown.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:46.983
[TWILIGHT]
If she's aware Yuri works

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:48.859
for the State Security Service,

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:51.279
she could stop this by
mentioning his name.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.407
There's no reason to keep his
secret from his coworkers,

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:56.325
and if she lets the
situation escalate,

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:59.036
it'll only be that
much harder to fix.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.329
Come on, Yor.

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:03.541
If you're in on this,
call your brother for help.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.501
And if you're not...

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:06.836
Excuse me.

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:10.089
I work hard every day for
the citizens of this country.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.300
I'd never participate
in espionage.

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:14.010
There's no use playing dumb!

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.679
Just shut up and come
with us already.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:20.224
Ah! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:23.352
Sorry, but I believe
I told you I'm married.

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.146
So please don't touch me.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:26.689
Hey, lady, you realize

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.442
you're putting your family
in danger by doing this?

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:31.694
[YOR] My younger brother
and husband are both kind

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.655
and upstanding
members of society.

00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:37.199
If you're suggesting you intend
to harm them in some way...

00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:38.701
[gasps]

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:43.164
...then frankly I don't
care who you work for,

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.541
I'll show no mercy!

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.631
Hey, Second Lieutenant Mop,

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:53.799
are you certain
about this cipher?

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:57.178
What? Well, of course I'm--
Ah! What the hell?

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:01.140
This isn't the racoon cipher.
It's the caterpillar cipher!

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.933
[TWILGIHT]
Then if we decode it right,

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:07.480
this is a letter Burns sent to
a renowned hemorrhoids doctor.

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.775
I see. He used a cipher
because he was embarrassed.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.485
He should know better.

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:15.112
So yes, it would appear
we had the wrong idea.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.532
Your name isn't on here.
You're free to go.

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:19.950
Though I suggest you
keep this matter

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.620
a secret for Burns's sake.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.211
[FRANKY]
That felt like a bad prank.

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:31.420
Considering the way she acted,

00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:33.464
it's pretty clear to me that
she has no connections

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.550
with the Secret Police.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.135
Oh, come on, what's wrong?

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.513
Don't tell me you feel
guilty for doubting her.

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:41.597
[TWILIGHT]
I don't.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:42.598
I've warned you before,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.309
you gotta keep your
emotions outta this.

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:47.520
This is the job
we signed up for.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:49.897
If you wanna stay alive,
you can't trust anyone.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:52.191
That's just the way it is.

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:57.405
[TWILIGHT] Don't lecture
me wearing that face.

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.531
[FRANKY screams]

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:01.117
[FRANKY] But you're the one
who made it for me!

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:04.537
Damn it! I thought I could land
a few chicks with that on!

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.497
My precious hot-guy
face is ruined!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.998
[TWILIGHT] Deceiving a woman
that you're dating

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.417
is a terrible idea.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.544
[FRANKY]
Are you freaking kidding me?!

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.758
[YOR]
Today was rough.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.386
I can't believe I
was almost arrested.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.555
I went from worrying I
wasn't a good enough wife

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:25.266
to nearly ruining
my entire family.

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:27.309
Yor, what a coincidence.

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:28.436
Hey there, Loid.

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:29.645
[TWILIGHT]
Perfect timing.

00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:31.439
Why don't we go home together?

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.108
Oh, there's something
on your collar again.

00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:40.573
Sorry I'm such a wreck.
I'm no good at this.

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.116
What kind of wife
doesn't even notice

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:45.077
when her clothes are dirty?

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:47.580
[TWILIGHT] Well, if you
ask me, you're not alone.

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.123
I think plenty of
families out there

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.041
have someone playing a part.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:51.917
They tell themselves,

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:56.338
"This is how a wife should act"
or, "This is what parents do."

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.259
Striving to live up to one's
ideals is admirable, of course.

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:02.136
But if you dwell
on that too much,

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.513
it's easy to lose
sight of who you are

00:21:04.555 --> 00:21:07.475
and where your true
strengths lie.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.977
In fact, a lot of the
patients at my hospital

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:13.522
are struggling for
that very reason.

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:18.986
It's exhausting, putting on
an act every waking moment.

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:21.113
Definitely.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:24.283
Just be yourself.
That's all you need to do.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.534
And if you're confident,

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:27.912
the less people will
suspect anything.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:29.455
Plus, I'm sure Anya'd be happier

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:32.750
seeing you with a
smile on your face.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:35.044
[YOR]
Thank you for that. I...

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:37.087
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:40.549
I'm truly grateful that
I married you, Loid.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.558
[FRANKY] Don't tell me you feel
guilty for doubting her.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.110
Hm? What did you
just throw away?

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.863
Nothing. Just the lint
from your collar.

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:05.699
But anyway, we never
did anything to celebrate

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:08.077
our one-year
anniversary, did we?

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:09.787
Why don't we get some
cake on the way home?

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.455
[YOR]
Good idea!

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.379
[ANYA]
Hey Papa! Hey, Mama!

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.423
I'm back home from school!

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.926
Welcome home, Anya.
How was your day?

00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:25.469
You okay?

00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:30.599
You're getting along!
Like I wanted!

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.352
I told you before,

00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:35.688
we weren't ever fighting
in the first place.

00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:37.857
[YOR]
Guess what? We bought a cake!

00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:40.109
[ANYA]
Whoa! I want cake!

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.193
[TWILIGHT]
Hey, don't jump.

00:22:41.235 --> 00:22:43.779
You're going to bother
the people downstairs.

00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:19.041
[inaudible]
