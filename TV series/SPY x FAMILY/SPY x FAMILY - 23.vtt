WEBVTT

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:47.941
[KIM gasps]

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.862
[COMMENTATOR A] The Phony
couple is on fire this game!

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.072
Try to return this!

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.782
[COMMENTATOR A] Look at
that crazy amount of spin

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.368
on Carrol's backhand!

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.786
[gasps]

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.749
[gasps]

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.462
[CARROL]
Damn it. Time for Plan C.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.131
We need to change
the height of the net.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.141
See that?

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:24.478
Yeah. It's moving by
about a ball's height.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.106
So we'll adjust our trajectory
when we strike back.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.487
It's not working for us at all!

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.989
[CARROL]
How 'bout some wind, huh?

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.410
[BOTH gasp]

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:43.163
[KIM] What the--? They're using
it to their own advantage!

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:44.081
[CARROL]
Crap!

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.832
[NARRATOR] The Campbells
employed seemingly

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.126
every dirty trick in the book.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.337
[CARROL] Come on!
Coat that ball in stink spray!

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.839
[KIM] But we're gonna
have to smell it, too!

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.175
[NARRATOR] Though they only
amounted to minor annoyances

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:57.803
to the pair of spies who
had found their groove.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:01.098
Great eyes, reflexes,
and control.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.642
Extremely impressive, Nafalia.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.769
I'm glad to have
you as my partner.

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:07.437
Thanks, darling.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:10.190
[COMMENTATOR A] The final set
is about to begin! Which one...

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.942
[NIGHTFALL]
Why?

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:14.820
Why can't this this
tournament last forever?

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.115
Maybe I'll force a tiebreaker
that keeps us together longer.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.658
No, I can't do that.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.785
It could make Twilight
start to resent me.

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.912
We're riding a wave
to victory again.

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.915
It would be unfair to
take that away from him.

00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:28.166
[TWILIGHT]
It looks as though Nightfall's

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.918
plotting out her strategy.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.754
Perhaps my little pep
talk had an impact.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.756
[CAMPBELL] What do you
two think you're doing?

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.633
Do you have any idea
how much your loss

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.593
could end up costing me?

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.430
Guess we'll have to
pull out the big guns.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.394
[TWILIGHT]
Are they out of dirty tricks?

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:50.313
[NIGHTFALL] Lobbed it up
perfectly for a slam.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:53.108
[TWILIGHT]
Uh? A new signal?

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.492
Nafalia!

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.288
[gasps]

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.914
[NIGHTFALL]
Twi--

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.084
[COMMENTATOR A]
Whoa!

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:14.629
Twain Phony pounced onto his
wife and tumbled to the ground!

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.672
Hey, now.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.591
Can you old farts wait
for the make-out session

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.967
till we're done?

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.968
[CARROL]
What was that?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.387
It's like he knew
the shot was coming.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.931
[NIGHTFALL] Twain!
Sweetie, are you all right?

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:29.019
I'm fine, don't worry.
It's nothing serious.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.855
[NIGHTFALL]
Oh, my love.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.357
[TWILIGHT]
They're using rubber bullets.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.151
Sniping at us from
the air ducts.

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:40.989
See? They even painted it
green to match the court.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.992
I'm sorry. I should've been
paying closer attention.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.786
It's not your fault.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:49.539
But I did plan for this.
I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:50.957
Always ready.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.918
[NIGHTFALL] Yet another
reminder that Twilight's

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.296
the embodiment of perfection!

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:59.633
[CARROL] What the--? How is he
not hurt? Did it miss him?

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:02.135
They're taking this
entirely too far.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.514
Do you think that we should try
to get a penalty called on them?

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.141
Even a rubber bullet can
cause serious injuries.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.434
Fair point.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.019
But don't forget that
most of the staff

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.313
is on Campbell's payroll.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.732
Not to mention, if the
tournament is shut down,

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:18.401
we'd lose our chance to get
our hands on the painting,

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.362
putting the mission at risk.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.614
Thankfully, these
are low velocity.

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.032
If we make ourselves targets,

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.077
then move erratically,
we'll throw off their aim.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.703
So watch for their signals.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.372
I'll do my best.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.165
[UMPIRE A]
Are you folks okay?

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.166
[TWILIGHT laughs]

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.334
I'm sorry.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.629
Had too many drinks last night.
Guess I'm still feeling it.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:38.505
There's no way!

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.257
[COMMENTATOR A] Incredible!
Even while battling...

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.342
[TWILIGHT]
He's right.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.724
[COMMENTATOR A] And Phony
is back on the serve.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.602
[TWILIGHT] They're going to fire
right when I hit the ball.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.104
[COMMENTATOR A] Twain is
stumbling and swerving

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.730
like crazy!

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.443
Crap. Missed him.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.611
Hey, court squad,

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.738
we're gonna have to work
together on this one.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.241
The Campbell kids need to win
this thing no matter what.

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:07.909
[MINIONS]
Roger!

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.037
[COMMENTATOR A]
Apparently, Nafalia is...

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.039
What's the deal?

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.082
[COMMENTATOR A]
Seems neither Phony

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.792
was drinking alone last night.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.795
[TWILIGHT] Their overconfidence
is making them easy to read.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.381
BB team! We need you now!

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.383
Don't let the crowd
or the umpires catch on.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:24.801
Number one, roger.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.219
Number two, roger.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.429
Stay on guard.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.097
Got it.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.724
[TWILIGHT]
Even the ball boys?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.267
[chuckles]

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.102
[COMMENTATOR A]
Huge whiff by Phony!

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.478
He knocked it away!

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.771
[NO.2]
Same thing happened to mine!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.940
It appears we have
two more foes.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:39.858
[TWILIGHT]
We do.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.861
But unlike the sniper, we can
track their hands and eyes.

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:46.740
It's simply another issue for
us to contend with, easily.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.867
Let's end this!

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.244
[COMMENTATOR A]
The Phony pair continues

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.455
their bizarre,
acrobatic movements!

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:58.293
Is this the legendary drunken-
fist style of the Far East?

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.211
What the hell's the
matter with you?!

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:03.089
You have to beat those Phonies!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.928
[groans]

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.804
[UMPIRE A]
Son, is there a problem?

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.850
Oh, uh, I must've drank
some spoiled milk this morning.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:14.893
[COMMENTATOR A]
Oh, no!

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:16.978
Carrol has been playing
through a stomachache!

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.273
We're watching a passionate
battle of wills!

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:24.235
[CARROL] They can't beat us!
I don't want to lose!

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:29.366
[CARROL]
But we're no match for them!

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.496
[COMMENTATOR A]
Game, set, and match!

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:39.250
The newest Cambelldon champs
are the Phony couple!

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.170
[CARROL] You saw right through
all of our tricks, didn't you?

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.339
And no matter what
we threw at you,

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.299
you wiped the floor with us.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.677
That was brutal.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:53.556
Now I know what it's like...
to feel disappointment!

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.768
You're still a young man--
a talented one.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.770
If you keep working
hard on your game,

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.398
you'll be a top-ranked player.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:08.071
Thank you, Twain! I promise
to do my best from now on!

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:08.822
You got this.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.282
[NIGHTFALL] You strive not only
to complete the mission,

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.493
but also to rehabilitate
our enemy?

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:15.912
You're amazing,
Twilight! I love you!

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.123
So lame.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:21.376
We may have lost the tournament,
but gained much more.

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:24.087
My precious little
man has grown up.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:28.216
Has it not sunk in how
much money you've lost?

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.759
[SECRETARY A]
Sir, phone call.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:32.512
It's not the time!
I'm having a moment here!

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:33.805
[SECRETARY A]
Sorry, but--

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.057
[COMMENTATOR A] For their win,
the Phonies will be presented

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:39.144
with a piece of their choice
from Mr. Campbell's collection.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:43.064
Congratulations to the
victorious couple!

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.278
[NIGHTFALL]
Right here.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.864
Lady in the Sun
is the one we want.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:51.865
[SECRETARY B]
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.576
I'll fetch it from the
gallery right away.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.244
[CAMPBELL]
Please wait.

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.620
I hope that you can forgive me,

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:59.497
but that particular
piece is the only one

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.750
I simply can't part
with at the moment.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.418
Oh? And why's that?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.129
It's clearly listed
in your catalog.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.465
[CAMPBELL] Something came
up all of a sudden.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.759
But please,
pick any other piece.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.762
I'll even throw in something
extra, if you'd like.

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:14.637
What now?

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:15.930
Let's see.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:19.059
I'd bet the State Security
Service just called him.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.560
No big surprise there.

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.729
They must've found
out about the code.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.773
They're likely on
their way to get it.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:29.694
So then, you can take
a little more time to decide.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.029
Can we look at the art

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.615
and then make our final
decision afterwards?

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.534
[CAMPBELL]
Sure, that's perfectly fine.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.246
Wow, impressive.

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.749
Only a select few
are allowed in here.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.334
You're quite a lucky lady.

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.711
Hang on.
Where'd your husband go?

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.464
[NIGHTFALL] He went to
sleep off his hangover.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.510
[NIGHTFALL]
Looks like it's still here.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.720
[NIGHTFALL] If Lady in
the Sun is off the table,

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:58.807
perhaps you might suggest
something other than a painting.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.892
I'm happy to show you around.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.019
Can I put my bag here for a bit?

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.771
Sure thing.

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.981
Pardon, sir.
The Lady in the Sun?

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.776
Yes. They should be here
in about ten minutes.

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:10.860
Bring it out to the lobby

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.279
and you can just hand
it over when they arrive.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.073
Sir.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.670
Hey, what are you doing?
Hurry up.

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:32.048
I'm simply making sure the piece
is in pristine condition.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.299
[SECURITY A]
Don't worry about it.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:37.303
I don't believe they're taking
it on artistic merit alone.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:42.225
[STATE SECURITY A] Yep. Looks
like Lady in the Sun to me.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.185
Appreciate your cooperation.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.437
Oh, it's not a problem at all.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.482
I'm always happy
to be of service.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.278
[SECRETARY B]
I'll see Misses Phoney out.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.989
If that's all right with you,
of course, Mr. Campbell.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.448
Yes, please do.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.242
And you might want to
ask if they'd be open

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.952
to playing for us
while you're at it.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.413
[CAMPBELL laughs]

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.508
[NIGHTFALL]
Do you think WISE

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.429
will let us moonlight
as tennis pros?

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.182
I've had more than my
fill of tennis for now.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.268
So what did you pick
from his collection?

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.646
This bizarre pot. He threw
in some gaudy rings, too.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.690
I can't say that
I'm too interested.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.026
[TWILIGHT] Suppose they
could be a gift for Handler.

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.069
[NIGHTFALL]
Good idea.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.952
Exhaustion hit all at once.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.913
The mission went well, though.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:49.083
I did panic for a moment when he
said he couldn't hand it over.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.714
[TWILIGHT] But it all
worked out in the end.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.799
If you hadn't snuck
the fake in your bag,

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.343
we would've been
in real trouble.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.470
[NIGHTFALL] Only possible
because of your disguise

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:02.222
and sleight of hand skills.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:05.767
We're just lucky the code wasn't
hidden somewhere in the frame.

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:06.726
[TWILIGHT]
Yeah.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:10.271
I can see some traces of ink
on the back, which must be it.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.023
Let's get this to the
analyst team at HQ

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.942
and see what they say.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.193
[NIGHTFALL]
The State Security Service

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.153
should be occupied for a while--

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.323
too busy trying to chase down
a code that doesn't exist.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:22.825
[TWILIGHT]
You're right. Heh.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.328
Well, anyway...

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.081
Mission accomplished, Nightfall!

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.045
[TWILIGHT] You can let me
out over there, please.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.755
I don't mind taking
you to your place.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.548
[NIGHTFALL]
I want more time with you!

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.635
Loid Forger's a devoted
husband and father,

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.512
so being dropped off
by a young lady

00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:44.973
may give our neighbors
the wrong impression.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.516
It's not unheard of
to get reported

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:49.644
to the Secret Police
over adultery.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:53.231
[NIGHTFALL] Twilight, you see
how useful I am, don't you?

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.608
I did everything flawlessly.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.943
It's clear that you
currently have

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.570
the wrong partner
for Operation Strix.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.823
It should be me.

00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.700
Here we are, then.

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.205
[TWILIGHT]
I'll see you at the hospital.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.582
[YOR]
Come on, Anya! Grab Bond!

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.875
We should start
heading home soon.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.836
[ANYA]
Okey doke!

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:20.758
Tennis again? I guess they
must really be enjoying it.

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.473
[TWILIGHT]
Uh.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.309
Nightfall!

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.270
Good evening, Misses Forger.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.523
Oh, Fiona? Good evening to you.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.274
[ANYA]
That weird lady.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.984
We're done for the day.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.193
[YOR]
Hey, Loid.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:42.196
Fiona gave me a ride since she
was heading over this way.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.699
I figured I'd say hello
while I'm here.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.701
[YOR]
Well, hello.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.787
[NIGHTFALL]
Do you play tennis, too?

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.956
[gasps] Kind of.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.958
But after playing with
Loid the other day,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.085
Anya's gotten a little
obsessed with it.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.463
Oh, yeah. I'm the
home run champ.

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.174
All that practicing really
paid off for me today.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:02.342
So thank you.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:03.426
[YOR]
Happy to hear that!

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.177
[NIGHTFALL]
Hmph.

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:07.305
Like you could ever help
Twilight improve his skills.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:08.848
[ANYA]
Where are the cool prizes?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.308
[NIGHTFALL]
How arrogant.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.560
I would never think I
could make him better,

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.228
but if I was given the chance,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.482
I'd make him far more
powerful in record time.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:18.649
[NIGHTFALL]
Well, Misses Forger,

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:21.069
you must be quite
the tennis player.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.822
In that case, how about you
and I play a quick match?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.492
[TWILIGHT] Uh, maybe now's
not the time, Fiona.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:31.371
I've still got some energy
left today, so it's fine.

00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:35.458
So will you indulge me?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.959
[NIGHTFALL]
I'll crush you.

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.754
I will crush your spirit,
break your heart,

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:42.965
and make you lose your spot in
the happy little Forger family.

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.884
[YOR]
I'm in way over my head.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.595
I think Fiona should take
my place and be your wife.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.138
[TWILIGHT]
Great idea!

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.182
Well, uh... I, uhh...

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:53.226
[YOR]
What the heck is going on?

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:55.645
[TWILIGHT]
You don't have to do it, Yor.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.356
Okay, I'll play!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.149
[YOR] All I know is,
losing or running away

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.402
are both out of the question!

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.778
[TWILIGHT] I've always
wanted to marry someone

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.530
who's super good at tennis.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:09.367
[NIGHTFALL] For real?
I'm totally awesome at tennis!

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.624
Whoa, Anya! Did you see this
week's <i>Berlint in Love</i>?

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.876
Ooh! The craziest
thing happened!

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.045
The protag's fiancée and
his childhood girlfriend

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.755
happened to run into each other!

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:25.216
Those girls were about
to have a real catfight!

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.426
[BECKY laughs]

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.386
--You should've seen it!
--I only like cartoons.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:32.890
[ANYA] I get it now. I finally
understand how Becky felt!

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:36.018
'Cause I love super cool
fight scenes, too.

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:55.288
[NIGHTFALL] You'd better
not hold anything back.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:56.622
Watch it, Fiona.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.292
Please stay out of this,
Doctor Forger.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:00.501
[YOR]
She's right.

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:03.921
Don't want to insult my opponent
by not doing my best.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.757
I'll give it
everything I've got!

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.975
[YOR]
Whoops!

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:18.060
[NIGHTFALL]
Hmph.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:23.191
I'd be disappointed in you, Yor
Briar, but I knew you'd fail.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.947
[YOR] I can't believe
that happened again!

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.283
If I put too much
strength into my swing,

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:35.453
the racket strings just cut the
ball into a hundred pieces.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.288
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ball.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.082
Tennis really just
isn't my game.

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.042
Gotta to do my best

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.711
while holding back enough
to not kill another one.

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.838
[YOR] Anya, will you get
me another ball, please?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.632
Ball dog! We need you
on the court!

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.050
[BOND barks]

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.053
Sorry! That's my fault!

00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:53.888
[NIGHTFALL]
Wait, uh, what?

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.348
I don't understand
what happened.

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:58.476
She shattered the ball? Umm...

00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.936
[NIGHTFALL]
Huh?

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:06.234
[NIGHTFALL] It's faster
than the speed of sound?

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.819
Doesn't stray a millimeter
from its course.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.323
Yeah, just a straight line
headed out of bounds.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.325
Get your head in the
game, Nightfall.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.536
Put up that racket for
protection, at least.

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:17.328
Or you'll die!

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:21.582
[NIGHTFALL yells]

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:25.294
[NIGHTFALL] It's so heavy!
I can't push it back!

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:29.382
Still... my love for Twilight
is stronger than ever!

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:32.635
I must tap into those feelings
that have grown over time.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:35.096
Use that longing and
the power of love

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:37.640
and just move the
racket forward!

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.393
Aim directly for Twilight's
heart, Nightfall!

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:42.645
Don't let this woman
steal him from you!

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.146
He's fighting for the future,

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:47.024
and he deserves to
have me by his side!

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.442
Someday we'll stand in our home

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:50.319
and laugh about the
hardships we faced.

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:51.946
We'll retire in
a neutral country,

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.948
spending our days
gazing at the ocean.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.409
Ugh! I can't handle
thinking about it!

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.787
That's why, when it comes
to being "Misses Forger,"

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:04.667
obviously... it should be me!

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.888
[NIGHTFALL] I've lost. Utter
defeat. Never had a chance.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.890
[TWILIGHT]
I tried to warn you, Nightfall.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:23.185
Oh, no! Fiona, are you hurt?

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:24.103
[NIGHTFALL]
It's true.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.355
You're better than me,
for now at least.

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:27.690
[YOR]
Say what?

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:30.109
[NIGHTFALL]
But, Misses Forger,

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.613
I request a revenge
match in the future.

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.245
[NIGHTFALL] Try and enjoy
this nice life of yours

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.873
until I come back
and take it all away.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.709
Because I am never giving up!

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.919
Uh. I didn't mean
to make her upset.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.463
[ANYA]
What a weird, energetic lady.

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:53.924
Oh. I think she just feels
really passionate about tennis.

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:56.427
[TWILIGHT] I hope this doesn't
make Yor suspicious.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.012
But we both know
it's a fake marriage,

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.056
so what's the worst
that can happen?

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.849
[YOR]
Loid.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.601
You saw me win just now?

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.729
Uh, yeah, I did.
I'm happy for you.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:07.897
I just beat her!

00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:10.316
Oh, yeah, you really did!

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:16.864
[TWILIGHT sighs]

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.492
[TWILIGHT] Here comes
that exhaustion again.

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.744
[ANYA]
Papa, I'm really hungry.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:22.828
[BOND barks]

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.954
[TWILIGHT]
Okay.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:27.333
It's definitely a takeout
kind of night though.

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:33.673
You did quite an excellent job

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:35.591
with retrieving that
painting last week.

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:38.511
I have the results
of the analysis ready.

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:39.804
[TWILIGHT]
Hm? Where's Nightfall?

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:40.930
She's gone into the mountains

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:43.849
to train on her forehand
swing speed and power.

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:44.975
Is that so?

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:48.646
The code on the painting
was extremely simple to crack.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.065
It lead us to a
top-secret depository,

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.651
so we sent agents there
to retrieve the goods.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.320
[TWILIGHT] Do we have
the Zacharis Dossier?

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:01.117
A diary?

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.619
[ZACHARIS]
August 21.

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.247
Today, I've sealed
something very dangerous

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:07.915
within these walls.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:11.752
My photographs
of young starlets.

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:12.920
[groans]

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.214
[ZACHARIS] I love theatre
in all its forms!

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:18.426
Though I much prefer comedic
musicals to tragic operas.

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:21.887
Even more so if they feature
beautiful young ladies!

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:24.557
I make it a point to
always support them.

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:26.225
[TWILIGHT]
Well, I see.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.810
[ZACHARIS]
My obsession drove my wife

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.478
to the point of
violent outburst.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.688
[ZACHARIS' WIFE] How much
money have you wasted

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.480
on these hussies?

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:34.316
[ZACHARIS] I'm just trying to be
a patron of the arts, dear!

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.902
[ZACHARIS] I convinced her to
attend a performance with me,

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.487
but she did not enjoy it.

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:40.197
[ZACHARIS' WIFE] Why do they
just burst into song?

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.031
Who does that?

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:43.701
[ZACHARIS] She ordered me to
throw out all my headshots,

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:46.871
but I simply couldn't bear
to part with the rare ones.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:47.747
Since that day,

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:50.541
I've only made clandestine
trips to the theatre.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.668
I'm sealing away this
ticking time bomb

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:57.214
in hopes that I can avoid
reigniting our conflict.

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:00.468
So then, "the flames
of war" thing

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:01.927
wasn't about East and West.

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:03.763
Domestic situation.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:06.348
Then why was this regarded
as a top-secret file?

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.559
And why go through
all that trouble?

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:09.894
Before the war ended,

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.438
Zacharis hosted some
Western diplomats.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.814
Took 'em to the theater.

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:15.566
But he was so
secretive about it.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.318
Now we know it was
a personal thing--

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:20.196
he was just trying to hide
the excursion from his wife.

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:22.490
But that's probably
how this rumor started.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:23.407
No, wait.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.533
There has to be another code

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.410
hidden between this
journal and the photos!

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:27.119
Nope.

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:29.997
Our team did an extensive
analysis and found nothing.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.541
[sighs]

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:35.044
No bombshell there that
could restart the war,

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:38.255
do we should consider
it a huge victory.

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:43.010
Guess you're right.

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:44.470
Hm?

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.141
A picture of the colonel?

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:51.310
"My beloved wife and daughter."

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:54.104
After all that mess,
he stayed true to his family.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.065
He even took his
secret to the grave

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:57.775
out of respect
for their feelings.

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.443
Well, if he truly loved them,

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:01.445
he would've tossed the
creepy pictures, right?

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:03.697
Ugh! You still don't
get it, do ya?

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:07.368
It's not about that, you see?
It's because they're rare!

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.537
[TWILIGHT] Must be tough
to maintain a happy family

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.664
for so long.

00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:16.377
Let's see, two of
these apple tarts

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:19.380
and two caramel
nut cakes as well.

00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:05.945
[NIGHTFALL yelling]

00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:18.248
[inaudible]
