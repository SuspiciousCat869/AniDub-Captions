00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:11.094
[MEMBER A]
Today's the day.

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.721
[CHIEF]
Hmm? For what?

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:14.014
[MEMBER A]
Did you forget?

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:16.683
Eden College will announce
the admissions results.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.562
Currently scheduled to be
posted at 1200 hours.

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:22.731
[TWILIGHT]
This is far too stressful.

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:23.774
[YOR gasps]

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:27.569
My gold bracelet just snapped.
Why today of all days?

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:29.530
Huh, coincidence.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:30.405
[YOR gasps]

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.991
Look there, Loid. See that?

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.120
Oh, now don't be silly.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.289
You're not superstitious,
are you?

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:41.124
Me? Not really, no.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.334
[ANYA]
Papa.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.293
What's wrong?

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.880
I, uh, stepped in poopoo.

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:48.298
[YOR, TWILIGHT chuckle]

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.801
[CHIEF] Admissions results
for Eden College?

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:54.012
Ah, part of Agent Twilight's
special mission, yes?

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.682
Correct. Known as
Operation Strix.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.560
Peace between East and West
is hanging in the balance.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.895
I'm surprised you're
not more concerned.

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.814
[CHIEF] You're not well
acquainted with Twilight,

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.148
are you?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.025
[MEMBER A]
Um. No, sir.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.485
[CHIEF]
He's the best in Westalis,

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:10.028
unparalleled in the field,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.823
so there's nothing to
be concerned about.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.951
Soon, he'll tell us that
"The sakura blossoms bloom."

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.869
Meaning what exactly?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.871
[CHIEF]
It's a code from the Far East.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.624
Meaning they passed.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:25.794
[TWILIGHT]
No.

00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:02.641
[FAMILIES chattering]

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:05.435
[YOR]
We failed.

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:06.853
[TWILIGHT]
We failed.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.855
We failed.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.483
Hey, let's head back home.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.944
Yeah. I'll make some tea.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.362
I'm so sorry.

00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:18.073
It's all because I
stepped in that poopoo.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:20.117
[HENDERSON]
A moment of your time, Forgers?

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.077
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.287
Master Henderson.

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:27.374
[TWILIGHT]
What is this?

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:30.127
You see the name at the top?

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.337
[TWILIGHT]
It's Anya, but...

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.881
[HENDERSON] The waiting list
of successful applicants,

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.883
confidential, of course.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.677
So she's an alternate?

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:39.845
That's correct.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.763
Once all her
scores were tallied,

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.223
your daughter Anya was placed

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.600
at the number one
spot on that list.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.978
Which means if any of the
current successful applicants

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.690
were to withdraw, she will be
offered their place instead.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:55.527
But, I mean, after
what happened...

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.904
[HENDERSON] Care to guess which
of the creatures on this planet

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.698
are the most lethal to humans?

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.949
Uh.

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.868
Mosquitos!

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.911
Therefore, by saving Master Swan

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.621
from that brutal
killer in there,

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.499
your score increased
tremendously.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.001
That's just ridiculous.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.627
Stand proud, Forgers.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.213
Your family is worthy
of joining our school.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.549
All it takes is one
student to drop out

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.468
to clear the way for Anya?

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.094
[HENDERSON]
Indeed.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.597
[YOR]
But if no spots open up...

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.640
[HENDERSON]
Now, to be candid...

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.810
Ah! The Thorn Princess?
What do you want from me?

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.813
[YOR] I want one thing,
Secretary Zachry Feiss.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.774
And that would be the
honor of taking your life

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:34.858
on this fine evening.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.070
No! Please, don't kill me!
I have a son! He's only six!

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.990
He just passed the application
process for Eden College!

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.158
But if something happened to me,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.785
I'm afraid he'd
have to drop out!

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.412
I'm aware. That's why
I'm doing this.

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.455
Huh?

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:51.833
I need a position to
open up for my Anya.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.335
So you have to die!

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.669
[ZACHRY FEISS screams]

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:55.462
[YOR]
No, no, no!

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:57.214
You can't take the life
of an innocent person

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:58.632
because of some school!

00:04:58.673 --> 00:04:59.966
What's wrong?

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.177
Oh, um, I'm quite all right.

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.514
[YOR] I hope you'll
forgive me, Zachry Feiss.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.724
[HENDERSON]
It's no matter.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:11.895
Every year there are a few that
withdraw for various reasons.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:15.023
So please, prepare yourselves
for that eventuality.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.943
Master Henderson, thank you.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.613
Forgers, you should also
prepare for the eventuality

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.908
that I will not be here
when you arrive.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.787
I was forced to give Swan
a good thrashing...

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.373
[TWILIGHT] That pompous man
or this instructor.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.250
I'm not entirely sure
which one will prove

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.960
most useful to my mission,

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.922
but I have ways to destroy
anyone who'd jeopardize it.

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:41.341
[TWILIGHT] Is there anything
I can do to help?

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:46.847
Elegant attempt at comfort.
I appreciate that.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:50.600
For now, simply await the call.

she's doing some kind of
prayer dance get into Eden.

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.116
Ah, obviously.

into some cartoon's theme park,
so that's gotta be it.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.868
[TWILIGHT]
Fine.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.036
[FRANKY]
All right!

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.579
We'd better strike
while the iron's hot!

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.831
I'm gonna book the castle;
you're in charge of our ride!

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.541
[TWILIGHT]
What? You want us to go today?

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.959
And I'm handling part of it?

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:06.838
[FRANKY] Of course, you are!
I mean, it's for your daughter!

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.511
[sighs]

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.306
[gasps]

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:20.435
Message from Twilight.
Code GO005.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.978
He pulled it off.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.022
[MEMBER A]
"The sakura blossoms bloom."

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.774
[COMMS ENGINEER A]
He sent another message.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.400
What is it?

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.905
[COMMS ENGINEER A]
Our reply?

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.241
[CHIEF]
He's the best in Westalis,

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.495
unparalleled in the field.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:39.954
[MEMBER A]
He'll get whatever he needs!

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.415
[COMMS ENGINEER A]
Yes, ma'am!

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:43.583
To Falcon in Rhynnick:

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.543
Emergency operation
from Twilight.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.252
[FALCON]
Falcon here.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.422
Roger emergency operation
from Twilight, over.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.257
[TWILIGHT]
"Eighteen-thirty hours.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:54.010
Meet downstream on
the Nein in Rhynnick."

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.721
They sure didn't
waste any time.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:00.475
Just look at it. This castle
is filled with cool stuff!

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:02.018
I'm gonna make a quiz!

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.729
Yeah, that's a great idea!

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.232
Whoa! Holy--!

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:11.027
[ANYA] It's so neat! I've
never been on a plane before!

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.363
[TWILIGHT]
There you go.

00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:15.073
Do I look cool?

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.575
[TWILIGHT]
Extremely.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.494
[YOR]
This is amazing, Loid!

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:22.622
Where'd you get this
li'l plane from anyway?

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.332
It's just so adorable!

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:24.999
This?

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.626
A couple of my
esteemed colleagues

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.628
are letting me borrow it.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.298
[YOR] Thanks for bein' so cool
to my man all the time.

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.637
Seatbelts on,
all right? Here we go.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.056
[FRANKY, ANYA]
Let's fly!

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:50.567
[ANYA]
Ah! This is super cool!

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.113
[FRANKY]
Yahoo!

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.993
[YOR]
Ooh, so pretty.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.871
It looks like a big
ol' treasure chest.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.415
Papa, you're so cool!

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.171
[FRANKY]
Look! There it is!

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.964
[gasps]

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.090
[FRANKY]
Ah, crap!

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.009
[ANYA]
It's a real-life castle!

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.552
[TWILIGHT]
Hey, settle down!

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:21.139
We're landing, so please make
sure you're buckled in tight.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.145
[ANYA]
We're in Anya's castle!

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.397
[TWILIGHT]
You're not a kid, Franky!

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.984
This is the best, you know.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.362
[TWILIGHT]
Hm? What's the matter?

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.822
[ANYA]
It's not right.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.782
[TWILIGHT]
Not right, how?

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.202
[ANYA] Without enemies and
maids and stuff like that,

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.329
it's just a big empty house.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.206
Feeling sad now.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.374
I don't think I can
go to that school.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:52.420
Yeah, me, too. Not very
castle-y, huh, Anya?

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.881
Guess your daddy better
step up his game.

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.466
A message from Twilight.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.051
He's requesting
some more agents.

00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:00.637
As many as we can send.

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:04.140
This will be a true
test for WISE.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.184
[COMMS ENGINEER A] Attention,
all agents in Ostania.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.938
Report to Newston Castle
for an emergency operation.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.689
This is an extremely
important assignment

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.691
regarding Operation Strix.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.818
Mission rank is over double S.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.279
Repeat: This is an extremely
important assignment

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.156
regarding Operation Strix.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:23.034
Mission rank is over double S.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.373
[ANYA gasps]

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.500
[AGENT C] That's really
Twilight, isn't it?

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.043
[AGENT D]
I gotta get his autograph.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.545
The agency really comes
through for ya, huh?

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:38.299
Give 'em the rundown, won't ya?
Leave everything else to me!

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:40.051
[sighs]

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.303
If that's how it is.

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:45.431
[TWILIGHT]
Evening.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:49.394
I appreciate you all coming
tonight. Anya does, too.

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.105
[AGENT E]
Morse code.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:55.149
[AGENT F]
"I need you to listen quietly."

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.859
[AGENT D]
Whatever you say, Twilight!

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.319
We'll be doing a bit
of roleplaying,

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.488
with you posing as enemies
of a spy on a mission

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.031
to save a beautiful princess.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.534
[AGENT E] This makes
absolutely no sense to me.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:06.119
[AGENT F]
A rather strange request,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.413
but I trust Twilight
has a plan in mind.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.540
Once again,
thank you every much.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.042
My daughter's going to love it.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:15.878
[FRANKY]
Now!

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.381
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet the cast!

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.384
Starting with our big star!

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:24.470
Princess Anya!

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.932
This is the spy man
who's gonna save me!

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:28.975
Loidman!

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:32.645
And the big boss of the baddies,
Count Scruffy-head!

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:35.857
And Mama! She's, uh, whatever.

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.066
Huh?!

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:39.986
And now, Count Scruffy-head
demands action

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.155
from my loyal minions!

00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:45.450
By all means, get out there
and sell this performance.

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:48.202
So don't be afraid to really
go after Loidman, okay?

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:49.495
Uh, wait--

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.664
[AGENT D] I've never even heard
of a mission over double S.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.750
It's gonna be super important
to get this right.

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.461
And we're up against
Twilight, of all people!

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.755
[AGENT E] I've been waiting
for something like this.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:13:59.547
[FRANKY]
In fact!

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.758
How you try to jam him up
will be your choice?

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.259
Just give it your all!

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:06.262
The success of this operation,
and the future of our world,

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.931
is in your capable hands!

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.224
[TWILIGHT]
Where is he going with this?

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:13.519
My loyal minions!
Protect Anya at all costs!

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.397
And make Loidman suffer
as much as possible!

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:19.776
Hope you guys are ready.
It's time to go!

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:21.194
[AGENTS]
Roger!

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.201
[FRANKY laughs]

00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:30.661
Now, Princess Anya's mine.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.164
If you want her back,
you'd better get it in gear!

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:34.791
[ANYA]
Please save me, Loidman.

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:37.001
Wait, we're going already?

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.420
Oh.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.178
[ANYA]
Hey!

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.304
[FRANKY]
All right, Loidman.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:49.639
If you want to save
the princess,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.059
you must make your way through
my many fiendish obstacles!

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.478
First up, we have a quiz
in the courtyard

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.730
that was devised
by Anya herself!

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.524
So pay attention,
and if you fail,

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.609
you'll be putting that on!

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:02.860
Huh? That's--

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.571
Yes! Your very own
Bondman costume!

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.990
[ANYA]
So cool!

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:09.867
[FRANKY]
Question one:

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.495
What does Princess Anya
like about Bondman?

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:13.746
[TWILIGHT]
Uhh... His face?

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:15.248
Bzzt!

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:18.084
I like that he has a
pistol with a silencer!

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.127
[TWILIGHT]
Really?

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.586
How sad.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.754
Can't believe her own Papa

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.549
doesn't even know
that about her.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.425
Next one!

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:28.010
[FRANKY] What's Anya's favorite
food in the whole world?

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:28.719
[TWILIGHT]
Peanuts!

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.639
Ooh! He got it!

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:33.850
Way too easy.

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:34.809
Final question!

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:38.271
Get it wrong and that mask is
going on your face, Loidman!

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.523
[TWILIGHT]
Then I'd better get it right!

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.026
This one's a doozy.

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:46.863
What does Anya want more
than anything right now?

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:48.489
[TWILIGHT]
What does she want right now?

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.616
[FRANKY]
Five! Four!

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.702
[TWILIGHT] You didn't say
there'd be a time limit!

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:55.538
I'm sayin' it now!

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.664
[TWILIGHT]
Focus.

00:15:56.706 --> 00:16:00.543
What does Anya want right now?
What does she want?

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.712
She wants Bondman's spy gear!

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:05.047
Well, Anya, is he right?

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:07.341
What I want now...

00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:10.928
I want some water
'cause I'm thirsty!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.097
You got it wrong!

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.391
[TWILIGHT]
How could I know?!

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.477
[FRANKY]
Them's the breaks!

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:21.063
Time to make good on
your part of the deal.

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:24.150
[ANYA]
This is gonna be so cool.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:28.112
I'm gonna get to see
the real Loidman, yay!

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.793
Ah! It's Loidman!

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.962
Alrighty! On to the next stage!

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.380
[TWILIGHT]
Hold on!

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.569
[ANYA]
Loidman, help!

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.196
[FRANKY] You wanna save
the princess, right?

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.448
Well, then get up here!

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.618
[FRANKY laughing]

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.497
Oh, wow!

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:46.315
Look at him go.

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:49.110
[ANYA]
Yay, Loidman. So cool!

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.571
Oh, I am just getting started.

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:54.156
[ANYA]
Oh, no. Save me, please.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.284
[TWILIGHT]
What a pain.

00:17:56.325 --> 00:18:00.288
[ANYA]
Loidman! Up here, up here!

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.540
You see me?

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:15.094
They just keep coming.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.031
[ANYA]
Ah! Amazing!

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:37.950
Come on, minions! Stop him!

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.578
Let them hit you a little, Loid!

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:45.207
[FRANKY grunts]

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.880
Now, I'm real angry!
You won't get me that easily!

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:56.719
Uh?

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.137
[FRANKY]
Buh-bye!

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.973
[ANYA]
Save me, Loidman.

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:14.737
Loidman, you're so cool!

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:27.750
[FRANKY laughs]

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.461
I'm impressed you got
this far, Loidman!

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.714
But you won't have the princess!

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:37.218
[ANYA]
Loidman! Please, save me!

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.099
[TWILIGHT] They're really
going to make me act out

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.102
this silly little play in front
of all of these agents?

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:50.731
I have no choice.
The mission depends on it.

00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:53.234
[TWILIGHT] Um. Hand over
the princess, fiend.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:53.943
[AGENTS]
Ooh!

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:55.319
[AGENT D]
I can't believe we get to see

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.071
Twilight's acting
skills for real!

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:59.573
[FRANKY laughs]

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:02.243
You fool! I said this
wouldn't be easy!

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:03.494
[ANYA gasps]

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.704
[FRANKY]
Meet your doom!

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:07.415
Behold Yorticia!
The powerful witch.

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:09.959
Who will literally take
your breath away!

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.421
[TWILIGHT] A witch?
This plot needs some focus.

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:22.179
[TWILIGHT]
Wait, what's going on here?

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:26.434
[YOR] Those who'd dare to hurt
Anya will pay the price.

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.061
It'll cost you your life!

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.021
[TWILIGHT]
Yor! Calm down.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.150
[TWILIGHT] Are witches
supposed to be this good

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.277
at hand-to-hand combat?

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:43.534
[TWILIGHT]
She might actually kill me!

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:48.706
[TWILIGHT grunts]

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:53.002
Uh, Yor, you okay?

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:01.093
[FRANKY laughing]

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:03.929
Nicely done getting
this far, Loidman!

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.766
But it'll take more to beat me!

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:11.896
[ANYA]
So cool!

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:16.150
Um. Here to save you,
Princess Anya.

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:19.653
[ANYA]
Papa!

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:22.156
Wait, are we done
pretending now?

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:26.118
[AGENTS crying]

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:37.296
[ANYA]
So sparkly!

00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.548
[AGENTS cheering, clapping]

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.510
Well done. Anya!

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:49.058
Yay, Anya...
I'm so proud of you...

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:54.021
[TWILIGHT]
What is this?

00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:55.606
[ANYA]
Since I left the orphanage,

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.691
life has been so exciting.

00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:58.609
Thank you, Papa!

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:01.946
[TWILIGHT]
Well, I'm happy for you.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:05.366
I promise, I'll do
my best at school!

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:09.495
I know.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:14.917
Anyway, congrats.
You got into Eden.

00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:25.511
[groans]

00:22:28.222 --> 00:22:30.891
Agent Twilight's expense report.

00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:34.645
[CHIEF]
Are these numbers real?

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.021
Yes, sir, they are.

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.898
--[CHIEF] But--
--They're real!

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.125
[inaudible]
