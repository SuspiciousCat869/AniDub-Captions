WEBVTT

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:16.141
[NARRATOR] Berlint, the
bustling capitol of Ostania.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.477
This woman is a contact
for the rival country

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.272
Westalis's intelligence
agency, WISE.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.950
[sighs]

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.291
[NARRATOR] Currently,
this man is Loid Forger,

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.628
otherwise known by his
code name, Twilight.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.172
Occupation, spy.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.674
Although he is
presently in the middle

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.467
of a very important mission,

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.012
it seems he's been given
another on top of that.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.069
[CONTACT A] How long has
my life been like this?

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.738
Every day is the same
as the one before,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.825
hoping that peace
is on the horizon.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.078
And if ever comes,
people like me...

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.248
...well, we won't
be needed anymore.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.276
[TWILIGHT]
Mission complete.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.491
[CONTACT B] Good day, or
perhaps, good evening, Twilight.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:23.161
We appreciate you completing
that mission so swiftly.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.498
How's Operation Strix
moving along?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.418
[NARRATOR] He's referring to
Twilight's top-priority mission,

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.587
the stakes of which is peace
between East and West.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.214
The goal...

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.634
Very smoothly.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.429
A wife and child have
both been acquired.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.432
[NARRATOR] ...to bring the enemy
country's plans for war to light

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.393
by establishing a family in
Ostania, which will allow him

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:50.021
to infiltrate its premier,
elite academy.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.356
Excellent.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.900
Blending in is of the
utmost importance.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.445
Keep up the facade
as a normal family.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.405
Copy that.

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.741
Did you quit smoking?

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.660
I'm a father now.

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.620
[NARRATOR] Under these
unique circumstances,

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.665
the Forger family came to be.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.044
Your father said that he'd
be running late tonight,

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.547
so would you like to
go out to eat with me?

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:16.465
[ANYA]
Yep.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.759
[YOR]
It must be hard being a doctor.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.304
Seems like they stay
busy around the clock.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.307
[ANYA] Papa's not really
a feelings doctor.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.058
[NARRATOR] His daughter,
Anya, whom he adopted

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.978
at a somewhat
questionable orphanage...

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.439
[ANYA]
Papa's actually a cool spy.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.317
He's out taking down
a bad guy today.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.904
[NARRATOR] ...has the power
to read people's minds.

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:41.948
[ANYA]
I bring you my dish!

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.993
Thank you so much,
Anya. Good girl.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.038
[YOR] Hmm. It's like
they'll never be clean.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.791
[NARRATOR] His wife, Yor,
agreed to the arrangement

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.043
due to a common interest.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.796
[YOR] I can still smell the
blood from yesterday's kill.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.465
[NARRATOR] She's a
hard-boiled contract killer.

00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:01.510
A spy, a telepath,
and an assassin.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.970
The trio created this
fictitious family bond

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:06.807
while keeping their true selves
hidden from one another.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.683
All the while
maintaining the facade

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:12.354
of a so-called "normal" family.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.648
[TWILIGHT] Even though I'm
busy with Operation Strix,

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.068
I get these random extra
missions every day now.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:21.822
This personnel shortage must
be worse than I thought.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.573
Home life with
the pretend family

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.534
is another part of the job.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:30.539
Such is the life of an agent.
No time for the soul to rest.

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:33.834
[NEIGHBOR A]
I'm not getting a good feeling

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.962
about that husband
from across the hall.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.213
Even though it's the weekend,

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:41.299
he's out, quote unquote,
"working late," again.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.260
[TWILIGHT]
A group of neighbors.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.928
And that poor,
sweet little girl.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.888
She must be starving
for attention.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.808
I can hardly think of a time
I've seen them all together.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.269
He must be leading some
secret, double life.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.436
Cheating on her!

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.397
[NEIGHBOR A]
Either that, or he got fired

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.482
and he can't bring
himself to go home.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.693
[TWILIGHT]
Ugh. I've been careless.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.445
All these extra missions have
caused me to neglect my role

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.990
as a loving husband
and father.

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:09.703
[TWILIGHT] Even the slightest
suspicion or mistrust

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.705
from those around us
in a deception operation

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:12.998
can be fatal.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.626
I must do everything
I can to fix this!

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:20.130
A threat to our family
is a threat to the world!

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:23.091
This next weekend... family day!

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.678
[TWILIGHT] We'll have
a great time together!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.264
So where are we going?

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:32.142
Anya. Is that a penguin
you're drawing?

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:35.353
I know, we should go
to the aquarium.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.273
Um, Loid, it's pretty
obvious you're exhausted.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.025
Maybe you should get some rest?

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.862
I know, but for the sake of our
pretend marriage's future,

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:47.282
we must do all that we can
to seem like a normal family.

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:48.992
And that means going out

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.452
and having a great
time this weekend!

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.412
Sounds cool!

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.080
[TWILIGHT] Though I'll have
to get all my other missions

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.499
squared away before then.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.881
[groaning]

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.132
[YOR]
Uh...

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.844
[TWILIGHT]
Heh. Okay, let's go.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.304
[YOR]
Really, Loid.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.765
You might need rest
more than family time.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.558
[TWILIGHT]
I'm all right.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.393
[NEIGHBOR D]
If it isn't the Forgers.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.313
Been a while since I've
seen you all in one place.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:19.356
[TWILIGHT chuckles]

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:22.400
Seems like a great day to go
enjoy the aquarium together.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.944
I know Anya's excited!

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.904
[NEIGHBOR D]
Oh?

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:27.614
[TWILIGHT] We need to
demonstrate to our neighbors

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:29.574
what a happy family we are.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.117
Wouldn't want them
to find out the truth

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:34.204
that the whole thing's a sham.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.581
Papa's taking us
on a family oooting.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.208
He's very kind to me and Mama,

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.418
and they are both
good, honest people.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.506
Our family is completely
normal in every way.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.341
[TWILIGHT]
Sounded suspicious to me,

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.803
but probably good
enough for a civilian.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.889
[TWILIGHT] Ladies, it was
very good seeing you today.

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:56.518
[ANYA] Let's go, Papa!
You're so nice and normal!

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.981
[ANYA]
Ba-donk ka-chonk!

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:08.279
[TWILIGHT] Uh? No, not again.
This can't be a good thing.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.115
I'll go grab us some drinks.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.449
[YOR]
Thanks!

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:17.497
[CONTACT A]
Agent Twilight,

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.291
we've got another additional
mission for you today, so--

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.710
[TWILIGHT]
Can't.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.006
Came directly from WISE HQ--

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.173
[TWILIGHT]
I can't.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.093
Operation Strix needs
my full attention today.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.761
[ANYA]
Papa!

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:32.554
We need to hurry,

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.140
or the aquarium will
go out of business!

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.350
[TWILIGHT] They just remodeled
the place, so don't worry.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.102
Wait, please.

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.562
You see what I'm dealing with.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.564
Now, I'll take a
coffee, a juice--

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:47.068
Wait! Aquarium, huh?
That's perfect, Agent Twilight.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.070
This mission just so
happens to take place

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.031
at the Berlint Aquarium.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.616
Your preparedness is
astonishing, as usual.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:54.617
[TWILIGHT]
You're mistaken.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.537
I didn't know. I just want
that coffee and juice.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.623
There's gonna be some important
intel traded at the aquarium.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.375
[TWILIGHT]
My coffee and juice, please.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.918
[CONTACT A]
Listen carefully, Twilight.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.546
This intel contains instructions
from an enemy country

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:08.548
for making a new
chemical weapon.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.633
If the terrorists get
their hands on this,

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:13.428
there's no telling just how
many of our fellow countrymen

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.764
will die as a result!

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.731
All the fishies! Yay!

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:28.401
An octopus! Starfish.
Li'l bitty shark!

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.235
[YOR chuckles]

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.571
[YOR]
Well, she's having fun.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:35.742
Uh, Loid. You're
so pale. You okay?

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:40.080
[TWILIGHT] Ugh, just couldn't
say no to that extra mission.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.706
But at least the neighbors
saw us on our way

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.125
to have a nice time
together earlier.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.128
All I have to do is make it
through everything today, and--

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.506
[NEIGHBOR A] Oh, my,
if it isn't the Forgers

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.840
from across the hall.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.592
How do you do?

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:53.510
[YOR]
Hello there!

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.762
[TWILIGHT]
No! Of all the--

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.806
[NEIGHBOR A]
We've just arrived here as well!

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.474
[TWILIGHT]
Definitely can't relax now.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:00.642
Focus, Twilight,

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:02.227
all we have to do is
shoo them off, and--

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.270
You're free to join us
if you'd like some company!

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:05.980
[TWILIGHT]
Yor!

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.524
How sweet of you!

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.234
[ANYA]
Papa is funny.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.277
[YOR] Maintaining a good
relationship with our neighbors

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:14.739
will help us seem like
a normal family.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:15.865
[TWILIGHT]
Okay, fine.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.575
I'll knock out this
side mission ASAP,

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.911
and then it's back
to family fun mode.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.746
[CONTACT A]
According to our sources,

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:25.667
the weapon schematics are on
microfilm smuggled in a capsule,

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.128
which was, in turn,
swallowed by a penguin.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.963
[TWILIGHT]
It's inside a penguin?

00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:31.798
[CONTACT A]
It arrived sometime yesterday,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.134
but the recipient hasn't
appeared to collect it.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.678
You must retrieve the goods
before the enemy does,

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.264
no matter what!

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.849
[TWILIGHT] Let's check out
the penguin exhibit.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.641
It's very popular.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.226
--[NEIGHBOR A] Sounds lovely.
--[NEIGHBOR B] Okay.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.729
[ANYA]
I like penguins! Let's see 'em!

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.441
[ANNOUNCER A]
Welcome one and all

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.319
to the world's largest
penguin park!

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.947
P-P-P-Penguins!

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.448
[ANNOUNCER A]
People come from far and wide

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.368
to see our playful
penguins in action...

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.786
[TWILIGHT] So exactly
which one of these guys

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.288
is my target today?

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.789
There's no time
to personally check

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.083
every penguin in the colony.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.793
Perhaps my approach
should be more focused

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.838
on keeping the terrorist
away from the birds.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.965
Actually, since I don't know

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.758
when their agent
is going to show up,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.344
that'll be difficult as well.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.054
But it is going to be
quite a challenge

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:23.850
to track all these
creatures by myself.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.603
What to do... Look
carefully, Twilight.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.563
Surely they marked
the penguin somehow

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.690
to tell it apart
from the others.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:31.983
[ANYA]
Papa's flustrated.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.234
[YOR chuckles]

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:34.402
[YOR]
Loid's engrossed.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.864
I guess even he lets out
his inner child sometimes.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.161
[VOICE D] Man, that fish
looks pretty tasty.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.662
[VOICE A] Where did
the dang kid run off to?

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.373
[VOICE C] I hope my girlfriend
lightens up after this.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:50.210
[VOICE B] I could stand
to live like those guys.

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:53.838
[PENGUIN VOICE A]
Fish.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.674
[ANYA] Reading penguin
minds is super hard.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.468
[PENGUIN VOICE D]
Lots of fish!

00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:59.969
[PENGUIN VOICE E]
Come over here.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.012
[PARLES chokes]

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.972
[gasps]

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:07.435
Papa, look at that penguin.
Can he breathe?

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:08.895
[TWILIGHT]
It's drinking a lot of water,

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.730
but spits it all back out.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.816
Almost as if something's
stuck in its throat.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.569
This bears further
investigation.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:20.073
Hey, uh, I'm gonna
grab us more drinks!

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.282
[YOR]
Poor Loid.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.619
His exhaustion must be what's
making him so thirsty today.

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.706
[CHIEF A] I thought we were
supposed to have a new guy

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.041
starting this afternoon!

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.626
Is he late for his first shift?

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.419
[TWILIGHT] I'm here,
boss! Sorry I'm late!

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:37.715
Ugh. This generation
doesn't wanna work.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.468
Lemme show you how to feed
the penguins, all right?

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.178
[TWILIGHT]
Yes, sir!

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.304
[TWILIGHT]
I figured the quickest way

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.556
to get close to the target
without making a scene

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.768
was to disguise myself
as one of the keepers.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.148
[CHIEF A] Now, it's
important for you newbies

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.026
to learn to put a name to
a face with these penguins.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.696
I hope you've tried
to memorize the roster!

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:00.613
[TWILIGHT]
Yes, sir.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:02.824
I did glance through it back
in the staff room a bit ago.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.285
[CHIEF A]
Seriously? You glanced at it!

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.620
I studied that thing all
the time and it still--

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:08.913
Hey, boss?

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.749
Watch that you don't
step on poor Petilda!

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.376
[CHIEF A]
Hmm...

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.755
[CHIEF A] Yup, that's
definitely Petilda all right.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:22.468
This little guy here is Pemas
and this one's Pescar.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.847
How can you tell them apart?

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:28.391
Well, all of their patterns
are completely different.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.852
Their faces are, too.

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:32.061
[CHIEF A]
I still have a little trouble

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.855
telling them apart
from one another.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:37.025
This guy sounds like he's
known them all his life.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.861
All right then, newbie,
let's get these guys fed.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.321
This way.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:47.910
[TWILIGHT] So the one I spotted
coughing earlier is...

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.788
There, Parles,
the emperor penguin.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.624
I need to get over to him.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.085
Uh! That might be a problem!

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.920
Now, they're all
a little different.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:01.674
Gluttons, picky eaters--pay
attention to their unique needs.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.134
[TWILIGHT]
I don't have time for this.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.803
I need to get back before
the neighbors get suspicious.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.639
Hey, boss! Allow me
to do the honors!

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.641
Huh?

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:11.601
[TWILIGHT]
I learned a few things

00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.686
by watching veteran keepers.

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:17.023
It's all about understanding
what kind of fish each one eats,

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.358
the quantity involved,

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:21.944
as well as their individual
place in the colony's hierarchy.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:24.947
Once I factor in all
those variables...

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.994
[BOTH gasping]

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.916
[TWILIGHT] ...controlling the
masses is mere child's play.

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:38.461
I've never seen a newbie
take to it like this before!

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:44.592
Uh-oh. Apparently Parles
isn't very hungry today.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:48.679
I think he's feeling sick. I'll
just take him to the clinic.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.972
Excuse me.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:51.933
[CHIEF A]
Uh, yeah.

00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.770
[TWILIGHT]
Sorry, buddy.

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:58.606
Oh.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:14:59.732
[TWILIGHT]
Bingo.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.193
Definitely something
stuffed down there.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.444
Upon closer observation,

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.947
it seems there's a mark on
the bottom of his foot, too.

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:09.367
[TWILIGHT] Hold on, little guy.
I'll fish this out real quickly.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:14.205
Hey, you! There a problem?
What are you doing with that?

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:18.418
[TWILIGHT] Taking him to
the clinic. He's sick.

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:21.838
Ah, well, hand him over
and I can take him.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:22.922
[TWILIGHT]
I'm sorry, sir.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:26.259
But the rules say only qualified
staff can handle the penguins.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.136
Apologies.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.055
I should've said,
I'm a professor

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:34.600
from Berlint University's
marine biology research lab.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:35.518
And as part of my job,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.354
I'm in charge of the
marine animals here.

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.275
Uh?

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:48.531
[TWILIGHT]
This ID is fake.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:51.451
Not to mention
extremely poorly made.

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:52.410
[gasps]

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.287
Who do you work for, you--?

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.207
[TWILIGHT]
No, you don't!

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.584
Quit squirming will you?

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.210
[CHIEF A]
Hey, newbie!

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.671
What in the heck are you
doin' with that penguin?

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.840
The clinic's that way!

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.926
[TWILIGHT] I don't know if
there are other enemies here,

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:11.762
so I can't let this
penguin out of my sight.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:14.765
The primary goal of the mission
is to retrieve this film.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.768
Which means I can't
give chase right now.

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:24.567
Oh, no. Where did
Anya run off to?

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:27.987
[MAN A]
I'll get to the others outside

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:31.574
and tell them to kill that guy,
then we can grab the film!

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:35.453
[MAN A]
What's with you?!

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.872
[ANYA]
Mama! Help! I'm being kidnapped!

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.332
Anya!

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:42.418
[MAN A] Let go of me!
The hell are you--?

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.087
[YOR]
Hands off, creep!

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:48.633
Don't touch my daughter!

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:49.342
[ANYA]
Wow.

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.761
Are you okay, Anya?

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:54.722
[YOR] Whoops. I think I may
have overdone it a tad.

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:57.433
Hope I didn't kill him.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.434
[TWILIGHT]
Wow.

00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.602
[NARRATOR]
With help from his family,

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.604
Twilight was able
to retrieve the film

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:06.567
and get info about the enemy
organization from the imposter.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.152
[NEIGHBOR A] I think
it's awfully suspicious

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.780
that your husband
hasn't come back yet.

00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:12.823
My intuition screams "cheater!"

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.116
Mine, too!

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:15.243
[gasps]

00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:16.827
There's no way he would--

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.163
[TWILIGHT]
Sorry. That took way too long.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.331
There you are!

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.457
[TWILIGHT]
Ta-da!

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:22.959
[ANYA]
Big ol' penguin!

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:26.462
Oh, that's a gigantic one, Loid!
Where did you get it?

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:27.463
I won it as a prize

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.550
in the penguin name
guessing game over there.

00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:32.301
It certainly took some trying,

00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:35.221
but I knew Anya'd love it,
so what could I do?

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.765
Finally got him, though!

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.642
[ANYA]
Papa is such a liar.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.978
He got it right
on the first try.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.229
[laughs]

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.898
[YOR] It's kind of adorable
how worked up he gets.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.358
I was wrong about you.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.028
You're an amazing father.
Color me impressed.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.781
Thanks, I try.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.117
Yeah, I've been flailing
around in fatherhood,

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:59.287
but I always do
the best I can...

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.789
...to protect my family.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:06.294
I don't think I ever noticed
how handsome you are.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:10.631
[TWILIGHT] I suppose I achieved
my goal with today's outing,

00:18:10.673 --> 00:18:11.882
but I'm putting my foot down

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:15.803
about all these
excessive missions.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:18.055
Time to file an official
complaint with HQ

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.016
and request a few weeks off.

00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:22.810
[ANYA laughing]

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:26.063
[TWILIGHT] No, I have a
duty to maintain peace.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.441
To create a world where
children can laugh

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:31.527
and war is just part
of the history books.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.070
I can't shirk away from that.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:36.198
[ANYA] Papa! The dolphin
show is gonna start!

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.368
[TWILIGHT] I know, Anya.
I'm moving as fast as I can!

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:47.084
Huh?! I'm in charge
now? But why?

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:50.963
You're too good. I have
nothing more to teach you.

00:18:57.428 --> 00:18:59.096
[ANYA]
My name is Director Chimera.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.350
I'm the boss of the
secret organization P2.

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:06.062
You must be the newbie
recruit, is that right?

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:07.063
[ANYA]
My name is Penguin,

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.732
and I come from the
aquarium, please.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.984
It really is a pleasure
to meet you.

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:15.780
Yes, now, Agent Anya, you
should know what happens next.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:17.490
Yep!

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.124
[ANYA] As part of you
joining our organization,

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.293
we'll split a peanut
and eat it together.

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:33.422
After that, you will officially
be a member of P2!

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:41.806
[ANYA] Now, you have a new
name, Agent Penguinman.

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.433
Do your best for world peace.

00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:46.602
Sir!

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:47.853
Okay, Agent Anya,

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.147
I want you to show our new
recruit around the hideout,

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.149
let 'em know how we do things.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.984
Okey-dokey!

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.410
This is the hideout's
central command room.

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:06.872
And we use this machine to
gather some new intel every day.

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:08.457
This is Agent Papa.

00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:11.210
He is a super-elite
that can do anything.

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.630
[TWILIGHT] So she's
pretending to be a spy?

00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:16.090
[ANYA]
That's Agent Mama.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:19.051
She's strong, but not
very good at most things.

00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:21.303
I'm not that bad, am I?

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:24.807
Both of them are Agent Anya's
most trusted lackeys.

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.059
Now let's move on.

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:31.355
Adorable.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:34.191
Seems she's really taken
a liking to her new plushie.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.651
[TWILIGHT]
Hm.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.198
[ANYA]
This is the potty!

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.994
It's where you go to heal
and stuff after a big battle.

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:50.082
[ANYA]
This is Agent Anya's room.

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:53.919
Lots of training for missions
goes on every day in here!

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:02.762
And now...

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:05.389
...I'm gonna show you the
most top-secret-est spots

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:09.518
in the hideout:
Papa's room and Mama's room!

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.312
Be very careful.

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:14.690
These rooms have some deadly
secrets hidden inside them.

00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:16.400
[ANYA] We might find
the ultimate knife,

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.236
or even some kind of crazy bomb!

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.452
[ANYA]
Okay.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.330
[TWILIGHT]
Hey! What are you doing?

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:32.333
How many times have I told
you not to go in there?

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:33.793
[ANYA wailing]

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:35.628
[TWILIGHT]
Uh. Uh, don't cry.

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.338
There's just scissors
and heaters and stuff

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:38.255
that could hurt you.

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.131
[TWILIGHT]
And those are probably

00:21:39.173 --> 00:21:40.883
the least dangerous
things in there.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.177
And the same goes
for mine, too.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:45.387
[YOR] Wouldn't want her to
touch a poisoned needle.

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:51.602
I hate you, Papa and Mama!
I'm gonna run away from home!

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:52.561
[TWILIGHT]
This is bad.

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:55.022
Operation Strix is
in the danger zone!

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:57.858
I have to think of
a plan quickly.

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:03.489
[TWILIGHT]
Um, Agent Anya!

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.908
Don't forget, we're on a
mission to save the world.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.618
There's no time for tears!

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.287
I say we finish the
tour of the hideout

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.498
and get to our next assignment!

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.875
[YOR] Correct!
Crying does not compute.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:17.253
We gotta get the bad guys!

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.465
[ANYA] Okay! You two
are coming with me.

00:22:21.507 --> 00:22:24.301
The bad guys are at the candy
store on Second Street.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.136
Let's go teach 'em a lesson!

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.513
[YOR, TWILIGHT]
Huh?

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:31.308
Be careful.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.520
There could be some traps
and stuff from the enemy.

00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:36.605
[TWILIGHT]
Very good thinking, Agent Anya.

00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:39.650
What a cute little family.

00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:43.821
[TWILIGHT] Spies mustn't draw
attention to ourselves...

00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:45.614
[NARRATOR]
Anya's morale greatly improved

00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:48.784
after Agents Mama and Papa
bought her a snack.

00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:52.788
Thus, peace was restored
to the Forger household.
