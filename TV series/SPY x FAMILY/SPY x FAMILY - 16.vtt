WEBVTT

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.310
[TWILIGHT]
These past few nights,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:22.105
Yor's been coming
home rather late.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:25.234
We don't pry into each
other's personal lives,

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:29.363
so I'm not quite sure
what she's been up to.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.990
[BOND groans]

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.327
Papa, can we eat dinner now?

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.538
[TWILIGHT]
We will after Yor gets home.

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:43.210
Hey, Bond, use your power to
tell me what we're eating.

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:44.962
[door opens]

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.675
Sorry, I got a little held up.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:55.472
[TWILIGHT] A late arrival
with that grim expression.

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:58.392
And several cuts on her hands.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.185
Welcome home, Mama!

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:03.272
[YOR] Aw, thanks for
the warm reception, Anya.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:06.775
So glad you're here.
Should we start dinner?

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:10.279
[YOR] Um, I'm not particularly
hungry right now,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.781
but you two should
eat something.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.578
[TWILIGHT]
Oh. Okay.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.291
[TWILIGHT]
What's going on with her?

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.211
[ANYA gasps]

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.680
[ANYA]
Mama's gonna cry? But why?

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.277
[YOR]
If I fail this time...

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.948
[YOR] ...I might lose
those two forever.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.210
[WORKER B]
Good work today.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.920
[WORKER A]
Yeah, you, too.

00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:33.422
[CAMILLA]
See you later.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.258
[MILLIE] Hey, Camilla.
Wanna grab a drink?

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.969
Uh.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.804
Nah, not tonight.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.223
[SHARON] Wait, I thought you
had a hot date, Millie.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.851
[MILLIE]
He canceled at the last minute.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.317
[EMPLOYEE A]
Thank you!

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.442
Okay, we're doing this.

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:43.700
Wait a sec.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.077
Are those the tomatoes?!
They got crushed!

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.412
What is the matter with you?

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.663
[YOR screams]

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:49.498
[DOMINIC]
Back at it?

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.500
Guess you can't keep
a good woman down, huh?

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.709
Still trying, thanks.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.294
Oh, don't act all innocent!

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.713
She's here because
of your big mouth!

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.677
[CAMILLA] Oh, yeah?
You wanna learn how to cook?

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.054
Things are getting bad.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.931
I made my husband breakfast
the other morning

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.892
and he ended up stuck
in the bathroom all day!

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.061
Wow, that is bad.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.480
I'm scared this'll
cost me my family!

00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:15.273
[YOR]
And then I'd lose my cover!

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.775
If any of you would
be able to teach me,

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:20.195
I'd really appreciate it!

00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:24.241
Uh, sorry, the housekeeper
makes all our meals.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.867
Just take a class.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.703
If you wanna work a can
opener, I can teach ya!

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.540
[DOMINIC] Hey, ladies,
what are you talkin' about?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.627
Yeah? She's a whiz
in the kitchen!

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.295
Shut up!

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.173
Oh? Please help me out, Camilla!

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:43.134
What? No. Why would
I wanna do that?

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.637
Hey, don't be such a sourpuss.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.973
So the first lesson'll
be at her place.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:48.765
Shut up!

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.350
[DOMINIC chuckles]

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.439
Last time was rough,
but I'm ready.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.983
Teach me all your ways.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.609
This is a nightmare.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:00.986
Maybe it's your attitude.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.320
Listen up, buster!

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.240
You'll be the one tasting
all her crap, so zip it!

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.658
Oh, ya know,

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.952
I actually invited someone
over to help with that.

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:09.911
[doorbell rings]

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.913
[CAMILLA]
Hm?

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.958
What's up, Yor? I'm here!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.501
[YOR]
Yuri!

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.337
[YURI] I heard you'd be cooking
dinner here tonight.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.839
Well...

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.591
[CAMILLA]
That's her little brother, huh.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:26.094
He comes off kinda
different in person.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.804
Thanks for having
me over, Camilla!

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.599
I really appreciate
all you do for Yor.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.058
[CAMILLA]
Uh-huh.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.268
[YURI] Are you guys
havin' a little party

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.145
or somethin' like that?

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.065
Oh. It's a cooking class?

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.484
Please don't mention it
to Loid and Anya.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.945
I'm trying to get
better in secret.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.989
[YURI] She's doing all
this for stupid Loidy?!

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:48.366
Ugh. Do I even wanna help?

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.035
For tonight's menu,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.245
I thought we might try
making minestrone.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.330
[CAMILLA]
Seriously?

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.665
I told you not to get all
this stuff we don't need.

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.626
I mean, do you think
<i>that's</i> in the recipe?

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.419
[YOR] They say variety
is the spice of life,

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.339
so won't this make it better?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.340
[CAMILLA sighs]

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.301
Okay, let's start by
peeling the potatoes.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.386
Right!

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.680
[CAMILLA] How could anybody
be this bad at prep-work?

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.432
There's blood everywhere!

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.518
Ah! This weapon is almost
impossible to wield!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.145
It's not a weapon, you dope!

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.814
Hey, Sis, I brought
some bandages.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.150
I'm handy with a knife, though!

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:25.320
You don't have to cut
it paper-thin,

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.822
just do it like a
normal person, okay?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.783
Look at those knife skills!

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.329
[CAMILLA] What the--?
You're acting like a lunatic!

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.706
You sliced up my
favorite cutting board!

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.667
I'm so sorry! I'll buy you
another one, I swear!

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.419
[YURI]
Amazing as always!

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.922
[CAMILLA] Like, really, what is
the matter with you anyway?!

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.132
And why would anyone
marry you? Get outta here!

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.051
I'm sorry.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.720
[YURI] Who does she think she
is, treating Yor like that?

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.098
I should make her disappear.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.101
[CAMILLA] You know, I'm
afraid this is a lost cause.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.437
Might as well give up, divorce
that hunk, and move out.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.147
[YOR]
I can't do that.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.732
[YURI]
Yeah, that's a great idea.

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.152
You should definitely
leave him A-S-A-P.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:14.077
I'm begging you, Camilla!

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:18.206
Because if Loid divorces me,
then I'll... I'll be...

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.875
[YOR] ...picked up
by the Secret Police.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.343
Just get your ingredients
simmering already.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:33.138
Then I'll teach you how to
properly season everything.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.307
The sooner we get this meal
done, the sooner you can leave.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.560
See, there's a soft
side under there.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.438
Once you get past
the prickly bits.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.982
[YOR] Honestly, I always
thought she was pretty great.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.442
Hey!

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.239
[YOR]
Okay, here we go!

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.742
My first dish is ready!

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.036
You're up.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:59.122
Make sure it's not pois--I mean,
make sure it's delicious!

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.541
Yeah? Sounds good to me!

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.043
[YURI chuckles]

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:09.632
Down the hatch! Aah.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.343
Whoa!

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.430
This is amazing! It tastes
just like my childhood!

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.557
You've always been
such a great cook!

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:21.352
[CAMILLA] Uh. If it's good,
then why are you throwing up?

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.448
[YOR gasps]

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.744
[CAMILLA groaning]

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:40.121
How could you've screwed
it up this badly?

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.956
Did you even listen
to a word I said?

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.875
[YOR]
I don't know. I'm so sorry!

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:47.420
Hey, Sis. I'm ready for seconds!

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.964
Guess you weren't at
the minestrone level yet.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:53.051
Let's try an easier dish,
like meatballs or something.

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.178
Yeah, okay!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.431
[YURI]
This is incredible!

00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.766
It's so good, I'm turning blue

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.684
and breaking out
into a cold sweat.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.604
Like, every bite is making
my life flash before my eyes!

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.731
Wait, I think I see mom
calling me to come join her!

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.108
She must be hungry!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.693
[DOMINIC]
Stop before it's too late!

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:11.694
[CAMILLA]
Oh, yeah.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.446
She told me the two
of them lost their parents

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.281
when they were young.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.700
I suppose it makes sense that
your palate is such a mess

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.495
if you only had this walking
train wreck eating your food.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.288
Train wreck?

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.707
[YOR] I just wanted to make sure
he got all the right nutrients

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.501
that a growing boy needs.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:30.922
[DOMINIC] Wow. I'm so glad
you survived, buddy.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.006
[CAMILLA]
Here's an idea.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.008
Can you remember any
dish in particular

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.302
your mom made that
was really good?

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.346
We could try that.

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.392
Yuri, can you think
of something?

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.978
[YURI]
Something Mom made?

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:48.648
Huh. I kinda remember her
making some type of stew

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.191
that was really good, right?

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.442
Very warm and filling.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:55.029
[YOR] Yeah! And she'd always
put a fried egg on top!

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:58.074
'Kay, we should give
that a whirl.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:01.119
So see if you can
recall the flavor.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.622
It probably uses a simple
southern stew base.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.499
Whoa!

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.126
Once it comes to a boil,

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.670
turn off the heat and
throw in some paprika.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:11.629
Right!

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.464
Be careful not to burn it.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.842
And don't go overboard
with the salt and pepper.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.802
I'll do my best.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.770
[CAMILLA] You know, something
is different about you lately.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:29.898
I mean, like, you
don't have that blank,

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:33.318
robotic look on
your face so much.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:37.238
[YOR]
Uh... Oh, yeah?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.742
Well, maybe it's
because I'm married.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:41.576
[CAMILLA]
What?

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.494
So now you're trying
to brag about it?

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.372
Honestly, I think you just
changed your makeup.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.666
[YOR] Oh, I'm sorry! I wasn't
trying to be boastful!

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:49.959
Aw, come on.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.086
You know that you're
a total catch, babe.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:53.129
So don't feel bad.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.173
Hey!

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:58.092
I gotta say, this one
actually smells kinda good.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.262
I think you nailed it.
Nice work.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.318
Wow, it's not awful.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.153
[gasps]

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.698
It's really good!

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.952
But it feels like there
may be something missing.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.578
[CAMILLA]
Hmm...

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.831
So where is your family
from originally?

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:31.209
We're from Eastern
Nielsberg, mostly.

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.378
[CAMILLA]
Hmm.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:36.297
Seems like people in that
region might add sour cream,

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.133
so why don't we throw
a little bit in there.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.773
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:02.949
[CAMILLA sighs]

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.118
That was exhausting.

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.998
Now what?

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:13.376
Oh. Just admiring
the view, cutie.

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:14.919
[gasps]

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.839
[CAMILLA]
Shut up.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.010
[TWILIGHT]
Wait.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.221
Now.

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:29.309
[TWILIGHT] Naturally or not,
he's an intelligent creature.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.394
We'll start training him
to be a guard dog soon.

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.229
[stomach growls]

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:36.607
Papa, I think my tummy's
gonna eat itself.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.568
I'm so hungry.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:40.820
[TWILIGHT]
I'll bet.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:43.740
I'm so sorry.
I'm home late again.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.658
[TWILIGHT]
We're glad you're back.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.957
[TWILIGHT]
Hm? What've you got?

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.001
Well, about that...

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:01.049
Listen up, everyone!
Tonight, I'm making dinner!

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.384
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.095
[TWILIGHT] You've been
learning how to cook?

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.805
[YOR]
Sorry for hiding it from you.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.432
[TWILIGHT]
I see now.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.101
Uh. This is southern stew?

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:15.480
[YOR] Yeah. My mom used
to make it for us.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:20.860
[YOR]
Here ya go!

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:24.572
Slight issue frying
the egg, but voila!

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.699
I hope you like it!

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.621
[TWILIGHT]
Doesn't smell deadly.

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:34.499
[ANYA]
This is my last meal.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:40.546
--It's really good!
--It's yummy!

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:42.006
[gasps]

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.716
[ANYA]
I actually like it!

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.094
[TWILIGHT]
Yes, it's quite comforting.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.399
Uh. Yor, is there
something wrong?

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.733
[YOR]
I'm sorry.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:04.237
It's silly, but when
I saw your faces,

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:07.657
I just felt so relieved.

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.493
[YOR] I thought the only
reason to have this family

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:14.872
was so I could keep doing
my assassination jobs.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.834
I never dreamed that
having them around

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.169
and seeing their smiles,

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:25.174
that those simple things
would make me so happy.

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.888
I'm starting to feel a little
more confident now--

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.101
both as Loid Forger's
wife and Anya's mom!

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.979
It makes me so happy
to hear that.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.147
You know what?

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:43.526
I did make another dish
that you might enjoy!

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.987
But this one's a
Yor Forger original!

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.989
[ANYA]
Gimme! Gimme!

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:51.909
[YOR gasps]

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:11.429
[TWILIGHT] So what's this
meeting about? Something urgent?

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.018
I've fallen in love with a girl.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.271
[TWILIGHT]
Okay. Best of luck. See ya.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:23.649
Wait a sec!
Don't just walk away!

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.027
[TWILIGHT]
Why?

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:28.613
You looking for dating
tips or something?

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:32.783
[FRANKY] Come on, you're kind
of a pro with the ladies, right?

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.161
[TWILIGHT] It takes time
and effort. Goodbye.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:36.787
[FRANKY]
Don't be such a jerk, man!

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:40.541
I could always sell your info
to the Secret Police, ya know?

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.837
[FRANKY] I'm just messin'
with you, really!

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.047
Hey, I 've got an idea!

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.256
You said you wanted
me to make you

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.050
a new miniature recording
device, didn't you?

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.928
You do me this li'l favor
and it'll be all yours!

00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:53.346
Deal?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.767
[FRANKY]
Her name's Monica McBride.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:01.312
She works at a cigar club
over on Fifth Street.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.649
She's 25 years old, and her
birthday is on September 20,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.526
blood type is O.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:10.613
She's 162 centimeters tall,
and weighs 46 kilograms.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.741
Currently living with her
mother and younger sister.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.159
She's a bit of a film buff

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:18.079
and her favorite movie
is <i>Ber-Ber-Berlint</i>.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.123
Nickname's Moppea and--

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.959
You're a stalker.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.043
Hey, now!

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.837
Don't try to pretend you're not
a fan of thorough research!

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.256
But I do it for work.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.298
You idiot!

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.800
When a man falls madly in love,

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:32.718
we make it our mission
to know every last detail

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.846
about what makes our
soul mate who they are!

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.057
Well, if you've been able to
learn this much about her,

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:40.685
surely you can figure
the rest without issue.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.228
[FRANKY]
Don't be like that, man!

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.355
You intelligence people have
whole separate departments

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.607
for gathering, assessing,
and analyzing data!

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.818
My expertise runs out
after gathering!

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:51.195
[TWILIGHT] That some
kind of weird brag?

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.030
Come on, I'm serious!

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.408
I've been sucking on these
disgusting cigars every day

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:57.868
just so I get the
chance to see her!

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.954
I'm a scruffy boy
who needs guidance!

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:03.082
So please help me!

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.042
[TWILIGHT sighs]

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.961
Guess I could analyze
your potential date

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.671
and help you come
up with a plan.

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:11.674
Thank you so much,
Master Twilight, sir!

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.217
You're the best!

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.928
[TWILIGHT]
Just shut up and let me think.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:22.518
[TWILIGHT]
Okay, here you go.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.729
Based on the information
you've given me,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.232
I came up with a conversational
flowchart for you.

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.191
Really?

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.402
[TWILIGHT] Starting here,
of course, with question one.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.363
Asking about her favorite food
will lead down a certain path.

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:34.947
[FRANKY]
Hmm.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.158
[TWILIGHT] The path should have
her most likely responses,

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.909
ranked from A to D.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:39.869
[FRANKY]
Mm-hmm.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.203
[TWILIGHT]
Then I added the best response

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:42.747
you can give to each choice,

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.999
and here you can see her
most probable responses,

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.418
listed as A though D again,
and then we have

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.629
what your corresponding
response should be.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.379
[FRANKY grunts]

00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:52.548
[TWILIGHT] All you have to do
is memorize this chart,

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.634
go with the flow,
choose the best answers,

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.218
and the whole thing should be--

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.388
Oh, is that all?
You're kidding, I can't do that!

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.599
Besides memorizing tens
of thousands of answers,

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.143
how the hell am I supposed to
pick the "best" ones anyway?

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:05.853
I need a foolproof plan!

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:09.899
[TWILIGHT] If that existed,
I wouldn't have a job.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.153
Uh... I could disguise myself
and feed you instructions.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.989
[FRANKY] And let you snoop
on our conversation?

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:19.492
Well then, you're just
going to have to practice

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:20.826
with me instead.

00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:22.578
[FRANKY]
Really? I don't know.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.914
I mean, you're so not my type.

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:27.249
I'm kidding! Please help me!

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.505
[inaudible]

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.522
'Kay! I think I might
have a real shot at this.

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:50.856
I'm going in tomorrow,

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:53.025
armed with the tools of
strategic conversation

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.695
and my sight set
on Monica's heart!

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:58.406
Hope you won't be the
only one I'm debriefing.

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:01.033
I do not need that mental image.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:04.829
[TWILIGHT] He already reeks
with the stench of failure.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.753
Welcome in, sir.

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:17.383
Franky, fancy seeing
you here again today.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.928
Uh. Oh, I, uh, look
forward to, uh--

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.764
Look at, uh... Forwarding.

♪ Going on an ooting today! ♪

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:32.106
Let's go to the playground
with the bobstacle course!

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.400
That does sound like fun.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.486
[TWILIGHT]
Hm?

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:39.196
Uh! Scruffy-head!

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:42.366
[FRANKY]
Huh? It's the Forgers.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.204
[ANYA] I'm gonna do
a bobstacle course!

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.999
Yeah? That sounds like fun.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.625
[TWILIGHT]
I thought you were...

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.128
Oh, the whole date thing, huh?

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.756
Well, I asked her out in
the most charming way,

00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:57.757
but she had to run home

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.509
because she forgot
to turn off her gas.

00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:03.053
She said she'd go to a movie
with me someday, though.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.388
I'd call that a win.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:05.973
And since I've got
all this free time,

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.267
I guess I'll grab a drink.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.897
Don't console me!

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:18.778
[FRANKY] I can't believe it!
Am I really that hideous?

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:20.571
She could've at least
gone on one date with me!

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.032
She didn't have to
shoot me down like that!

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.117
Pardon, sir.

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:27.369
The hell do you want?
Huh? You got a problem?

00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:30.831
Just pour me another beer!
The cheapest one you've got!

00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:31.957
And to top it all off,

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.710
now I gotta make Twilight
that stupid thing for free.

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:37.963
I've got no girl and no money.

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:42.301
[BARKEEP A] Macallan 18 year,
on the rocks, sir.

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:45.513
[FRANKY] Huh? Does this look
like a cheap beer to you?

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.348
I'm flat broke, gramps!

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:49.600
It's courtesy of the
gentleman over there.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:50.976
Huh?

00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:56.232
Oh, hey, what do ya know?

00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:59.652
I felt like having a
little drink myself.

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:02.363
Twi-- Uh, Loid.

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.911
[FRANKY] So what happened
with the obstacle course?

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.997
[TWILIGHT] Yor and Anya are
having mother daughter time.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:16.168
[FRANKY] I get it. You just
came to laugh at me, right?

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.880
Have you forgotten
about your own advice?

00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:21.757
Keep your emotions out of it,

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:25.427
and be careful not
to get too attached.

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.096
Even if you did go out with her,

00:22:27.137 --> 00:22:30.474
there probably won't
be a happy ending.

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:34.270
[FRANKY] Tch. That's rich from
a guy with a wife and kid.

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:36.397
[TWILIGHT]
They're part of my mission.

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:37.398
[FRANKY]
Damn it!

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:39.942
Well, my mission's to
get drunk on your dime!

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:43.112
[TWILIGHT]
Heh. I'll join you.

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:21.877
