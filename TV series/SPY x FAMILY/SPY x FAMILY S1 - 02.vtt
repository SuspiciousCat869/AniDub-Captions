WEBVTT

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:45.689
[sighs]

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.523
[TWILIGHT]
This won't do.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:47.899
What?!

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.610
I don't want this Mama.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.654
Not seeing you convincingly
pull off the mother role.

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:53.989
[FRANKY]
You're a master of disguise,

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.992
so why can't you make
me beautiful, huh?

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.828
I have rather limited options.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.831
Ugh! I can't believe
I volunteered for this!

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:04.416
[TWILIGHT]
Operation Strix.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.460
I was given this top-secret
mission by Wise

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.171
in order to stop political power
player Donovan Desmond

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:12.215
from fomenting a
war with Ostania.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.051
Part of the task was to
pass the prestigious

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.887
Eden College's entrance
exam, which we did,

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.305
but this interview
with both parents

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:21.808
of the prospective student
has complicated matters.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:27.522
Very well. I'll need
to find a woman.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.649
[CAMILLA]
Did you hear?

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.859
There was some kind
of office break-in.

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.819
Apparently, someone
came and snatched up

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.364
all the files with us
ladies' personal info.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.908
Scary, right? What kind
of creep does that?

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.577
I always thought the section
chief was way creepy.

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.205
Like, he's always ogling me.
Can't stand him.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.791
You ever considered
wearing some longer skirts?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:46.875
[MILLIE]
I don't think my boyfriend

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.461
would be happy about that.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:50.879
You're pretty fit, Sharon.

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.631
Why don't you show it
off a little more?

00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.758
I stopped caring
after I had a kid.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.884
And what about you?

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.053
You're awfully quiet
over there, Yor.

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:00.514
Doesn't it creep you out, too?

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.765
Huh?

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:04.476
[MILLIE] The section chief's
coffee? Blow snot in it!

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.436
Uh, do you think snot

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:09.773
would make it taste
better or something?

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.484
You know, I really gotta
give you credit, girl.

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.236
You're definitely one-of-a-kind.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.112
Uh.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.196
[MILLIE]
Isn't she though?

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:19.032
Not many guys out in space
or wherever you are, huh?

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.242
Cut it out, Millie.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.244
[CAMILLA] You're cute, with
curves in all the right places.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.871
If you knew how to flaunt it,
you'd be knocking 'em dead.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:25.664
Yeah?

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:27.666
[MILLIE] Yeah, if you need
makeup tips or anything,

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.334
just ask me.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.460
[YOR]
Honestly though,

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.338
all I really want is
just to keep this job.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.966
But aren't you, like,
27 years old already?

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.135
You need to be careful
at that age.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.052
From what I hear,

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:41.680
there are supposedly spies
everywhere these days.

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:42.973
People have been
getting reported

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.100
for the tiniest little
things, you know.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.518
I mean, just the other day,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.770
I heard about a bachelorette
in her late 20s

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.772
being arrested because
her neighbors thought

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.774
she was extremely suspicious.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.193
[MILLIE]
Oh, wow, really? That's funny.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.487
How do you always know
about this stuff, Camilla?

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.948
Being single at that
age is kinda unusual.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.533
A bit eyebrow raising.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.326
I didn't realize that.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.704
I appreciate you
letting me know.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.874
Oh, yeah. This coming weekend,

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.084
I'm throwing a little dinner
party at my place,

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.462
so why don't you
plan on dropping by?

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.089
Bring a date and
join in the fun.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.635
[SHARON] Might be asking
a bit much there.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:21.803
[CAMILLA]
She could ask whoever's been

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.097
rifling through our drawers;
they'd love to come.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.057
[MILLIE]
You are just too mean!

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.229
[phone ringing]

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.606
[YOR]
Briar residence.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.232
[YURI]
Hey, Sis. How are you?

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.276
[YOR]
Oh, hey, Yuri.

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:37.736
[YURI]
Is work okay?

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.739
It's fine, I guess.
I'm still there at City Hall.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.074
[YURI] You're kinda weird,
so I'm worried about you.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.952
[YOR] Don't be rude,
I'm completely normal.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.746
[YURI] Well, most girls
your age are married.

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.247
Do you have any prospects?

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.582
[YOR]
Not this again.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.710
[YURI] I'm sorry, but I think I
might get a big promotion soon.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.212
Which would mean I'd
be expected to travel

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.505
more than I already do,

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.174
but I worry about leaving
you alone in the big city,

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:02.636
so I'm not entirely sure that
I should take the offer.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.471
The whole reason I got this
far is because of your help,

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:06.473
and I'm so grateful.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:09.476
That's why all I want
is for you to be happy.

00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:13.355
Aw, that's sweet.
Thanks a lot, Yuri.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.981
[YURI]
Can I set you up with someone?

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.859
Huh? That won't be necessary.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:21.238
Because, um, I'm actually
going to a party this weekend.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.614
And I'm bringing a date.

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.074
[YURI]
Wait, you have a boyfriend?

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.536
[YOR] Yep. Hah. I do.
So don't worry 'bout me!

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.912
[YURI]
Wow, that's great!

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:31.331
Uh, like a little coworker
party or somethin'?

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:32.958
Yep, Camilla's putting it on.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.167
[YURI]
Okay.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.669
Then I'll have to make
sure to ask Dominic

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.046
all about this mystery
man afterwards.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:38.964
Huh?

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.008
[YURI] Come on, you know
you can be a little naive.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.969
If the guy's a jerk,
I'll take care of him.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.262
[YOR]
Well, uh...

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.638
[YURI] I'll wait on this
promotion until I know

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.598
what his story is.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.267
[YOR] Oh, you don't need
to bother with all tha--

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.351
[YURI]
Can't wait to meet him.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.228
Well, nighty-night!

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.567
[YOR]
What do I do?

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.695
I gotta land a date before
the party this weekend.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.989
If he finds out I'm lying,
he'll think I'm a weirdo

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.826
and a pathological liar and
things'll get even worse.

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:08.910
And I would hate for my brother

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.079
to skip a promotion
on my account.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.748
[phone rings]

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.000
Hey, Yuri, I want you to know

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.334
I was joking about
all that earlier--

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.502
[SHOPKEEPER]
Uh-oh.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.338
Are you and your little
brother having a spat?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.132
[YOR]
I-- Shopkeeper?

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.134
Sorry, didn't realize
it was you.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.218
[SHOPKEEPER]
It's fine.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.889
But I do have a client needing
your attention tonight,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.265
Thorn Princess.

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:34.728
The Royal Hotel. Room 1307.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.025
I'm sorry about this, lady,

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.027
but the entire floor has
actually been reserved

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.737
for the evening, so...

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.655
[GUARD B]
Did anyone call for this chick?

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:46.823
I dunno.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.367
[YOR]
Oh, well, with all due respect.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.246
What I heard is that there's a
traitorous scumbag staying here.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.041
[GUARDS yell]

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.125
What's happening out there?

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.878
[GUARD C] It's an ambush!
Some broad just--!

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.258
[YOR]
Excuse me.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.887
Vice Minister Brennan from the
auditing department, I presume?

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.348
Terribly sorry for
the interruption.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.308
But tell me,
may I have the honor

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.144
of taking your life
this evening?

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.733
[NARRATOR]
Code name: Thorn Princess.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.402
One of the world's
deadliest assassins.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.155
She learned the skills of her
trade at a very young age,

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.574
and since then, has done
whatever dirty work

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.786
her employer's requested of her.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.621
Won't wash off.

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.583
[YOR]
Uh! Oh, no! Not my dress.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:43.964
This is the only nice one I own.
I'll have to miss the party.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.259
[YURI]
Do you have any prospects?

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.845
[SHARON] Being single at
that age is kinda unusual.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:53.390
[CAMILLA] Bring a date
and join in the fun!

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.852
There's no way.
I'll never be a homemaker.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:01.064
"Cleaning house" is the
only thing I'm good at.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.654
[ANYA]
Scruffy Head!

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:10.824
Copied all the files of
unmarried women from City Hall.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:11.866
Thank you.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.159
[FRANKY]
Gotta find one who won't care

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.369
you're divorced with a kid,

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.538
is refined enough for
a hoity-toity school,

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:19.374
and is willing to get
married in 48 hours?

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.793
If there's a goddess like that,
I'd love to meet her.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:25.839
As for me, I can't get a date
and I'm not even picky!

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.840
My condolences.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.009
Don't pity me, ya jerk!

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.969
[ANYA]
Is it bad to have a kid?

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.264
Am I keeping Mamas away?

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.807
[TWILIGHT]
No, it's not your fault.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.851
Just watch some TV
and don't worry.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.310
[ANYA]
'Kay.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.361
[FRANKY] I gotta wonder why
you're not just paired up

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.697
with some lady spy from work.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.033
[TWILIGHT] A lot of them were
caught in the recent spy hunts,

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.701
so I couldn't find a match.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:57.662
[FRANKY] Lots of rats
runnin' loose these days.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.247
We're low on agents right now,

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.875
so I've got another mission
on top of this one.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.502
Brass wants me to eliminate
a smuggling ring.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.337
They're working you like a dog!

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.673
Fine. Let's find
you a lady, then.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.675
Seems like women in
bad circumstances'd

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.969
be most likely to
go along with it.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.721
Finding dirt on 'em would help.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.639
'Course we could always
just make stuff up.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.683
I'd like to minimize my risk.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.143
[FRANKY]
Too late for that.

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.103
You see her don't ya?

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.813
Does she look the part
of a rich family's

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.483
precious little princess?

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:31.112
Point taken. I need to do
something about her appearance.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:33.656
[gasps]

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:34.699
[PROPRIETRESS A]
Now, young lady,

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.242
I'm going to take
your measurements.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.243
If you'd please come with me.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.704
I'm being sold to traffickers!

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.915
[TWILIGHT]
You won't if you behave.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:46.211
Honestly, where does she even
pick up that kind of language?

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:52.175
[TWILIGHT] The seamstress is the
right age, but already married.

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.803
The proprietress was listed
among the single women,

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.347
but she's been arrested once
over political activities,

00:09:57.388 --> 00:10:00.809
and that's definitely
something to avoid.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.521
Finding the right person
might take longer than--

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.024
Excuse me!

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:11.069
[EMPLOYEE A] Goodness,
Yor, it's been too long.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:14.864
[YOR] Hi, sorry. I was hoping
to get my dress mended.

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.616
As soon as possible, please.

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.159
[EMPLOYEE A]
Oh, of course, dear.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:19.869
You're one of our regulars.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:23.081
[TWILIGHT] She slipped right
past me. Who is she?

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.375
Yor. Yor.

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:28.670
Ah, Yor Briar, 27 years old.

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:31.798
Never been married,
both parents are deceased,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.884
and she has one brother
who's several years younger.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:38.638
They're both civil servants
with fairly spotless records.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.142
Did I let my guard down?
I'm losing my edge lately.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:45.353
[YOR] Excuse me. I couldn't
help notice you staring at me.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.021
Is there something
I can do for you?

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:47.397
[TWILIGHT]
Oh...

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:49.566
[TWILIGHT]
Impossible! She sensed my gaze?

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.609
[TWILIGHT]
It's just that you're so pretty.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.737
You're saying...

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.907
You have a favorable impression
of my physical appearance?

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.742
Uh, I guess. Yeah.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.703
[CAMILLA] You're cute, with
curves in all the right places.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:05.123
If you knew how to flaunt it,
you'd be knockin' 'em dead.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:05.957
[YOR]
Uh--

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:10.211
[ANYA] Papa! I'm this
long! They told me!

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.421
Who's that?

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:12.380
[TWILIGHT]
A fellow customer.

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.674
[YOR]
He has a child.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.134
I came awfully close to asking

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.636
another woman's
husband on a date.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:22.182
They say people get killed by
jealous wives all the time.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:26.019
Although I'm positive I'd
be able to kill her first.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.771
No, calm down Yor.
Don't even think about it.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.023
That's exactly the sort of thing

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:32.192
that would expose me
as an assassin.

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:33.902
Don't be weird.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.237
[ANYA]
What? An assassin?

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:40.116
A spy. An assassin.
This is...

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.576
...so cool!

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.828
[NARRATOR] The girl was starved
for entertainment.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:44.913
[TWILIGHT]
Hmm.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.207
I thought about asking
her to play my wife,

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.125
but I'd better not.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.418
[YOR]
I thought about asking him

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.337
to play my boyfriend
at the party,

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.839
but that could easily end in
bloodshed, so I'd better not.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.132
[ANYA gasps]

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.176
[ANYA]
Oh, poor, poor me.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.554
I'm so lonely 'cause
I've got no Mama.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:02.931
[TWILIGHT]
What's this about?

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.892
I just need a Mama so bad.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.977
Are you not here with your wife?

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:12.023
Um, no. Sadly, we lost
her two years ago.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:15.526
It's just me and my daughter.
I'm raising her by myself.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:19.239
[YOR] No one will try to kill
me for asking him out.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.865
Excuse me.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.455
[TWILIGHT]
Pretend to be your boyfriend?

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.250
Long story, but I lied
and told my brother

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.043
that I was in a relationship.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.504
I realize it's asking a lot,
but I was wondering

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.923
if you could come to
this party with me.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.300
Uh, I don't have any
weird ulterior motives

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:40.551
or anything like that!

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.012
And I'll find a way
to repay you.

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:47.100
All I want to do is put
my brother's mind at ease.

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:51.020
Very well then, offer accepted.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.939
Uh. Wait, seriously?

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.984
[TWILIGHT] Although I'd
like something in return.

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:01.406
It's a long story,
but I'd like you to pretend

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.866
to be her mother
during an interview.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.868
[YOR]
Pretend to be her mother?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.204
We live in such uncertain times,

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.706
and I just want my
sweet little girl

00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:11.332
to get into a good school.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:15.837
I have to try. Because it was
her mother's dying wish.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.630
[ANYA]
Papa's a big liar.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.049
[YOR]
What a wonderful man.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:22.218
[TWILIGHT] This is a relatively
simple first step,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.138
but I'll get her to agree to an
official marriage, eventually.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:26.889
If you think I'm good
for the role, that is.

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.182
Thanks so much.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.685
I suppose we 'll see each
other Saturday, then.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.186
'Kay.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.940
[TWILIGHT] I got a sitter
for you on Saturday,

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:38.192
so promise me you'll behave.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.069
'Kay, I'll need some peanuts!

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.071
[TWILIGHT]
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:45.325
Ten pents is your
change, ribbit.

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:46.326
Thanks, ribbit.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.536
[ANYA]
"Ribbit"?

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:52.165
[TWILIGHT]
A "T"-- No, an "F" cipher.

00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:00.423
[TWILIGHT] Must be details
on the side mission.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.717
Retrieving works of art
stolen from the West

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.053
and wiping out this
smuggling ring.

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:07.847
The mission is to commence
Saturday at 1800 hours

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.391
when the target meets the buyer.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.185
Saturday?

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.730
[TWILIGHT]
Listen up.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.231
We'll need to take care
of this this quickly

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.816
so I can make that party.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:19.484
Got it?

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:21.527
Whoa. You realize I'm
just an informant

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.030
and I couldn't fight my way out
of a wet paper bag, right?

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.199
And your tab is pretty
much maxed out, so...

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.909
[TWILIGHT]
We're talking 78 art pieces

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.370
valued at a total of
three million dalcs.

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.038
I'm fairly certain
no one would notice

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.165
if something were to go missing.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.834
Leave it to me!

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.045
Matter of fact, I've invented
some new spy gear

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.963
just for an occasion like this.

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.341
[TWILIGHT]
He can be so useful.

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:51.099
Loid is late. I'm worried.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.435
I really hope he wasn't
in some terrible accident.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.896
[FRANKY screaming]

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.481
[LACKEY A]
Hold it!

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.358
[LACKEY B]
Who you workin' for?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.069
[FRANKY] You didn't tell me
there'd be an army of 'em!

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.072
[TWILIGHT] Two, four, six,
thirty-eight of them.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:09.158
Gives me less than ten
seconds for each one.

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:18.209
[TWILIGHT] Reinforcements!
And a lot of them!

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.837
I got everything,
so let's go already!

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.634
[FRANKY]
Oh, yeah!

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:30.680
Now, which one of these
will go M-I-A?

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.891
I'll be taking this.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.101
[FRANKY]
Wait, the diamond?

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:36.769
Why ya gotta grab
the priciest one?

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.229
[TWILIGHT] Because it's best
for the whole charade.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.148
[FRANKY]
C'mon, give it back!

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.327
[YOR]
I get it.

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:56.622
This is what having your
heart toyed with feels like.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.125
But I still need to maintain
good work relationships

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.169
to keep my brother happy.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.213
So even though I really
don't want to go,

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:06.382
I can't skip the party.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:11.596
So you finally decided
to show up, huh?

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.765
I'm sorry. I brought
a gift for you.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:15.933
What's up?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.894
I remember you saying you'd
be bringing a date

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:18.853
with you tonight.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.272
[YOR] Unfortunately, he had
a last-minute situation.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.107
[CAMILLA]
Oh, that is such shame.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.026
I really wanted
to meet this guy!

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.736
What a lame excuse.

00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:28.029
[MILLIE]
Just pathetic.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.572
[SHARON]
I knew that weirdo was lying

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.449
about having a boyfriend.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.909
[MILLIE]
You think we should report her?

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:33.701
[CAMILLA]
Definitely!

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.077
She has to be some kind of spy,

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:36.496
who was sent here
for the sole purpose

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.872
of lowering our
country's birth rate

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.373
or something crazy like that!

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:41.042
[SHARON]
Come on, stop being petty.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.960
She's just too awkward
to find a man.

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.295
She's got it bad enough.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.381
Hey, Yor, I'm so sorry your
boyfriend couldn't make it.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:48.382
I wanted to meet him.

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:50.301
[YOR]
Oh, Dominic.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:54.972
Poor Yuri, you know he's always
extremely worried about you.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:57.225
Yeah, it's a little bit much.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:58.684
Do you think you
could just tell him

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:00.436
that I showed up with
a really nice guy?

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.813
Whoa, so you want him to lie?

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.440
That means you must
really be desperate

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:05.691
to pretend to be normal.

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.944
You know it makes you
look even more pathetic.

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.529
Hey, knock it off!

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.822
[CAMILLA] Stop talking
to my man, you freak.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.991
We'll be sure to let your
sweet widdle brother know

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.160
that you came here
all by your lonesome.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.037
[YOR]
I don't understand.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.207
What could she possibly get out
of doing something like that?

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:23.292
I'm getting sick of this.

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:26.671
Just think, if everyone
here were to die,

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.215
my brother would never
hear about any of it.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:32.093
[DOMINIC] Sorry to bug you.
Try and have some fun, okay?

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.513
Come on, Camilla. Let's get
this gratin in the oven.

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.768
[GUEST A] Oh, you want to know
what happened next?

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.603
Mama!

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:46.482
My oldest will be taking
an entrance exam soon.

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:49.360
We're going for Eden College.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.487
[GUEST B]
That's wonderful!

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:52.196
[GUEST A]
He'll be...

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.948
[YOR]
I guess this must be

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.285
what being a "normal"
person looks like.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.744
This is exactly the kind of life

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:01.706
that my little brother
wants me to have.

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.708
Wow, looks like
Yor's still here.

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.751
[MILLIE] She's got a
high shame tolerance.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:09.046
Honestly, I'm surprised she had
the guts to show up here alone.

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:13.509
[YOR] I get it now.
I'm just not cut out for this.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.597
[YOR]
I beg your pardon.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:20.516
Thank you, but it's
time for me to--

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.896
Please forgive my lateness.

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:29.108
I'm Loid Forger, Yor's husband.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.529
Hey. I needed a boyfriend,
not a husband.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.488
You're kidding me!

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.240
[TWILIGHT]
I mixed up our missions.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.909
Mister Forger, is that blood?

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.453
Yes, pardon me, please.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.747
A patient had a
violent outburst.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:46.125
Just one of the risks
of being a psychiatrist.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.501
You having a good time, Yor?

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:48.961
[CAMILLA]
You can't be serious.

00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:53.090
Why didn't you tell us you were
married? I had no idea!

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.009
Well, I-- Because--

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:55.843
It's embarrassing,

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.429
but this is my second marriage
and I have a child.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.598
Makes things a bit
uncomfortable.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.766
[CAMILLA]
Don't give me that crap!

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.768
No freaking way that
terminally awkward girl

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.519
has a hot, successful husband!

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.229
Now this will be
"uncomfortable"!

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:08.981
Oh, excellent timing.

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:11.275
I just got this piping hot
gratin out of the oven!

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.569
Whoops, I seem to've
tripped on something!

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:14.403
[chuckles]

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:15.613
[CAMILLA]
Hm?

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:23.245
I love that you're so mindful
about wasting food, Yor.

00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.705
But I'm not so sure
it's good manners

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:26.415
to use your feet, you know?

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:28.084
Uh. Sorry about that.

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.669
Wow.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.795
[TWILIGHT]
This is actually very tasty.

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.380
[YOR]
Isn't it?

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:33.964
Tell me, Mister Ranger.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.174
It's Forger.

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:38.302
Did you know that your wife
did some questionable work

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:41.013
before she started at City Hall?

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:42.640
--What was it, again?
--Give it a rest.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.975
Random men would call you
up to their hotel rooms

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:48.521
so you could give them
"massages," isn't that right?

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:49.939
That was...

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.401
[YOR] A massage was code
for "murder for hire."

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:56.946
I promise it's not what
you think, Loid. I just--

00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:58.114
I think it's great.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:59.657
[YOR gasps]

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:00.991
Truthfully.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.035
She lost her parents
at a young age,

00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:04.829
and to care for her
younger brother,

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.956
she did whatever she could.

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:09.834
She sacrificed a great deal.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.502
Be it for someone else's sake,

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:15.089
or whatever the reason, having
to put up with such a tough job

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.466
takes real grit and dedication.

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:21.178
And that's not something
just anybody can do.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.596
Let's go home, Yor.

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:26.517
[YOR] Okay. Thank you
so much for having us.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:32.314
Hey, sorry for the
"husband" thing.

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:33.482
No, it's fine.

00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:37.278
If your brother hears about
that, who knows what to say?

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:43.242
Well, here's an idea, tell
me what you think of this.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:44.368
[gasps]

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:48.581
What the--?

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:51.375
[TWILIGHT] Stragglers from
the smuggling ring?

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:52.752
[TWILIGHT]
Hang on, Yor!

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:53.961
[YOR]
Huh?

00:20:57.715 --> 00:20:59.383
[TWILIGHT]
How did they know where I was?

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:03.095
Let me guess, they left a
tracking device in the loot.

00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:05.806
Ugh. You've definitely
lost your edge, Twilight.

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:08.559
Who are those people?
Do you know them?

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.644
[TWILIGHT]
What do I say? What do I say?

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.605
[TWILIGHT]
Seems that some of my patients

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:15.775
are still having
psychotic breaks.

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:18.152
[YOR] Being a doctor
must be very demanding.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.653
[TWILIGHT]
She really believed that?

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:23.115
The best course is to
avoid them for a bit.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.243
[THUG A]
They left the van behind.

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:27.953
I betcha they're
hidin' around here.

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.872
Let's split up and find 'em.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:38.088
[TWILIGHT]
This way, hurry!

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.174
Hey, Loid, sorry to pry,

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.426
but are you supposed
to hit your patients?

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.011
Yeah, it's okay.

00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:45.888
I'm using a
cutting-edge technique

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.390
known as the "concussive
recovery" method.

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:49.600
[YOR]
Oh.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.268
[TWILIGHT] Hard to tell
if she's extremely smart

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.187
or extremely stupid.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:54.980
Get back!

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:56.190
[THUG E screams]

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.943
[TWILIGHT]
Another one! He's got me!

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.658
Uh! Sorry!

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:08.577
I'm not a doctor, so I shouldn't
try to treat your patients,

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:11.038
but I am kind of an
expert at self-defense.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.415
My little brother taught
me everything he knows.

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:14.834
[chuckles]

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:16.919
Thanks a lot, Yor.

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.214
I must say, that was impressive.

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:22.258
Did you see how far
the guy went flying?

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:25.386
It's crazy. Guess I don't
know my own strength.

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:26.637
[YOR chuckles]

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:28.264
[THUG G]
There he is!

00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:29.640
[TWILIGHT]
This way!

00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.101
[THUG G] I don't care how
you do it, just kill 'em!

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:34.728
--[thudding]
--[THUGS yells]

00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:43.571
[YOR] So, uh, Loid, this may
not be the best time to ask,

00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:45.030
but will you marry me?

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:46.198
[TWILIGHT grunts]

00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:48.742
[YOR gasps]

00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:51.412
[TWILIGHT]
I'm sorry?

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:55.499
[YOR] Well, I suppose it
would extend our agreement.

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:58.752
But honestly, it seems that
people are suspicious of me

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:00.421
just because I'm single,

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:04.174
so it'd be kind of a
nice little camouflage.

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:07.511
[YOR] And it would help me cover
for the assassin job, too.

00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:10.431
[YOR] Um, basically,
if it works for you,

00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:12.641
maybe you and I
could stay together.

00:23:12.683 --> 00:23:15.978
I mean, after the whole
interview thing is over.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.690
It'd be for both of our sakes.

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:21.567
[YOR]
It's happening so fast,

00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:24.236
but he's probably the only
person in the world

00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:27.239
who could accept me
for who I am.

00:23:29.283 --> 00:23:32.036
[TWILIGHT] Let's swing by City
Hall to fill out the paperwork.

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.037
Yeah, like, right now?

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:36.498
[TWILIGHT] No time like
the present. Oh, hang on.

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:41.378
[TWILIGHT]
Did I drop it?

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.798
[THUG B] You bastard!
We got 'em cornered!

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.094
You're dead! You hear me?!

00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:55.392
[TWILIGHT] Yor, even in
sickness... or in sadness...

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:58.646
No matter what hardships
we may face...

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.191
Let's do it together.

00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:03.567
