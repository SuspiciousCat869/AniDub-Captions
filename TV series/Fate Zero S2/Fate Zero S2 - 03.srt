1
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:05,440
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

2
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:09,033
As you can imagine, things have
been rather hectic this evening.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,884
I'm sure it couldn't be helped
given the extraordinary situation.

4
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,452
It's going to be rather difficult to cover all that up.

5
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:20,071
Well, perhaps.

6
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:24,662
What has happened is far too much for
the holy church to handle by herself,

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,420
and so we are accepting any and all aid
proffered for assistance in this effort.

8
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:32,681
Now the, down to business.

9
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:39,166
Regarding my request, I'm curious
as to what your decision is, Father.

10
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:43,402
I speak, of course, of the
reward offered for Caster's defeat.

11
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:18,477
This is wonderful.

12
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:26,511
Once I receive the command seal for killing Caster,
Diarmuid and I will finally be truly connected forever.

13
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:37,965
My right hand!

14
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:39,931
It's gone, it's gone!

15
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,221
My right hand!

16
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:42,589
My right hand!

17
00:02:43,107 --> 00:02:46,498
I need it or I... I cannot call Diarmuid,

18
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:49,180
I won't be able to make him care for me.

19
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:50,641
My right hand.

20
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,453
My right hand, my right hand,

21
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:53,916
my right hand, my right hand!

22
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:55,886
Hand...

23
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,699
my right hand.

24
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,562
Success.

25
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,056
I have secured Sola‐Ui over in New Town.

26
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:10,702
I removed the command seals in her right arm.

27
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:11,816
Fine.

28
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:14,173
Get out of there immediately.

29
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:17,111
Lancer should be returning any time now.

30
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:18,265
Roger.

31
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,047
I saved Kariya Matou.

32
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:36,195
Without doubt, he could threaten my master.

33
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:38,074
There is no excuse.

34
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,796
This is an act of rebellion.

35
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,315
But what is this I'm feeling?

36
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:47,297
It is not regret.

37
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:49,686
Could it be...

38
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:51,979
that I'm excited about this?

39
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:56,686
Of course, it's true that in the defeat
of the Servant Caster and his master,

40
00:03:56,897 --> 00:04:00,821
the Servant Lancer played an important
part in the overall conduct of the battle.

41
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:05,189
A fact varified by a number of
reports from various observers.

42
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,482
Then it's clear.

43
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:10,489
As master of Lancer, I have the right
to receive one of the command seals.

44
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:12,657
It's not that simple.

45
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,681
Lord Kayneth Archibald...

46
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:21,581
I am unsure whether it is at all inappropriate
to consider you a master at this point.

47
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,318
Father, my pact with Lancer

48
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:28,944
was from the outset executed jointly
by myself and my fiancee, Sola‐Ui.

49
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:33,396
And is Sola‐Ui not the one
currently supplying mana to the servant?

50
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:37,490
And is she not also acting as
defacto caretaker for the command seals?

51
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:38,792
Yes, that's true.

52
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:41,833
I've temporarily given her custody of the command seals.

53
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:46,527
However, the rights accorded by
the pact still legally reside with me.

54
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:51,766
After all, Father, the petition I submitted
to the church to be considered a master

55
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,938
was filed in my name and did not include Sola‐Ui.

56
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,953
Very well, I agree.

57
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:01,791
Your rights as a master shall remain intact.

58
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:06,449
Now, Lord Archibald, extend your hand, please.

59
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:10,797
Take this and drink from it.

60
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:16,838
This is my blood, the blood of the everlasting covenant
which will be poured out for you and for all mankind.

61
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,080
Do this in my memory.

62
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:33,484
I hope you will continue to fight a noble
battle for the Grail as a worthy master.

63
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,577
Yes, of course, Father.

64
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,914
I'm down to a single command seal.

65
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:53,854
My situation remains dire.

66
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,451
I cannot allow the other masters an
opportunity to acquire an additional seal,

67
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:01,408
not if I intend to possess the Holy Grail.

68
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,324
Mistress Sola‐Ui.

69
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,769
You complete incompetent!

70
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:11,791
You useless bumbling fool!

71
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,330
You couldn't even protect a
single woman from being attacked?!

72
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:16,390
Huh.

73
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:19,538
I'm sick of all your talk of chivalry.

74
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:21,912
I am grievously sorry, Master.

75
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,140
She may have been a mere substitute,

76
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,841
but you even failed to protect your
own master from nearly being killed!

77
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:31,812
What good are you as a servant, I ask you?

78
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:35,193
I'm amazed you had the unmitigated
nerve to return here alone.

79
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:37,825
Please understand, my master.

80
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,627
Mistress Sola‐Ui and I never entered

81
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:42,493
into a proper pact,

82
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,925
and as such we could not sense each other's presence.

83
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:47,327
That's no excuse.

84
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:50,277
You should've taken special care to ensure her safety.

85
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:52,779
My master, fret not.

86
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,827
Mistress Sola‐Ui yet lives.

87
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:57,995
She continues to supply me with mana.

88
00:06:58,072 --> 00:06:59,437
That's irrelevant!

89
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:00,923
You are not her servant.

90
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:03,340
And therefore you can not discern her location.

91
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:06,581
So it doesn't matter in the least
whether or not you know if she's alive.

92
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:11,238
Oh, Sola‐Ui, I should've never
given you those command seals.

93
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:14,205
I could not dissuade her, Master.

94
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,689
I share in the responsibility.

95
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:21,912
I really can't believe you had the nerve to say that.

96
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:23,885
Don't try fooling me, Lancer.

97
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:27,852
It was you who encouraged Sola‐Ui to become ambitious.

98
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,721
I would never do that, Master.

99
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:33,452
It's just as it was in the legend.

100
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,550
Are you truly incapable of seeing your
Lord's fiancee without attempting to seduce her?

101
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,524
My master...

102
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:44,757
please retract those words right now.

103
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,798
Have I struck a nerve, Lancer?

104
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:52,454
You're nothing but a beast who swore
an oath of eternal loyalty to his master.

105
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:56,222
And then gave into prurient
lust when the moment suited him.

106
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,543
My master.

107
00:07:58,268 --> 00:07:59,248
My lord.

108
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:01,876
Why will you not understand?

109
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:05,857
Master, I wished only to defend my honor,

110
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:10,192
to fight well in noble battle,
and achieve victory on your behalf.

111
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,728
Don't you ever speak to me in that manner, Servant!

112
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:15,952
Understand your place.

113
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:20,202
You're nothing but a spectral ghost,
granted form and substance by magic.

114
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,037
You dare to sit there and lecture your master!

115
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,253
It is absurd and unacceptable!

116
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,548
If you are so dissatisfied,

117
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:30,750
I believe you have but one option available.

118
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:34,013
Use your precious pride to resist my command seal.

119
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:36,369
You'll never win.

120
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:40,362
You servants are mere puppets, and
this seal the string that controls you.

121
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:42,726
Lord Kayneth.

122
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:46,512
Master.

123
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:47,553
What now?

124
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:50,726
Don't tell me, you still have something to say to me?

125
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:51,846
No.

126
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:53,249
That isn't it.

127
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:56,609
Something's approaching this building.

128
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,432
Look, Saber, it's just as Kiritsugu said.

129
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,286
There are traces of a magical barrier,

130
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:08,179
but it's very strange.

131
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,352
It hasn't been properly maintained.

132
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:14,273
It's already starting to... fall apart.

133
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:19,771
I did not expect to see you here, Saber.

134
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:21,992
Well, my...

135
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:25,494
allies found this place and informed me.

136
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,791
They said that this was your location.

137
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:33,332
You would not happen to know where my
master's betrothed is, would you, Saber?

138
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,720
My master has not heard from her.

139
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:40,087
No, I do not.

140
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:41,788
What of it, Lancer?

141
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:43,848
Never mind, forget it.

142
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:47,005
Anyway, are you sure about this?

143
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,695
I am certain you did not come to engage in idle chit‐chat?

144
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:56,618
After all, you must be completely exhausted
after employing that technique against Caster.

145
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,446
No more so than all the other servants.

146
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:00,926
I'm certain.

147
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:03,308
None of them will be fighting further tonight.

148
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:05,298
They will focus on defense.

149
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:09,581
That is why we needn't worry about being interrupted.

150
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,339
Dawn is nearly upon us.

151
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,738
But this may be the best night

152
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,984
for us to finally finish our battle.

153
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:23,852
What say you, Lancer?

154
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,783
Hm.

155
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:27,004
Brave Saber.

156
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,640
The only thing in this world
that still grants my heart peace

157
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:34,733
is your honor and the purity of your fighting spirit.

158
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:05,457
Her attacks are too weak.

159
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:11,795
Saber, why?

160
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:14,144
You will not use your left hand?

161
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,156
Don't get the wrong idea, Lancer.

162
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,453
If I use my left hand here,

163
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,303
the shame is certain to dull my blade

164
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:26,167
against your powerful spear.

165
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:28,777
A dulling such as that would be fatal.

166
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:30,464
Saber.

167
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,559
Therefore, Diarmuid...

168
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,848
...this is my best strategy,

169
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:41,698
the path that will allow me to defeat you.

170
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,454
Pride is in the blade of chivalry.

171
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,216
Saber...

172
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,619
I am glad I was able to meet you.

173
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:59,048
I am first Bure of Fianna,

174
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:00,792
Diarmuid O'Dyna.

175
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,205
I come for you.

176
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:03,285
Splendid.

177
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:07,042
For this night, Artoria Pendragon accepts your challenge.

178
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:10,430
Come then.

179
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:13,887
Why does he not win?

180
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:19,261
If he has no certain path to victory, should he
not escape with his master instead of risking defeat?

181
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,721
Right now our highest priority
should be to locate and rescue Sola‐Ui.

182
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:28,575
Why can't he not understand even that
simple concept?! He's a useless servant!

183
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:47,211
Why him?

184
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,700
Of all people?

185
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,313
This is...

186
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,020
a Self‐Geis Scroll.

187
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:06,903
A powerful magical item

188
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:11,168
that has been used throughout the ages
to forge an absolutely unbreakable pact

189
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,126
between one mage and another.

190
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,876
"Binding spell.

191
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:17,822
Affected party, Kiritsugu Emiya.

192
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:20,354
The crest of the Emiya family

193
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,407
orders the following actions:

194
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:27,901
the pledge is to be obeyed by the affected party
upon fulfillment of the terms described herein.

195
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:34,397
Pledge that Kiritsugu, son of
Norikata, fifth heir to the house of Emiya

196
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:38,077
will be forever forbidden from
harming Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald

197
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:40,527
and Sola‐Ui Nuada‐Re Sophia‐Ri,

198
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:46,645
or from intending to, by his hand, harm or
injure them or cause them pain in any way whatsoever.

199
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:47,918
Terms.

200
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:55,418
In principle, the curse of the Geis cannot be
removed by any means known to the mage world.

201
00:13:55,758 --> 00:14:00,031
Even if you forfeit your life,
as long as the magic crest exists,

202
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:01,991
it will bind your soul

203
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:03,582
even in death.

204
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:08,726
It's true that if I do what's written
on this scroll, he cannot kill me?

205
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:17,141
But under these terms, my fight, the fight for
which I prepared my entire life... will end here.

206
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:19,711
The Grail.

207
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,251
And the Archibald family pride.

208
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:27,352
He asks me to throw it all away?

209
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,168
Sola‐Ui.

210
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:13,038
Use your remaining command seals to
compel your servant to commit suicide.

211
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,165
The terms of the agreement have been met.

212
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:26,785
You wanna win!

213
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:29,409
You wanna win so desperately.

214
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,466
You desire the Grail so desperately,

215
00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:37,631
you have crushed... you have
crushed my sole remaining wish.

216
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,361
And you just stand there!

217
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,736
Do you not feel any shame at all?!

218
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:44,073
I will never forgive you.

219
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,317
I will never forgive any of you!

220
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:51,231
You inhuman monsters who have
ruined the honor of a knight.

221
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:54,410
Let my blood taint your dreams forever!

222
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:56,561
May the Grail be cursed!

223
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,311
May the wish it grants bring disaster!

224
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:02,685
And when you fall into the searing pits of hell,

225
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,693
you'll remember the hateful rate of Diarmuid!

226
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,237
So now the Geis binds you?

227
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:17,801
Yes, it is sealed.

228
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,687
I can longer kill you or Sola‐Ui.

229
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,211
I can't, but...

230
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:53,781
Kill me.

231
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,643
Kill me now.

232
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,131
Sorry.

233
00:16:57,753 --> 00:16:59,453
Our pact forbids me to.

234
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:13,235
Kiritsugu Emiya.

235
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:17,072
I finally recognize you as the lowly beast that you are.

236
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:21,002
I believed that our paths
differed, but we shared a mutual goal.

237
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,842
I was a fool to think this.

238
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,442
Until now, I placed my faith in Irisviel's words,

239
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,026
and thus did not doubt your intentions.

240
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:34,609
But now...

241
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:38,590
I can no longer believe that your desire for the Grail

242
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:41,334
has anything to do with salvation.

243
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:43,921
Answer me, Kiritsugu!

244
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,854
What is the true reason you desire the Grail?

245
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:51,170
Even should my sword at the end of this war win the Grail.

246
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:55,285
If that means I must yield it to you, I must...

247
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:58,091
Answer her, Kiritsugu!

248
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:02,477
After everything that has
happened, you owe her an explanation!

249
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:08,548
You know, this incident is the very first time

250
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:11,425
you've seen how I kill, Iris.

251
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,253
If you only eliminate a master, the servant

252
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:17,354
may enter into a pact with another party.

253
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:22,013
So I had to eliminate the master
and the servant simultaneously.

254
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:23,701
No, Kiritsugu.

255
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:24,881
Not to me.

256
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,396
Talk to Saber.

257
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,882
She's the one who needs to hear your words now.

258
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:30,750
No.

259
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,559
Honor, glory...

260
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:35,511
there's really no point in speaking to a killer

261
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:38,286
who extols the virtue of such things.

262
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:41,976
You would even insult chivalry to my face, monster!

263
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:45,019
A knight cannot save the world.

264
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:48,321
Knights call certain methods of fighting good,

265
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,860
and others evil, acting as if

266
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:53,750
there were some sacred nobility to the battlefield.

267
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,484
Such illusions created by heroes throughout history

268
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:01,541
have led countless young men to their bloody deaths,

269
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:05,717
all for the sake of this glory and honor they all extol.

270
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:07,282
They are not illusions!

271
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,438
Even the taking of a life in battle

272
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:11,947
as an act as a human being

273
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,608
must have ideals,

274
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:18,123
otherwise every war would bring
the very fires of hell to this world.

275
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,298
And there you go...

276
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:22,141
you heard her, Iris.

277
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,529
Our heroic spirit over there considers
a battlefield to be better than hell.

278
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:29,617
What a joke.

279
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:32,537
A battlefield is hell itself.

280
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:35,249
There's no hope to be had on one.

281
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,334
There is nothing but unspeakable despair.

282
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,434
Just a soulless cry we call victory.

283
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:44,022
Paid for by the pain of the defeated.

284
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,734
But humanity has never recognized this truth.

285
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:53,537
And the reason is that in every era a dazzling
hero has blinded the people with their legends and kept

286
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:57,001
them from seeing the evil of bloodshed they bring.

287
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:02,647
True human nature has not
advanced a step beyond the Stone Age.

288
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:05,144
Tell me this, Kiritsugu.

289
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:08,178
Do you force Saber to endure such humiliation

290
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:11,116
because of your hatred for the heroic spirits?

291
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:12,433
Of course not.

292
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,897
Personal feelings don't enter into it.

293
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:17,998
I will win the Holy Grail and save the world.

294
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,105
And I will wage that war with the most

295
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:23,193
appropriate weapons I have at my disposal.

296
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:27,203
Justice and righteousness cannot save the world.

297
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:29,433
I care nothing for such things.

298
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,810
Kiritsugu, don't you understand?

299
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:35,360
If you do evil to stop evil,

300
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:39,797
that rage and hatred will give rise to new conflict.

301
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:41,972
Kiritsugu Emiya,

302
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:46,523
I do not know what betrayed you, or
what has caused you to lose all hope,

303
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:53,351
but your sorrow and rage are found only
in those who at one time sought for justice.

304
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:57,309
Kiritsugu, in youth, your true self,

305
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,868
wished to be a hero, did it not?

306
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,911
A hero to save the world.

307
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,014
You believed in that. You desired it more than life.

308
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,594
Am I wrong?

309
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:12,926
I will break this endless cycle.

310
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:15,434
The Grail will make that possible.

311
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:21,075
I'll ensure that the blood I spill in
Fuyuki is the last that humanity will ever shed.

312
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:25,256
If that means I must stain my
hands with every evil in the world,

313
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:26,663
I don't care.

314
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,224
If that will save the world,

315
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,630
then I do it gladly.

316
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:43,820
Kiritsugu has left, hasn't he?

317
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:45,712
Irisviel?

318
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:51,898
Irisviel!

319
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:28,150
This cannot be allowed!

320
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:29,698
An alliance at this stage?

321
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:32,422
Let me tell you the truth behind the Holy Grail War.

322
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:36,601
Go and tell them we accept to
die to make his dream a reality.

323
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:38,588
Such a boring end.

324
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:40,520
I'll see you soon, Father.
