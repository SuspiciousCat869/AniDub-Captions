1
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:18,915
What are we gonna do now, Rider?

2
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:20,462
Hmm.

3
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:32,849
Hmm.

4
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,958
So what now, Mad Dog?

5
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,589
Tokiomi.

6
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:59,036
I'll kill you, bastard.

7
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,627
Saber!

8
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:27,748
They can't make it through.

9
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,855
If only Saber could use her left hand.

10
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:06,743
Hey, Saber!

11
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:08,977
We're not getting anywhere like this!

12
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:10,368
Let us withdraw!

13
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:11,889
Don't be a fool!

14
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:13,886
We must stop its advance!

15
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,097
That may well be, but we're in a stalemate!

16
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:18,832
Just fall back for now!

17
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,320
I have an idea!

18
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:28,018
Listen, everyone.

19
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:30,671
Whatever strategy we devise tonight,

20
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,169
we first need to buy some time to organize it.

21
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:37,817
For the time being, I will drag
that beast into my Ionian Hetairoi,

22
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:41,286
but it will be impossible for my elite troops to slay it

23
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,694
even if they attack in full force.

24
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,550
The best we can hope for is to halt
its advance within the Reality Marble.

25
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,534
And after that?

26
00:03:50,424 --> 00:03:51,571
No idea.

27
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:52,638
Huh?

28
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:55,329
After swallowing something as big as that,

29
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:59,979
my bounded field and its army will
only hold for a matter of mere minutes.

30
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,938
In that short time, we must act.

31
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:07,771
Heroic spirits, I want you to
find some way for us to prevail.

32
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,566
Boy, disembark!

33
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,496
You're staying here with them.

34
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:14,036
Huh?

35
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,059
Hey!

36
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:22,522
Once my reality marble is deployed, I will
not know what is going on in the outside world,

37
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:26,570
and so if anything happens, concentrate and call to me.

38
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:28,721
I'll send a messenger to you.

39
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,700
Saber and Lancer,

40
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:37,267
the rest is up to you.

41
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,760
Right.

42
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:40,181
Understood.

43
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:41,510
Yah!

44
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,867
You only prolong the inevitable.

45
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,303
Mom!

46
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,098
What is that?

47
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:13,478
How does plunging headfirst into that
filthy creature sound to you, you mongrel?

48
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,994
After all that raging and ranting against me.

49
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:53,186
When it comes time to act, this is all you can do?

50
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
Is he trying to kill himself?

51
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:05,176
Kariya, consider this an act of mercy.

52
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,982
Intensive, Einäscherung.

53
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,430
I can't kill you.

54
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,049
I'll kill you.

55
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:24,620
Tokiomi...

56
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:45,124
What now?

57
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,851
I know he said he'd buy us some time, but
if we don't think of something really fast,

58
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:50,191
We'll be right back where we started.

59
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,051
Come on now, Einzbern.

60
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:54,054
Don't you have any ideas?

61
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,334
Say something!

62
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,095
Wait a minute.

63
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,581
I don't know how to use this.

64
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:07,289
Iri.

65
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:10,493
Um, no, I'm... wait, who is this?

66
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:14,076
Ah, well, you must be Rider's master.

67
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:15,149
Good timing.

68
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,036
There's something I wanna discuss with you.

69
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:19,237
Who... who are you?

70
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:20,692
That's not important.

71
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:24,912
Caster's disappearance... I
gather that was your servant's doing?

72
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,580
That's right, basically.

73
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,101
Question... Rider's reality marble, when he releases it,

74
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:35,069
can he put down the contents in a specific area?

75
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:38,419
To a point.

76
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:41,378
He can get within 100 meters or so, I think.

77
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:42,667
It should be possible.

78
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,221
Rider has control over where
he enters back into this world.

79
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,534
Good enough.

80
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:52,248
When the timing seems like
it's right, I'll send up a flare.

81
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,208
Release Caster directly underneath it.

82
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:56,548
Can you do that?

83
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:59,713
I can, probably, I think.

84
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:03,023
One more thing... give this message to Lancer.

85
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:07,477
Tell him Saber's left hand contains
an anti‐fortress Noble Phantasm.

86
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:08,650
Huh?

87
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:13,580
Something the matter?

88
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:17,013
Well, he asked me to give you a message.

89
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:20,277
Saber's left hand has an anti‐fortress Noble Phantasm.

90
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:25,503
Is this true, Saber?

91
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:29,710
I see.

92
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you think it's capable of
obliterating Caster's monster?

93
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,073
I believe so.

94
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:41,727
But Lancer, my blade and my pride are the same.

95
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:46,487
This wound you inflicted on me
is a mark of pride, not shame.

96
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:50,940
If that loss was the price of
securing Diarmuid Ua Duibhne's aid,

97
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:53,168
then it was worth a veritable host.

98
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,455
Listen, Saber,

99
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:02,896
I cannot abide this Caster.

100
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:08,230
He finds the despair of others both right
and good and takes pleasure in spreading terror.

101
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,904
On my word as a knight,

102
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,256
his is an evil that I cannot let go unchallenged.

103
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:17,849
Lancer, no, you mustn't do that!

104
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:21,884
Must it be Saber who is victorious today or Lancer?

105
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,487
No, it is neither of us.

106
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:28,624
What must triumph here today is the path of chivalry.

107
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,685
Agreed, heroic Arturia?

108
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:46,274
Lancer.

109
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:51,132
I entrust our victory to the
single strike of the King of Knights.

110
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:54,035
I'm counting on you, brave Saber.

111
00:10:57,454 --> 00:11:02,671
Rest assured, Lancer. Upon my blade, I will prevail!

112
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:19,854
That is from the Arthurian legends.

113
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:28,605
Saber!

114
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:29,798
Berserker?

115
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:31,018
Why now?

116
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,674
You dare turn your back on me, you lowly mongrel?

117
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:58,094
Blasphemy!

118
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:00,298
What?

119
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:11,003
Saber!

120
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:13,263
What the hell does Berserker think he's doing?

121
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:16,524
I've finally regained the use
of my left hand and now this.

122
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,694
Regardless of its own self awareness of this fact,

123
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:44,791
a soul instinctively seeks out joy in its life.

124
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,137
He was the only one you ordered Assassin

125
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:52,722
to investigate thoroughly enough such
that you could understand those circumstances.

126
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:56,712
And this was due to your unconscious interest in him.

127
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,356
Still too soon.

128
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:45,698
What are all these tremors?

129
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:51,202
An omen that Rider's reality marble
is approaching its limits, I imagine.

130
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,542
Come, Rider.

131
00:13:58,265 --> 00:14:00,714
I am Mithrenes, Soldier of the Hetairoi.

132
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:05,119
I have come here to act as my king's eyes and ears.

133
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:09,977
Tell him to wait for our signal,

134
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,955
then release the bounded field and
dump Caster at the designated location.

135
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:15,709
Can you do it?

136
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:20,183
We can, sir, but it will be a race against time.

137
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,176
We of the Hetairoi are no longer able

138
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,994
to slow the progress of that
horror within the bounded field.

139
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,749
I understand that!

140
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:30,196
I know!

141
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,045
Damn that Berserker!

142
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,186
Can't we do anything about him?

143
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,533
Allow me.

144
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:41,475
Lancer!

145
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,743
I am putting an end to this mad warrior!

146
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:07,791
It's all or nothing.

147
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,823
Archer!

148
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:41,572
There it is!

149
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:43,079
Right under there.

150
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:43,832
Yes, sir.

151
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,519
Finally... what took them so damn long?

152
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:17,241
Oh.

153
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,135
All right now, Saber, show me your best!

154
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:29,363
I shall judge your worth as a heroic spirit

155
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,504
with my own two eyes!

156
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:55,012
The light.

157
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:56,946
It shines bright.

158
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:59,043
It is the true embodiment

159
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:02,515
of the sad yet noble dream of all soldiers

160
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,878
past, present, and future who
lie dying on the fields of battle,

161
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:10,282
clutched to their hearts with their last breath,

162
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:16,754
holding aloft their dying wish, making
certain that their loyalty will not be in vain.

163
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:21,265
The invincible king is about to cry out the true name

164
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:23,880
of the miracle she wields in her hands.

165
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:32,681
That name is...

166
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:38,802
Excalibur!

167
00:17:58,492 --> 00:17:59,918
This brilliant light!

168
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:17,990
There is no doubt, this is the light

169
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:22,350
from when Jean and I were blessed with such profound joy!

170
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:38,288
What... have I...

171
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:08,211
Did you see that, King of Conquerors?

172
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,808
Such is Saber's brilliant skill.

173
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:13,450
Having seen such light,

174
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,518
you still refuse to grant her your respect?

175
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:22,834
Hmm... that light is a result of her accepting
the hopes and dreams of the people of her time.

176
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,761
It hurts me because it's so bright.

177
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:29,063
And because I know that this burden

178
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,393
was thrust upon the shoulders of a little girl.

179
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:37,122
What I see is what became of a
girl who was never allowed to admire

180
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:39,661
butterflies or flowers or fall in love,

181
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:43,249
but was instead taken hold of by the curse of ideals.

182
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:46,808
It is too painful to look upon.

183
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,604
Which is exactly what makes her so endearing...

184
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,793
the unattainable dream she held so dear

185
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:58,286
was certain to explode in a brilliant
flare that would burn her to ash.

186
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,699
The tears of bitter lamentation she shed,

187
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:05,626
how sweet they'd have tasted as she laid there dying.

188
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:11,447
You and I will never get along, Babylonian King of Heroes.

189
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,347
Really?

190
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,897
You only now realized that fact?

191
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:17,512
What are you going to do, Rider?

192
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,893
Perhaps give vent to your righteous anger here and now?

193
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:24,812
It would give me great pleasure were I to do so.

194
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:30,490
But if you and I were to do battle, it would mean
expending more energy tonight than I would care to.

195
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:36,559
Of course, if you were to decide that
you couldn't pass up the chance to attack,

196
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,907
I would be forced to respond in kind.

197
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:42,749
This once, I shall allow you to escape.

198
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:46,382
There would be no satisfaction in crushing you

199
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,082
if you were not in your prime.

200
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:55,465
Or is it that you yourself are injured from
being shot down by that ridiculous lunatic?

201
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:59,206
I respond to provocation with death.

202
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,149
We'll save it for next time, King of Heroes.

203
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,835
Ours will be the epic battle that will
determine who is the champion of the Holy Grail War.

204
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,419
Don't be so certain.

205
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:22,762
I have yet to decide if there is but one who is
worthy of the gift of my greatest treasure, Rider.

206
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:29,406
You glorious fool who strives to achieve
that which man was not meant to have.

207
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:33,644
In all of Heaven and Earth, none but I, Gilgamesh,

208
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,422
can truly appreciate your destruction.

209
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:44,749
You who shine so brightly yet so briefly,

210
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:46,578
come to my arms.

211
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,016
This I have decided.

212
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:28,634
I am first Bure of Fianna,

213
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,147
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

214
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:33,419
Saber, I am glad I was able to meet you.

215
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:35,726
Splendid... for this night,

216
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:38,220
Arturia Pendragon accepts your challenge.

217
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,486
Come then!

218
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:40,806
I come for you!
