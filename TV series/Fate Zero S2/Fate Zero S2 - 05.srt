1
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:10,037
Hey! Come on, Kerry!

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,530
Hurry! Hurry up!

3
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:12,900
Kerry, jump in! Come on!

4
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:14,391
Come on! Come on!

5
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,760
It's so nice! Hurry up!

6
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:40,657
That was sweet, Kerry!

7
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:42,604
That was so cool! You're so awesome.

8
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,947
That was nothing. You're so cool.

9
00:00:43,972 --> 00:00:44,638
That was really great.

10
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,279
Shirley!

11
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:48,458
Shirley!

12
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:49,704
Kerry!

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,270
Sorry I'm late.

14
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:57,424
Hey, Kerry,

15
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,672
do you know where this island's name comes from?

16
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:01,379
Uh‐uh.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,573
Oh, isn't Arimago the word for crab?

18
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:05,461
Yep.

19
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:09,923
Long ago, this was a place where they
would make offerings to the sea gods.

20
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:16,175
But then one day a girl who was very poor and
had absolutely nothing to feed her sick mother

21
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:19,813
took some of the food that had been
set out by the village as an offering.

22
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:25,904
The sea gods were so upset by this that they
cursed the girl and transformed her into a crab.

23
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,449
That's where it comes from?

24
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,044
What an awful story.

25
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:33,259
Well, according to the legend, the shrine
where the village worshipped those gods

26
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:37,231
was located way up in the mountains,
right about the place where your house is.

27
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:42,175
That's why none of the villagers in
this area ever want to go up there.

28
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,089
They say it's bad luck.

29
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,923
They tell me that if I go there too often,

30
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:48,894
I'll end up cursed for life.

31
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,191
You're kidding.

32
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:51,417
Really?

33
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,551
But everyone's nice to me.

34
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,701
Of course they are.

35
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,897
You're not an outsider to them anymore.

36
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,862
In the village, they just treat
you like you're my little brother.

37
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,970
Your little brother, huh?

38
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:10,196
You know, Kerry, you've really settled in nicely here.

39
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:11,133
Yeah?

40
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:17,149
Back when you first arrived, everyone used to
really bully you, saying you had a weird name.

41
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:18,315
Hey!

42
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:22,365
You were the very first one to call my name weird,

43
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:25,460
and it was your big idea to call me Kerry.

44
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,140
Well, yeah, because your actual
name is really hard to say.

45
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,932
Kerry, uh...

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,273
Kerry...

47
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:34,375
Kiritsugu.

48
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,371
Jeez.

49
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:36,425
Kerrystugu!

50
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,260
Not even close.

51
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:39,460
Really?

52
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:41,712
Oops.

53
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:54,506
Okay.

54
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:55,777
Hm?

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,206
Hey, Dad, is that a new one?

56
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:00,697
That's right.

57
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,938
This would make my 100th success.

58
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:08,777
Amazing.

59
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:10,355
These flowers don't wither.

60
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,496
That's because I've altered the flow of time.

61
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:17,960
They will never grow beyond this, but they will never die.

62
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,540
Unbelievable.

63
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:24,452
The big question is whether or not we
can get the same theory to work on humans.

64
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,029
Sorry for the wait!

65
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,773
Shirley, what you got?

66
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:35,550
Check it out.

67
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:37,577
It's my first successful flower.

68
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:41,462
Shirley has been watching closely
and learning while she assists me.

69
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:47,868
She does seem to have the natural gift to be a mage.

70
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,025
Aw, come on now, Professor.

71
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,294
You did most of the work.

72
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,236
I only did a little bit, and it was right at the end.

73
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:56,282
Maybe, but it's amazing.

74
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,327
Uh, hey, Dad?

75
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,577
Huh, what?

76
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,239
You think I could give it a try?

77
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:03,954
What Shirley did, I mean.

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,451
That'd be great!

79
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:07,453
I think if you had a little bit of help,

80
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:08,572
you could do it.

81
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:10,459
Right, Professor?

82
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:10,869
No.

83
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:15,319
Kiritsugu, it's still too early for you.

84
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:16,079
Mm.

85
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:18,247
This isn't a game.

86
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:19,793
There are dangers.

87
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:25,412
I only let Shirley try it because she has the
necessary knowledge and experience to succeed.

88
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:26,156
Hm.

89
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,145
Father Simon, why won't you try to understand?

90
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,103
Shirley.

91
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,947
Everyone in town has the professor all wrong!

92
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:50,449
Shirley, listen to me.

93
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:53,112
You must stop going up to that mansion.

94
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:58,629
Let's talk inside.

95
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:07,204
I think Dad should spend some time with the villagers too.

96
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,500
I don't know.

97
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:16,250
Father Simon just has it in for him for some reason.

98
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,160
He keeps lecturing me all the time.

99
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:21,635
He says if I stay working there,

100
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:24,376
I'll get possessed by a demon someday.

101
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:25,736
Check this out.

102
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:27,678
He gave this to me yesterday.

103
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,934
Says I should always keep it near me.

104
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:33,865
He told me that it's a powerful talisman.

105
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:39,736
So you're not scared, you know, of my dad?

106
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:40,909
Not at all.

107
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:45,337
I realize that magical research
like he does isn't exactly normal.

108
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,080
But the professor's research
and discoveries are a big deal.

109
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:51,351
I mean, they could make history.

110
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,765
Actually, I think he's amazing.

111
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:02,114
Are you sure you should be...

112
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:05,720
What; It's sharp and it's really easy to use.

113
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,832
Well, see you tomorrow.

114
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:13,997
Shirley, something wrong?

115
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:18,485
Keeping a flower blooming forever.

116
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:20,734
It's really amazing magic.

117
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:23,191
But you're doing it too, Shirley.

118
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,841
The work with flowers is all I can do.

119
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:28,906
But he can do a lot more than that.

120
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:33,676
The medicines he makes could make
human beings effectively immortal.

121
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:37,907
I really want him to use his
power for the good of the whole world

122
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:41,943
so that everyone will finally
understand how incredible he is.

123
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,259
He's given up on that.

124
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,821
But, Kerry, I think you can do it.

125
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,536
Oh, come on.

126
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:53,088
You're the best student he's ever had.

127
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,865
If anyone could carry on his work,

128
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,213
it'd be you.

129
00:06:57,953 --> 00:06:59,946
Kerry, I'm not really his student.

130
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:02,314
At best, I'm his assistant.

131
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:04,225
Running his errands,

132
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,386
helping out.

133
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,774
See, I'm not his student.

134
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,680
Far from it.

135
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:17,414
So even when Father Simon says bad
things about him, there's nothing I can say.

136
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:22,461
Kerry, you're his heir, there's no doubt about it.

137
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:28,573
You do realize that everything he's
working on now he plans for you to continue.

138
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,805
It's just a little too soon, that's all.

139
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:37,086
Hey, come with me.

140
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:55,572
Whoa.

141
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:02,569
Tell me, Kerry,

142
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:05,489
what do you want to grow up to be?

143
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:06,846
Huh?

144
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,381
If you decide to take up your dad's work,

145
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,507
what do you think you'll use it for?

146
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:15,268
It's a world changing power,

147
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,905
and one day it will be yours.

148
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:21,144
So, go change the world.

149
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:23,034
You can do it.

150
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:24,741
I guarantee it.

151
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,442
Well, I, uh...

152
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:30,086
That's a secret.

153
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:33,316
Hm.

154
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:42,247
Then I guess I'll have to wait until you grow
up to see what you're gonna do with your power.

155
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:48,470
I'll stay with you until that day comes, okay?

156
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,119
Yeah, right, whatever.

157
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:04,398
Stop it!

158
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:05,218
No way!

159
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,957
Oh, good morning, Dad.

160
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:21,403
Kiritsugu, you didn't go into
my workshop last night, did you?

161
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:22,209
Huh?

162
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:23,797
No, I didn't.

163
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,423
I see.

164
00:09:28,364 --> 00:09:31,032
Listen, don't leave the house.

165
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:31,914
Huh?

166
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:32,704
Stay here.

167
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:34,444
Don't go into the village today.

168
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,979
What's gotten into him?

169
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:46,857
Shirley's late, I wonder why.

170
00:09:59,237 --> 00:09:59,851
Hey!

171
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:02,781
Have you guys seen Shirley?

172
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:04,001
Uh‐uh.

173
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:12,864
Shirley?

174
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:23,115
Shirley?

175
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:26,896
Hm.

176
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:34,203
Huh?

177
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:47,128
What the?

178
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,475
What happened?

179
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:13,533
Kerry.

180
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:15,801
Shirley!

181
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:22,462
I...

182
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,965
I only wanted to prove him right.

183
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:30,079
His resear... research.

184
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:34,828
But I guess

185
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:37,116
it didn't work.

186
00:11:47,617 --> 00:11:48,357
Kill me.

187
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:51,927
Use that.

188
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:53,402
Please.

189
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,930
You have to kill me.

190
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:59,393
Do it now

191
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:02,306
before it's too late.

192
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,598
Please do it!

193
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,013
I can't stop.

194
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,699
Can't hold it back anymore.

195
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:13,141
Hurry!

196
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:25,998
Hm.

197
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,836
Are you certain it was Shirley who did this?

198
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:40,178
Kerry, I want you to stay here for the time being.

199
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:42,379
I'll go inform the village.

200
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:54,935
Agh!

201
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:55,106
Agh!

202
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,926
Agh!

203
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:11,344
What?

204
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,030
What is all this?

205
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:34,382
Father Simon?

206
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:02,733
Yah!

207
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:25,291
Agh!

208
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:26,397
Agh!

209
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,826
Looks like we got here just a little too late.

210
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,179
Wait a minute.

211
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,563
Who are... who are you?

212
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,024
Agh!

213
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:42,279
Agh!

214
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:47,100
Don't you think you should worry about yourself first?

215
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,796
Well, if you just sit there like
that, you'll be joining them soon enough.

216
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:03,353
So what's going on?

217
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:05,013
Who did all this?

218
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,294
Why would they burn the village?

219
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:10,164
Surely you must have heard of them before.

220
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,764
You would know them as vampires.

221
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:15,865
The name we use is Dead Apostles.

222
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:17,340
Apostles?

223
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:20,149
They drink blood to increase their numbers.

224
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:23,880
Nearly everyone living on this island has become one now,

225
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,471
and here we are having to clean up the mess.

226
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,487
So, we have two groups down there
right now trying to eliminate them all.

227
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:36,044
One of the groups is made up of Church Inquisitors,

228
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:38,384
those who believe beyond the shadow of a doubt

229
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:41,718
that it's all right to slaughter
anyone who defies the will of God.

230
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:45,304
They'll show no mercy to any Dead Apostles they find,

231
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:49,315
and they'll kill anyone they even
suspect of having had their blood sucked.

232
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,341
The other group is from the Mage's Association,

233
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:54,205
and they're harder to explain.

234
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:59,443
Suffice it to say, they'd very much like to
keep the secret of who made such bizarre things

235
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,798
as the Dead Apostles to themselves.

236
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:06,101
Naturally, since their motto is All To Ourselves,

237
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,269
they'll kill anyone they suspect of knowing the secret.

238
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:11,289
They'll do anything to cover this up.

239
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:14,454
It was the mages who set a torch to the village.

240
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,391
So then whose side are you on?

241
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,730
I'm something akin to a salesman
to the Mage's Association.

242
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:25,793
All right, it's your turn, kid.

243
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:27,984
Time to answer one of my questions.

244
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,211
I'm looking for a mage who's marked for sealing.

245
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:33,302
What's a mage?

246
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:37,176
I suppose that word doesn't really mean anything to you.

247
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:40,811
There was someone who became a Dead Apostle first,

248
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:44,908
someone infected them with the medium
that turns people into those creatures,

249
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:47,967
the trigger that started their transformation.

250
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,246
The son of a bitch mage who conjured that medium up

251
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:54,269
should be laying low somewhere on this island.

252
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:57,713
Can you think of any likely spots where I should look?

253
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,949
Oh, good.

254
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:15,837
There you are.

255
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:16,842
You're okay.

256
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:18,469
Well, thank goodness.

257
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,570
Didn't I tell you not to go into the village?

258
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,817
Dad, why were you researching Dead Apostles?

259
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:28,754
How did you know about that?

260
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:33,880
Shirley used the magic on herself.

261
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,478
Oh, well, that's most unfortunate.

262
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,049
But you can't change what's already happened.

263
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:45,369
It just means Shirley gave me an answer I was looking for,

264
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:46,189
that's all.

265
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:51,028
Dad, will... will you use me

266
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:52,319
like you used Shirley?

267
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:53,672
Don't be stupid.

268
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:56,766
A Dead Apostle that can't control its blood lust

269
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:57,817
is a failure.

270
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:02,882
But the Emiya family research
requires an unlimited amount of time.

271
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:06,713
The Root will never be attained
by someone with a mortal body.

272
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,384
It was a time consuming task,

273
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:11,994
but it seems to have ended in failure.

274
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm going to have to reconsider my entire theory.

275
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:19,272
Kiritsugu, let's save this matter for another time.

276
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:21,962
For now, escaping comes first.

277
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,150
It's not too late to escape?

278
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,900
I suspected something like this might happen one day,

279
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,811
so I've kept a motorboat hidden on the south coast.

280
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,421
I'm sorry, Kiritsugu,

281
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:38,186
but we don't have time to let you gather your things.

282
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:39,399
Come on.

283
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:40,891
I'm gonna do it.

284
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,894
There's a Bounded Field around the forest,

285
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:45,862
an extremely powerful one.

286
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:48,548
It'll take a little bit of time to break through it,

287
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:51,672
but I'll be able to get in.

288
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,975
I have to be the one.

289
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:17,932
Tell me, Kerry...

290
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:23,966
What do you want to grow up to be?

291
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:55,133
That Bounded Field, I was able to break through it easily.

292
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,214
Are you mad or stupid?

293
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:02,715
It was only dumb luck that you showed up in time.

294
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:04,634
If this man had escaped,

295
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,091
he'd have continued his Dead
Apostles research somewhere else.

296
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:13,138
Yeah, well, that's a pretty crappy
reason for a kid to kill his father.

297
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:17,975
You're a good person, aren't you?

298
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:22,042
I'll get you off this godforsaken island.

299
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:24,472
You can decide the rest for yourself.

300
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:26,667
Wanna take anything?

301
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:29,691
Nothing at all.

302
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:28,512
After leaving the island,

303
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:33,538
I spent the next several years
living with Natalia Kaminski.

304
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:40,852
That meant choosing the same path as Natalia,
the solitary path of a highly skilled master hunter.
