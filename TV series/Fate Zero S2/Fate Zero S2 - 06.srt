1
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:24,023
Hurts, huh?

2
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:28,287
Mages carry the pain of that crest forever.

3
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:34,933
You know, I think your dad
really gave you the perfect name.

4
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,646
Your origin is based on cutting and tying, kid.

5
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:46,453
The nuance is a little different
than destroy and regenerate.

6
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:49,550
If you cut a thread and then re‐tie it,

7
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:51,565
it will be thicker where you cut it,

8
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,065
isn't that right?

9
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:57,946
In that sense, it carries a
connotation of irreversible change.

10
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:03,515
Kiritsugu, with the characters for cut and tie,

11
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:07,109
these will be your ace in the hole.

12
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:16,533
I've powdered some of your
ribs and put a little bit in here.

13
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:21,579
Your origin will materialize
in anything shot by this bullet.

14
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:25,551
If your target attempts to use any magic against it,

15
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,203
it will cut his circuits and thoroughly fry them.

16
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,363
Just one shot will incapacitate him.

17
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,246
I've made 66 in total.

18
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:36,608
Don't waste them.

19
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:04,060
Natalia, do you read me?

20
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:05,421
I'm almost there.

21
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,367
Roger.

22
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:18,503
Natalia, do it.

23
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,491
Huh?

24
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:05,311
In the end, after leaving the island,

25
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:09,438
I spent the next several years
living with Natalia Kaminski.

26
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:16,288
That meant choosing the same path as Natalia.

27
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:20,997
The solitary path of a highly skilled master hunter.

28
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,511
Natalia belonged to no organization.

29
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,693
She was a total freelancer,

30
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,281
interested only in the money she could earn.

31
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,517
The Mage's Association and the Church,

32
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:41,465
the rivalry between those two enormous organizations

33
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,145
kept her business booming.

34
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,449
During that time,

35
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:45,539
I witnessed many tragedies like the one on Arimago Island.

36
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:50,642
I also learned that all around the world

37
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:52,386
on every single continent,

38
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,766
the same horrors happened every day.

39
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,021
Just missed.

40
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:38,363
Are you trying to be a hero or something?

41
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:47,901
Was there no meaning to it?

42
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,279
I thought...

43
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:54,912
I thought I had killed my father to
keep more people like them from dying.

44
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,614
Killing merely one man isn't the solution.

45
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:00,842
It's not that simple.

46
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:06,294
Kill every single person all around
the world who's like our target here.

47
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,896
If you could somehow manage to do that,

48
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,035
maybe it would be possible.

49
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:27,648
No matter what happens, do whatever you must to survive.

50
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:31,505
That's a rule I set for myself
when I got started in this business.

51
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:35,782
Regardless of what you face, put your
own life ahead of anything or anyone.

52
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:44,583
Look, kid, if you try to save someone and you
get yourself killed, it'll all be for nothing.

53
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:49,528
I don't think it's possible to save everyone.

54
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:55,398
But I do want to save as many as I possibly can.

55
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,377
Well, suit yourself.

56
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:18,571
This target really is a nasty piece of work.

57
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:20,111
Do you know him?

58
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:22,735
The Mage Odd Vorzak.

59
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:27,519
He's a Dead Apostle who uses his
bee familiars to create his ghouls.

60
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:31,393
The Mage's Association has put a huge bounty on his head.

61
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,140
You know a lot about him.

62
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,482
He causes destruction wherever he goes.

63
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:43,448
The last town he visited was
completely and utterly annihilated.

64
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:44,702
Our town.

65
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:57,879
Natalia, can I have one of those too?

66
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:02,395
How old do you have to be in
your country to smoke tobacco?

67
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,097
I won't try to stop you, but they aren't good for you.

68
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,594
What's his destination?

69
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:25,385
There's a flight from Paris to New York in four days.

70
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,431
Vorzak will be on board.

71
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:30,066
I'll be handling this myself.

72
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:33,991
This guy is a clever target who
managed to give me the slip once.

73
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,484
You gotta clean up your own messes, right?

74
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:40,259
So, even you fail sometimes?

75
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,556
That should tell you how tough he really is.

76
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:49,640
What should I do?

77
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:54,494
I'm fairly certain he has
associates working for him in New York.

78
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,543
I want you to go there and eliminate them.

79
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,459
Then you'll fight Vorzak alone.

80
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:05,705
He can't keep his bees with
him in a carry‐on when he flies.

81
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,693
I see.

82
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,532
There's no risk of him getting away from you this time.

83
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:12,992
Shut your mouth, kid.

84
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,236
Kid, do you copy?

85
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:28,480
Roger.

86
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:29,759
Loud and clear.

87
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,916
All right, good luck to both of us then.

88
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,611
That was much easier than I expected.

89
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:45,912
Yes, well, I'm just glad you were
able to kill him with a minimum of force.

90
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,022
All right, Kiritsugu,

91
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:59,302
his corpse is in the passenger cabin.

92
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,094
Are you ready to carry it out?

93
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:03,476
I've secured a vehicle.

94
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,044
The only thing we need now is a doctor

95
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:09,084
who will carry out our sick patient.

96
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,594
I don't have a license, but that's okay.

97
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:29,710
Hey.

98
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:32,412
Natalia, what's wrong?

99
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:34,278
A ghoul!

100
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:40,801
We have a big problem here.

101
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:46,997
He was keeping the bees inside of his own body.

102
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,668
Natalia, you have to get out.

103
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,125
I'm not exactly close to the ground here.

104
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,067
I didn't come prepared to sky dive out of here.

105
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:01,840
This isn't good.

106
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:03,847
Looks like they've taken the cockpit.

107
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:13,464
I've got no choice.

108
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,741
Natalia, what are you gonna do?

109
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:21,443
I am coming home.

110
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:23,249
I'm coming home alive

111
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,714
carrying Vorzak's body.

112
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:29,026
But first I need to do something about this plane.

113
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,165
You got something to say?

114
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,940
Yeah.

115
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:36,831
You can do this, Natalia.

116
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:38,902
That'll do.

117
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:41,559
Prepare a nice warm bed for me and wait.

118
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,464
Hey, kid, do you read me?

119
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,418
You didn't fall asleep, did you?

120
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:08,845
Reading you loud and clear, Natalia.

121
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,821
We've both been up all night.

122
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,210
It's a rough morning.

123
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:16,041
If you'd slept in a bad last night with me stuck up here,

124
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:18,299
I would have to kill you after this is over.

125
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:22,411
Now, I have good news and bad
news. Which do you want first?

126
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,205
Isn't it a rule that you always start with the good news?

127
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:27,761
Okay.

128
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,526
I guess I'll start with the good news then.

129
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,143
For the time being, I'm alive.

130
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,936
The plane is also undamaged.

131
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:39,117
I made it up to the cockpit fairly easy,

132
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,857
though repairing the comms array wasn't easy at all.

133
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:47,752
I also think I can pilot it, assuming
the controls are similar to a Cessna.

134
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,467
Have you contacted the control tower?

135
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:51,393
I have.

136
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:54,425
At first they thought I was pulling some kind of prank.

137
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:58,258
Those kind folks say they'll escort me in.

138
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:00,212
All right.

139
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:02,977
And the bad news?

140
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:06,243
I'm the only one here who hasn't been bitten or stung.

141
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:10,773
300 passengers and crew, they're all ghouls now.

142
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:15,148
All that separates me from the
Night of the Living Flying Dead

143
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:17,708
is the damn cockpit security door.

144
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:19,633
Spooky, right?

145
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:23,422
Given everything you've just told me,

146
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,986
will you be able to make it out of this alive?

147
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,184
Well, the cockpit door is actually pretty tough.

148
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,832
They're scratching at it as we speak,

149
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,202
but they can't seem to break it down.

150
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:37,230
It's the landing that's worrying me.

151
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:40,984
This thing may be too big for me to handle by myself.

152
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:45,399
Natalia, I know you'll be able to manage it.

153
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:49,497
Were those words of encouragement?

154
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:51,266
It's good to hear them from you.

155
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:55,318
I can handle the landing.

156
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:58,974
But what do I do with all these monsters in back?

157
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:00,434
Hm.

158
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:02,449
Don't worry about that.

159
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,957
I have it all worked out, Natalia.

160
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:06,264
Hm?

161
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,525
I can always count on you.

162
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:13,064
50 more minutes till we get to the airport.

163
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:15,654
That's a little bit too long to spend praying.

164
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,807
Kid, keep me company for a while, okay?

165
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,283
I can do that.

166
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:52,353
Way back when you first said
you wanted to help me with my work,

167
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,949
I really didn't know how to respond.

168
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:58,953
You just didn't look ready to
relent no matter what I said.

169
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:03,432
So, I showed that little promise as a student?

170
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:05,395
No, it's not that.

171
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:07,430
You had a lot of potential.

172
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,970
Too much.

173
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,700
What does that mean?

174
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:15,074
The ability to pull a trigger to
kill regardless of your feelings

175
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:20,082
is a skill most killers take many years to fully develop.

176
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:23,157
You had that skill from the very start.

177
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,832
It's a hell of a gift.

178
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:32,409
But choosing your occupation based solely on your
talents doesn't necessarily guarantee your happiness.

179
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:38,564
If you think only of what you should do
and completely ignore what you want to do,

180
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:42,829
then you're just a simple machine, a force of nature.

181
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:45,793
That isn't how a human being should live.

182
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:49,033
I'm surprised.

183
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:52,674
You know, I always thought of you
as a much colder person than that.

184
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,376
What are you talking about? Of course I'm cold.

185
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:59,867
In all these years, have I ever
spoiled you or coddled you even once?

186
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:03,438
True, you've always been a rather strict teacher.

187
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,105
You never held anything back

188
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:08,291
and taught me what you could.

189
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,908
Under normal circumstances, training
a boy like you is the father's job.

190
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,170
But... well...

191
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:24,224
I'm afraid that in your case

192
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:27,552
I basically took away your
chance for that kind of upbringing.

193
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,160
Anyway, I...

194
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,848
I did feel a little bad about it.

195
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:38,084
This was the only way of life I knew how to teach you.

196
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:41,933
So you consider yourself my dad?

197
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:45,360
I'm a full‐grown woman, you rude little jerk.

198
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,391
At least call me mother.

199
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,211
You're right.

200
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:50,363
Sorry.

201
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:55,479
I spent an awfully long time on
my own in this bloody business.

202
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:59,885
So long that I even lost track
of the fact that I was alone.

203
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:04,843
But... it's been pretty entertaining in its own way,

204
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,327
having something like a family in my life.

205
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:08,945
For me too.

206
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:11,053
For all these years,

207
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:13,707
I did always think of you as a mother.

208
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:17,104
I was happy to have you.

209
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:23,827
Look, kid, I think we'd better quit saying stuff
that'll embarrass us next time we see each other, okay?

210
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:27,721
You're throwing me off my game.

211
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:30,258
I've got to land this thing in 20 minutes or so.

212
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:35,623
If I'm laughing over what we were just talking
about and screw up, I'll end up dead, you know?

213
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:39,677
Sorry, I'll stop.

214
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:47,304
You know, maybe I'm just getting too old for this job.

215
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:50,110
Maybe the reason I screwed up so badly

216
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,082
is because playing at having a
family made me lower my guard.

217
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:57,099
If that's true, I should walk away.

218
00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:59,567
Maybe it's time to retire.

219
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:02,319
If you quit this job,

220
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:04,246
what would you do with your life?

221
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:06,694
If I weren't working...

222
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,417
The only thing left for me to do

223
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:13,165
would be to really act like a mother, I guess.

224
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,282
Natalia, you are...

225
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:35,228
...my real family.

226
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:22,593
Did you see that, Shirley?

227
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,129
I killed someone again,

228
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:31,702
just like I did with my dad.

229
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:34,966
I didn't screw up like I did with you.

230
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,973
I saved an awful lot of lives.

231
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:42,395
If Natalia had landed that plane safely,

232
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,378
there's no telling how many people

233
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:47,910
might have died.

234
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:55,908
Her sacrifice prevented all of that.

235
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:58,356
So I...

236
00:20:59,147 --> 00:20:59,929
So I...

237
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:03,794
Shirley, I...

238
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:13,589
Shut your mouth.

239
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:14,843
Just shut up.

240
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:16,948
Bastard!

241
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:28,956
Tell me, Kerry,

242
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:31,306
what do you want to grow up to be?

243
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:34,368
I...

244
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:43,256
I want to...

245
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,794
Who are you?

246
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,348
What a bad joke.

247
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,962
How does the life you took from Sakura feel?

248
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:33,976
By my Command Seal, I order you!

249
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,340
You look focused just like you used to.

250
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:38,280
This is a battle that I got us into.

251
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:40,500
You know what, I'm really happy.
