1
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:16,121
Did you hate me?

2
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:20,014
Did you hate me so much that you became this?

3
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:37,209
Origin rounds. They cause the
target's mana to go out of control,

4
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,871
causing their body to rip itself apart.

5
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:42,394
What?

6
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:44,667
Time alter.

7
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:46,970
Double accel!

8
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:04,037
The origin rounds are working.

9
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:07,278
No, I understand.

10
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,488
He's using command seals as his mana source.

11
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:13,581
By the time the round strikes and takes effect,

12
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:16,542
the command seal mana source has already vanished.

13
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,194
Since he doesn't use his own magic circuits for attacks,

14
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,653
the origin rounds' magic won't work.

15
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,266
But if I can land a solid hit,

16
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:28,918
it'll still be strong enough to kill him.

17
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:33,403
Don't think you'll escape next time.

18
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:36,327
Now that I know you're moving at double speed,

19
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,923
I simply need to adjust the distance to compensate for it.

20
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:54,382
He's fast!

21
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:15,238
The depth of your violent madness...

22
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:20,942
...is that my fault as well?

23
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,114
Is it?

24
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,725
Is it my fault?

25
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:03,610
Time alter, double accel.

26
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,225
I'm at a massive disadvantage at close range.

27
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,292
I've lost my Calico.

28
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,373
My Contender needs reloading.

29
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,386
However, Avalon.

30
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:12,609
He has healing ability that allows him
to instantly regenerate a demolished heart?

31
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,808
Well then, I'll have to destroy the brain.

32
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,152
But I can't use my right arm.

33
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:22,473
Avalon will even work on self‐inflicted wounds.

34
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:26,402
I have a knife I can use and two grenades left.

35
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:31,111
I have 12 blades remaining and eight spare command seals.

36
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:32,582
Time alter.

37
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:34,697
Triple accel.

38
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:15,524
Time alter.

39
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:18,561
Square accel!

40
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:13,136
But, even so, I will win the Grail.

41
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:17,728
If I do not, there will be nothing I can do

42
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,654
to atone to you.

43
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:28,200
Even after all that has happened

44
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,964
you would still take up your sword

45
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,535
for a reason such as that?

46
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,500
What a difficult person you are.

47
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,138
Where am I?

48
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,201
I knew you would come, Kiritsugu.

49
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:13,068
I had faith that you would be the one to reach this place.

50
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:15,828
Iri.

51
00:09:16,195 --> 00:09:19,310
This is where the wish you have lived for will be granted.

52
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,885
We are inside the Grail that you have been seeking.

53
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:29,608
That is the Holy Grail.

54
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:31,660
It has yet to take form,

55
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:34,675
but the vessel itself is more than filled.

56
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:37,803
All you need do now is offer it your prayer.

57
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:42,490
Only then will it be able to
go out into the physical world.

58
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:47,698
Now, please, hurry and give the Grail its form!

59
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:54,078
Kiritsugu, you have proven yourself
more than worthy to define its existence.

60
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:57,877
Who are you, really?

61
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:00,561
I am Irisviel, as you see.

62
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,374
No.

63
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:04,245
If the Grail is prepared to receive a wish,

64
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:05,983
then she is already...

65
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:09,251
Answer me!

66
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,124
It's true.

67
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:14,406
I will not deny that this is no more than a mask.

68
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:20,299
You see, unless I use a
preexisting personality as a shell,

69
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,661
I cannot communicate with others.

70
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:26,518
However, the personality of Irisviel that I recorded

71
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:28,613
is undeniably the real thing.

72
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:33,665
And so I have inherited the last
wish that Irisviel held in her heart.

73
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,295
Are you the will of the Holy Grail?

74
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:40,563
I am, that interpretation is not incorrect.

75
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:44,157
I have my own will and my own wish.

76
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:47,107
I have the will to be born into the world.

77
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:48,422
No way.

78
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,719
If that's the case, then how does the Grail

79
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:54,168
intend to totally fulfill my wish?

80
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:57,877
Well, Kiritsugu, that is something

81
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,565
that you should know far better

82
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:02,645
than anyone else could possibly know.

83
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,546
What?

84
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:07,063
You learned exactly how to save the world

85
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:09,165
a long, long time ago.

86
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:12,991
So I will do exactly as you always did...

87
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:17,487
to carry out your will and to
ultimately answer your prayer.

88
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,775
What are you talking about?

89
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,245
I have no choice.

90
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:28,912
The only way is to have you go and explore
that same question through your inner self.

91
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:35,908
This is...

92
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:41,047
Three hundred are on one ship,

93
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:43,542
200 on another.

94
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:45,445
What the...

95
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,871
hundred total Five passengers
and crew, plus Kiritsugu Emiya.

96
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:53,525
Let's assume that these 501 people

97
00:11:53,852 --> 00:11:55,745
are humanity's last survivors.

98
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:00,618
Giant holes simultaneously open
up in both ships, crippling them.

99
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:04,582
Kiritsugu alone has the skills needed to repair a ship.

100
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:09,305
Now then, which one of the ships would you choose to fix?

101
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:13,435
Simple... the one holding 300 people.

102
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,594
As soon as you make that decision,

103
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,438
the 200 passengers on the other ship

104
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:20,777
kidnap you and take you prisoner.

105
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:24,234
They demand that you fix their ship first.

106
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:25,978
What will you do?

107
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:28,661
I would...

108
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,742
You would kill all 200 passengers.

109
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:02,431
That is correct, that is the Kiritsugu Emiya we know.

110
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:11,169
Next, the surviving 300 passengers
abandon their damaged craft.

111
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:15,114
They split themselves between two
new ships and continue their journey.

112
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:18,338
This time, there are 200 on one,

113
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,068
and 100 on the other.

114
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:24,489
But again, holes open the hulls of both ships

115
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,329
at exactly the same time.

116
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:28,504
Wait.

117
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,350
The hundred in the smaller ship take you prisoner,

118
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:34,538
and like the others, demand that you fix their ship first.

119
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:36,972
Now what will you do?

120
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:39,856
You already know, but you...

121
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:58,912
Yes, you made the right decision.

122
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,130
No, that's impossible!

123
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:02,747
How can that be the right decision?

124
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:07,152
Two hundred survived, but 300 died so they could live.

125
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:09,478
The scales are tipped the wrong way!

126
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:12,506
No, your calculations were correct.

127
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:16,358
You made a choice to sacrifice the few to save the many.

128
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:20,044
Isn't that right, Kiritsugu Emiya?

129
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:24,694
You have consistently chosen to kill
those in the lighter side of the scales,

130
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:29,788
even if it meant leaving a long
trail of bodies behind you in your wake.

131
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:32,627
If it saved lives, the lives of the saved

132
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,149
must've been worth more than those you destroyed.

133
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:39,443
This...

134
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:42,151
this is what you wanted to show me?

135
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:44,597
Yes, this is your truth.

136
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,796
The answer that lies within Kiritsugu Emiya.

137
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,916
The course of action that should be taken by the Grail

138
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:52,776
as an all‐powerful wish‐granter.

139
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:53,495
No.

140
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,692
No, this is not what I want!

141
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:58,898
I want there to be another way to save the world.

142
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:00,784
That's why I believed

143
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:04,018
that a miracle was my only hope.

144
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:06,120
Your wish cannot include

145
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:08,915
a method you yourself don't already know.

146
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,456
If your wish is the save the world,

147
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,002
it must be done in a manner that you can fully comprehend.

148
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:17,344
Like hell!

149
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:21,430
How in the hell can you call that a miracle?

150
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:23,750
But it is.

151
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:27,643
The deed you tried so hard to accomplish

152
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:29,765
and failed to do on your own

153
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,668
can be accomplished on a scale
beyond the power of any man.

154
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:37,227
If that is not a miracle, what is?

155
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,049
Father.

156
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:53,388
Natalia.

157
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,591
Kiritsugu Emiya.

158
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:01,339
You truly are Angra Mainyu...

159
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,423
the one worthy to bear all the evil in the world.

160
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:08,920
Now, the final question.

161
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,460
Three remain.

162
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:20,909
Will you save two or choose one?

163
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,553
Welcome home, Daddy!

164
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:38,839
Oh, I'm so happy that you're finally back!

165
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:42,754
You understand now, right?

166
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:47,904
This is all the Holy Grail
granting your heart's fervent prayer.

167
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:54,550
All you need do now is to wish for it,

168
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:58,874
to bring back your wife, to take back your daughter.

169
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:11,061
I won't be able to go looking
for chestnuts with you anymore.

170
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,287
It's okay, don't worry about it!

171
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:18,115
I'll be happy just as long as you
and Mother are with me from now on.

172
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:19,319
Thank you.

173
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:23,531
Daddy loves you, my precious Ilya.

174
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:26,528
If nothing else, I swear that's true.

175
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,336
Goodbye, Ilya.

176
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:40,061
Ilya!

177
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,125
Ilya!

178
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,570
Ilya, Ilya!

179
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:44,143
Ilya!

180
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:45,468
Ilya.

181
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:48,390
But why?

182
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,239
Why would you do this?

183
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,119
My love, you killed our Ilya!

184
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,834
My love...

185
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:03,629
why?

186
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,403
Why do you...refuse us...

187
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:11,556
and the Grail?

188
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:17,699
Six billion people on the Earth.

189
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:18,900
I...

190
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,522
curse you...

191
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:24,400
Kiritsugu Emiya.

192
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:26,529
Versus you two.

193
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,297
Angra Mainyu curses you.

194
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:31,328
That's why.

195
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,032
You'll suffer...

196
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:34,858
That's why...

197
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:35,854
...till the day you die.

198
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,828
...I have to kill you.

199
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:39,816
I will...

200
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:41,747
And I will save...

201
00:18:42,473 --> 00:18:43,861
the world.

202
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,591
Never forget...

203
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,839
What a boring conclusion to this fight.

204
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,327
Why did you refuse it?

205
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,880
You were able to see all that?

206
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,940
I thought you sacrificed everything you had
including your family in order to make it to this point.

207
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:31,938
How can you simply deny the worth of
something you worked so hard to attain?

208
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,469
It's so foolish, I cannot understand it.

209
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,432
The tremendous toll it demands

210
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,621
is far greater than anything it can offer.

211
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,824
That's the simple truth.

212
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,845
That thing is no omnipotent wish‐granter.

213
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:49,961
Then give the damn thing to me!

214
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,040
You may not think you need it,

215
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,304
but I most certainly do.

216
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:58,351
If it... if it is given the life it is seeking,

217
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,039
then it can surely answer my every doubt

218
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,519
and finally bring everything into clarity.

219
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,195
The Grail longs for a life of its own,

220
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,942
longs for its own birth!

221
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:10,969
Please, don't kill it,

222
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,210
it's...

223
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:22,195
No, you are the fool I can't understand.

224
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,145
Oh, Iris, you...

225
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:38,125
You're late, Saber!

226
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,942
I realized you were enjoying
yourself with your old Mad Dog,

227
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:45,970
but it is imprudent to the extreme
to keep me waiting like you did.

228
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,213
Archer.

229
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,220
Look at that delightful expression,

230
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,084
like that of a ravenous wild dog.

231
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:56,803
Get out of my way.

232
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,071
You haven't won.

233
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,294
The Holy Grail belongs to me!

234
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,981
Dear Saber, it is when you are
delusional and crawling in the dirt

235
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,433
that you are at your most beautiful.

236
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,257
Lay down your blade and be my wife.

237
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:21,331
A Grail that grants miracles?

238
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,861
Where is the sense in totally
obsessing over something so dubious?

239
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,106
Abandon these foolish ideals and childish vows of yours.

240
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:34,977
From now on, seek only me and devote yourself to me alone.

241
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,236
If you do, I swear as King of All Creation

242
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,000
that I shall give you every
pleasure the world has to offer.

243
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,923
You would steal the Holy Grail from me

244
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,318
for such utter nonsense?

245
00:21:54,136 --> 00:21:56,302
I was not asking for your opinion.

246
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,200
I am informing you of my decision.

247
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,151
Now, let us hear your response.

248
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,025
I refuse.

249
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:06,740
I would never...

250
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,508
Shyness has left you at a loss for words, I see.

251
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:11,907
That's fine.

252
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,971
You may answer wrongly as many times as you like.

253
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:17,408
If you would learn the joy of serving me,

254
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,166
you must first learn the exquisite pain of it as well.

255
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,292
Kiritsugu!

256
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,033
Ah, then you have finally made your decision.

257
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,719
In the name of Kiritsugu Emiya,

258
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:43,011
and by my command seal...

259
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:45,897
Give me the Holy Grail.

260
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:49,056
...I order you, use your Noble Phantasm.

261
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:51,632
Destroy the Grail.

262
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,104
Impossible... what are you doing, Saber!

263
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:00,213
No!

264
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,665
By my third command seal,

265
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,139
I order you again.

266
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:09,423
But why, Kiritsugu... you of all people?

267
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:10,429
Why this?

268
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,796
Damn you to Hell.

269
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:14,350
You dare interrupt my nuptials?

270
00:23:14,513 --> 00:23:15,417
Mongrel!

271
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:17,836
Saber, destroy...

272
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,990
Stop!

273
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:22,169
...the Holy Grail.

274
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,885
I remember the look on his face,

275
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,879
the tears in his eyes...

276
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:06,055
a man filled with joy from the bottom of his heart.

277
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:08,406
I felt jealous of him.

278
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,499
He said, "Thank you."
