1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,750
- ( woman singing opera )

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,583
- ( gunshot )

3
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,916
- ( screaming )

4
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,875
- DECENT VOICE, I GUESS,

5
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,083
BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY
DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

6
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,750
THE ONLY TRUE SOURCE OF MUSIC

7
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,875
IS ORCHESTRA.

8
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,333
AMEN.

9
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,958
WELL,
WE GOT A LIVE ONE, DO WE?

10
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,291
- ( whimpering )

11
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,000
- THAT SOUND'S MUSIC
TO MY EARS.

12
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,541
- ( theme music playing )

13
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,083
- ( panting )

14
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,416
- I GOT A VISUAL.
GRAB 'EM NOW?

15
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
- NO, FLANK THEM.
WE'LL USE THE CAR AS A SHIELD.

16
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,375
- LOOKS LIKE WE GOT SOME LIVELY
NEW PLAYERS IN THE PIT.

17
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,958
- GUESS I'LL HAVE TO STEP ON IT.

18
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:57,958
- A NEGEV?
HE HAS A NEGEV LMG?

19
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,500
FINE.


20
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,291
LET'S DO THIS, ORCHESTRA.


21
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,833
- HIT THE TIRES.
- YEAH, NO SHIT.  I'M TRYING.

22
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,708
- KEEP RUNNING, BOSS LADY.

23
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,041
- HIT THE CODA ONCE MORE,

24
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,416
THEN I THINK IT'S TIME
WE WRAP THIS SHOW UP.

25
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,125
- TOTALLY.

26
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,750
- GOOD LORD.

27
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,708
DAMN IT.  KOKO, LISTEN UP.

28
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,625
THEY'VE GOT AN M-2
BROWNING MACHINE GUN

29
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,291
MOUNTED INSIDE THAT VEHICLE.

30
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,166
- WHAT?  ARE THEY CRAZY?

31
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,958
- Chinatsu: STILL WISH I DIDN'T
HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE CUTE BOY.

32
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,500
HIS FRIENDS
ARE JOINING HIM, THOUGH,

33
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,666
SO AT LEAST
HE'LL HAVE COMPANY.

34
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,416
- R, CONCENTRATE FIRE
ON THE ENGINE BLOCK.

35
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,291
THEY'LL DO THEIR BEST
TO FORCE YOU OUT OF THE WAY.

36
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,083
- ENSEMBLE.

37
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,708
- FIRE.

38
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,000
- BRACE FOR IMPACT.
- YEAH, NO SHIT.

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,291
- WHAT?!

40
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,125
- HURRY, IT MIGHT BLOW.

41
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,416
- SON OF A BITCH.

42
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,000
- ( gunfire )

43
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,625
- DAMN IT.
LITTLE SHIT IS STILL ALIVE.

44
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,333
AND THAT'S GOTTA MEAN 
HIS LADY BOSS IS, TOO.

45
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,416
- GET BACK!

46
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,041
NO, MY HAT.

47
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,375
MAESTRO, WE GOTTA SCRUB
THE OPERATION.

48
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,416
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

49
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,916
LET'S PULL BACK
AND TRY AGAIN LATER.

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,583
- HUH?  RUN JUST BECAUSE
YOUR HAT GOT SHOT UP?

51
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,333
WASTING YOUR TIME
ON SUPERSTITION.

52
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,583
I SHOULD HAVE
THROWN IT AWAY.  UGH!

53
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,125
- MAESTRO!

54
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,666
SNIPER.

55
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,208
- HEART SHOT.  HIT.

56
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,291
TARGET WILL FALL TO HIS KNEES.

57
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:44,166
HEAD SHOT.  AIM.  FIRE.

58
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,500
HEAD SHOT.

59
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,500
HIT.

60
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,875
- ( screaming )

61
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,291
- THE GAP BETWEEN REPORT AND
IMPACT INDICATES A SHOT FIRED

62
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,250
FROM ROUGHLY 900 METERS AWAY.

63
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,791
MOST LIKELY USING
A .338 LAPUA MAGNUM.

64
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,375
IT WAS LUTZ'S SHOT.

65
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,291
NOW TO SEE IF CHINATSU
ENTERS HIS LINE OF SIGHT.

66
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,333
- NO.
NO, THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

67
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,750
YOU GAVE ME A NEW LIFE,
MAESTRO.

68
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,291
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME NOW.
YOU CAN'T.

69
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,750
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

70
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,458
- LUTZ, ORDER IS
TO PULL BACK.

71
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,458
- WHAT?
WE STILL HAVE ONE TARGET LEFT.

72
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,291
- YEAH, BUT THAT LITTLE GIRL
HAS THE REFLEXES OF A CAT.

73
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,666
BESIDES,
EVEN IF YOU GOT A BEAD ON HER,

74
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,583
WOULD YOU REALLY SHOOT?

75
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,291
- I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.
HEAR ME?  I'LL KILL YOU ALL.

76
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,000
- WAIT, A HIT MAN
WANTS ME DEAD?

77
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,750
- NOT NOW.  IN A FEW DAYS
OR MAYBE A FEW MONTHS.

78
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,166
NO, BETTER IF I TAKE MY TIME.
- SHE IS LOSING IT.

79
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,875
- I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN AND RIP YOU
APART PIECE BY PIECE!

80
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,625
- HE HAS THE SHOT NOW.
- Lutz: A GIRL?

81
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,750
SHE'S JUST A KID.

82
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,041
- WE CAN'T ELIMINATE TARGET TWO,
BUT WE CAN DESTROY HER WEAPONS.

83
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,291
DO IT, LUTZ.

84
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,416
- OH.
- SHE'S QUICK.  DAMN!

85
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,708
- ( horn honks )

86
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,166
- GOODBYE, MAESTRO.

87
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,000
- WHAT THE HELL?

88
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,541
THAT GIRL,

89
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,958
SHE WASN'T WEARING PANTIES.

90
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,875
- ( siren wailing )

91
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,416
- HEY, THERE.

92
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,458
DON'T WASTE TIME
PUTTING UP A FIGHT.

93
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:59,875
KOKO HEKMATYAR, LOOKS LIKE WE
CAUGHT YOU RED-HANDED THIS TIME.

94
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,333
- CAUGHT ME DOING WHAT?

95
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,708
- PLAYING DUMB
WON'T DO ANY GOOD.

96
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,333
I PERSONALLY WITNESSED
THE ENTIRE GUNFIGHT.

97
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,166
- YOU MAY HAVE A POLICE OFFICER
WITH YOU, BUT YOU'RE NO COP.

98
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,666
WHO ARE YOU?
- OH, NOBODY SPECIAL.

99
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,750
I'M JUST A CITIZEN.

100
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,750
YOU'VE HEARD OF
A CITIZEN'S ARREST, I ASSUME.

101
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,208
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

102
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,208
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THE PLAY, KOKO?

103
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,333
- NO PLAY.  SHE'S COMING 
WITH ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT.

104
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,625
HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR SWIM.
TAKE CARE.

105
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,208
TELL YOUR GUARDS TO STAND DOWN
AND WE'LL--

106
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,166
- HUH?  WHAT WAS THAT?

107
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,916
YOUR SIGNAL
FOR STRATEGIC RETREAT?

108
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,166
LEARN SOMETHING EVERY DAY.

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,916
WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING
IN INTERROGATION?

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,666
EXTREMELY POOR MANNERS, BRO.

111
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,916
I SO HELPED YOU GUYS OUT TODAY.

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,416
- YOU USED PHYSICAL FORCE
ON ONE OF MY OFFICERS

113
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,875
WHILE HE WAS ATTEMPTING
TO PERFORM HIS DUTIES.

114
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,791
WE FIND THAT KIND OF
BEHAVIOR UNACCEPTABLE,

115
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,375
AS WOULD MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES, I'M SURE.

116
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,000
WE'LL LET YOU OFF WITH
A WARNING THIS TIME,

117
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,791
PROVIDED YOU CAN OFFER PROOF
THAT YOU REALLY ARE

118
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,750
AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.

119
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,458
AH, AMERICAN, I SEE.

120
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,208
- I SURE AM.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

121
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,291
- COULD YOU VERIFY YOUR NAME,
PLEASE?

122
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,916
- I'M JERRY SCHATZBERG.
HAH!  KIDDING.

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,208
MY HANDLE IS SCARECROW.

124
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,708
THAT'S HOW YOU CAN REFER
TO ME IN YOUR PAPERWORK, OKAY?

125
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,708
ACTUALLY, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT THE PAPERWORK.

126
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,583
IT'S THE ARMS DEALER
I'M INTERESTED IN.

127
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,583
HAND OVER KOKO HEKMATYAR
AND ANYTHING YOU'VE GOT ON HER,

128
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,833
ESPECIALLY FROM TODAY
LIKE FOOTAGE OF THE SHOOTOUT.

129
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,916
- WHAT SHOOTOUT?

130
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,916
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,125
- WHAT?

132
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,250
- Koko: THANK YOU FOR THE SHOWER
AND CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

133
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,250
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.
- THAT MAKES ONE OF US.

134
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,625
- AW, YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL?
I'M SORRY.  IS IT A COLD?

135
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,125
- NO, NOT A COLD.
MORE LIKE A HEADACHE.

136
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,875
YOU MADE QUITE A SCENE.

137
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,000
THAT LITTLE SKIRMISH ATTRACTED
SOME UNWANTED ATTENTION.

138
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,083
YOU KNOW CIA AGENT SCARECROW?

139
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,666
- YEAH, WE'VE MET.

140
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,333
HE'S IN A NON-COMBAT ZONE,

141
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:18,166
SO HE'S PROBABLY BROKE,
LOOKING FOR A NEW BACKER.

142
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,333
PERSISTENT, IS HE?
- OH, YEAH.

143
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,708
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE HIM?
- VERY MUCH SO.

144
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,375
- IT WILL BE HARD TO COVER
THIS UP AND EXPENSIVE.

145
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,916
WE LOST MEN, YOU KNOW?

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,708
SOME OFFICERS HAVE YOUR
BODYGUARDS IN CUSTODY.

147
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,375
THEY'RE BEING HELD
IN A LOCAL HOTEL.

148
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,375
A SLAP ON THE WRIST
TO HELP ME SAVE FACE.

149
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,375
HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

150
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,750
- NOW THAT JUST HURTS.

151
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,375
- GIVE MY REGARDS
TO YOUR FATHER.

152
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,833
- YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH
OF THE GUNFIGHT RECORDED

153
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,416
TO MAKE A WHOLE
FREAKIN' ACTION MOVIE.

154
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,833
THIS CITY IS COVERED
IN SECURITY CAMERAS.

155
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,041
- GET OFF THE DESK NOW
OR I WILL SHOOT YOU.

156
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,833
- CAN'T BELIEVE THIS BULLSHIT.

157
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,125
WHAT KIND OF SHENANIGANS
YOU TRYING TO PULL?

158
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,458
'CAUSE WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK ON ME.

159
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,875
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?
WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?

160
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,750
NOW I GET IT.

161
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,833
- Officer: WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.
SIT BACK DOWN.

162
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,083
- GET THE HELL OFF OF ME.
- WAIT!  UGH!

163
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,958
- COME ON,
WHERE ARE YOU, BACK DOOR?

164
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:21,125
HEKMATYAR,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

165
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,583
- OH, IT'S YOU.  HEY.
- PLAYING NICE NOW?

166
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,333
AND YOU'VE EVEN GOT THE BALLS TO
MARCH RIGHT OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

167
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,958
YOU MADE ME LOOK LIKE
AN IDIOT TODAY.

168
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,583
I DON'T APPRECIATE THAT.
- GRAB HIM!

169
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,375
TIGHTER!
- YEAH, I'M TRYING.

170
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,583
- ( Scarecrow laughing )

171
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,875
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE
ON A GNAT LIKE YOU.

172
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,166
- SUCH ARROGANCE.
GO AHEAD, ENJOY YOUR MONEY

173
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,791
AND YOUR POWER WHILE YOU CAN.

174
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,916
PRISON WOULD BE TOO GOOD
FOR YOU ANYWAY.

175
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,166
YOU HEAR ME?
I'M GONNA HUNT YOU DOWN.

176
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,625
AND WHEN I FIND YOU, I'LL TEAR
YOU APART, LIMB FROM LIMB.

177
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,458
- GET IN LINE.

178
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,958
YOU'RE THE SECOND PERSON TODAY
WHO'S TOLD ME THAT.

179
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,750
- Chinatsu:
RIP YOU APART PIECE BY PIECE!

180
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,333
- Police chief: SOME OFFICERS
HAVE YOUR BODYGUARDS IN CUSTODY.

181
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,791
- Koko:
I'M A SITTING DUCK OUT HERE.

182
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,250
- ( gasps )

183
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,291
YOU!

184
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,708
- YEAH, ME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE?

185
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,833
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY PUNCHED YOU.

186
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,625
- THAT ASSHOLE FROM BEFORE.

187
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,208
NOTHING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

188
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,208
THE POLICE COMMANDER TOLD ME YOU
GUYS WERE BEING HELD

189
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,125
IN SOME HOTEL.
STILL WET, AWESOME.

190
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,541
- THEY DIDN'T KEEP ME.  I'M
YOUNG AND INNOCENT, YOU KNOW?

191
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,291
- PURE AS THE DRIVEN SNOW.
YEAH, THAT'S YOU.

192
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,916
WELL, SHALL WE GO?

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,875
GOOD.
ONWARD HO, OFFICER JONAH.

194
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,041
YOU'RE A NICE KID,
YOU KNOW THAT?

195
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,500
YOU CAME DOWN TO THE STATION

196
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,166
BECAUSE YOU WANTED 
TO LOOK OUT FOR ME.

197
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,958
- NICE KIDS DON'T SHOOT PEOPLE
IN THE FACE.

198
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,583
- THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.

199
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,833
- THESE DAYS, EVEN SAINTS
GO AROUND WITH WEAPONS,

200
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,875
PREACHING GOD'S LOVE
TO THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

201
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,291
IN THE END, IT'S ALL ABOUT
WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN,

202
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,583
WHAT MAKES YOU PULL
THAT TRIGGER.

203
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,333
IMAGINE SOMETHING FOR ME.

204
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,208
YOUR BULLETS ARE HARD SHELLS,

205
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,791
CONCEALING WITHIN THEM
THE KINDNESS OF YOUR SOUL.

206
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:29,041
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU UNLIKE
ANY OTHER SOLDIER I'VE MET.

207
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,083
IT BAFFLES ME.

208
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,958
HOW DO YOU HAVE
ANY KINDNESS LEFT

209
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,083
AFTER EVERYTHING YOU'VE ENDURED?

210
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,708
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, DON'T YOU
DESPISE ALL ARMS DEALERS?

211
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:41,458
- EXCEPT FOR YOU.
YOU'RE OKAY.

212
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,541
- OH, I'M THE ONLY ONE
YOU DON'T HATE, AM I?

213
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,875
WHAT AN HONOR,
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

214
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,250
I'M JUST LIKE EVERY
OTHER DEALER OUT THERE.

215
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,875
THINKING OTHERWISE IS NAIVE
AND DANGEROUS,

216
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,958
ESPECIALLY IF IT
MAKES YOU HESITATE

217
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,916
BEFORE PULLING THE TRIGGER.

218
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,708
THE WORLD WE LIVE IN DOESN'T
HAVE MUCH ROOM FOR KINDNESS.

219
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:04,708
THE UN HAS A LIST CALLED THE
MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS.

220
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:09,500
A 189 COUNTRIES WORKING TO END
POVERTY AND SUCH BY 2015.

221
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,875
CONSIDER GOALS TWO AND FOUR.

222
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,625
ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL
PRIMARY EDUCATION

223
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,916
AND DECREASE
THE CHILD MORTALITY RATE.

224
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,333
THESE GOALS ALONE WILL COST
A PROJECTED $220 BILLION.

225
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,333
FAR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT SPENT
ANNUALLY ON WEAPONS WORLDWIDE.

226
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,375
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

227
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,166
THESE PEOPLE CARE MORE ABOUT WAR
THAN OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURES.

228
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,125
- BUT THAT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS,
RIGHT?

229
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,708
- AND I SHOULD BE HAPPY MY GOODS
ARE SELLING SO WELL?

230
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,750
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.
IT'S WEIRD, THOUGH.

231
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,500
SEE, BEING AN ARMS DEALER GIVES
ME AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE.

232
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,833
I CAN SEE CONTRADICTIONS
OTHERS MISS.

233
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,833
SO I UNDERSTAND
THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS

234
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,375
BETTER THAN
MOST PEOPLE DO.

235
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,458
YOU MAY BELIEVE ME
OR YOU MAY NOT,

236
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,958
BUT HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU.

237
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,875
WHAT GROUP OF PEOPLE OWNS
THE MAJORITY OF GUNS?

238
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,583
- MILITARY, DUH.
- SORRY, THAT'S WRONG.

239
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,458
IT'S CIVILIANS.  YEP.

240
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,833
60% OF ALL THE GUNS
IN THE WORLD ARE OWNED

241
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,166
BY ORDINARY CITIZENS.
AS FOR THE REST OF THEM,

242
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,250
37% BELONG
TO VARIOUS MILITARIES

243
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,708
AND A FRACTION TO THE POLICE.

244
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,666
YOU KNOW THOSE REBEL ARMIES
THE MEDIA SALIVATES OVER?

245
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,083
THEY DON'T EVEN POSSESS .1%
OF THE GUNS IN THE WORLD.

246
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,791
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE?

247
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,958
A NORMAL PERSON WITH A GUN WILL
WIND UP DOING SOMETHING

248
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,333
HE NEVER THOUGHT HIMSELF
CAPABLE OF.

249
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,541
NOBODY IN THIS WORLD CAN TRULY
HOLD HIMSELF SEPARATE

250
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,541
FROM VIOLENCE.

251
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,625
GUNS ARE LITERALLY
WITHIN REACH OF ANYONE.

252
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,291
SADLY, THAT'S WHERE
WE PUT OUR FAITH,

253
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,250
IN BULLETS
RATHER THAN HUMAN KINDNESS.

254
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,166
YOU KNOW, JONAH,
I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE

255
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,958
OR ANY OF THE OTHERS, OF COURSE.

256
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,500
- THEN DO US ALL A FAVOR

257
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,541
AND STAY AWAY
FROM ASSASSINS FROM NOW ON.

258
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,916
CATS MAY HAVE NINE LIVES,
BUT I DON'T.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,875
- ( laughs )
SORRY, I DON'T MEAN TO LAUGH.

260
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,041
YOU'RE JUST SO RIGHT.
FORGIVE ME?

261
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,041
- Koko: STOP THERE.

262
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,416
THE SECOND YOU AIM THAT GUN
AT ME, YOU'RE DEAD.

263
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,416
- THIS GUY MUST BE BETTER
THAN THE ONE YOU USED YESTERDAY.

264
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:54,291
I CAN'T EVEN TELL FOR SURE
WHICH DIRECTION HE'S IN.

265
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,708
FINE, I YIELD.

266
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,041
- YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

267
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,041
WHAT, YOU THINK THIS
IS SOME COURTLY DUEL?

268
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,375
IT WAS ALWAYS A GAME
OF CHANCE, NOTHING MORE.

269
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,125
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

270
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,166
I GUESSED YOU'D WAIT THREE DAYS
AND THEN TRY THE ROOF

271
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,791
AND NOW HERE WE ARE.
MY BET PAID OFF.

272
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,375
A DAY LATER
AND WE MIGHT HAVE GONE,

273
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,125
LEAVING YOU FREE
TO HUNT ME DOWN,

274
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,958
SO THANK YOU
BECAUSE I WANTED TO CHAT.

275
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,791
- HUH?
- CHINATSU,

276
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,916
WHAT IS UP WITH
THE NO PANTIES THING?

277
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,750
- YOU BITCH!

278
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,000
YOU'RE JUST SCREWING WITH ME.

279
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,583
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

280
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,583
I DON'T EXPECT SOMETHING
FOR NOTHING.

281
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,750
IF YOU TELL ME WHAT I WANT
TO KNOW,

282
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,583
THEN I'LL ANSWER THE QUESTION
YOU ASKED WHEN WE FIRST MET.

283
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,250
I'LL TELL YOU WHY I STAY
IN THIS BUSINESS,

284
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,750
EVEN THOUGH IT WILL PROBABLY
KILL ME IN THE END.

285
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,833
- IT WAS THE FIRST JOB I WORKED
AS PART OF ORCHESTRA.

286
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,000
WE HAD TO CROSS A RIVER
TO GET TO THE TARGET'S HOUSE.

287
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,875
WALKING AROUND IN WET UNDERWEAR
FELT DISGUSTING

288
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,166
SO I DECIDED TO TAKE THEM OFF.

289
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,166
MY AIM WAS UNUSUALLY GOOD
DURING THAT FIGHT.

290
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,375
MAESTRO WAS SO PROUD.

291
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,625
I TOOK OUT MORE GUYS
THAN HE DID.

292
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,041
- NOT WEARING PANTIES
INCREASES YOUR ACCURACY?

293
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,541
( laughing )
- YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

294
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,541
- AWESOME STORY.  AND NOW?

295
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,625
- YES, I'M FUCKING
WEARING SOME NOW.

296
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,416
- ALL RIGHT, MY TURN.

297
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,375
- YOU'RE ONE FRIGHTENING WOMAN.

298
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,875
- YEAH, BUT I ADMIT,
I DO FIND YOU INTERESTING.

299
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,708
YOU COULD JOIN MY CREW.
YOU WANT TO?

300
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,583
- NO WAY.  I COULDN'T EVEN WAIT
THREE WHOLE DAYS.

301
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,416
I KNOW I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

302
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,833
I AM ORCHESTRA.
I AM AN ARTIST.

303
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,916
WHEN I PLAY,
IT IS A SYMPHONY OF DEATH.

304
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,625
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME,
ARMS DEALER.

305
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,750
I WILL NEVER WORK FOR YOU.

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,208
THE-- THE SKY.

307
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,958
SO BEAUTIFUL.

308
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,833
I NEVER KNEW,
BUT HOW COULD I?

309
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,458
I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN
AT THE GROUND.

310
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,166
SHE'S A...

311
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,208
MONSTER.

312
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,250
- HUH?  HEY, LUTZ.

313
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,916
YOU WERE WATCHING?

314
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
SO YOU SAW THAT NASTY
LITTLE DISPLAY, HUH?

315
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,083
"HOW COULD YOU KILL
A YOUNG GIRL LIKE HER?"

316
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,833
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
TO ASK ME, ISN'T IT?

317
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,166
IT'S SIMPLE.

318
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,583
I'VE LOST A LOT OF COMRADES
OVER THE YEARS.

319
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,541
BUT YOU KNOW,

320
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,250
FIVE OF THEM WERE TO A SOLDIER
JUST LIKE THAT CHICKIE.

321
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,583
IT'S A CYCLE.  YOU KILL SOMEONE,
SOMEONE KILLS YOU.

322
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,666
DO ME A FAVOR, WHEN IT'S MY
TURN TO GO, DON'T AVENGE ME.

323
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,875
- SORRY, KID.  IF IT HELPS, YOU
DID MANAGE TO RUIN MY VACATION.

324
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,875
COMMANDER.  RIGHT.

325
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,458
YES, I KNOW IT'S LATE.

326
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,791
I JUST FINISHED KILLING
OFF ORCHESTRA.

327
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,583
ON THE ROOF.
YES, WE SNIPED THEM.

328
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,250
I APPRECIATE IT.
WHAT'S THAT?

329
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,916
OF COURSE, SIR,

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,916
I CAN GET YOU A GREAT DEAL
ON A SNIPER INSTRUCTOR.

331
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,791
NOT ONE OF MY TEAM, BUT STILL
QUALITY, I ASSURE YOU.

332
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,333
RIGHT.  GOOD.

333
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,916
PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS
WITH YOU.

334
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,541
