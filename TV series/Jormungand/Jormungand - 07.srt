1
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,625
- Koko: PROFESSOR MINAMI AMADA,
A.K.A. DR. MIAMI.

2
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,291
SHE SPECIALIZES IN ROBOTICS,

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,333
AND THE STUFF SHE WORKS ON
PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,458
GETS CONVERTED
FOR MILITARY USE.

5
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,208
- YOU ARE KOKO HEKMATYAR?
I AM GUOMING CHEN.

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,916
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,458
- OUR MISSION IS TO SECURE
THIS WOMAN, DR. MIAMI.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,583
AND IF ANYBODY OUT HERE
TRIES TO GET IN OUR WAY, WELL,

9
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,500
WE ELIMINATE 'EM, BOYS.

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,041
- Karen: I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE DAMN DOCTOR.

11
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,458
IT'S HEKMATYAR'S PEOPLE I WANT.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,291
I'LL SLAUGHTER THEM ALL
AND AVENGE THE MEN

13
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,416
WHOSE LIVES KASPER STOLE.

14
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,750
- VALMET?
- WHA--

15
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,500
WHY THE HELL
DID SHE BREAK RANKS?

16
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,625
- Lehm: EVERYONE,
COVER VALMET!

17
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,958
- ( knives stabbing )

18
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,875
- A WOLF IS COMING.

19
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:19,833
- ( theme music playing )

20
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

21
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,291
- DELICIOUS!

22
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,458
THIS IS THE BEST EGG ROLL EVER.

23
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,500
- I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE ENJOYING IT.

24
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,625
THEY COMBINE SHRIMP
CAUGHT IN ST. FRANCIS

25
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,708
WITH THE FRESHEST VEGETABLES

26
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,541
TO MAKE THEIR EGG ROLLS
SUPERIOR.

27
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:03,208
- OOH! AND THIS SPRING ROLL--
CRISPY, BUT STILL CHEWY.

28
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,791
- WE'RE ONLY JUST BEGINNING.
IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL,

29
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,083
YOU'LL FILL UP
ON APPETIZERS ALONE.

30
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,000
- UGO, WOULDN'T IT BE AWESOME
TO BRING THE WHOLE CREW HERE?

31
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,958
- HUH?
YES, CERTAINLY.

32
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,416
- PLEASE, FEEL FREE
TO HELP YOURSELF.

33
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,541
- UH, NO THANK YOU,
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

34
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,875
NOT FOR THIS CRAP.
- I WISH JONAH COULD TRY THIS.

35
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,791
I'D LOVE TO SEE HIS FACE.
HE'S MISSIN' OUT.

36
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:28,958
- SORRY, MS. HEKMATYAR DOES NOT
CARE FOR WINE THIS EVENING.

37
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,625
( thinking ) THE BOSS LADY
IS AN UGLY DRUNK.

38
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,625
- ABSTAINING FROM ALCOHOL?
HOW ADMIRABLE.

39
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,041
- ( Scarecrow laughs )

40
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,625
EH, HOW BORING!
FOOD AND BOOZE.

41
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,250
DON'T THEY HAVE ANYTHING
MORE INTERESTING

42
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,458
TO TALK ABOUT OVER DINNER?

43
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,541
SCHOKOLADE, COME ON.

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,208
WE NEED TO RECORD THEM
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING JUICY.

45
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,916
- WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT IT?

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,833
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN CONTROL
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

47
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,541
- WELL,
WHAT DO WE HAVE SO FAR?

48
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,833
ONE USELESS PHOTO OF THEM
OUT IN THE HALLWAY.

49
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,041
AND THEN IT'S STRAIGHT
INTO THE V.I.P. ROOM.

50
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,333
YOU DIDN'T FIGURE THEY'D
BE GIVEN SPECIAL TREATMENT HERE?

51
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,166
WHY CAN'T THE HOME OFFICE
SEND ME A USEFUL ASSISTANT

52
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,791
AT LEAST ONCE IN A WHILE?

53
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,291
THIS TIME I'M STUCK
WITH A GLUTTONOUS BIMBO.

54
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,250
- I AM NOT A BIMBO,
THANK YOU.

55
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,416
IT TOOK SKILL FOR ME TO GET IN
THAT ROOM, LET ALONE BUG IT.

56
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
SO SHUT UP.  PERSONALLY,
I'M JUST SURPRISED

57
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,375
THAT WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT
YOU IS TRUE.

58
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,041
YOU ACTUALLY ARE
AS BIG OF A DICK

59
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,833
AS EVERYONE SAID YOU WOULD BE.

60
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,250
WHAT, NOT GONNA EAT?

61
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,000
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH KOKO.
THE FOOD HERE IS AWESOME.

62
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,500
- ( thinking )
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

63
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,583
HOW LONG ARE THEY GONNA
KEEP THIS FARCE UP?

64
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,500
DAMN IT.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,291
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.

66
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:53,041
MAJOR SOPHIA VELMER,
OR, RATHER, EX-MAJOR.

67
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,625
YOUR FIGHTING TECHNIQUE
IS QUITE UNUSUAL.

68
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,833
I WOULD REALLY LOVE
TO HEAR MORE ABOUT IT.

69
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,125
- I'M NOT MUCH FOR TALKING.
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

70
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,875
I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO TALK TO YOUR DEAD BODY.

71
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,291
I'M SURE IT WOULD BE
A GREAT CONVERSATION.

72
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,125
- ( gunfire continues )

73
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,708
- HMM.
I CAN'T SLEEP LIKE THIS.

74
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,166
I MEAN,
WHAT'S WITH THE FIREWORKS?

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,000
- THE FOOD WILL BE READY SOON.

76
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,208
A HOT MEAL SHOULD HELP YOU
FALL ASLEEP, OKAY?

77
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,041
- YEAH, I'M SURE IT WILL.

78
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,958
- THERE'S A BATTLE OUT THERE,
AND IT'S GETTING CLOSER.

79
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,000
BUT THE WAY IT'S ECHOING,
I CAN'T TELL WHERE IT IS.

80
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,500
- THEN AGAIN,

81
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,541
MAYBE THAT'S THE SOUND
OF KOKO HOT ON MY HEELS.

82
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,041
THE ECHO OF GUNFIRE FOLLOWS
WHEREVER THAT WOMAN WALKS.

83
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,333
- ( laughs )

84
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,541
- I AM TOTALLY NOT JOKING,
YOU KNOW.

85
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,333
I MEAN, NO MATTER
WHERE SHE GOES,

86
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,291
SHE ALWAYS MANAGES TO GET
INTO A FIGHT WITH SOMEBODY.

87
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,958
- THAT PROBABLY HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH

88
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,000
THE LINE OF WORK SHE'S IN.

89
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,875
- YEAH YEAH.
FUNNY THING IS,

90
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,625
SHE INSISTS THAT SHE DOESN'T
SEEK OUT VIOLENCE.

91
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,666
I CAN'T COUNT HOW MANY
TIMES SHE'S SAID THAT.

92
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,083
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

93
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,583
NOTHING GOOD EVER COMES
FROM THE WEAPONS TRADE.

94
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,041
WHETHER YOU'RE IN IT
BY CHOICE OR BY FORCE,

95
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,708
YOU'RE SCREWED.

96
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,583
YOU'RE A TOOTH,
CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO COGS.

97
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,958
THERE'S NO CHANGING IT.

98
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,541
SURE, I COULD TRY
TO BE STUBBORN

99
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,000
AND INSIST THAT
I'LL DESIGN ROBOTS

100
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,583
ONLY FOR
CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINMENT.

101
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,333
IT WOULDN'T HELP.

102
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,916
THE COGS WOULD CRUSH ME
INTO SAND AND KEEP ON TURNING.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST REALIZED
THAT WAS HOW THINGS WERE?

104
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,750
I'D DEVELOPED AN ADORABLE
ROBOTIC STUFFED ANIMAL

105
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,333
FOR THREE YEAR OLDS.

106
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,750
AND THEY TURNED IT
INTO A MISSILE WARHEAD.

107
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,791
- THAT IS A SHITTY SITUATION.

108
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,125
WHY DO YOU STILL
ASSOCIATE WITH H.C.L.I.

109
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,750
AND THE DA XINGHAI COMPANY?

110
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,333
SURELY YOU COULD CUT
THOSE TIES, AT LEAST?

111
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,333
- PARTIALLY IT'S BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP MYSELF.

112
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,708
I GUESS I LIKE THE PERKS
OF SPENDING TIME

113
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,750
WITH A WEALTHY MAN
LIKE MR. CHEN.

114
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,333
AS FOR KOKO,
I SEE SOMETHING IN HER THA--

115
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,166
THE FOOD!

116
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,750
THE NOODLES ARE OVERCOOKED.

117
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,458
- OH, JEEZ!
SORRY, DOC.

118
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,375
OW, HOT!
- AW, MAN!

119
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,916
MOKO, I DON'T LIKE THEM
UNLESS THEY'RE AL DENTE.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,916
- Chen: MS. HEKMATYAR?

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,416
ARE YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?
- SAY WHAT?

122
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,125
OH, YES, THANK YOU.
ANOTHER EXCELLENT WINE.

123
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,750
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

124
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,000
I'M GLAD I SELECTED SOMETHING
TO YOUR LIKING.

125
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,583
- ( thinking ) SHE SHOULD REALLY
BE CUT OFF ABOUT NOW.

126
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,208
- I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE A BOTTLE

127
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,416
WITH YOUR ELDER BROTHER
AS WELL SOMETIME.

128
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,666
- ( laughs )

129
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,041
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD
BE NEARLY AS ENJOYABLE.

130
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,291
MY BROTHER GULPS HIS BEVERAGES
RATHER THAN SAVORING THEM.

131
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,666
HE PREFERS JUNK FOOD
TO FINE DINING.

132
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,250
NOT THAT I DON'T CRAVE
THE OCCASIONAL BURGER.

133
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,750
- I'VE NOT HAD THE
PLEASURE OF MEETING

134
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,625
MR. HEKMATYAR IN PERSON,

135
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,833
BUT SOME OF MY ASSOCIATES
IN CENTRAL ASIA

136
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:01,000
HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.
- THERE, MUCH BETTER.

137
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,333
NOW THEY GOT SOME DRINKS IN 'EM,

138
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,416
THEY'RE FINALLY
STARTING TO TALK.

139
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,333
- ISN'T THIS A LITTLE
TOO CONVENIENT?

140
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,500
EARTH TO SCARECROW.
- HUH?

141
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,958
- CHEN'S POSING
AS A LEGITIMATE BUSINESSMAN,

142
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,291
BUT HE BASICALLY JUST ADMITTED

143
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,916
TO INVOLVEMENT WITH
THE ARMS TRADE.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,500
AND IT KINDA SEEMED
LIKE HE WAS HINTING

145
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,291
THAT HE'S GOT TROOPS
OF HIS OWN TOO.

146
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,833
- THAT'S THE REASON WE BUGGED
HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

147
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,708
THIS IS JUST THE
KIND OF INFORMATION

148
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,750
WE WERE HOPING TO HEAR,

149
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,875
SO TRY NOT TO
FREAK OUT ON ME NOW.

150
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,166
STILL, THERE'S A LOT MORE
I WANT TO KNOW

151
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,541
ABOUT HOW THIS GUY WORKS.

152
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,750
HE'S FRONTING AN HONEST BUSINESS
AND DEALING WEAPONS.

153
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,291
AND I'M GOING TO KEEP ON HIM
UNTIL I KNOW HOW.

154
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,583
- Chen:
FROM WHAT I HAVE GATHERED,

155
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,875
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
OPERATE IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS.

156
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,291
I FIRST CAME TO THAT REALIZATION
WHEN I LEARNED THAT,

157
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,291
LIKE ME,
YOU'VE HAD REPEATED CONTACT

158
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,250
WITH ONE DR. MINAMI AMADA.

159
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,583
IF I MAY BE SO BOLD,

160
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,416
WHAT IS ON THE HORIZON FOR
YOUR BUSINESS, MS. HEKMATYAR?

161
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,041
- THAT'S A SECRET.

162
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,000
- I CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK YOU AND I

163
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,583
ARE AFTER EXACTLY
THE SAME THING.

164
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:08,000
IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN
WORK TOGETHER TOWARD THAT GOAL.

165
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,833
- I'LL HAVE TO DECLINE.

166
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,625
- IF SOMEONE HAS TIED
YOUR HANDS IN THIS,

167
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,041
PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
BREAK FREE.

168
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,500
- ( gunfire continues )

169
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,541
- I THOUGHT SO.

170
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,500
THE WAY YOU MOVE
IS NEARLY IDENTICAL

171
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,250
TO THE MAN
WHO ANNIHILATED MY UNIT.

172
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,583
ALL THESE YEARS
COMING UP EMPTY HANDED,

173
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,750
AND NOW A CLUE DROPS
INTO MY LAP.

174
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,583
AS YOU CAN GUESS,
I'M QUITE EXCITED.

175
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,666
- LIKE I GIVE A DAMN.
- ( gun cocks )

176
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,666
- R: AWESOME.

177
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,000
I KNEW SHE WAS GOOD,
BUT DAMN.

178
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,875
I COULDN'T FIGHT LIKE THAT
IN A MILLION YEARS.

179
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,083
- ( gunfire )
- ( Lutz grunts )

180
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,625
- I GOT HIT,
SHOT RIGHT IN THE ASS.

181
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,750
- WOW, LUTZ,
THAT'S PRETTY PATHETIC.

182
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,041
SERVES YOU RIGHT, THOUGH,
FOR LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN.

183
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,791
IT'S OBVIOUSLY JUST A SCRATCH,
SO STOP CRYING.

184
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,500
GET IT TOGETHER, MAN.
WE STILL GOT WORK TO DO.

185
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,958
- Jonah: LEHM,
THEY'RE MOVING.

186
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,583
I THINK ALL THE RANDOM GUNFIRE'S
STARTING TO GET TO THEM.

187
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,458
- SOUNDS LIKE SHELL-SHOCK.

188
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,583
COMBAT FATIGUE
IS WEARING THEM DOWN,

189
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,250
SO THEY'RE
BREAKING COVER, RIGHT?

190
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,541
- RIGHT.

191
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,875
APART FROM THE LIEUTENANT,

192
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,041
NONE OF THEM KNOW HOW TO FIGHT
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

193
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,708
THEY'VE PROBABLY ALWAYS BEEN
STATIONED IN CITIES.

194
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,833
I SAY WE JUST PUT DOWN
OUR WEAPONS AND PLAY DEAD.

195
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,291
THEY'LL ALL STAND UP,
THINKING THEY'RE SAFE.

196
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,166
AND THEN YOU CAN START
PICKING 'EM OFF, ONE BY ONE.

197
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,083
- ( laughs )

198
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
- THE SHOOTING'S STOPPED.

199
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,750
- ( panting )

200
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,541
- ( gunshot )

201
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,875
- ONE MOMENT OF WEAKNESS
AND YOU'RE DEAD.

202
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,750
BUT THAT'S COMBAT FOR YOU--
CRUEL AND UGLY.

203
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,541
- THIS REALLY SUCKS.
I GET ALL THE CRAPPY JOBS.

204
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:29,041
- HEKMATYAR'S IN THE BATHROOM.

205
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,583
SHE MIGHT USE THIS CHANCE
TO CALL HER PEOPLE.

206
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,041
GET IN THERE
AND CHECK IT OUT.

207
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:38,083
- EH, I'M ALREADY HERE,
I MIGHT AS WELL.

208
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,916
- ( toilet flushes )
- ( door rattling )

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,500
- AHH! HEY!  WHA--
HEY, DO YOU MIND?

210
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,500
SOMEONE'S IN HERE!
- SCHOKOLADE, HUH?

211
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,750
- KOKO?  WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU USED MY CODENAME.

212
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,625
HOW DO YOU EVEN
HAVE THAT INFORMATION?

213
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,458
- BECAUSE I MADE IT
A SPECIAL POINT

214
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,875
TO CHECK INTO ALL OF SCARECROW'S
KNOWN ASSOCIATES.

215
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,791
- AH!  WHAT THE HELL?
CAN'T I GET SOME PRIVACY?

216
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,291
- IN A SEC.
ONE THING FIRST.

217
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,666
I HAVE A MESSAGE
YOU SHOULD PASS ON TO YOUR BOSS

218
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,875
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO END UP DEAD.

219
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,875
- LIEUTENANT!

220
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,000
- ( gunshot )

221
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,583
- AHHH!

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,666
- SHE DODGED THEM ALL!

223
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,333
- YOU DON'T NEED THIS ARM.
- AHHH!

224
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,875
AHH!

225
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,083
- YOU MAKE A LOT OF NOISE.

226
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,750
IF YOU'VE GOT
THE STRENGTH TO SCREAM,

227
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,000
YOU'VE GOT THE STRENGTH TO TALK.

228
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,208
YOU CAN START
BY TELLING ME YOUR NAME.

229
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,583
SHOULD BE SIMPLE ENOUGH.

230
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,583
COME ON, YOU CAN SPEAK,
CAN'T YOU?

231
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,916
I HAVEN'T SLIT YOUR THROAT YET.

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,500
YOU'RE WEAK. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YOU'RE WEAK!

233
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,333
( thinking )
AND ME?  AM I SO STRONG?

234
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,416
MY UNIT.

235
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,458
BECAUSE I COULDN'T CUT IT
AS COMMANDING OFFICER.

236
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,958
THEY'RE ALL--

237
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,875
- IT'S TIME TO PULL OUT,
VALMET.  LET'S GO.

238
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,500
WE STILL GOT A MISSION
TO COMPLETE.

239
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,416
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.
I'VE TAKEN OUT HER ENTIRE UNIT,

240
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,250
THANKS TO SOME QUICK THINKING
ON JONAH'S PART.

241
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,166
- NO, HOLD ON.

242
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,166
SHE KNOWS SOMETHING
ABOUT MY PAST.

243
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,708
- SO WHAT THEN?

244
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,583
YOU WANNA TAKE HER WITH YOU
AND TORTURE HER TILL SHE TALKS?

245
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,375
THAT'S NOT HOW WE OPERATE.

246
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,958
- WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

247
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,583
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE
IN THE SAME PLACE I ONCE WAS.

248
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,875
CHEW ON THAT FOR A WHILE.

249
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,333
- MAJOR VELMER.

250
00:13:56,416 --> 00:14:00,833
KAREN LOW, LIEUTENANT
IN THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY.

251
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,583
DON'T FORGET.

252
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,708
IT'S THE NAME OF THE WOMAN
WHO WILL KILL YOU.

253
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,625
- SEE YOU AROUND THEN,
KAREN.

254
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:13,625
- Lehm: THAT TOOK FOREVER.
IT'S PRACTICALLY DAWN ALREADY.

255
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,416
- YOU BIMBO.

256
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,458
WHAT DUMBASS IDEAS DID HEKMATYAR
PUT IN YOUR EMPTY LITTLE HEAD?

257
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,833
MY JOB IS TO SEE
THAT JUSTICE IS DONE

258
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,041
BY TAKING THE MONEY THOSE CROOKS
WORK SO VERY HARD TO EARN.

259
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,875
THAT'S HOW THIS GOES.

260
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,458
I'M NOT ABOUT TO TURN AROUND
AND GIVE IT BACK TO THEM.

261
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,000
LISTEN, HON,

262
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,500
I'M WELL AWARE THAT CHEN
IS A DANGEROUS MAN.

263
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,500
I DON'T NEED ANYONE
TO TELL ME THAT.

264
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,875
I GOT THINGS UNDER CONTROL.

265
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,708
YOU AND ME ARE GONNA
LEAVE CHINATOWN IN ONE PIECE.

266
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,958
YOU KNOW, THAT MAN HAS PROBABLY

267
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,166
KILLED TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE IN HIS TIME.

268
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,791
BUT WHEN YOU'RE A PRO LIKE ME,

269
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,958
YOU CAN TELL THESE THINGS
JUST FROM A MAN'S FACE.

270
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,000
- WONDERFUL.  SO THIS GUY
IS BASICALLY A KILLING MACHINE.

271
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,708
WOULDN'T IT BE SAFER
TO THROW IN OUR LOT WITH KOKO?

272
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,083
- HUH?
- THINK ABOUT IT.

273
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,500
IF CHEN KILLS HEKMATYAR,
YOU WON'T GET A CENT OUT OF HER.

274
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,416
WE'RE OUT OF TIME HERE.

275
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,833
- ( cell phone ringing )

276
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,208
- SORRY, DO YOU MIND?

277
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,041
THIS MIGHT BE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

278
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,458
KOKO HERE.

279
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,500
A-CHEW!

280
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:23,458
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M NOT FEELING SO WELL.

281
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,708
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST
IF WE CALLED IT A NIGHT.

282
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,791
THANK YOU FOR A LOVELY DINNER.

283
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,833
- IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

284
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,625
I'M JUST GRATEFUL
YOU COULD FIND THE TIME

285
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,250
TO MEET WITH ME THIS EVENING.

286
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,916
I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
IF I DON'T WALK YOU OUT.

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,375
- OF COURSE, MR. CHEN,
I'LL FIND MY OWN WAY.

288
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,250
THE MEAL WAS EXCELLENT.
YOU TAKE CARE NOW.

289
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,375
- Man: TARGETS?

290
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,583
- Li: FOUR, TOTAL.

291
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,375
TAKE OUT HEKMATYAR AND HER MAN

292
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,083
AND THE AMERICANS
THAT ARE WITH THEM.

293
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,583
TRY TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY
WERE MUGGED OR SOMETHING.

294
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,333
- ROGER.

295
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,750
- AHHH!

296
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,500
- GENERAL!
- FROM THE SOUND OF THINGS,

297
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,958
MR. CHEN COULDN'T QUITE
HIDE HIS TRUE FEELINGS

298
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,041
UNTIL WE WERE GONE.

299
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,916
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
- DON'T WORRY.

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,541
LEHM AND THE OTHERS
CAME OUT ON TOP.

301
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,208
- KOKO, OVER HERE!
- MOVE YOUR LILY-WHITE ASS.

302
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,583
- SEE THAT?

303
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,833
I'VE ARRANGED FOR OUR
SAFE PASSAGE AWAY FROM HERE.

304
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,833
SUH-WEEET!

305
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,250
THE SUPER HIND M.K.5
IS ALREADY OPERATIONAL?

306
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,708
- Scarecrow: IT'S A PROTOTYPE.
NOW GET THE FUCK ONBOARD.

307
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,791
- THEY GOT AWAY
IN A HELICOPTER.

308
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:40,041
- DAMN YOU, KOKO HEKMATYAR!
DAMN YOU, H.C.L.I.!

309
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,458
- PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

310
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,875
THIS IS THE ONLY SPOT
ON THE MOUNTAIN THAT'S WARM,

311
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,458
AND IT'S FILLED
WITH BUTTERFLIES.

312
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,125
- WA-HOO!

313
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,125
HMM.

314
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,916
SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE,
BUT NOT QUITE IT.

315
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,041
THAT SPECIES IS ACTUALLY HOSTILE
TO THE ONE I'M LOOKING FOR.

316
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,625
AND THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM.

317
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,166
THERE'S NO WAY PROFESSOR JAMES
WOULD MAKE A MISTAKE LIKE THIS.

318
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,375
DID SOMEONE SEND ME
FALSE INFORMATION?

319
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,166
- THEY ARE PRETTY, THOUGH.
- TRUE.

320
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,833
AND THIS VALLEY ITSELF
IS QUITE A FIND.

321
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,041
THERE MAY BE NEW SPECIES.
HI-YA!

322
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,916
AHHHH!
- I FOUND THE DOCTOR.

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,166
- Miami: A KID WITH A GUN.
ARE YOU KOKO'S MEN?

324
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,791
- I WANT THE WHOLE AREA
CLEARED.

325
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,208
- HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
WITH THE TEAM BEFORE.

326
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,041
SO, HON,
DO YOU HAVE A NAME?

327
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,666
- Koko: ARGH!

328
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE DITCHED ME TWICE IN A ROW!

329
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,500
- DAMN YOU, MINAMI!
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY!

330
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,500
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO VERY SORRY!

331
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,833
- AGAIN MALIN, NO NEED TO
APOLOGIZE. IT'S MY FAULT TOO.

332
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,208
I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE
GETTING UP THIS MORNING.

333
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,291
- ( laughing )

334
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,625
- BUT I CAN JUST IMAGINE
YOUR STRUGGLE.

335
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,291
YOU DESPERATELY TRIED
TO STOP HER FROM LEAVING.

336
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,750
BUT SHE USED HER CLEVER WILES
TO SNEAK AWAY.

337
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,208
- YOU UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU.

338
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,208
- SO WHICH BUTTERFLY THIS TIME?

339
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,958
- OH, SHE SAID
IT WAS SOME KIND OF SHELLFISH.

340
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,541
- SHELLFISH?

341
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,708
I WAS DITCHED FOR SHELLFISH?
THIS IS A NEW LOW.

342
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,125
OH, WELL, AT LEAST SHE GOT
THE BASIC THEORY COMPLETED.

343
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,333
BUT I WILL SO KICK HER ASS

344
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,916
IF SHE BLOWS ME OFF
AGAIN IN SIX MONTHS.

345
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY...
- SERIOUSLY, MALIN,

346
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,000
STOP IT WITH THE APOLOGIZING.

347
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,291
TO THE BAT CAVE!
- YES MA'AM.

348
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,916
- HONESTLY, WHY DOES NOTHING
EVER SEEM TO GO RIGHT

349
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,208
WHEN WE'RE IN AFRICA?

350
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,666
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
KOKO.

351
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,666
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

352
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,083
- I BET YOU DO.
- THE LAND IS HARSH AND VAST.

353
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,583
AND TOO MANY OF ITS PEOPLE
LIVE IN CHAOS.

354
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,250
EVERYTHING HERE
SEEMS JUST OUT OF REACH.

355
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,291
DAMN IT, LEHM!

356
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,000
FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME,
NO SMOKING IN THE CAR.

357
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,541
- YEAH YEAH.
SORRY.  JEEZ.

358
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,458
- Koko: NEXT STOP, ENGLAND.

359
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,458
- LOOK AT THIS.
THERE ARE A TON OF THEM, MOKO.

360
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,583
- YES, DOCTOR.

361
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,625
- Koko:
MAN, IT'S CROWDED IN HERE.

362
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,083
NOT THAT I MIND.

363
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,833
IT MAKES
FOR GOOD PEOPLE WATCHING.

364
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,375
THAT WAS ROUGH.
- SORRY.

365
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,333
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
ARE YOU OKAY?

366
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,750
- I'M FINE.

367
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,583
IT'S JUST THAT WE NEEDED
TO GET AWAY FROM THAT RESTAURANT

368
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:44,083
SO QUICKLY, WE HAD TO LEAVE
BEHIND THE CREW'S NICE NEW CAR.

369
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,625
FULL-ON BULLET-PROOF WINDOWS,
ARMORED BODY.

370
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,500
THAT WAS A COSTLY LOSS.
- ( Mao laughs ) 

371
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,125
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

372
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,000
BUT AT LEAST HUMAN CASUALTIES
WERE REMARKABLY LOW.

373
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,250
NONE DEAD AND ONLY TWO INJURED.
THINK OF IT THIS WAY--

374
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,416
THE CAR DIED
INSTEAD OF ONE OF US.

375
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,208
- HUH.
I KINDA LIKE THAT.

376
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,375
WHAT A GREAT WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT, MAO.

377
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,791
I HAVE AN IDEA--
WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER THERE

378
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,166
AND EXPLAIN
YOUR PERSPECTIVE TO UGO.

379
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,416
HE'S BEEN IN MOURNING
EVER SINCE IT HAPPENED.

380
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,750
HE WAS REALLY ATTACHED
TO THAT CAR.

381
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,791
- AW, JEEZ, I DON'T KNOW.

382
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,375
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
AN EASY TASK.

383
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,791
- Woman over P.A.:
BANGKOK, HONG KONG, BALI,

384
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:24,125
AND SYDNEY, FLIGHT 806,
NOW BOARDING FROM GATE FIVE.

385
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,666
- Koko: WELL, SHOOT.
IT WAS WORTH A TRY ANYWAY.

386
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,916
- ( alarm sounding )
- HOLD ON, KID.

387
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,166
YOU'RE NOT CARRYING
ANY METAL OBJECTS, ARE YOU?

388
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,583
SORRY, SON, BUT WE CAN'T
LET YOU THROUGH SECURITY

389
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,875
UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S
MAKING YOU BEEP LIKE THAT.

390
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,333
- YEAH, I KNOW.

391
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,666
IT'S BEEPING 'CAUSE I GOT
A BULLET IN MY BUTT CHEEK.

392
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,208
- COME ON, YOU HEARD THE KID.

393
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,666
JONAH HERE HAS GOT A BULLET
IN HIS BUTT, THAT'S ALL.

394
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,625
- YES, THAT'S CORRECT,
OFFICER!

395
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,541
I KNOW--
STRANGE BUT TRUE.

396
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,333
THE POOR LITTLE THING
HAS A BULLET IN HIS REAR

397
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,083
FROM AN OLD INJURY.

398
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,333
- OH, I SEE.

399
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,916
I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST JOKING.
VERY WELL, THEN.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,083
- HE'S LETTING YOU THROUGH.

401
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,041
AND HE ONLY HAD TO BE
TOLD THREE TIMES.

402
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,583
THAT'S SECURITY FOR YOU.

403
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,625
- HEY, IF THERE'S A KID
HOLDING UP THE LINE,

404
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,083
IT'S HIS DAMN
PARENTS' FAULT. HONESTLY!

405
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,458
- THERE A PROBLEM BACK THERE?
- I'M SO SORRY.

406
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,000
- ( grunts )
- I CANNOT BELIEVE

407
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,125
YOU JUST MADE MY BOSS
APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

408
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,916
YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO SKIP THE
LINE IF YOU'RE IN A WHEELCHAIR.

409
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,500
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ARRANGE
THAT FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE.

410
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,375
- THAT'S ENOUGH, VALMET!
WE DON'T BEAT UP ON CIVILIANS.

411
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,458
COME ON, LEHM, WHY AREN'T YOU
DOING SOMETHING TO STOP HER?

412
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,500
- I DUNNO,
'CAUSE IT'S FUCKIN' FUNNY?

413
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,583
- Koko: SWEET JEEBUS!

414
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,875
CAN'T WE EVEN CHANGE PLANES
WITHOUT MAKING A HUGE SCENE?

415
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,708
- SORRY, KOKO, I DIDN'T LIKE
HOW HE WAS TALKING TO YOU.

416
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,000
- ( laughs )
AW, THAT POOR SAP.

417
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,791
HE JUST WANTED TO ENJOY
HIS VACATION.

418
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,041
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THERE WAS ALL THIS COMMOTION

419
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,250
OVER ONE LITTLE BULLET
IN JONAH'S ASS.

420
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,416
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

421
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,291
A BULLET IN THE ASS
IS A SERIOUS THING.

422
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,708
- ( laughs )
- WHY DON'T YOU GET IT REMOVED?

423
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,208
IT WOULD BE RELATIVELY
MINOR SURGERY,

424
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,375
NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

425
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:56,916
- SURGERY DOESN'T SCARE ME.
IT'S JUST...

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I DON'T LIKE NEEDLES.

427
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,000
- ( grunting )
- ( objects crashing )

428
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,458
- All: SCARED OF NEEDLES?
WHAT ARE YOU, A KID?

429
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:07,041
OH, YEAH.
YOU ARE A KID.

430
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:11,000
- ( theme music playing )

431
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

432
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,208
- ♪ CONTROL, CONTROL ♪

433
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,541
♪ HER NAME IS KOKO,
SHE IS LOCO ♪

434
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,791
♪ I SAID, OH NO! ♪

435
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,708

436
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,750
