[YURI] The Second Great Collapse
has been averted.

3
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,958
Haru must have passed the info
on to Chihiro and his friends.

4
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,958
I'm so glad it's finally over.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,125
There's no longer a reason
for our two sides

to be fighting each other.

The battle
for humanity's fate begins now!

[GRUMMAN] Only through death
can there be rebirth.

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,166
Time to abandon the old

10
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,208
and take our first daring steps
toward a brave new world.

11

I've been saving Chiyu
specifically for this day.

12
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,375
Her wisdom will serve
as a guiding light,

I won't accept another failure
out of you, Kark.

The only failure I see
is your lack of understanding.

not your subordinate.

Despite the phrasing,
he has a point.

25
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,708
We should be combining
our efforts

26

to defeat Chihiro Kamina.

You can't!

he killed both Jun and Haru.

30

What?

31

You should have seen the way
he cut them to pieces

Ignorance is bliss

00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,583
I thought it was
a father's responsibility

40
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,708
to explain the harsh realities
of life to his daughter.

41
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm able to admit
when I've made a mistake.

42
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,000
We shouldn't have used
the audience as human shields.

43
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,750
But the Heroic Lineage knew
and attacked anyway.

44
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,041
When I heard what they had done,

45
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,125
I couldn't believe
their cruelty.

[DRAYLE giggling]

This is what you would call
a worst-case scenario.

48
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,208
I don't know who told them
we would be there,

49
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,750
but they knew exactly
what they were getting into.

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,000
He is the Lord of Cruelty.

53

Eventually, he'll destroy
everything.

[SHOKO] The plan was
an absolute success!

I single-handedly destroyed
the final keystone!

There's no longer going to be
a Second Great Collapse!

[KOTETSU] You were amazing
out there, Chihiro!

AVAL doesn't stand
a chance against you now.

Still.

65
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,583
So many people died
because of what I did.

66
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,458
What happened
wasn't your fault.

67
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,166
[TSUBAKI] He's right.
The Foundation's to blame.

68
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,416
If we hadn't stopped them,

69

who knows what shape
Tokyo would be in.

You saved lives.

You should be proud.

We won last night
thanks to you.

74
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,500
I'd say that's because
he's the Lord of Vermilion.

What are you talking about?

Not yet!

00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,708
Only the last surviving vessel

78
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,333
will become
the Lord of Vermilion!

79
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,416
Actions alone don't determine
who earns the title!

80
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,458
But if they did,
the fact that I prevented

81
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,166
the Second Great Collapse should
make me the best candidate!

82
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,083
Yeah, we understand that, but...

83
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,125
Chihiro's definitely
the front runner.

84

No offense.

00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,916
You can't be sure.

Isn't that right, Dux?

87
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,875
So head-band is gonna be okay?

00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,625
Yeah, they both are,
thanks to Cerdid

in the nick of time.

[EIKO]
Don't thank me.

91
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,208
I only followed
Chihiro's orders.

92
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,333
Well, we appreciate it anyway.

93

[CHIHIRO chuckles]

94
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,041
But Shoko, leaving both
of them for dead,

95
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,583
talk about heartless.

96
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,291
Just so she'd get
to destroy the keystone.

97
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,416
She'll do anything
to impress Dux.

98
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,708
Sure, but don't forget,

99
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,583
she did stop
the Great Collapse

100
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,125
and saved countless lives.

101
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,166
Sometimes she acts like
we're on different sides.

102
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,208
Oh, speaking of which,
he'll be shocked...

103

finding out he was saved
by his enemies.

104
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:56,083
The smallest things can turn
people against each other,

105
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,166
make us enemies or allies.

106
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,958
Surely there's something
we could've done

107
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,750
that would have kept us all
from fighting.

108
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,958
Haru was able
to remain friends with Akira.

109
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,208
Maybe Jun could have been...

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,833
Things might have been different
if Inuki had survived.

[KOUME]
I'm not so sure.

Jun was one twisted dude.

He must feel
pretty uncomfortable

[CHIYU]
The seventh artificial keystone

126
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,833
was destroyed.

127
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,458
We can no longer cause
a Great Collapse.

128
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,791
But if we absorb
the ley line energy

129
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,375
at the remaining six

130

and guide them using
this research equipment,

131
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,250
we will be able
to forcibly open gates.

132
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,166
However, by doing so,

133
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,000
a chain reaction will occur.

134

When Tokyo's energy balance
is thrown off,

135

it will be destroyed.

Absolutely.

I was so desperate
to bring Mitsuki back,

I didn't see the obvious.

I can simply go
and meet her myself.

[ELECTRONIC VOICE]
Identity verified.

164
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,250
Welcome, Professor Mitsuki.

165
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,958
Chihiro Kamina.

166
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,125
I'll never forgive you
for embarrassing me

167
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,458
in front of Dux like that.

168
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,250
Stealing my praise
when I was the one

169
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,916
who should have been celebrated.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,125
On top of that,
the fools think you're worthy

171
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,291
of being the chosen one.

172
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,916
I won't allow it.

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,791
Did he stop
the Great Collapse or me?

174
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,708
I should be
the Lord of Vermilion.

175
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,875
Not him.

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,541
He's in my way.

177
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,416
But I will stop him.

178
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,125
If only he'd disappear.

179
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh!
The last surviving vessel

180
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,958
will be
the Lord of Vermilion.

181
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,416
Why did I take
so long to come

182
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,416
to such
an obvious solution?

183
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,041
I simply have to kill Chihiro
and the others.

184
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,333
It's perfect.

185
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,416
[laughing]

186
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,000
Dux will be proud
of my initiative.

187
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,125
-Then I'll become the--
-[rattling, wind whooshing]

188
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,625
I wish bloody blessings
upon your dark deeds.

189
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:40,916
[body thuds on floor]

190
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,500
You're mine--
[grunts]

191
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,708
[DRAYLE]
What a beast!

192
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,666
He doesn't even hesitate
to kill his own allies.

193
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,458
Truly merciless.

194
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,833
[GRUMMAN]
Friends, enemies,

195
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,375
they're all the same to him.

196
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,833
He's been conquered
by his own power.

197
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,416
Don't avert your gaze.

198
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,333
If he's as important
to you as you claim,

199
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,375
then observe the monster
he's become.

200
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,125
[DRAYLE]
Ya-hoo!

201
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,291
He knew that thing
used to be human!

202
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,875
You're lying.

203
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,500
This isn't real!

204
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,458
[GRUMMAN]
It's the undeniable truth.

205
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,500
No! Chihiro would never--

206
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,416
[GRUMMAN]
It's time to face the facts.

207
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,166
He's no longer the same person.

208
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,041
I understand how you feel.

209
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,500
He didn't want this.

210
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,041
The boy is a victim.

211
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,416
What?

212
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,416
The problem has to do
with his blood powers.

213
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,875
When he uses them,
the Lord of Vermilion consumes

214
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,291
a little more of him.

215
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,958
This energy force
is impossible to control.

216
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,750
I guarantee you, he
won't survive for much longer.

217
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,083
[shrieking]

218
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,125
[GRUMMAN] He's climbing
the stairway of destruction

219
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,416
without realizing
where it's leading him.

220
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,708
Eventually, he'll become
a mere shell.

221
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,666
And then,
the Lord of Vermilion

222
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,125
will end up
erasing everything.

223
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,500
A tragic story.

224
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,666
At this rate, his hands
are gonna be stained

225
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,458
with the blood
of the entire world,

226
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,833
if you don't save him.

227
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,916
You're the only one
who can prevent this

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,333
from happening.

229
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,583
Only me?

230
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,250
He can't become
the Lord of Vermilion,

231
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,666
or it will be too late.

232
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,083
He'll be lost for good.

233
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,500
Stop him. Save Chihiro.

234
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,958
[GRUMMAN]
What a marvelous idea.

235
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,833
Bring back the Chihiro Kamina
you once knew.

236
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,541
Save him.

237
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,500
Save Chihiro.

238
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,250
[GRUMMAN]
That's right, Yuri.

239
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,000
Save him.

240
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,750
Only I can help him.

241
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,333
[KOTETSU]
What a mess.

242
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,833
[EIKO]
You don't think...

243
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,958
[KOUME]
No doubt.

244
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,583
It's Shoko.

245
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,625
[KOTETSU] Damn it.
Who could've done this?

246
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,041
It couldn't have been Jun
or the kid.

247
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,833
The only two who are left at
the Foundation are Kark and...

248
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,416
[DUX]
Good. You're all here.

249
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,041
Since Shoko is no longer
with us, I'll have to tell you.

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,208
It appears agents of Chaos
have a new plan in the works.

251
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,416
[KOTETSU]
What's wrong with you?

252
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,958
Nothing.

253
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,458
Aren't you sad at all
about what happened to her?

254
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,416
Shoko practically worshiped you!

255
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,541
They're planning to take
all of Tokyo to another world.

256
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,541
-Huh?
-What does that mean?

257
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,125
What'll happen to the city?

258
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,458
I think we can all assume
it'll be pretty bad regardless.

259
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,791
Best-case scenario is we vanish.

260
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,291
Best case?

261
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,625
Why are they doing this?

262
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,208
That's meaningless.

263
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,250
The question you
should be asking yourselves

264
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,625
is how you can stop them.

265
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,375
Should we be stopping them?

266
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,791
They'd be destroying Tokyo,

267
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,958
which is what you wanted
in the first place.

268
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,041
It's up to you.

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,666
Choose your own futures.

270
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,125
[GRUMMAN] The Lord of Vermilion
will end up erasing everything.

271
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,458
Even his memories of you.

272
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,958
It's not too late.

273
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,291
Chihiro.

274
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,333
[CHIHIRO]
You seem well, Yuri.

275
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,041
[YURI]
Thanks. So do you.

276
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,000
I've missed you a lot.

277
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,833
Sorry I've been gone,
but I, you know.

278
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,208
It's fine.

279
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,833
Let them fight if they want.

280
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,541
The Maldeus Church
and The AVAL Foundation.

281
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,583
None of that has any effect
on our relationship.

282
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,125
I couldn't agree more.

283
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,208
Some hot cocoa?

284
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,916
The flavor's pretty close
to the way

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,708
your mom used
to make it.

286
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,833
Hmm. It tastes good.

287
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,625
You think so?

288
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,416
That hit the spot, Yuri.

289
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,000
I can't remember the way
my mom's cocoa tasted.

290
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,708
But somehow, when I drink yours,
it relaxes me.

291
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,458
What a relief!

292
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,541
Seriously, hearing you
say that is proof

293
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,708
you're the same old Chihiro
you've always been.

294
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,083
-Sorry?
-I was so worried about you.

295
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,458
I wasn't sure what I'd do
if I found you

296
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,375
and you'd somehow changed,
but that's not the case.

297
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,333
What do you mean?

298
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,541
Just a strange vision I had

299
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,583
of you becoming
the Lord of Vermilion.

300
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,708
The audience at the theater,

301
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,500
I saw them transform
into a huge monster.

302
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,416
You had this incredible power
and killed them with it.

303
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,125
Oh, I see.

304
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,083
[YURI]
But I refused to believe it.

305
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,416
I knew that was impossible.

306
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,083
A complete
and total fabrication, yep.

307
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,875
You can probably guess
who told me.

308
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,208
-It's all true.
-Uh...

309
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,833
I killed those people.

310
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,625
With my own hands.

311
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,416
[YURI]
Why?

312
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,666
It's Kark's fault.

313
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,583
If he hadn't transformed
the audience...

314
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,958
There was no other choice.

315
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,666
I was forced into killing them.

316
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,291
But you said no one else
would have to die.

317
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,000
That's what I thought, and yet

318
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,416
if I'm going to save everyone
from the Great Collapse,

319
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,708
it means getting
my hands dirty.

320
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,291
That was my reasoning.

321
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,750
There was no other way?

322
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,125
So you have changed after all.

323
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,375
What?

324
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,083
You're not the Chihiro I know.

325
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,416
What happened to him?

326
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,291
You can't keep doing this.

327
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,208
I don't want you
fighting anymore!

328
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,791
Promise me!

329
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,958
Yuri...

330
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,291
If you continue letting
that power consume you,

331
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,958
you'll destroy yourself

332
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,541
and become someone
I don't recognize.

333
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,458
I can't stop.

334
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,291
I heard the Foundation is about
to put a new plan in motion.

335
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,250
And if it works, Tokyo will
be swallowed by another world.

336
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,291
I'm going to fight.

337
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:04,291
Inuki and Kakihara wanted me
to fulfill their dying wishes.

338
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,708
I can't run
from my responsibilities.

339
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,333
-Who cares about that?
-Huh?

340
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,416
You're the only person I need
standing by my side.

341
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,958
My father doesn't mean
anything to me.

342
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,375
You should forget all about
the Lord of Vermilion.

343
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,250
But, Yuri...

344
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,375
Let's leave everything
behind now.

345
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,750
We'll find someplace
we can be alone forever.

346
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,125
Far away, where no one
can reach us.

347
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,166
-Just you and me.
-[sighs]

348
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,750
Well?

349
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,500
I can't walk away from this.

350
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,333
Of course you can.

351
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,750
I'm sorry, but no.

352
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,583
Don't leave.

353
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,500
Don't leave me.

354
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,291
He'll be lost.

355
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,458
I have to save him
before it's too late.

356
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,208
I'm sorry, Chihiro.

357
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,375
You're staying!

358
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,041
Yuri?

359
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,125
There's no one else with
the power to stop you except me.

360
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,041
I'm begging you.

361
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,458
Don't make me.

362
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,791
You won't lay a finger on him!

363
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,083
Don't bother.

364
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,666
What the hell are you doing?

365
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,166
Stop this, both of you!

366
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,166
Yuri!

367
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,333
You won't win this.
Give up.

368
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,458
Stay out of my way.

369
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,333
I've been looking forward
to this day for a long time.

370
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,333
This is all your fault!

371
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,583
Ever since you came along,

372
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,625
Chihiro's acted
completely different.

373
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,875
Leave me alone.

374
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,000
[CERDID]
He began treating me coldly.

375
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,791
And then he valued
spending time with you

376
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,625
instead of fighting our enemies.

377
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,500
Chihiro's risking
his life every day!

378
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,083
What if you distract him?

379
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,166
I've seen how he lets
his guard down when you're near.

380
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,458
What if something happens
to him because of you?

381
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,250
My purpose is to be
his Defender.

382
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,958
Protecting my master
is my sole duty.

383
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,500
Face it.

384
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,083
Eventually, you would be
responsible for Chihiro's death.

385
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,791
I'm sorry, but I'd give
my life to stop you, Yuri.

386
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,041
No. I would never hurt him.

387
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,750
[CERDID]
I know the truth.

388
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,541
You want him all to yourself.

389
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,375
My only choice is to kill you.

390
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,916
I don't care if he hates me
the rest of his life

391
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,458
or if every time he looks at me,
his eyes are full of resentment.

392
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,458
You love him.

393
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,083
Stop, Cerdid!

394
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,208
Don't do it!

395
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,041
That's an order!
I'm telling you to stop!

396
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,666
Please, forgive me.

397
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,541
No.

398
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,541
[CHIHIRO]
Stop!

399
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,291
[gasps]

400
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,791
[CERDID]
What?

401
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,458
What... happened?

402
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,916
What did you do to her?

403
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,708
[CERDID]
Goodbye, Chihiro.

404
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,958
Cerdid!

405
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,208
You killed her.

406
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,375
No, I--

407
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,958
This wasn't supposed to happen.

408
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,125
Why, Yuri?
How could you?

409
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,666
It's the truth.
I didn't do anything.

410
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,000
Please believe me.

411
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,708
The only thing I wanted
was to save you.

412
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,041
[CHIHIRO]
Yuri!

413
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,041
[YURI]
It's wrong.

414
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,041
All wrong.

415
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,375
No more.

416
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,416
I can't do this.

417
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,541
It's time. Let's begin.

418
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,958
All artificial keystones
have been activated.

419
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,583
Ley line energy absorption
bulb open.

420
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,000
Limiter removed.

421
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,375
Contact made.

422
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:59,250
[pulsing]

423
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,500
Dirac value is increasing.

424
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,875
We are encroaching
on the dimensional barrier.

425
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,166
[pulsing intensifies]

[laughing]

428
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,458
The destruction
has finally begun!

429
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,083
Took us long enough!

430
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,333
The land I desire is waiting
on the other side.

431
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,458
How I've yearned
for this moment.

432
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,791

[KOTETSU]
Looks bad.

436
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,250
You're here.

437
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,250
Where'd Cerdid go?

438
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,041
We're the only ones
left alive to stop this.

439
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,916
Guys, there's no turning back.

440
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,208
[DUX]
That's right.

441
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,083
This entire phenomenon
is the result

442
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,791
of an experiment at AVAL HQ.

443
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,875
The same experiment that took
your mother from you,

444
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,041
Chihiro.

445
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,458
Understood.

446
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,375
Don't forget, heaven helps
those who help themselves.

447
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,125
So I recommend you get to work.

448
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,041
Well, all's well
that ends well, I hope.

449
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,416
Ready, Chihiro?

450
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,958
I am. Let's move.
