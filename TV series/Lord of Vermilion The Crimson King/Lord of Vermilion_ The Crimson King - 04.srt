[SHOKO]
His overpower is incredible.

7
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,541
Because he's inexperienced,

8
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,541
the rate of growth
is precisely as expected.

9
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,958
What a delight he's chosen

10
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,458
to ally himself
with the Maldeus Church.

11
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,500
Even though he doesn't know
where the barrier is,

12
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,916
it doesn't really matter.

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,541
How'd it get to this?

14
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,458
I'm starting to see
why we were waiting around

15
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,500
with nothing to do
for the longest time.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,250
The fact is we had
no one on our side

17
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,375
strong enough
to complete this mission.

18
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,416
Now, that's changed.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
I won't stop!

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,750
[CHIHIRO]
If the cost of saving our future

21
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,583
is destroying Tokyo,
then so be it!

22
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,625
How long will you keep
dragging your feet?

23
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,583
At this point,
whether the barrier

24
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,916
is destroyed or not
is of little consequence.

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,958
What I can't comprehend is
why you continue

26
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,625
to let the church's
Heroic Lineage

27
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,083
do as they please?

28
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,458
It's not as though we don't have
the intel to strike.

29
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,583
The problem is
we've hit our limit.

30
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,166
We're at
a complete disadvantage

31
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,208
and especially weak in places
where gates can't be opened.

32
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,916
My question is when can we
expect them to help?

33
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,875
Careful, Jun.

34
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,875
You should know better than
to refer to them so casually.

35
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,625
Fine, then you won't mind us
finding reinforcements

36
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,791
while we're waiting.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,208
We'll return shortly.

00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,833
Please forgive me.

40
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,416
Placing you in danger's
the last thing I ever wanted.

41
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,583
But try to see it
from my perspective.

42
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,041
You're the only one
who can save me.

43
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,500
There's nobody else.

44
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,666
Yes. I know, Father.

[MAN]
Good girl.

46
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,083
[SHOKO]
Today was a huge success for us.

47
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,000
These are fantastic results.

48
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,208
Barriers in two different
locations were destroyed,

49
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,500
and in record time.

50
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,250
Isn't he expending
too much power?

51
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,375
He hasn't grown
accustomed to it.

52
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,750
[CHIHIRO]
No. It's fine.

53
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,791
If my abilities can help.

54
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,750
We know barriers
have been erected around Tokyo.

55
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,166
There's only one way
to remove their influence.

56
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,541
Destroy what protects them.

57
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,125
The spiritual sites
that keep us

58
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,791
from toppling the barriers.

59
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,958
Kamina's power is an asset.

60
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,791
I don't believe we'd have
a chance without it.

61
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,333
Yeah. But come on.

62
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,541
Chihiro won't last
at the rate he's going.

63
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,916
The agents of Chaos won't stop.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,541
They'll continue turning people
into gates to other worlds

65
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,833
unless we act.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,458
Yeah, but...

67
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,291
[SHOKO] We have to take down
the remaining barriers.

68
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,750
Once they've all
been eliminated,

69
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,916
Tokyo will crumble on its own.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,750
Only then will we
be able to stop

71
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,833
further atrocities
from happening.

72
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,125

any more causalities.

I've been having this dream.

76
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,541
Huh?

77
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm afraid if we ease off,

78
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,791
someone else will fall victim.

79
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,458
And the thought of that,
I can't stand it.

80
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,333
Until we get rid
of the barriers,

81
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,708
the future will never be safe.

that will...

to sacrifice yourself?

of his heart,
not for catharsis.

Is demolishing a city enough

104
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,916
or do you have
to personally kill someone?

You're a Vessel of Heroic Blood.
