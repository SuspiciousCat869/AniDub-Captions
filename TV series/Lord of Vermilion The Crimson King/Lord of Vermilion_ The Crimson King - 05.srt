00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,333
-[grunts]
-Huh.

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,583
[HARU screams]

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,500
What the hell?

6
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,125
[groans]

7
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,500
[EIKO]
Chihiro.

8
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,291
[JUN]
Yuri.

9
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,500
Don't tell me
this boy defeated you.

10
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,083
[CHIHIRO]
Koume, we need to retreat.

11
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,000
-[KOUME] But we haven't--
-[CHIHIRO] This mission.

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,208
Something's wrong.

13
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,875
[KOUME]
Fine.

14
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,000
[HARU]
You're not going anywhere!

15
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,166
Fall back, Haru!

16
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,083
Don't pursue them.

17
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,541
But, sir.

18
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,875
[JUN] I'm worried about Yuri.
Let's move.

19
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:07,958
[grunts]

20
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,208
[YURI] It's all because
of your mother.

21
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,666
[blood splatters]

22
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,666
[roaring]

23
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,291
[church bell tolling]

24
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,166
Chihiro?

25
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,833
What happened back there?

26
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,125
I saw a bright light,
then suddenly you were gone.

27
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,583
I couldn't detect
your Arcana anywhere.

28
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,583
I was paralyzed
until you returned!

29
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,541
Are you listening to me?

30
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,041
Hey! Say something!

31
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,791
I'm sorry but...

32
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,458
could you leave me alone
for a while?

33
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,666
Are you... mad at me?

34
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,750
Please don't make me
say it again.

35
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,666
Leave me alone.

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,916
[gasps]

37
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,875
[KOTETSU] I'm telling the truth!
There was someone else!

38
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,500
[KOUME]
Nah. The fall just left you

39
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,833
more dazed than usual.

40
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,833
[KOTETSU] And they used
some kind of weird pattern

41
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,375
to summon a monster.

42
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,750
[INUKI] I don't see
how they could if there weren't

43
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,416
any humans around.

44
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,583
Are you talking about that boy
with the hairband?

45
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,583
Huh? No. This was a girl.

46
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,583
Kotetsu is telling us the truth.

47
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,083
She was from the Guardian State.

48
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,625
Huh?

49
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,083
And who are they exactly?

50
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,291
Allow me to explain.

51
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,375
The Guardian State has been
around since ancient times.

52
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,625
They've been the sworn
protectors of this island

53
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,833
since long before
it was even a country.

54
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,083
So they're enemies?

55
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,791
[SHOKO]
Given our objective, yes.

56
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,833
Hmm?

57
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,083
Does that have
something to do

58
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,125
with Chihiro disappearing
during the battle?

59
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,791
The guy with the sunglasses
seemed as confused as us.

60
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,625
Where'd you go after
you were hit by that light?

61
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,375
Um...

62
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,208
I don't really know where I was.

63
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,250
[KOUME]
Huh?

64
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,041
By the time I came to, I...

65
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,708
You seemed fine
when you gut-kicked bandana boy.

66
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,708
Based on what you're telling us,

67
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,250
it sounds like you lost
some time.

68
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,708
Yeah, on the subject
of "missing time,"

69
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,625
quit asking me to show up
for every single pow-wow.

70
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,000
Our information's
being leaked to the enemy.

71
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,125
Wh-- We have a spy?

72
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,625
[KOUME] You think someone plans
to kill all of us?

73
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,750
No one would dare.

74
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,916
So that ambush
was a coincidence?

75
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,458
The way I understand it,
the Guardian State is involved.

76
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,291
Seems they know everything.

77
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,583
Then wouldn't that make you
the prime suspect?

78
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,791
You did refuse to go
on the mission.

79
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,750
[chuckles]

80
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,333
Why would I sell you out?

81
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,833
There's nothing to gain from it.

82
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,250
There's no point in us
standing around speculating.

83
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,666
We'll figure out
how to handle this

84
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,500
when we make our next move.

85
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,208
I don't know how anyone
else here feels, but me,

86
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,666
not that eager to get
stabbed in the back.

87
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,833
We're going through
with the plan,

88
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,208
and nothing's changing that.

89
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,125
Now wait.
The fact is we were set up.

90
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,458
Speculation aside,
you can't deny that.

91
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,500
Are you scared?

92
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,041
I'm saying it's foolish

93
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,000
to rush in
knowing there's a leak!

94
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,250
Dyin' ain't high
on my priority list.

95
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,541
Our goal's to destroy Tokyo!

96
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,375
As fast as possible!
Nothing else matters!

97
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,083
You understand that, right?

98
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,708
[YURI]
It's all because of your mother.

99
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,041
[INUKI] How have you been
holding up recently?

100
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,500
The mission's been
shelved for now,

101
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,833
so it's a good opportunity

102
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,458
for you to catch up
on some rest.

103
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,875
-Did something happen?
-[CHIHIRO] No.

104
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,083
[CHIHIRO] Someone told me
something strange.

105
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,583
That this is all
because of my mother.

106
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,500
Your mother?

107
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,041
[CHIHIRO]
I don't know why,

108
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,000
but for whatever reason,
I can't stop thinking about it.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,958
You mean about her?

110
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,500
[CHIHIRO]
That's the thing.

111
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,458
I'd never given her much thought
until I heard those words.

112
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,208
[INUKI]
Chihiro?

113
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,041
Her face.

114
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't even remember
my mother's face.

115
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,625
None of my childhood.

116
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,208
[KAKIHARA] If that's true,
seems I have the advantage.

117
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,791
So how about it? Care to take
a stroll down memory-lane?

118
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,416
Okay. Tell me everything.

119
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,291
It's hard to believe you don't
remember your own mother,

120
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,333
especially with how explosive
the story was

121
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,833
at the time, pun intended.

122
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,000
Go back ten years.
There was a big detonation.

123
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,875
The AVAL Science Foundation
Research Facility.

124
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,166
That ring any bells?
