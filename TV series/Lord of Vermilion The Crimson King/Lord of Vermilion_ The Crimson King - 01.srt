"Save Tokyo" demonstrations
are being held

in the capital of Osaka

as the public voices
their frustrations.

Meanwhile,
the Japanese government

has sent the special autonomous

food and medical assistance
totaling trillions of yen.

Special autonomous district?

That's what they're
calling the city now.

The red mist seems to be keeping
everybody from leaving it.
