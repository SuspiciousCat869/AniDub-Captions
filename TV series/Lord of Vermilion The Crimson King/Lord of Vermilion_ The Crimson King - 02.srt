Is that Ikuro?

Guys, it's him.

00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,208
Fine. Step aside. I'll do it.

[EIKO]
Hurry and wake up!

335
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,500
You need to remember
who you really are!

336
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,041
What do you mean by that?

337
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,458
Give yourself to
the Heroic Blood inside of you.

338
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,583
Once you do,
it'll take care of the rest.

[screaming in pain]

I can't.
I won't do it.

00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,375
You don't have any choice!

342
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,625
No!

343
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,958
And what if Kotetsu turns
into a monster?

344
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,791
Does that mean I'll kill him?

[CHIHIRO]
I won't do it!

348
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,791
If living means
my friend has to die...

349
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,250
then I'd rather be the one
to die instead!

350

You killed him. It was you.

You're the one
who murdered my father!

This whole time, he was
a vessel of Heroic Blood.

00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,458
[KOTETSU]
Where'd he run off to?

359

This way!

[MAN]
To think there was another.

362
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,000
Doesn't matter.

363
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,625
I'll kill both of you
at the same time.

That's enough.
I warned you!

I don't remember anything.

378
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,583
I don't want to wake up

379

and find another person
I've killed.

I can't.

381

No. I don't want
more blood on my hands.
