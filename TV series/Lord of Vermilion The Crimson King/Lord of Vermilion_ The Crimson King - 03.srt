How can we cure him?

They have a defender.
That's just perfect.

I'll say this
about your beloved.

Stop using that excuse.
It's my fault!

I understand how you feel,

there's simply no changing them
back to their original form.

You have to kill them.

then you kill him.

00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,208
Huh?

167
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,333
She can't change back, Kakihara.

168
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,625
What did you say?

169
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,125
Now that she's a familiar,

170
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,666
she can't become human
ever again.

171
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,083
You're a liar.
Give her back to me!

172
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,083
-As I've already stated--
-[KOTETSU] Chihiro!

173
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,500
Come quick!

174
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,916
-[groaning]
-[CHIHIRO] Ikuro?

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,791
[SHOKO] It appears he couldn't
transform into a familiar.

176
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,041
Tsubasa's lucky.

177
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,833
There was a chance she could
have ended up like him.

178
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,541
-How is she lucky?
-That's enough, you two!

179
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,708
Save him!
You can't leave him this way!

180
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,458
[INUKI]
Maybe I can help.

181
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,458
Why are you here, Doctor?

182
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,583
[SHOKO] It's all right.
Inuki is one of us.

183
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,041
One of you?

184
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,416
I know you must
find this confusing.

185
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,833
Please come with me.

186
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,166
[KOTETSU]
Where to?

187
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,208
The Maldeus Church.

188
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,041
[SHOKO] I welcome you
to our sacred stronghold.

189
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,125
The Maldeus Church is home
to the Heroic Lineage

190
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,083
who fight against Chaos.

191
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,583
And what is Chaos?

192
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,125
As the name suggests,
they're the forces that seek

193
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,875
to plunge the world
into darkness.

194
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,541
We are tasked
with stopping them.

195
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,291
Mmm, okay, you lost me again.

196
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,208
More importantly,
where's Tsubasa?

197
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,625
Aero is being examined
over at the hospital.

198
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,458
Cerdid is with her now, so you
have nothing to worry about.

199
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,833
[chuckles]

200
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,125
Right, Aero.

201
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,291
Hanashima, time to tell us
what's going on.

202
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,333
You can't avoid it any more.

203
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,833
Our leader will provide you
with the answers you seek.

204
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,291
Your leader, huh?

205
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,708
[footsteps]

206
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,041
[DUX] "We are such stuff
as dreams are made on."

207
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,125
"Yea, all which it inherit
shall dissolve,

208
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,208
and like this
insubstantial pageant faded."

209
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,250
[KOTETSU]
Where'd she come from?

210
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,625
[CHIHIRO]
No way.

211
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,833
Is that...

212
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,916
Welcome,
Vessels of Heroic Blood.

213
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,750
You may call me Dux.

214
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,375
It is her.

215
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,333
Wait, you mean
you know this girl?

216
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,875
I met her in a dream once.

217
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,500
A dream?

218
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,875
Dreams are mirrors
through which we peer

219
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,291
into other worlds.

220
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,375
Hello, Chihiro Kamina.

221
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,500
So we meet again.

222
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,958
Impossible.

223
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,000
[KAKIHARA scoffs]

224
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,250
I tagged along
for some answers

225
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,833
and what do I find?

226
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,625
Just some blindfolded bimbo
with a Shakespeare fetish.

227
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,250
Silence, blasphemer!

228
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,166
The only tool I require to share
the truth is this mouth.

229
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,625
Am I wrong?

230
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,375
I admit you got a point.

231
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,458
Judging someone off appearance
isn't very professional of me.

232
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,458
[SHOKO]
No smoking inside the church.

233
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,916
We want to know.

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,875
Why the hell's this crazy stuff
happening to us?

235
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,583
Everything is destiny.

236
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,500
[CHIHIRO]
That's not an answer!

237
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,375
It begins in the near future.

238
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,666
In 40 years,
this world will cease to exist.

239
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,666
[ALL gasp]

240
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,583
That's end-of-days nonsense.

241
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,166
Why am I not surprised?

242
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,416
[DUX] You asked me for
the truth, and I'm telling you.

243
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,750
[KOTETSU]
I think I get it.

244
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,666
You're saying
those monsters are invaders,

245
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,500
and we have to stop them, right?

246
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,083
[DUX]
You can't stop them.

247
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:58,041
Destruction is inevitable,
and a new world will begin.

248
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,166
[KOTETSU] Huh?
What kind of future is that?

249
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,916
[DUX]
The act of creation is painful.

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,500
Eliminating the antiquated
is necessary.

251
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,583
I still don't understand
what this has to do with us.

252
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:12,583
[DUX] The new world will either
be born from hope or chaos.

253
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,833
The vessels of Heroic Blood
hold the key that will decide.

254
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,958
It is up to you.

255
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,708
-The three of us?
-[KAKIHARA chuckles]

256
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,208
And what exactly are
the Vessels of Heroic Blood?

257
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,083
When destruction
finally arrives,

258
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,125
a hero named the
Lord of Vermilion will appear.

259
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,333
They will create a new world
overflowing with hope.

260
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,458
The Vessels of Heroic Blood
are those with the capacity

261
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,666
to become
this legendary figure.

262
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,166
The Lord of Vermilion.

263
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,125
If this chosen one is not born,

264
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,375
the world will be ruled
by Chaos.

265
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,791
There'll be war,
poverty, sickness.

266
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,625
Terrible things will happen,

267
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,750
and the Earth will sink
into despair.

268
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,833
Lady, not even
the tabloids would buy

269
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,625
the delusions
you're trying to sell us.

270
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,791
[DUX] I thought what you saw
with your eyes was the truth.

271
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,500
People became monsters,

272
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,625
and your dear assistant
changed into a familiar.

273
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,875
Were those delusions?

274
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,375
The ones who transformed my dad.

275
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,666
Who are they?

276
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,791
They are Agents of Chaos.

277
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,708
[rattling, clanging]

278
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,666
We've got three Vessels
wide awake and running around.

279
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,125
And you're saying that all three
of them have aligned themselves

280
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,500
with the Maldeus Church?

281
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,375
It would appear that way.

282
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,750
[MAN] Those fanatics
only have one goal.

283
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,291
Destroy the world.

284
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,083
Then build their vision
of paradise atop the rubble.

285
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,375
What else do we know?
Eh, Van Drayle.

286
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,208
Well, they operate
off the belief

287
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,708
the apocalypse will arrive
in 40 years.

288
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,375
So of course
it's going to happen.

289
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,416
After all, they're the ones
who'll be pulling the trigger.

290
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,708
And yet,
they've also been claiming

291
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,416
a world full of hope is
in the realm of possibility.

292
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,750
Sophistry.

293
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,916
The only way this utopia
of which they speak

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,041
could be born
is through utter destruction.

295
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,833
The foundation of this new order
must be stopped.

296
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,916
We will put an end
to the Heroic Lineage.

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,625
The world must be saved.

298
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,166
And we have the science
to prevent its destruction.

299
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,958
Death to the Heroic Lineage.

300
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,708
[KOTETSU] They're responsible
for the Great Collapse?

301
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,375
Correct.

302
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,333
And because this event occurred,
creatures from other worlds

303
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,458
are now able to cross over
into this one.

304
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,208
By using human beings
as a kind of gateway, right?

305
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,458
I don't believe this.

306
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,041
[DUX]
Tokyo's become a hunting ground,

307
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,291
overflowing with monsters
created solely

308
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,791
to capture and murder
the Heroic Lineage.

309
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,666
Okay, but what do we do?

310
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,166
[DUX] Survive. That's
the only thing that matters.

Against those things?
Easier said than done!

312

There is a way.

313
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,166
You must destroy Tokyo.

Once the city is gone,

they won't be able to open
any more gates.

317

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,291
She is no longer the person
you once knew.

326
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't understand.

327
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,833
What I'm saying is we're both
Defenders of the Heroic Lineage.

328
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,083
We arrived here
during The Great Collapse.

329
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,791
But if that's true,

330
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,208
When you showed up at the dojo,
you were already...

331
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,833
[EOKI]
Cerdid, yes.

332
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,333
I merely pretended
to be Morizono.

333
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,791
Then whatever happened
to the real Eiko?

334
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,208
You're lying!

335
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,625
Even after the red mist,
Tsubasa never acted differently

336
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,125
until today!

337
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,958
Some of us have been awake
since the very beginning.

338
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,291
Others were asleep
and completely unaware,

339
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,583
like Aero.

340
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,125
But she was finally revived,

341
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,625
thanks to the waves
created by Chihiro.

342
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,125
You did this?
I should've known.

343
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,125
Of course you're
the one to blame.

344
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,041
How many people
do you have to kill

345
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,250
before you're satisfied?!

346
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,125
If it wasn't for you...

347
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,458
Turn her back!

348
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,291
Give my Tsubasa
back to me now!

349
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,375
[KOUME]
Will you shut up?

350
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,083
Keep on yelling and I'll throw
your asses outta here!

351
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,583
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,
but I'm--

352
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,833
Just tell me where
I can find Tsubasa.

353
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,833
All I can say for now
is she's nowhere.

354
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,000
You mean she's dead?

355
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,166
Not even we know
the answer to that.

356
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,708
The fate of those we switch with
remains unknown.

357
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,541
[KAKIHARA] You're going
to leave me alone in this world?

358
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,166
Of all people.

359
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,666
You always asked me
the same question.

360
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,000
Why was it necessary
to stubbornly pursue Kamina?

361
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,166
But I never gave you
a straight answer, did I?

362
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,708
Is this all my fault then?

363
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,208
Did this happen 'cause
I wouldn't stop following him?

364
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,500
What am I saying?

365
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,416
Chihiro Kamina's to blame!

366
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,833
I will avenge you!

367
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,791
Until I get my answers
and everything becomes clear,

368
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,708
I'll hold on,
even if it kills me!

369
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,458
[CHIHIRO]
How is he?

370
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,083
[INUKI] His transformation
has been halted.

371
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,458
Poor Ikuro.

372
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,166
For quite a while now,

373
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,166
I've been taking in
people like your friend

374
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,375
who have partially merged

375
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,958
with creatures
from different worlds.

376
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,916
Can he be cured?

377
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,041
It's not like flipping on
a switch, you know.

378
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,416
Hold up.

379
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,875
You can help him, right?
You must know something.

380
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,541
Don't be ridiculous.

381
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,166
The only thing we know for sure

382
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,916
is that we were summoned
from beyond.

383
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,916
[INUKI]
By the Great Collapse?

384
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,125
Yes.

385
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,958
[INUKI] We've discovered
that humans have

386
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,833
an unidentified gene
within them.

387
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,958
It's known as the Arcana gene.

388
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,750
[CHIHIRO]
Never heard of it.

389
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,708
The eternal scientific question
we've never been able to answer

390
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,416
is "what makes up the soul?"

391
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,250
Apparently, this gene is related
to some spiritual quality.

392
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,333
You all possess the Arcana gene.

393
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,708
However, creatures
from other dimensions

394
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,125
and worlds do as well.

395
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,916
They resonate with one another.

396
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,541
When that resonance strengthens,

397
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,791
entities from different worlds
cross over to our dimension.

398
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,708
They use humans
with strong connections

399
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,000
to their Arcana genes,
turn them into gates

400
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,666
and enter into this world.

401
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,250
And if you're not
a complete idiot,

402
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,250
you can guess why.

403
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,750
Because of the Great Collapse.

404
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,625
While there are some
who can coexist

405
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,875
with their human forms,
similar to Cerdid and Aero,

406
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,125
those who cannot withstand
being used as gates

407
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,791
seem to vanish,
turning into a red mist.

408
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,416
Ikuro. He's not gonna vaporize
like the others, is he?

409
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,791
We'll keep treating him.

410
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,166
There's got to be a cure.

411
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,125
Who're wearing
the lab coats here?

412
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,083
Like he said,
we're working on it!

413
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,916
I'm so sorry.

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,375
[CHIHIRO]
Is this my fault?

415
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,250
Were you hurt just because
of your involvement with me?

416
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,333
[DUX]
And if that's true?

417
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,500
[gasps]

418
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,750
[DUX] There's a cloud
of death that follows you,

419
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,250
enveloping anyone
who gets close enough.

420
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,708
[echoing]
Ikuro!

421
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,333
[DUX]
Such a tragedy.

422
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,333
Everything disappears and
all that ever remains is you.

423
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,625
-Alone.
-Show yourself!

424
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,416
You can't deny
it's all your fault.

425
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,333
No way! I didn't want this!

426
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,750
Then what is that
you're gripping in your hand?

427
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,125
[screams]

428
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,041
[shatters]

429
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,958
[DUX]
It was the same back then.

430
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,250
Don't do this. Make it stop!

431
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,916
[DUX]
Yes.

432
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,708
Ever since that day, your hand
has been stained with blood.

433
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,875
[CHIHIRO]
Forgive me.

434
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,666
You seek salvation?

435
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,375
Even inevitable tragedies
are sometimes worthy

436
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,083
of thunderous applause.

437
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,291
That is,
as long as the tragedies

438
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,583
you invite have meaning.

439
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,833
[CHIHIRO]
What?

440
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,000
Though your hands
are stained with blood

441
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,458
and everything
around you is destroyed,

442
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,750
as long as
there is hope beyond it,

443
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,291
the blood you spill
will shape the future.

444
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,416
There's no running away
from your fate.

445
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,791
You can't escape.

446
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,833
If you insist
on seeking forgiveness...

447
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,833
you must choose.

448
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,583
Don't go! Dux, wait!

449
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,416
-Something wrong?
-Where did she go?

450
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Huh?

451
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,666
Uh... Chihiro! You're bleeding!

452
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,000
[KOUME]
Of all the places

453
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,333
you could've injured yourself,
a hospital?

454
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,625
What? Hold on.

455
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,458
This isn't a wound.
At least it's not fresh.

456
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,166
Looks like it's from
a long time ago.

457
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,666
[grunts]
Don't touch me!

458
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,250
What's your problem?

459
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,625
Sorry. I overreacted.

460
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,083
Yeah. I'll say.

461
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,625
So long as it has meaning.
Right?

462
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,750
-What?
-[EOKI] Hmm?
