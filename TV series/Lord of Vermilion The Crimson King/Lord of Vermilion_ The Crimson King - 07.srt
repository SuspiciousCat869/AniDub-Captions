00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,583
What matters is that
you were by his side

until the end.

Death is not the final chapter.

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,458
The body changes forms,
becoming red stones.

9
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,333
Chaos controls
the Heroic Blood

10

and makes them fight
against each other...

in hopes that
they'll destroy one another.

They desire our extinction.

If they succeed,
then the world will end.

Everything will be destroyed.

Tokyo must fall

Only one of you can survive.

They will be

Only one of us?

Who would be
a better representative

What if he's the one?

23
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,291
The Lord of Vermilion.

24
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,208
Will I be able to beat him?

25

We should be celebrating.

That makes one less
Heroic Blood in this world.

29

Oh! And choosing to liquefy
the doc was exquisite,

30
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,583
I gotta say.

[GRUMMAN] We're making
the final adjustments

to the experiment.

33

The day of
the Second Great Collapse

34
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,583

-For that to happen...
-I know.

37
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,250
The process requires even more
human lives to be sacrificed.

38
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,083
-But...
-Our immediate goal should be

the slaughter
of the remaining Heroic Blood.

00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,791
Imagine if they interfered.

41
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,541
How inconvenient that would be.

42
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,458
Sounds like
you're hungry for more.

43
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,000
The good news is
they're in a weakened state.

44
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,583
So what better time to strike?

45
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,791
The newbie agrees
with me, right?

46
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,875
Uh? Totally. Why wait?

47
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,125
Hmm.

48
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,791
[GRUMMAN] Do you share
this sentiment, Yuri?

49
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,791
I do.

50
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,333
Very well, then.

51
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,291
Go kill them all.

52
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,375
Bring death
to the Heroic Lineage.

53
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,916
I'm pumped.
What's our strategy?

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Do we split up?
And who do we kill first?

55
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,833
We'll start
with Chihiro Kamina.

56
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,583
Although, we won't give him
a quick death.

57
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,125
He took my brother from me.

58
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,875
Only after we inflict
unspeakable suffering

59
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,916
will we put him
out of his misery.

60
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,500
-You're not invited.
-Huh?

61
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,208
Your personal feelings
would get in the way.

62
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,250
Haru and I will handle this.

63
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,875
-Let's head out.
-You got it!

Inuki.

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,125
As long as you never quit,
you'll find a solution.

66
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,125
The future's not written
in the stars!

67
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,583
Make it your own!

68
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,750
I wish I was more like you.

69
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,333
Huh.

00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,083
Shiraki. Hi.

Thank goodness.

Please. I want to hear
what's on your mind.

74
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,458
No, I think
you should go first.

75
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,375
It's good to see you again.

76
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,333

I don't know why,
but for some reason,

79
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,958
every time I come here,

80
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,916
it fills me
with a sense of peace.

81
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,291
I know what you mean.

82
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,416
Whenever I need to think
or clear my head,

83
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,791
I always wind up here.

84
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,958
You know, I was hoping that
I would get to see you today.

85
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,541
[CHIHIRO]
I felt the same.

86
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,875
Here. Try it.

87
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,291
I've been experimenting
with the recipe,

88
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,375
hoping to recreate the flavor.

89
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,625
Be honest.

90
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,916
It's really good.

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Yeah, but it's not quite right.

92
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,708
I still feel like
it's missing something.

93
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,750
A gentle, calming taste.

94
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,125
The way your mother made it.

95
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:53,791
That's right.

96
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,500
Everything happened
because of my mother.

97
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,541
I'm sorry?

98
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,208
It's what you said before.

99
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,416
Tell me.
What did you mean by that?

100
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,666
Are you sure?

101
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,291
I want to know.

102
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:21,875
Your Mother's name
was Professor Mitsuki.

103
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,916
She'd been working
with Father.

104
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,416
That is, until the accident
13 years ago.

105
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,208
We were here
the day it happened.

106
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,541
[gasps]

107
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,291
[YURI] I have no idea
what kind of experiment

108
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,291
was being conducted.

109
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,958
But whatever they were testing,
it ended in failure.

110
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,458
Your mother vanished,

111
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,666
swallowed up by another world.

112
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,916
Everything changed that day.

113
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,625
My father stopped being kind.

114
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,416
He wouldn't even
look me in the eye.

115
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,458
It was around that time
he started using Tokyo

116
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,333
to open gates
into other worlds.

117
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,541
And there was you.

118
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,083
You stopped visiting this place
after the accident.

119
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,791
I wanted to search for you,
but my father wouldn't allow it.

120
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,625
I learned the truth
about your father recently.

121
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,708
But while you were gone,
I was so lonely.

122
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,916
I've missed you.

123
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,541
But...

124
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,708
I had no choice
except to live my life

125
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,583
the way my father demanded.

126
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,708
Being by his side
is where I belonged.

127
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,291
The thing is,
he saw me as a vessel,

128
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,291
a carrier of Heroic Blood.

129
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,166
Not as Yuri, his daughter.

130
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,833
He forced me to fight
against other vessels.

131
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,916
When we were finally reunited,
I was ordered to kill you.

Sometimes I wonder
how it got this far.

168
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,583
[KOTETSU]
Wow! This is great.

169
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,041
[TSUBAKI] It's one
of the best views of Tokyo.

170
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,791
Too bad only those of us
inside the mist can see it.

171
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:23,500
On my top scenic spots list,
this ranks at number eight.

172
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,541
[KOTETSU]
And how big is this list?

173
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,083
Big. I'll show you all of 'em.

174
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,875
We can find new ones.

175
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,041
Places I haven't seen yet.

176
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,125
[KOTETSU chuckles]

177
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,958
[KOTETSU]
I sure could use some food.

178
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,625
Yeah? I've got
a restaurant list too.

179
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,791
[chuckles]

180
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,375
[CHIHIRO]
What should I do?

181
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,416
How can I stop my dream
of Kotetsu from becoming real?

182
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,458
[YURI]
Father.

183
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,083
[CHIHIRO]
Good. You're still here.

184
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,583
Chihiro?

185
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,375
I need your help.

186
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,208
[HARU]
Ugh. My stomach's growling.

187
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,166
How much longer
do we have to do this?

188
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,666
Not like we're gonna
learn anything

189
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,541
watching them flirt
from a distance.

190
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,833
Let's grab him
and hit the drive-thru.

191
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,750
That girl is with
the Guardian State.

192
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,916
Huh?

193
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,333
[JUN] She's in the way
of our mission.

194
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,208
Guess we'll have
to kill her too.

195
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,041
-A dream?
-Mm-hmm.

196
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,625
And they play out the same way.

197
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,416
It's red, then I see
someone important in my life.

198
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,166
The worst part is, in the
dream they're always dead.

199
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,125
First, Kotetsu's dad.

200
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,291
After that, I saw Inuki.

201
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,625
Later on, they were both killed.

202
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,458
It became reality.

203
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,708
So they're prophecies?

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,750
This one was about Kotetsu.

205
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,083
He's like a brother to me
and the only family I have left.

206
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:23,500
It's ridiculous,
thinking dreams control us.

207
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,375
But I can't stop feeling

208
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,250
like they're more
than just nightmares.

209
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,583
Yeah, I know. Not like
anyone would believe me.

210
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,291
So why?
Why are you telling me?

211
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,333
Because you opened up to me.

212
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,125
Told me about your life

213
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,375
and helped me piece
together some of mine.

214
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,541
And I guess
because you're you.

215
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,041
Thank you.

216
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,250
If it turns out to be fate

217
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,333
and the future
can't be changed,

218
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,875
I still have to try.

219
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,541
I can't lose Kotetsu.

220
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,625
Honestly...

221
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,000
what I think is
you can fight back

222
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,958
against whatever stands
in your way.

223
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,708
As long as you have the courage
to face your fears,

224
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,666
then change is possible.

225
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,916
At least I hope so.

226
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,083
I'm just curious.

227
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,583
If you did know something,
you would tell me, right?

228
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,750
[YURI sighs]

229
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,500
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

230
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,333
No. It's all right.

231
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,750
Listen...

232
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,291
-[phone ringing]
-Uh!

233
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,583
[KOTETSU over phone]
Chihiro! We need your help!

234
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,666
Where are you?

235
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,250
You got here so quick.
Did you run all the way?

236
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,333
[TSUBAKI] Now I owe Chihiro
for saving my life.

237
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,291
Thanks for treating us.
But you know what's crazy?

238
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,125
How Kotetsu and I
both forgot our wallets.

239
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,750
Weird, huh?
Never happening again.

240
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,375
[CHIHIRO] Your call
really had me worried.

241
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,958
Know what'll give you
a guaranteed heart-attack?

242
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,625
Getting the check and realizing
you can't pay for it.

243
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,833
So maybe I exaggerated
a little bit.

244
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,041
Are you upset?

245
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,458
I'm glad you're okay.

246
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,083
Come on, Chihiro.

247
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,416
There's no need
to get worked up.

248
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,458
What the hell
is he doing here?

249
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,750
Now our whole plan
to beat them down is ruined.

250
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,916
[JUN laughing]

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,791
Huh? What's so funny?

252
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,416
[JUN]
It's all so predictable.

253
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,041
I swore I'd take my time
torturing him.

254
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,833
But I'm too damn impatient
to let him walk.

255
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,583
He won't escape me.
I'll tear him limb from limb.

256
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,708
You can handle the woman.
Can't you?

257
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,416
Yeah. I-I won't let you down.

258
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,666
Come on, Chihiro,
I'm sorry.

-Kotetsu!

-Hold it!
-[TSUBAKI grunts]

263
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,416
Don't worry.
Your boyfriend's in good hands.

264
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,791
[JUN]
What're you waiting for, Kamina?

265
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,916
Or have you already
written off your friend?

266
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,125
Wanna fight? Fine!

267
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,833
I'm not gonna go easy on you,
even if you are a woman.

268
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,583
Akira would try
and talk me out of it,

269
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,666
but you need to be
shut up for good.

[groans]

274
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,625
Let him go!

275
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,166
It's too late. Run.

276
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,541
[JUN]
Don't think of moving!

277
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,250
Otherwise, this is going
straight through his heart.

278
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,208
[groaning]

279
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
Painful, isn't it?

280
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,416
But I haven't even started
with you yet.

281
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,583
He suffered
an unspeakable death.

282
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,541
All for the likes
of this trash.

283
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,750
There was no need for him
to shorten his life.

284
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,958
He deserved
a more respectable end!

285
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,208
He wasn't like me!
He was...

286
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,583
You mean Inuki?

287
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,416
His blood's on your hands!

288
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,875
You used him to selfishly
feed your power!

289
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,625
You're wrong!
I wanted to save Inuki!

290

Don't say another word!

291
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,916
You don't deserve
to speak his name!

than you look but just as dumb.

Sorry. There's no way
you're surviving!

Or not.

Huh? Huh!

Where's Kotetsu?

I'm here. Hey.

I'm sorry, Chihiro.

Everything's okay.

I refuse to stand by
and do nothing.

Whatever the consequences.

314
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,666
But you helped us.

315
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,083
You can't go back now.

316
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,916
I know. It's fine.

317
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,500
It's not. You just saved
both of our lives.

318
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,041
It's my turn to save you.

Listen...

320
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,458
I want you
to come along with us.

Please.
