[JULIA]
You want to apologize?

3
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,916
In case you forgot,
we lost a valuable warrior.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,166
Surely you understand
now, Tsubaki.

5
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,666
It's impossible to work
alongside these sinners.

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,750
I only wish we didn't have
to lose a teammate to prove it.

7
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,083
They're our enemies.
Nothing more.

You're wrong! We're your allies!

Allies, is it?

10
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,041
You were just betrayed
by a woman

11
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,333
you were convinced
was on your side.

12
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,541
Yuri didn't.

-These are--
-[SURUGA] What, exactly?

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,666
Kurokami is dead because of you.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,250
And you think giving us a stone
will earn you forgiveness?

[SHOKO] A shame
things didn't go as planned.

38
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,166
But what did you expect,
befriending an Agent of Chaos?

39
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,958
Fate is carved in stone.
There's no way to alter it.

40
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,333
Our relationship with the
Guardian State is beyond repair.

41
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,541
So what now?

42
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,583
I don't know.

43
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,500
You better think of something!

44
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,958
Kurokami died
because she trusted you!

45
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,666
And your answer
is "I don't know?"

46
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,333
How many will it take
before you're satisfied?

How many
do you have to kill?

48
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,583
I'm sorry, but... I don't--

49
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,958
[KAKIHARA] You're sorry?
Then fix this!

00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,583
[grunts]

51
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,916
I was never willing to depend

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
on the Guardian State
to begin with.

53
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,041
As I've always said,
destroying Tokyo

54
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,500
is the only way
to save the world.

55

[KOUME] Kotetsu. Give me
Kurokami's blood crystal.

00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,166
Huh? Oh. Okay.

57
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,125
And just where are you going?

58
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,791
To continue
with Inuki's research.

59
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,125
If you want to save the world,

60
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,625
then this is how
we're gonna do it.

We're leaving.
Come on.

62
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,041
I have my own method
of handling things.

-What? You can't.
-Kakihara, wait up.

64
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,000
[SHOKO] Don't you understand
your noble calling?

65
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,583
How can you turn
your back on it?

66
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,875
Destroying Tokyo's the only way!

67
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,958
Otherwise, we're all doomed!

68
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,291
Is that what you want?

69
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,083
[KAKIHARA]
She left us with our best lead.

70
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,333
Let's see if we can't uncover
what she's been working on.

71
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,833
[TSUBASA]
It's a list.

72
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,416
These are properties
owned by AVAL.

73
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,125
All the land the Foundation's

74
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,666
been forcibly acquiring
around the city.

75
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,666
Most likely, Kurokami
discovered something

76
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,250
at one of these locations
and was killed for it.

77
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,208
It's up to me
to avenge her death.

78
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,083
This is where we part ways.

79
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,708
You can do whatever you want.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
After everything
we've been through?

81
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,458
You and I are a team,
and I'm not abandoning you.

82
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,375
What're you waiting for?

83
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,833
Let's go find out why AVAL
wanted those properties.

84
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,833
Right!

85
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,583
You have something to say,
well, here I am.

86
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,500
Or maybe you've
come here to kill me.

87
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,666
What? No! I...

88
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,041
I only wanted...

89
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,458
I'll bet you anything
you dreamed of my death.

90
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,416
Tell me that's not true.

91
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,583
[chuckles]
This is great news.

92
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,958
Now I finally get the chance
to cover one of the deaths

93
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,833
you're responsible
for firsthand.

94
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,583
How can you joke about this?

95
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,041
He has a point.

96
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,833
We ought to thank him
for bringing me the scoop.

97
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,083
We're usually the ones that have
to chase down the story leads.

98
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,041
You realize
I don't want you to die?

99
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,625
[chuckles]

100
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,625
You're going to make me weepy.

101
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,541
In all seriousness,

102
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,833
I see right through
your saint act.

103
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,583
You're doing this for yourself
and Yuri Shiraki.

104
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,083
You can't change fate unless
you can change your dreams.

105
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,583
And you can't change the fact

106
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,958
that it's your destiny
to kill one another.

107
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,541
You know what?
Maybe so.

108
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,041
You're a monster.

109
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,041
I'm delighted to hear that.

110
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,583
Now tell me about
how you killed your father.

111
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,541
I couldn't care less
if you hate me.

112
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,458
I don't have
to like you either.

113
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,166
It doesn't matter.

114
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,083
-I have to do something.
-Hmm?

115
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,750
[CHIHIRO]
Or nothing will be left.

116
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,708
We'll change our destiny.

117
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,958
We'll do it
for Inuki and Kurokami.

118
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,083
They trusted us
to carry on their mission!

119
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,833
-[KAKIHARA scoffs]
-Uh...

120
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,208
Kakihara!

121
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,541
If you don't want to die,
here's a suggestion.

122
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,041
Stay as far away
from me as possible.

123
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,250
Don't come near him again,
you hear me!

124
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,791
I didn't recognize his eyes.

125
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,791
They belonged to someone
trying to live.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,250
Not the Chihiro Kamina
I've been pursuing.

127
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,333
[GRUMMAN] Our goal
is progressing smoothly,

128
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,708
but it's likely
we've been discovered.

129
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,791
I want you to tighten security.

130
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,291
Lay out a trap and put
the Church out of their misery.

131
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,583
[JUN] As long as
Chihiro Kamina is mine.

132
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,291
No, Jun. Your judgment
has been clouded by hate.

133
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,208
[scoffs]

134
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,125
[HARU]
Hey! Wait up!

135
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,708
[GRUMMAN] He's a fool.
Though he has a point.

136
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,958
Chihiro Kamina continues
to be a thorn in our side.

137
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,416
[chuckles]

138
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,833
Almost tempting your daughter
to leave us, for example.

139
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,000
[grunts]

140
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,458
[GRUMMAN]
That's not the issue.

141
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,708
The problem is an alliance
was nearly formed

142
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,833
between the Church
and the Guardian State.

143
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,208
And at the center of this plot
was Chihiro Kamina.

144
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,375
The boy managed
to temporarily unite

145
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,000
the Heroic Lineage.

146
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,166
He may have what it takes
to become the Lord of Vermilion.

147
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,291
I hope you're safe.

148
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,041
-[TSUBAKI] Kakihara's next?
-[KOTETSU] Guess so.

149
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,333
Chihiro said
that's what he dreamt.

150
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,625
[TSUBAKI] He'll fight
and try to stop it.

151
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,875
So what should we do?

152
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,541
That depends on
who you're asking right now.

153
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,916
A member of the Guardian State
or Tsubaki?

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,250
Huh?

155
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,291
I don't mind
helping out a friend.

156
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,916
We are friends, aren't we?

157
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,833
[KAKIHARA] What did you
stumble on, Kurokami?

158
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,791
The message
she left Tsubaki Manazuru

159
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,333
was her last communication.

160

No.

to eliminate the barriers

What did you want to tell me?

[KAKIHARA] Huh?
Is that some kind of a joke?

You're the one
who's following me, kid.

[CHIHIRO]
I just want to protect you.

176
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,750
The thought of dying
doesn't bother me at all.

177
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,291
Matter of fact,
it's been a long time coming.

out of their money problems.

Suicide.

181
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,833
I was supposed to die with them.

182
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,875
In the end, they abandoned me.

I was a precocious brat.

I could tell my parents
were never really fond of me.

Well, what about you?

Why'd you refuse to die
with your old man?

190
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,875
Your father wanted
to take you with him.

You were so reluctant
to die yourself,

194

195
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,000
Time to finally admit it.

196
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,500
You murdered him
so that you could live!

197
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,416
I don't care about living!

You what?

199
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,916
[CHIHIRO] I have no memory
of what happened that day.

200

But ever since,
it's been endless suffering.

Not knowing if I was
responsible or not.

202
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,958
I wished I'd died.

203
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,541
Or that I could have
traded places with him.

204
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,166
But there has to be some
good reason I'm still alive!

205
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,875
That's it.
The reason I can't die yet.

206
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,791
There they are.
Those eyes.

207

They were darker
than a moonless night,

no matter how carefree
you tried to act.

209

Filled with regret
and despair.

210
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,166
Even though
you murdered your father,

211
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,875
you still sought redemption.

212
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,000
I could tell.

213
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,083
You craved it.

214
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,000
More than anything.

215
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,833
If you're going to despair,

216
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,916
you should've just died
beside him.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,708
And if you do want to live,
stop looking so damn hopeless!

I don't care who forgives you.

it won't be me!

At least, that's what
I used to believe.

Now you have the eyes of a man
interested in living.

Because I wanted
to find answers.

You are a journalist,
aren't you?

Then shouldn't you be open
to finding out the truth?

[KAKIHARA chuckles]

If I'm being honest,
I don't know why

238
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,541
I opened up like that.

I'm out here at night

I'm no journalist.

there are seven on the map.

new barriers instead of relying
on what's already here.

322
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,208
You'll see.

323
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,708
[KAKIHARA grunts]

324
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,208
What're you doing?

325
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
I hear the incessant wailing
of your soul.

326
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,250
Shut your mouth!

327
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,666
[groans]

328
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,333
You're just one more note
in my symphony.

329
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,833
Play it for me.
The Rhapsody of Death!

330
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,125
[KAKIHARA grunts]

331
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,833
[CHIHIRO]
Kakihara!

332
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,291
Cerdid!

333
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,791
Nobody lays a finger on Chihiro!

334
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,333
You... saved me.

335
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,125
Making you admit your guilt
was my life's purpose.

336
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,666
The thing that kept me going.

337
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,541
I didn't have the strength
to acknowledge

338
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,791
my own parents
had rejected me.

339
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,041
If you love somebody,
you should take them with you.

340
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,041
I couldn't bring myself
to forgive you

341
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,583
for refusing to die
beside your father.

342
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,250
Now I see that I was wrong
all this time.

343
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,250
I lost sight of the--

344
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,458
-[grunts]
-Kakihara!

345
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,625
Run, Chihiro! Go now!

346
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,791
Listen, you didn't kill
your father.

347
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,291
I reviewed the case
documents again.

348
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,333
[KAKIHARA] He must have
returned to his senses

349
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,083
after he was stabbed.

350
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,666
He feared what he'd become

351
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,000
and knew what he had to do
in order to save you.

352
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,875
So you wouldn't end up
being a murderer.

353
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,916
So you could continue to live.

354
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,125
Are you telling me
the truth right now?

355
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,250
You did not kill your father!

356
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,833
Kark!

357
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,625
-[grunts]
-Kakihara!

358
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,625
[KOTETSU]
Chihiro. Are you okay?

359
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,958
Kotetsu!

360
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,000
That's the same man
who killed Kurokami!

361
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,708
Then that bastard's
going to pay.

362
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,000
-We're not letting him escape!
-You got it.

363
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,958
That's all for today.

364
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,166
Where do you think
you're going?

365
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,083
Cerdid.

366
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,916
You mean that he's...

367
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,500
[KAKIHARA]
You should feel honored.

368
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,500
Looks like I gave my life
protecting you.

369
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,041
It's a bit out of character,
if you ask me.

370
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,208
Or maybe I was jealous
all along.

371
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,416
-What?
-Nothing.

372
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,833
It's in the past now.
It's ancient history.

373
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,833
Turns out in the end,
you and I were the same.

374
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,791
It's fine.

376
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,750
[KAKIHARA]
Live.

377
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,000
Survive, Chihiro Kamina.

378
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,916
I have a message for you.

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,833
It's from Kurokami,
Inuki Akaya,

380
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,666
Tsubasa, and your father.

381
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,583
They wanted me to pass it on.

382
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,791
You have to keep living.
You hear me?

383
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,583
What about you?

384
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,083
There's a reason
you've made it this far, kid.

385
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,541
And hell, maybe I was
left alive this long

386
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,333
so I could have the chance
to get this off of my chest.

387
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,958
There's gonna come a time

388
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,750
you'll tell someone
what I told you.

389
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,041
[coughs]

390
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,875
Kakihara? Don't you die!

391
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,250
Tsubasa.

392
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,208
Father.

393
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,916
Mother.

394
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,666
You've got to hold on!

395
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,291
[CHIHIRO screams]

396
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,916
[DUX]
Another one lost.

397
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,166
Fate is truly unfaithful.

398
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,666
And yet somehow
Kotetsu was spared.

399
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,333
I chalked it up
as a rare blessing.

400
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,916
But then why tease us?

401
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,833
[SHOKO] Regardless,
at the rate we're going...

402
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,583
[DUX] Correct.
They'll be annihilated again.

403
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,791
Again?

404
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,375
Chaos's plan may still succeed,

405
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,208
regardless of whether
Tokyo is destroyed or not.

406
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,916
If the last one is connected,

407
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,791
there will be
a second Great Collapse.

408
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,750
And Chaos will reign.

409
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,083
I refuse to let that happen.

410
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,125
[DUX] The time has come
to settle this.

411
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,750
We cannot afford to retreat.

412
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,250
Soon, the Heroic Lineage
will be down to one.

413
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,000
Yes. I understand

414
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,125
Do it for
the splendid new world.
