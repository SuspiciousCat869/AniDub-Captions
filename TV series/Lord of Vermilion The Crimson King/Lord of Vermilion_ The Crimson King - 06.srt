Talk about a close call.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,750
Did you witness Jun Aoi
in the alley?

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,583
[TSUBAKI]
Nah. By the time I arrived,

6
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,958
all I saw was the victim
and his familiar.

7
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,583
Are you saying it was acting
independently of him?

8
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,541
What'd it look like?

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,125
Uh, I'm not sure
how I would describe it.

10
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,083
Other than the fact
that it was totally different

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,166
from the familiars
we've seen before.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,166
Yeah.

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,500
It also had the ability to
completely erase its presence.

[BOY 1] How're we supposed
to find this guy

00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,958
when all we have is a picture?

16

[BOY 2]
You're defying Jun's orders?

17

I never said that,
I'm just being real here.

18
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,041
And what's so special
about this guy?

19
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,208
Doesn't matter. Jun says
"find him," we find him.

20
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,041
Don't we get
any more details?

21
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,791
Like are we allowed
to kill this dude?

22
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,291
Negative. And if we
do run across him,

23
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,500
we're supposed to, quote,
"keep our distance."

Hey, I'm sorry I wasn't able
to answer the phone earlier.

32
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,416
So what was going on
over at the hospital?

[KOUME over phone]
Oh. I-It was nothing.

34
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,416
Well, is Inuki there?

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,333
Not at the present moment.

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,958
He... He stepped outside.

37
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,958
[CHIHIRO] I have a bad feeling
about this.

38
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,958
Like something's gonna happen
to him if we don't intervene.

39
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,541
You're being paranoid.

Everything is perfectly normal.

00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,375
[KOUME] He's just exhausted
from all the research

he's been conducting.

43
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,000
I suggest
you leave him alone.

[SHOKO over phone] Why are you
calling at this hour?

45
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,291
[CHIHIRO over phone] I need
to know if Inuki stopped

46
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,708
by the Church.

47
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,416
[SHOKO]
Not that I know of.

48
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,250
[CHIHIRO] Do me a favor.
Could you ask the others

49
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,583
to keep an eye out for him
in case he shows up?

that Inuki was going to die.

[SHOKO] A dream?
What're you talking about?

No matter how crazy it is,

as long as you never give up,

64

you can uncover

As long as I don't quit,
there's a way.

[KAKIHARA] I managed
to identify our traitor.

It's Inuki Akaya.

125
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,708
[KAKIHARA]
This is the orphanage, Hikari.

126
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,666
Both Inuki Akaya and Jun Aoi
were raised here.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It wouldn't be an exaggeration
to say they were like brothers.

128
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,083
So he was working
for Chaos the entire time.

No wonder he opposed
every decision the Church made.

Hold on a minute.

We can't determine
that he's a traitor

based on a single photo.

Guess who managed
the orphanage he was raised in.

134
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,000
None other than
the AVAL Science Foundation.

necessities to public works.

and illegal experimentation.

by Agents of Chaos.

beside him is his daughter.

[KOUME]
Yeah, that's right.

154
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,791

00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,083
our strategy to the other side.

156
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,250
[CHIHIRO]
But why?

157
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,666
He wanted to protect
the children of Hikari.

158
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,541
Remember the barrier
near the tower?

It's located
within the same area.

It was a facility used
