1
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,083
[GRUMMAN] You did well,
given the tight schedule.

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,583
Now that it's complete,

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,041
the Infinity Theater will become

4
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,333
a new symbol
of hope for Tokyo's future.

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,041
[FOREMAN]
Having Kaburagi Kark perform

6
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,750
at the unveiling ceremony
is rather extravagant.

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,333
The AVAL Science Foundation
is always striving

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,625
to bring joy and fulfillment
to the masses.

9
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,208
I trust his beautiful tones
will be able to reach everyone

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,416
who is in attendance?

11
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,083
A parting gift from my heart
to their ears.

12
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,166
It's really him.

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,583
Oh. By the way, Mr. Grumman.

14
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,041
What do you have planned
for this giant trapdoor

15
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,333
built into the stage?

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,958
Hmm.

17
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,833
This is
the ultimate performance.

18
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,125
So it requires
the ultimate spectacle.

19
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,041
Even now, I can hear
the sweet sound.

20
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,666
This is where the ending
will take place.

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,041
Individual notes
strumming together,

22
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,333
resulting in the awakening
of a new soul!

23
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,125
Smashing the vermilion
and offering up a requiem

24
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,833
that is fit for a king.

25
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,750
[motorcycle engine revving]

26
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,250
I did my best.
But I'm sorry to say,

27
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,833
Akira's the only one who's up
for joining our cause.

28
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,750
We thank you.
Both of you. Welcome.

29
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,083
Do you really know what
the Foundation's intentions are?

30
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:02,083
Yeah. Thanks to Kurokami
and Kakihara.

31
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,125
[TSUBAKI] I can't believe
he's dead, too.

32
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,625
For the longest time,
I hated that man.

33
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,083
He was always hounding Chihiro.

34
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,583
Turns out he was good.

35
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,666
It's not fair.

36
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,833
Our fight's far from over.

37
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,083
They forged the path.
Now the rest is in our hands.

38
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,291
We're going to put a stop
to Chaos's plans.

39
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,458
And survive, no matter what.

40
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,458
[SHOKO] I'm surprised a member
of the Guardian State

41
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,541
wants to work with us.

42
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,541
After what happened
to Marie Kurokami,

43
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,541
I would have figured
that they'd had enough.

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Really?
You're bringing that up now?

45
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,625
Akira and I both know
she acted on her own free will.

46
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,791
And we're doing
the exact same thing.

47
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,291
It has nothing to do
with the Guardian State.

48
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,750
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah? Well, right now,

49
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,541
we need all the help we can get.

50
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,958
I'm sure you do.

51
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,208
The six installed machines

52
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,125
are projecting barriers
around each other,

53
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,083
making them impossible
to destroy.

54
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,583
And once this Big Dipper
is completed,

55
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,291
there will be
a Second Great Collapse.

56
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,666
Your chances of surviving
afterward are practically zero.

57
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,958
Then we just have
to stop them

58
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,750
before they connect
to the final one.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,708
According to the information
Kakihara left me,

60
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,375
the last machine
will be installed

61
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,750
at the recently completed
Infinity Theater.

62
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,041
The performance hall
was built by AVAL.

63
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,583
-That puts any doubt to rest.
-[SHOKO giggles]

64
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,041
Kakihara was useless
when he was alive,

65
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,083
but in the end,
he actually helped us out.

66
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,875
-[CHIHIRO] You find that funny?
-What's this?

67
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,458
I figured his death would
bring you some sense of relief.

68
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,500
At long last, the nuisance
who kept digging

69
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,250
into your past is gone.

70
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,958
Don't start.

71
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,833
Before he died,
Kakihara told me to live.

72
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,041
The same as Inuki.

73
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,958
I'm going to fulfill their wish!

74
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,708
It's good to hear.

75
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,250
That you'll swing your blade,

76
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,541
and without
the slightest bit of hesitation.

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,916
Even if Yuri Shiraki is among
the enemies you'll be facing.

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,458
You need to work
on your motivational speeches.

79
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,000
Ignore her.

80
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,208
Nothing's going to make me quit.
I promise.

81
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,500
I'll change fate
with my own hands.

82
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,416
It's time.

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,000
Gentlemen, the Second
Great Collapse is upon us.

84
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,875
While the plan we've adopted
with Kark is infallible,

85
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,583
we still can't let
our guard down.

86
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,583
The final battle.
What about Yuri?

87
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,833
[GRUMMAN]
She is of no use to us.

88
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,458
Speaking of dead weight,
what about you-know-who?

89
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,666
Guess they're saving
their strength?

90
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,958
[DRAYLE laughs]

91
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,375
How disappointing
if they turn out to be

92
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,500
even more useless than Yuri.

93
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,000
You're talking about Chiyu,
my masterpiece.

94
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,583
Don't you dare compare
the two of them.

95
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,583
[DRAYLE]
Oh-ho! Scary.

96
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,583
Even your own daughter, huh?

97
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,166
Meaning?

98
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,625
You're so eager to abandon
your experimental subjects.

99
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,625
-Without a second thought.
-My test subjects?

100
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,083
[GRUMMAN chuckles]

101
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,666
I'm not in the habit
of remembering my failures.

102
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,500
If you don't want
to be scrapped,

103
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,875
you'd better show me
how useful you can be too.

104
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,958
Give me the chance.
Let me kill Chihiro Kamina.

105
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,666
You'll be defending
the other six locations.

106
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,291
But that's absurd!

107
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,833
If the Heroic Lineage wants
to destroy the last machine,

108
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,458
Kamina's guaranteed
to show up!

109
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:34,166
Grumman. This doesn't make
any sense!

110
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,958
-I want some answers!
-[DRAYLE laughing]

111

[DRAYLE]
He really doesn't get it.

112
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,375
I'll spell it out for you.

113
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,916
One of us might
ignore protecting

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,833
the artificial keystone.

115
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,791
Especially if they're
more preoccupied

116
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,708
with exacting their revenge.

117
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,666
My decision is final
and not up for debate.

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,541
[HARU]
Hold on, Jun! Wait up!

119
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,000
[JUN] That may have been
the only chance I had.

120
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,541
I should've killed you
the moment you stood in my way.

121
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,541
Chihiro Kamina would be dead,
and I could move on.

122
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,041
Instead I let you both live
because of my own weakness.

123
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,625
-Jun, wait!
-[JUN] Don't follow me.

124
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,791
This is your fault!

125
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,375
You've been talking
with Chihiro, right?

126
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,375
Then, lure him out of hiding
so Jun can finish him off!

127
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,958
Haru. I can't.

128
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:35,166
Don't you care about Jun at all?
What about how he feels?

129
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,750

Head band!
Hey. I gotta admit,

132
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,083
that's pretty bold of you
coming here without any backup.

133
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,208
Or drive off, that's cool.

-Hmm?
-[KOTETSU] What's it mean?

They're trying to create
the Second Great Collapse.

-[KOTETSU] We gotta stop it!
-Question.

He works for Chaos,
so why's he helping us?

141
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,666
A trap, obviously.

142
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,208
Maybe they're issuing
some kinda challenge.

143
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,416
Daring us to try and stop them.

144
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,291
[TSUBAKI]
Then they've underestimated us.

145
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,625
Yeah they did! Let's get 'em!

146
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,416
It won't be that simple.

147
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,958
Why is that?

148
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,583
[CHIHIRO]
It's a concert.

149
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,833
There'll be a lot of people
in attendance.

150
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,666
An audience. You mean...

151
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,458
Chaos is using them as hostages.

152
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:45,375
If we charge inside, they'll
transform them into monsters.

153
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,791
[KOTETSU]
That's messed up.

154
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,958
[SHOKO] If the Second
Great Collapse occurs,

155
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:53,583
Tokyo will be turned
into a hell, swirling with evil.

156
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,500
Sacrifices will have to be made.

00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,125
You agree with her?

160
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,208
Chihiro, the hostages.

161
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,708
We know they use
some kind of sound.

162
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,458
A resonance that forces
people to transform.

163
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,500
With a full house,
they'll most likely use

164
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,500
Kark's piano music
as the source.

165
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,083
We'll have to take him out
before he plays.

166
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,666
I see.
Great idea, Chihiro!

167
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,333
That might actually work!

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,791
[CHIHIRO]
There's no other way.

169
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,750
But one mistake and countless
people will end up dying.

170
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,833
What are my choices?
What can I do?

171
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,041
Is this the right answer?

172
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,500
[DUX]
Who will be the next to die?

173
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,583
[CHIHIRO] You can even appear
in people's dreams?

174
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,625
[DUX] Dreams?
You still don't understand.

175
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,750
[CHIHIRO]
I guess I don't.

176
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,250
[giggles]

177
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,125
You foolishly believed
that you could alter fate.

178
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,083
Yet Kurokami and Kakihara
are both gone.

179
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,625
Expectations cause suffering.

180
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,833
[CHIHIRO]
I'm not giving up yet.

181
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,291
You'll have to put
an end to Kark.

182
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,166
This is the first time
you've desired

183
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,791
the death
of another person.

184
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,250
Murderous intent.

185
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,291
And you used to find
the thought

186
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,833
of staining your hands
with blood detestable.

187
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,333
You've changed.

188
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,375
[CHIHIRO]
I won't ask for forgiveness.

189
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,916
I'm choosing to do this
of my own volition.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,416
This is my decision.

191
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,666
You sound confident
in your choice.

192
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,125
[CHIHIRO]
I'm not afraid anymore.

193
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,250
I can do it.

194
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,958

[buzzing, pulsing]

196
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,000
You shouldn't have come.

197
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,625
And you shouldn't be here
on guard duty.

198
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,166
You're fine with this?

199
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,708
You have your orders,
I have mine.

200
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,125
Go back to your post.

201
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,041
Tonight. Kamina will be there.

202
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,250
-I told them about our plan.
-You what?

203
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,583
I had to!

204
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,916
At this rate, you won't be
yourself anymore!

205
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,500
-Leave me.
-Just know--

206
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,833
I believe in you.

207

[MAN 1] It'll be starting soon.
Everything look good?

208
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,375
The audience have taken
their seats.

209
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,166
[MAN 2]
Let's sneak inside and listen.

210
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,083
We can't, idiot.
Jun's not here tonight.

211
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,458
No slackin' off.

Check it out!

[MAN 2] Huh? Are those people?
Th-They're flying!

00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,583
Seems we have
uninvited guests.

As long as Chihiro
keeps breathing,

232
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,958
Jun will never be able
to move on with his life!

233
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,333
Will you listen to me?

[HARU]
What the...

00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,958
It was some kind of illusion?

241
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,041
Kark!

242
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,708
[CHIHIRO] We need
a single surprise attack.

243
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,708
It's the only way to stop Kark
before he kills the audience.

244
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,000
So what do you have?

I won't let

by my hands!

will have your blood!

from the bottom of a deep abyss.

00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,250
the more wretchedly painted
the subject...

322
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,916
The more beautiful the death.

323
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,416
You're gonna die for that!

324
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,416
Shall I paint you too?

325
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Uhh!

326
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,500
Akira.

327
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,041
Haru.

328
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,666
I don't understand.

329
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,666
[KARK] How beautiful to watch
someone sacrifice themselves

330
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,541
to save the life
of the one they love.

331
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,791
However...

332
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,708
[BOTH groaning]

333
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,125
[KARK]
...it's even more beautiful

334
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,833
when it turns to despair.

335
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,916
Sorry.

336
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,750
[KARK laughing]

337
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,166
No more.

338
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,250
[KARK]
Chihiro Kamina.

339
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:45,125
The man who may have eventually
become the Lord of Vermilion.

340
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,500
Regrettably, you heard
my requiem,

341
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,625
same as the others.

342
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,500
Since your soul has been
purified to black by its melody,

343
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,041
you must meet your end too.

344
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,458
Death has arrived.

345
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,750
You've grown accustomed
to playing with human lives,

346
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,750
haven't you, Kaburagi Kark?

347
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,250
As if they're your toys.

348
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,166
That stops now.
Your life ends here.

349
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,750
Was that Chihiro?

350
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,208
No way.
That was someone different.

351
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,875
The Lord of Vermilion.

352
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,625
[roaring]

353
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,083
[KARK] Well, Kamina?
Don't keep me waiting.

354
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,625
Ahura Mazda.

355
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,208
Such power.

356
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,375
For the longest time,
I hesitated

357
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,458
to stain my hands with blood.

358
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,041
[shrieks]

359
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,500
[CHIHIRO] But I won't
hold back anymore.

360
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,916
Seems you have
forgotten one thing.

361
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,541
To whom do you think
Ahura Mazda's cry belongs?

362
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,000
That's right.
My adoring fans.

363
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:05,208
Are you willing to kill
thousands of lives to stop me?

364
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,583
It's not as if
they can turn back now.

365
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,333
Are you sure about that?

366
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,916
What if I told you
there was a way to save them?

367
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,416
And if there is,
you can't kill me.

368
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,375
-[KOTETSU] Chihiro!
-[KOUME] No!

369
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,166
People are so predictable.
So weak.

370
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,291
They cling to
a faint glimmer of hope,

371
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,166
then despair when it fails.

372
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,208
The only comfort
for them is death.

373
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,916
-[CHIHIRO] Including you?
-[KARK] Huh?

374
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,458
If becoming the Lord
of Vermilion requires

375
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,625
spilling more blood
then so be it.

376
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,208
And let forgiveness be damned.

377
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,000
That's my burden!

378
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,875
[shrieking]

379
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,750
[chuckles]

380
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,458
Much stronger than I expected.

381
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,625
You truly are the supreme one.

382
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,875
[rumbling in distance]

383
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,458
[SHOKO] The victory was mine.
Mine alone.

384
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,750
Are you watching, Dux?

385
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,333
Did you see me?
I'm the chosen one!

386
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,750
[chuckles]

387
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,208
This is the finale.

388
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,583
Kark!

389
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,000
Show yourself!

390
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,541
I'd very much like to see
what kind of world you'd create,

391
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,500
but granting you death
offers me far greater joy.

392
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,750
You won't want
to miss the encore.

393
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,458
Everything we worked so hard
to create has been ruined.

394
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,125
What should we do?
I need you to guide me, Chiyu.

395
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,875
Yes, my father.

396
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,666
Oh, thank you.

397
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,833
Thank you, Mitsuki.
