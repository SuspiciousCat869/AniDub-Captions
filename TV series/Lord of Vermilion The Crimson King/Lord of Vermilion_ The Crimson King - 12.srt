[GRUMMAN]
Are you watching, Mitsuki?

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,916
Your invention
is bridging the gap

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,541
between two different worlds.

5
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,500
Though we've been
separated for years,

6
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,583
our hopes will
finally become one.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,000
They've gone completely insane.

8
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,958
Tokyo won't last at this rate.

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,250
Guys, we have to put
a stop to them.

-[crackling in distance]
-Huh?

11
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,916
Kark!

12
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,291
[KARK] At last,
the gates have been opened.

13
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,750
And while I'm eager to depart
for the land I've yearned for,

14
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,666
leaving unfinished business
in this world

15
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,791
would ruin the experience.

16
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,875
Bring it!

17
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,541
[CHIHIRO]
Wait, Kotetsu.

18
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,791
I'm the one he wants to fight.

19
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,291
You three head to
the Foundation's headquarters.

20
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,875
No way!

21
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,916
We are not leaving you
to fight him all by yourself!

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,416
Just go!

23
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,583
[KOUME]
We should listen to Chihiro.

24
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,833
If we don't stop
whatever's causing this,

25
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,916
Tokyo's gonna be consumed.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,791
I'm going.

27
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,416
Otherwise, I won't be able
to face Inuki.

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,250
She's got a point.

29
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,416
Chihiro, please be careful.

30
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,666
I will. Same to you.

31
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,166
See you after we win.

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,958
We've got this
under control.

33
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,458
Apologies for the delay, Kark.

34
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,750
[KARK chuckles]

35
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,541
There's no need to worry.

36
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,541
It'd be in bad taste
if the god of death

37
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,708
was in the habit
of rushing final farewells.

38
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,458
I'm not planning on dying.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There's someone I have
to see before I go.

40
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,500
Regret is an anchor,
weighing down the soul.

41
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,958
The least I can do

42
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,500
is embellish it beautifully
with my requiem.

43
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,458
-[growling]
-Meet Jormungandr.

44
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,416
The Serpent god of death
that swallows the world.

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,000
Another beast?
Fine then!

46
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,541
The Lord of Vermilion demands
thousands of offerings.

[ghostly moaning]

49
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,750
[KARK] You're to blame
for everything,

50
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,083
Chihiro Kamina.

51
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,250
Listen to the grievances
of the people.

52
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,625
This is your chance
at redemption.

53
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,708
[grunting]

54
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,916
I told you once already,
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,708
Shouldering the burden
is my responsibility.

56
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,875
[chuckles]

57
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,333
Seeing as you're the closest

58
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,625
to becoming
the Lord of Vermilion,

59
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,375
your soul shall be mine.

60
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,625
Check it out.

61
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,000
[TSUBAKI]
That's AVAL's headquarters?

62
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,416
Looks nice from the outside,

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,208
but the location's
just terrible.

64
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,000
Grumman and Professor Mitsuki

65
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,291
once conducted
their research there.

66
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,875
You must act now.

67
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,875
They are attempting
to bring about the end.

68
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,958
[KOUME]
You're sure this is it?

69
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,708
-Kotetsu!
-Uh!

70
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,916
[DUX] If you want answers,
ask difficult questions.

00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,416
I leave the rest to you.

of this really affects her.

[TSUBAKI]
Densuke, go!

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,333
I'm second summer president.

The name's Tsubaki
"the Red" Manazuru!

77
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,958
Let's go!

00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,833

-Wow, yes, ma'am.

Let there be celebration
and praise.

Death is kind and precious.

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,625
Its beauty, so arresting.

[CHIHIRO]
Did I lose consciousness?

96
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,500
It's me?

97
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,541
[DUX]
Do you have to ask?

98
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,041
[CHIHIRO]
You mean...

99
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,958
[DUX giggles]

100
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,000
[DUX]
Don't worry. Not yet.

101
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,541
[CHIHIRO]
Good.

102
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,000
I can't leave this life
without completing my goal.

103
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,875
Still, my turn
is coming up regardless.

104
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,958
In what manner
would you like to die?

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,583
[CHIHIRO] You're the one who's
been giving me these dreams!

106
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,666
Was there a reason you filled
my head with illusions?

107
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,041
They were not illusions.

108
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,458
They're memories
from alternate timelines.

109
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,958
Reality is like a play.

110
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,750
Performed countless times,
over and over again.

111
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,833
Though the cast and ad-libbing
are different for each show.

112
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,291
And yet, the conclusion
never changes.

113
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,708
[CHIHIRO]
These are my memories?

114
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,708
[DUX] In other plays.
The dreams are a warning

115
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,333
to keep you from making
the same mistakes.

116
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,625
[CHIHIRO] Why me?
Why not help others!

117
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,125
Every time the curtain fell,

118
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,291
you raised another one
in its place.

119
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,375
I don't exactly know why,
but that is the reason.

120
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,208
[CHIHIRO]
In other words...

121
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,208
I've never been forgiven in any
of the plays I've appeared in.

122
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,875
I kept thinking
“maybe this next one.”

123
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,500
[chuckles]
How pathetic of me.

124
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,833
[DUX] Even the worst play
has its merits.

125
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,166
For example,
this is the first time

126
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,166
so many vessels
of Heroic Lineage have survived.

127
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,750
[CHIHIRO]
Can I change how this ends?

128
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,875
That is entirely up to you.

129
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,083
[TSUBAKI]
Densuke!

130
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,833
-You'll pay for that!
-We can't go rushing in!

131
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,375
[KOUME]
There's no end to them in sight.

132
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,500
[KOTETSU]
Koume, go on without us!

133
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,750
-[KOUME] What?
-[TSUBAKI] He's totally right.

134
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,791
He's totally wrong!

135
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,416
If we don't do this,
Tokyo will be destroyed.

136
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,791
Just remember.
We'll be counting on you!

137
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,166
I'm gonna be
so pissed if you die!

138
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,166
Well, we definitely drew
the short straw.

139
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,916
No way.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,166
Any time I get to spend alone
with you always makes me happy.

141
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,458
What? That's really sweet,

142
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,250
but do you think
now's the right time?

143
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,250
Sorry. I've never been great
at reading the room,

144
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,291
but I don't want any regrets.

145
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,916
[TSUBAKI] [giggles]
I think I can forgive you.

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,416
What do you say
we put this on hold?

147
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,958
You can tell me more
after we thin the herd.

148
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,916
Deal. I promise
I'll protect you.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,500
[KOUME]
Coming through!

150
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,791
Don't expect me to knock!

151
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,583
[GRUMMAN]
Kill them, Chiyu.

152
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,833
[CHIYU] If I'm not here
to manage the instruments,

153
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,250
odds are the device
will lose control.

154
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,791
That's fine.

155
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,041
If those pests close the gate
before I see Mitsuki,

156
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,041
all of this
will have been for nothing.

157
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,166
[distant explosion, rumbling]

158
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,166
It's time, my beloved daughter.

159
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,000
-[CHIYU] Sophistry.
-What was that?

160
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,708
Did you actually think
I was blind

161
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,583
to how you manipulate
the women in your life

162
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,708
by pretending you love them?

163
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,583
Me and Yuri
and Professor Mitsuki.

164
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,291
Whenever you talk about love,

165
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,000
it's only as a tool
to serve you and your vision.

166
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,041
And how could
a doll ever know?

167
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,916
Because... you mixed
the professor's DNA with yours

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,500
to create me
as a substitute

169
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,875
when you were no longer able
to have her by your side.

170
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,708
That's how I know.

171
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,541
I exist as both a version
of Professor Mitsuki

172
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,291
as well as you,
Aldo Grumman Shiraki.

173
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,625
The only person
you've ever loved is yourself.

174
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,375
You're wrong.
My heart belongs to Mitsuki.

175
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,833
One more thing.

176
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,000
While that may be true,
the Professor never loved you.

177
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,750
I don't think you need
to ask how I can tell.

178
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,250
[giggles]

179
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,416
Open the gate if you wish,

180
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,541
but she won't
be waiting for you.

181
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,250
You're not important to her.

182
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,708
She only wishes for one thing,
to return to her family.

183
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,375
Are you Mitsuki?

184
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,750
[grunts]
Stop, or else.

185
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,500
It's a fabrication.

186
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,625
You're lying.

187
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,666
[KOUME]
Huh?

188
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,916
I don't believe it.
I refuse to believe.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,750
[giggles]

190
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,666
You're just trying
to deceive me!

191
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,083
[laughing maniacally]

192
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,833
I see you're still
alive, defect.

193
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,125
You haven't changed one bit.

194
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,000
You've been looking
down your nose at me

195
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,791
since we were
at the orphanage.

196
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,208
-Think so?
-Out of the way, Chiyu!

197
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,041
Or don't blame me
when you get hurt!

198
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,000
Argh! You bitch!

199
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,708
[CHIYU] This was brought on
by the obsessions

200
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,291
of a foolish man.

201
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,375
And while there's no reason
for me to fulfill my duty,

202
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,458
a foolish woman's curiosity
compels me to press on

203
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,166
and see how this ends.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,791
[screaming]

205
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,916
We all have a reason
to fight, and that's mine.

206
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,833
[DUX] Moment by moment,
the wheel of fate turns.

207
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,583
[CHIHIRO] You're saying
we're all going to die?

208
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,083
It could end that way.

209
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,916
If so, I would simply go
and watch a new play.

210
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,875
[CHIHIRO] They entrusted me
with their dying wishes.

211
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,208
Inuki. Kurokami.
Kakihara. Shoko.

212
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,208
Even Jun fought against fate.

213
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,708
They weren't just following
the destiny

214
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,375
laid out before them.

215
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,375
They resisted!

216
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,125
So I won't give up either.

217
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,333
[DUX chuckles]

218
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,541
And what good will changing
the script do?

219
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,708
[CHIHIRO] I...
-[INUKI] Survive.

220
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,375
-Survive.
-Survive.

221
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,416
-Survive.
-Survive.

222
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,958
Survive.

223
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,083
Survive, Chihiro.

224
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,041
I'll keep on living!

225
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,666
[giggles]

226
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,458
The winds have
changed direction.

227
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,458
I won't stop fighting
until the very end.

228
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,625
I'm master of my own fate!

229
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,083
What?

230
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,750
[yelling]

231
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,250
[bellowing]

232
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,208
Impossible.

233
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,250
He's incinerating a god
that's supposed

234
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,750
to bring about the end.

235
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,208
[DRAYLE whistles]

236
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,166
Hey, that's not bad.

237
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,333
[KARK]
Lord of Vermilion.

238
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,791
No more distractions,
Kark. Fight me.

239
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,750
I've watched you burn gods
and destroy demons.

240
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,333
These are no longer
the deeds of a human being.

241
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,166
You've abandoned
your humanity.

242
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,666
You're mistaken, Kark.
It's the opposite.

243
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,958
I'm fighting
for those closest to me.

244
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,750
Their wishes
give me strength.

245
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,500
[KARK]
Your existence is an affront

246
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,333
to the gods of death.

247
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,333
You will never be forgiven!

248
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:30,208
Chihiro Kamina!
I will never forgive you!

249
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,791
Amadeus!

250
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,166
[screams]

251
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,750
My hands! What've you done?

252
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,375
Piano. Where's my piano?

253
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,291
Death comes to all of us.
Even you.

254
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,166
I was so close to his land.

255
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,666
Somebody,
play the piano for me.

256
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,833
Before I go, I want to hear
the ultimate requiem.

257
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,958
-Yah!
-Ah!

258
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,083
I don't think
there's much left in me.

259
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,041
Yeah, me neither. Is this it?

260
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,166
[growling]

261
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,250
[gasps]

262
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,166
I expected better. Disgraceful.

263
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,500
Are you or are you not a member
of the Guardian State?

264
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,625
Julia and Suruga? Why?

265
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,583
[JULIA]
Like I need to explain.

266
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,125
Our organization's purpose

267
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,625
is to protect the world
from evil spirits.

268
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,750
[SURUGA] We're simply performing
our sworn duties.

269
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,041
Thanks. You saved us.

270
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,375
Spare us your gratitude.

271
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,458
Destroy all demons!

272
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,666
Go, Gabriel! Exorcise them!

273
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,041
Go, Lia Fail! Crush them!

274
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,125
Don't underestimate me!

275
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,791
Come now. I've already
calculated your every movement.

276
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,666
Oh? Did you see this?

277
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,541
It's arrogant to assume

278
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,583
everything will go
exactly as you planned!

279
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,958
Because there are always
people in the world

280
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,125
who fight against
the impossible!

281
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,708
You're a defect.
Unworthy of challenging me.

282
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,500
There's no such thing
as a defective life!

283
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,208
Life's an obligation!

284
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,250
You have to struggle
against adversity,

285
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,750
no matter the cost!

286
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,750
That's why it's worth saving!

287
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,166
[grunts, breathing heavily]

288
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,833
If he were here,
that's what Inuki would say.

289
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,208
Now, stop the machine.

290
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,375
I can't.

291
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,750
[grunts]

292
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,708
That's enough.

293
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,416
I couldn't shut it down
even if I wanted to.

294
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,041
We've no other choice
but to accept our fate.

295
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,000
[GRUMMAN laughing]

296
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,166
That's what she gets
for mocking me.

297
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,666
No one can deceive me!
No one!

298
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,083
It won't be long now, Mitsuki!
I'm coming for you!

299
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,458
[DRAYLE laughing]

300
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,583
And much sooner
than you think!

301
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Mitsuki!
[screaming]

302
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,708
Told you!
[laughing]

303
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,666
[KOTETSU]
Did they stop it?

304
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,625
[DUX]
No. The mission failed.

305
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,166
The gate's beyond control
and will continue to expand.

306
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,500
Eventually, it will consume
the world.

307
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,625
It's over?

308
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,791
Not yet!
I refuse to give up!

309
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,166
There's gotta be a way!
You know something, don't you?

310
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,166
Tell me!

311
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,958
There is a possibility.

312
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,958
Just one.

313
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,166
The Lord of Vermilion
has several powers,

314
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,833
including the ability
to create new worlds.

315
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,291
As the candidate closest
to taking on this role,

316
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,000
it's possible for you
to erase the gate.

317
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,375
However...

318
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,666
Uh...

319
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,666
Yuri.

320
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,625
You're in a hurry.
Where are you going?

321
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,166
It's not too late. Step aside.

322
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,083
[YURI]
You don't want to answer me?

323
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,375
Fine. I already know the answer.

324
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,208
You plan to enter the gate.

325
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,166
As the Lord of Vermilion,
you'd be able to erase the gate.

326
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
However, it would require

327
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,541
countering one power
with another.

328
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,625
It would cost you your life.

329
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,500
But how do you know that?

330
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,750
Because someone was
kind enough to inform me.

331
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm not letting
you die, Chihiro.

332
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,375
The boy needs
to be stopped, Yuri,

333
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,500
and there's only one way
he can be saved.

334
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,458
By killing him!

335
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,916
It doesn't make sense!

336
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Tell me why you're so insistent

337
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,291
on throwing your life away?

338
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,125
I found the reason!

339
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,791
Why I was told
to keep on living!

340
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,875
Because as long as I'm alive,
I can keep using my life!

341
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,666
[YURI]
What're you talking about?

342
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,125
I don't understand any of this!

343
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,750
[CHIHIRO]
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,833
I've no idea who you are.

345
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,583
The real Chihiro
would never leave

346
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,458
without saying anything to me!

347
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,500
Please, Yuri! I have to!

348
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,625
You're not going!

349
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,958
Besides, I'll never
be forgiven anyway.

350
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,791
I killed Cerdid
with my own two hands, remember?

351
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,958
It's not your fault!
I was there!

352
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,833
She forced you
to defend yourself!

353
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,500
That doesn't change
the fact I killed her!

354
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:33,333
So I must take up her role
as your protector!

355
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,166
I'm not letting you die!

356
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,166
[grunts]
Listen to me! Stop, Yuri!

357
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,500
[YURI] There's no
turning back for me now!

358
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,041
But at least I can save you!

359
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,375
It's wrong.

360
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,875
This should have never happened.

361
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,375
I was reunited with you.

362
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,250
We drank hot cocoa
in the sun together.

363
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,666
And both of us were
at peace again.

364
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,375
Why couldn't those days
last forever?

365
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,875
Chihiro!

366
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,250
Yuri!

367
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,958
Why didn't you?

368
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,333
You are the most
important person in my life.

369
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,875
I could never bring myself
to kill you.

370
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,041
So you haven't changed.

371
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,541
You're still the same
Chihiro I remember.

372
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,458
That means...

373
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,500
I can't believe what I've done!

374
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,125
I'm sorry.
Could you ever forgive me?

375
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,500
It's fine. Really.

376
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,958
[YURI]
Do you have to?

377
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,000
[CHIHIRO] I'm sorry,
but I can't stay.

378
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,166
[YURI]
Okay, I won't stop you...

379
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,166
if you let me come along.

380
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,375
[CHIHIRO]
What?

381
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,458
I don't have
much strength left

382
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,000
but I know
if you take me with you,

383
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,666
I can still help you out.

384
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,083
I have to do this
by myself, Yuri.

385
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,250
I think it would be better

386
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,500
-if you stayed here.
-Don't leave me!

387
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,916
-Uh!
-Please.

388
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,666
I can't go on living
without you.

389
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,791
Yuri.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,625
Aren't you frightened at all?

391
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,041
[YURI]
Not when I'm with you.

392
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,541
Never let go of my hand.

393
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,750
I want you to stay
with me forever.

394
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,666
[CHIHIRO]
I will.

395
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,750
You and I will walk
together for all time,

396
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,833
in a beautiful blue sky
free of any conflict.

397
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:57,208
[chuckles]
Like Romeo and Juliet.

398
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,416
I thought you loved Shakespeare.

399
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,333
Of course I do,
but that play's a tragedy.

400
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,833
[YURI chuckles]

401
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,666
Our story will
turn out differently.

402
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,458
You're right.

403
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,708
Too bad.

404
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,333
I wish I'd come up
with a good line

405
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,541
to say goodbye with.

406
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,291
Huh, what do you mean?

407
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,291
Yuri...

408
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,916
give me the courage
to do this.

409
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,833
What? Chihiro!

410
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,750
You can't go! No!

411
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,208
[CHIHIRO]
I'm sorry, Yuri,

412
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,916
but where I'm going,
I can't take you with me.

413
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,583
[YURI]
Why? I don't understand!

414
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:43,500
[CHIHIRO]
Live, Yuri. Live for me.

415
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,875
You were the most
important part of my life.

416
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,125
You can't do this!

417
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,708
[CHIHIRO] Before I go,
you have to make a promise.

418
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,166
Please live.

419
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,208
Yes.

420
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,208
[inhales sharply]

421
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,416
I promise you.

422
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,291
Thank you.

423
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,875
Finally... I'll be able to.

424
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,125
[YURI]
Chihiro!

425
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,250
[grunts]

426
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,416
Huh?

427
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,916
[chuckles]
