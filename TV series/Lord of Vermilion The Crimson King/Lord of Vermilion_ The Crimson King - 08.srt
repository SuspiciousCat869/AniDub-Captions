[footsteps]

2
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:18,958
[SHOKO]
You're late.

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,458
So why did we have
to meet out here, exactly?

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,208
[CHIHIRO] That's on me.
I asked you all to come.

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,833
[KOTETSU]
Who's there?

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,916
Hey. How you doin'?

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,333
Seriously?

8
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,875
Didn't expect us.
Did you?

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,041
The Guardian State's here?

10
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,541
I'd like to make a proposal.

11
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,583
Instead of fighting, our groups
should be working together.

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,916
Is that supposed to be
some kinda joke?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,250
Well, personally,
I wouldn't mind if we teamed up.

14
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,625
You be quiet, Tsubaki.

15
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,541
And don't think for one second
that I'm not aware

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,666
of your involvement
with these people.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,166
You're a member
of the Guardian State.

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,083
Your thoughtless actions
won't be quickly forgiven.

19
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,500
Don't forget
that they're responsible

20
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,958
for destroying the barriers
protecting Tokyo.

21
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,000
We're the ones trying
to save the world.

22
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,041
[MAN] I've had just about enough
of your fanaticism.

23
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,166
[SHOKO] That so?
You'll have to excuse me,

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,666
but I don't find your views
exceptionally persuasive.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,666
Especially when they come
from an organization

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,208
that claims
it's protecting the country

27
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,291
while slaying anyone
who opposes them.

28
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,875
[WOMAN] No one gets away with
insulting the Guardian State!

29
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,166
Julia Ichijo, starting battle.

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,333
Gabriel! Come to me!

31
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,708
I, Suruga Jumonji,
call forth Lia Fail!

32
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,166
You wanna fight?

33
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,916
Wait! Calm down,
Julia and Suruga!

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,750
We haven't even heard
Chihiro out yet!

35
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,041
Chaos will continue
to stain the world.

36
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,875
Destroying Tokyo is
the only way to stop it!

37
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,875
There's a way to save the world
without sacrificing Tokyo!

38
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,333
That's... possible?

39
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,583
Uh...

40
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,916
[KOUME chuckles]

41
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,208
We're listening. Elaborate.

42
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,583
He's obviously lying.

43
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,875
[chuckles]
Of course he's making it up.

44
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,750
You know there's no other way.

45
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,416
That's why you've destroyed
your share of the city, right?

46
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,041
We can change our fate.

47
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,750
[KAKIHARA]
Yuri Shiraki.

48
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,875
She's an Agent of Chaos!

49
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,625
You're working with them now?

50
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,416
Just listen!
Yuri is on our side!

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,666
[chuckles]
You're kidding.

52
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,125
This must be
the Foundation's doing.

53
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,833
She saved Kotetsu.
We can trust her.

54
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:16,875
Are you serious?

55
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,125
He's telling the truth, Tsubaki.

56
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,541
She rescued me.
I owe my life to Yuri.

57
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,000
Since I woke up
after the Great Collapse,

58
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,666
I've been having
these awful nightmares.

59
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,666
Dreams about the ones
I love... dying.

60
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,125
First it was Kotetsu's dad,
then Inuki.

61
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,958
No matter how hard I fought,
I couldn't change the outcome.

62
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,083
Prophetic visions of death.
Those would happen to you.

63
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,250
And then I saw Kotetsu was next.

64
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,916
I thought that it was over.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,791
That he couldn't escape
his fate.

66
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,083
But look. I'm alive, aren't I?

67
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,208
[CHIHIRO]
Because fate can change.

68
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,958
Yuri's the one
who taught me that.

69
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,416
I have all the proof I need.

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,416
Kotetsu's life shows
that we're in control

71
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,125
of how this ends.

72
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,708
I'm in charge
of my own destiny.

73
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,375
Oh, yeah?
I like the sound of that!

74
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,208
But your original objective
was to destroy this city.

75
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,750
Isn't it a bit late
to stop now?

76
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,208
AVAL's goal is to exterminate
the Heroic Lineage.

77
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,666
In order to do that,
they caused the Great Collapse

78
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,833
and are turning people
into gates.

79
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,458
The Maldeus Church wants
to destroy

80
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,875
the source of the gates.

81
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,791
Which just happens to be Tokyo.

82
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,916
That's how they plan on
protecting the Heroic Lineage.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,791
[SHOKO] There is simply
no other choice.

84
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,416
There's a third option
available.

85
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,708
The Heroic Lineage survives

86
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,875
without leveling Tokyo
in the process.

87
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,208
As long as we're alive,
we can stop Chaos' plan.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,708
And if we all work together,

89
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,791
we should be able to overcome
the Foundation's attacks.

90
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,083
[chuckles] I guess
that plan's not so bad.

91
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,291
We'd no longer have
to be enemies.

92
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,625
I will never trust these people.

93
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,875
But Shoko...

94
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,666
The Heroic Lineage is killed

95
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,541
or Tokyo is destroyed.

96
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,750
It can only be one
or the other.

97
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,041
Yuri thought her only choice
was to fight, yet she joined us.

98
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,000
And Kotetsu
was supposed to die.

99
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,000
If their fates can change,
then so can yours.

100
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,291
You've been so misled
by your love affair

101
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,416
that you dare
lecture us about fate?

102
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,375
You really have some nerve.

103
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,875
I just don't want
any more people to have to die!

104
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,458
I'm begging you.
Please help me!

105
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,458
Well, you already know
my answer.

106
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,458
I'm with you, man.

107
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,000
Since Kotetsu's down to play,

108
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,541
I guess there's no harm
jumping on board.

109
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,958
How about you?

110
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,333
If it means getting Haru back,
then count me in.

111
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,291
I'll be fighting
with you idiots as well,

112
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,833
so you'd better be grateful.

113
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,541
[SURUGA]
You can do whatever you want.

114
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,125
We will continue
to fulfill our duties

115
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,416
as members
of the Guardian State.

116
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,833
We don't require
the help of sinners.

117
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,375
Better be careful.

118
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,375
If you get involved, that kid
might be dreaming of you next.

119
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:13,375
Duly noted.
I'm helping anyway.

120
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,250
[KAKIHARA] Do you really
trust them that much?

121
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,375
[MARIE]
I have faith in them.

122
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,791
Can anyone tell me
where Yuri is?

123
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,875
Maybe she betrayed us.

124
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,791
Tell me, have you heard
anything at all, Jun?

125
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,916
Not a word.

126
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,916
It's true my daughter is a fool,

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,541
but she's still useful to us
for the time being.

128
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,583
Go and find her!

129
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,958
[KAKIHARA] I try to help
you out, and you ignore me?

130
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,958
Get involved and I die, right?

131
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,958
Not like you have that problem.

132
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,208
Seems like it'd take
a lot to kill you.

133
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,791
Resiliency is one
of my few good attributes.

134
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,000
If I had a real chance
to change the present,

135
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,791
I would take it,
even if it meant death.

136
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,208
There's no guarantee things
will improve, though.

137
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,541
What happens in the past
determines the future.

138
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,333
If his hands are already
covered in blood,

139
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,291
it stands to reason
any world he creates

140
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,958
will be equally blood soaked.

141
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,083
Nothing good will ever come
from trusting him.

142
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,708
He even killed his own father
to survive.

143
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,250
[MARIE]
Are you sure about that?

144
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,333
Meaning?

145
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,458
Come with me.

146
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,000
[YURI]
Were you waiting long?

147
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,250
[CHIHIRO]
No.

148
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,250
It smells good.

149
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,750
I'm pretty confident
I got it this time.

150
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,375
These reports are
from thirteen years ago.

151
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,000
When I learned Chihiro Kamina
was a vessel of Heroic Blood,

152
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,750
I acquired them immediately.

153
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,458
Autopsy report,

154
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,875
crime scene photos.

155
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,708
Info that was never made public.

156
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,166
You've been convinced you knew
the truth all this time.

157
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,125
Did you consider
you might be wrong?

158
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,833
So, you're saying
he didn't kill his father?

159
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,875
[KAKIHARA]
Thirteen years ago,

00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,208
a family forced
into a double suicide

161
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,208
was discovered in
a Chichibusanchu neighborhood.

162
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,958
The seven-year-old son
was rescued in a weakened state,

163
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,958
but his father had been dead
for nearly two weeks.

164
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,250
It's assumed that the boy had
spent the entire span of time

165
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,250
next to his parent's corpse.

166
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,250
My dad. I think he's dead.

167
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,291
It was my fault.
I killed my dad.

168
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,208
Shortly after he was found,
the boy fell into a coma.

169
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,125
And when he woke up, he had
no memory of what had happened.

170
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,333
It's right there!

171
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,583
He confessed to the officers

172
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,666
that arrived at the scene!

173
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,250
The kid pled guilty!

174
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,500
It's likely
he was just confused.

175
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,875
Right. That's exactly what
you cops thought, wasn't it?

176
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,416
Then it was reported
as a forced double suicide.

177
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,250
[MARIE] There were bruises
on Chihiro Kamina's throat

178
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,208
that indicated he'd been choked.

179
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,416
It could be that his father
tried to strangle him

180
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,875
but changed his mind
and stabbed himself instead.

181
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,083
[KAKIHARA]
It was the kid who murdered him!

182
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,333
He used a broken piece
of glass to do it!

183
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,833
The cuts on his hands
are all the proof you need!

184
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,541
Kakihara. You are
a journalist, aren't you?

185
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,083
Shouldn't you be open
to finding out the truth?

186
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,541
As I said,
some of this wasn't made public.

187
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,875
What was thought to be
the father's dying message

188
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,250
was found at the scene.

189
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,416
Doesn't look like much to me.

190
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,083
If you want my personal
interpretation of it...

191
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,583
I'd say he was trying to tell
his son to keep living.

192
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,625
You think?

193
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,791
Actually. No way.

194
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,916
His son stabbed him,
why would he...

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,625
-Hey, Kakihara.
-Huh?

196
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,666
Just wanting somebody
to die can be simple

197
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,125
but telling them
to live isn't easy.

198
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,916
Especially for someone who's
about to lose their own life.

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,208
Wouldn't you agree?

200
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,166
He didn't kill him?

201
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,750
[cell phone beeping]

202
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,041
Yeah, what is it?

203
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,583
Right, got it. Tomorrow morning.

204
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,375
That was Kamina.

205
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,458
He wants us to meet up
with him at the Church.

206
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,750
I can't.
I refuse to accept this.

207
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,541
Kakihara.

208
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,791
This damn kid!

209
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,291
He freed himself
from the father

210
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,416
who was trying
to kill them both!

211
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,791
Instead of giving up,
he killed his own parent!

212
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,916
Here's what we know:

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,250
The Foundation is attempting

214
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,000
to bring about
a second Great Collapse.

215
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,541
-[ALL gasp]
-[KOTETSU] No way! A second one?

216
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,125
[TSUBAKI]
They can do that?

217
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,750
[YURI]
In preparation for it,

218
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,000
my father moved a number
of large machines

219
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,708
out of our research lab.

220
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,333
What kind of machines?

221
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,958
[YURI] I wish I knew.

222
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,000
And where were they sent to?

223
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,208
I'm sorry. I'm not sure.

224
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,625
It's fine.

225
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,875
Knowing the Foundation's plan
is a huge step.

226
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,166
You did good.

227
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,625
But if they cause
another Great Collapse,

228
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,041
doesn't that mean
we're gonna be turned

229
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,250
into those monsters?

230
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,208
Don't be deceived
by their falsehoods.

231
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,166
You're simply trying
to incite needless worry

232
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,000
so we fall into your trap.

233

-Aren't you?
-[YURI] No, I'm not!

234
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,000
I already told you.
Yuri is on our side now.

235
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,000
We can trust her.

236
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,208
Definitely. She did save
my life after all.

237
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,958
Let's investigate immediately.

238
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,875
You'll all regret this.

239
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,208
Just you wait.

And now Kurokami and her friends

are going to be helping
us out as well.

It's all thanks to you.

made this possible.

You've done so much for us.

I just wanted to help.

And if I can continue
to be of use, I will.

Yes, but...

[CHIHIRO]
I want to remember. Please.

[YURI] There's no need to rush.
You can take your time.

[CHIHIRO]
The only memories I have left

256

are built on despair.

00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,291
And if I want a new future,

258
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,833
then I'll need something
that gives me more support.

You said my mother
caused all this.

And, you know what?
Maybe you're right.

261
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,833
But still, if she set
everything into motion,

262
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,166
maybe that's why
we were reunited.

263
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,375
It was because of her.

264
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,500
You really think so?

265
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,166
And I'm glad.

266
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,416
You gave me the strength
to face things head on.

because of you.

00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,458
I'm not entirely sure.

321
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,791
You touched the book
and collapsed.

322
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,583
Oh, right.

323
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,708
Did you remember anything?

324
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,833
-Not yet.
-I see.

325
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,708
It was worth a shot.

326
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,041
Sorry.

327
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,875
[gasps]
Wait a second!

328
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,041
I had a new dream.

329
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,333
Pluto!

330
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,791
[roars]

331
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,291
By my hand, I'll shatter
the demon's night...

332
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,208
and illuminate
the paths of darkness.

333
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,208
And now, Death has arrived.

334
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,625
Death has truly arrived.

335
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,750
[MARIE chuckles]

336
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,416
Don't think you've won just yet.

337
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,750
You underestimate my familiar.

338
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,125
Pluto!

339
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,208
Bringing a swift death
unto the undying.

340
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,958
Such is the nature
of the reaper's scythe.

341
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,208
You'll pay!

342
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,500
Tokotsu!

343
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,750
I shall sing your praises.

344
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,250
Death is kind to all!

345
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,083
You can't reach me from there.

346
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,625
[groans]

347
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,333
Death has arrived indeed.

348
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,625
[CHIHIRO]
Where's Kurokami?

349
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,333
[TSUBAKI] We can't seem
to get a hold of her.

350
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,125
She probably got
what she deserved.

351
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,000
Deceived by the enemy
until the very end.

352
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,333
Guess the Guardian State
isn't so special.

353
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,250
Be quiet!
Come on!

354
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,083
Didn't she tell you
where she was investigating?

355
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,458
Hey! Don't yell at me!

356
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,750
You can listen to her
last message yourself.

357
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,041
[grunts]

358
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,416
If she's in trouble,
it's all your fault.

359
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,625
Look, Chihiro.

360
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,083
Huh...

361
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:49,500
[KAKIHARA]
Kurokami!

362
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,291
What happened?
Who did this to you? Tell me!

363
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,583
This is...

364
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,000
Wait, did you
discover something?

365
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,208
[chuckles]

366
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,458
[whispering, indistinct]

367
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,250
[KAKIHARA]
Kurokami!

368
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,583
Marie, no!

369
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,750
She's gone.

370
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,291
As I expected.

371
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,041
One step closer
to fulfilling Chaos' plan.

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,208
This is what you wanted,
isn't it, Yuri?

373
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,666
[gasps]
But I didn't--

374
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,208
[SHOKO]
Kurokami was foolish enough

375
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,458
to believe in your words
and died

376
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,625
without even realizing
she'd been lied to.

377
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,791
No, you're wrong!
Yuri would never--

378
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,375
[clapping]

379
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,500
[YURI]
Father?

380
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,875
Splendid work.
I'm so proud of you, daughter.

381
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,875
So it really was you!

382
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,791
Wait! No, I--

383
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,166
[GRUMMAN]
She was just doing her job.

384
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,750
Now, time to come home, Yuri.

385
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,458
She's not going with you!

386
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,791
She's staying right here!

387
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,500
Now, now.

388
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,166
You must realize
the best place for you

389
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,791
is by your father's side.

390
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,166
Can't you see that?

391
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,166
You don't belong
with their kind anymore.

392
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,750
[SHOKO] He's right.
You can go home with him, Yuri.

393
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,416
Just hang on!
There must be some mistake!

394
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,666
I don't see one.

395
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,708
Kurokami told us that
she wanted to trust you.

396
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,458
In the end, she did.

397
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,875
And look where
that faith in you got her!

398
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,708
I'm telling you the truth.
Please believe me!

399
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,208
Yuri didn't betray her!

400
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,458
How blind can you be?

401
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,375
Marie was a really good person.

402
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,041
She didn't deserve this fate.

403
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,125
[sobs]

404
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,625
Kotetsu.

405
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,250
Don't keep me waiting.
Come along.

406
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,833
Everyone.
Listen. She didn't--

407
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,000
Yuri. Please, come back!

408
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,000
No.

409
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,666
Don't leave with them!

410
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,041
Don't go!
Stop and think about this!

411
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,208
You can't.

412
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,833
Hmm.

413
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,083
[GRUMMAN]
Insolent child!

414
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,041
Did you actually believe that
you could leave your own father?

415
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,916
Even with the death of one
of the Heroic Lineage.

416
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,333
I will never forgive you
for betraying me!

417
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,458
Listen closely.

418
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,750
That place is important
to me and Mitsuki,

419
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,458
you understand?

420
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,708
I'll tell you this once,
you are not permitted there!

421
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,208
[dripping]
