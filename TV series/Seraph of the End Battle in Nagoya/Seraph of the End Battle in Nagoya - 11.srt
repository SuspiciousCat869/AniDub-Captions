1
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:12,083
[panting]

2
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:18,583
[KIMIZUKI panting]
So, what's going on, Shinoa?

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,041
[SHINOA] I don't know
anything more than you do.

4
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,541
[NORITO]
Where are the choppers?

5
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,166
Guren said they would be
here waiting to evacuate us.

6
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,375
We're not safe here.

7
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,375
The vampires will
be close behind.

8
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,166
We can't just stand around.

9
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,958
[MITO]
Major General.

10
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,291
These directives were in
the flight control room.

11
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,875
I think they're for us.

12
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,416
[NORITO]
Well? What does it say?

13
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,083
To stand by and
wait for new orders.

14
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,583
Stand by?

15
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,333
[RIKA] This is all your fault,
you spoiled little bitch!

16
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,625
Hey!

17
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,500
[RIKA]
Yayoi, Kagiyama...

18
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,125
They're both dead
because you betrayed us

19
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,166
and protected that vampire.

20
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,208
It's not fair that
you're still alive.

21
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,916
Maybe you should join them.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,500
It's all your fault!
You got my friends killed!

23
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,666
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,750
[gasps] I'm not forgiving
you that easily.

25
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,750
You'll pay for what you did!

26
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,666
Stop!

27
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,083
[SHINOA]
It's fine, you guys!

28
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,875
[RIKA sobs]
I don't want your apology.

29
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,208
Save your breath.

30
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,791
It won't bring my friends back.

31
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:44,250
They're bleeding in the
streets. You killed them.

32
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,416
[RIKA sobbing]

33
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
[IWASAKI]
Rika.

34
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,708
Pull yourself together.

35
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,500
Killing her isn't going to help.

36
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,000
But... Makoto!

37
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,750
I'm not saying that
I'm going to forgive her

38
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,416
or her team.

39
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,291
I'm your leader,

40
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,583
so her blood should
be on my hands.

41
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,958
[SHINYA] Sorry, but that's
not your decision to make.

42
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,250
Then you're gonna
punish them, right?

43
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,375
They sided with a vampire
on the battlefield,

44
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,791
which led to our
troops being ambushed.

45
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,958
Like I said, you
don't get to decide

46
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,916
what happens to them.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Fine, then.

48
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,083
Prove you've got what it takes
to lead us and punish them!

49
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,791
[NARUMI] This entire
mission has turned into

50
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,291
a giant shit storm.

51
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,750
Just look at us.

52
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,791
We've lost several of our
comrades and our commander,

53
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,708
but we kept moving
forward, following orders!

54
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,375
And look how well
that's working out.

55
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,916
You want us to forgive these
traitors and "stand by"?

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,250
Are we supposed to just
lie down and die out here?

57
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,791
[SHINYA]
Escape in the chopper.

58
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,500
Then lead the vampires to a trap

59
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,291
waiting for them in Shinjuku.

60
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,791
That's what our
final mission was.

61
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,125
Only thing is,

62
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,458
Guren's not the one
who planned this.

63
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,000
[NARUMI]
Then who did?

64
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,208
Lieutenant General
Kureto Hiragi.

65
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,583
[ALL gasp]

66
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,875
[NARUMI grunts] Of course.
I'm sick of the Hiragis.

67
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,958
The selfish orders
they give out only serve

68
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,583
to give them more power.

69
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,208
Well, I refuse to
follow it anymore!

70
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,375
Just calm down.

71
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,625
Freaking out isn't going to
help us figure out what--

72
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,416
[NARUMI] Don't you dare
tell me to calm down!

73
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,833
[NARUMI]
We're abandoning this mission.

74
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm going back to rescue
the Lieutenant Colonel.

75
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,833
If he's going back,
so am I. You coming?

76
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,083
If this wasn't Guren's mission,

77
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,875
I don't see any reason
to finish it. Right?

78
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:55,375
Goshi, Mito, Shinya. Goodbye.

79
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:59,458
Shigure! Sayuri!
Think about this!

80
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:04,000
This is starting to get
ugly. What should we do?

81
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,500
[SHINYA]
Hold on, Narumi!

82
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,541
I know I'm disobeying orders.

83
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,166
Go ahead and court martial
me for all I care.

84
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,333
Argh. Just--

85
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,708
Shut up for a second
and listen to me!

86
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,166
I'm trying to tell you
that we're aborting

87
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,916
this mission together.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,291
What?

89
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,458
Let's do it.

90
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,250
We'll ignore the orders
from high command.

91
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,750
From now on, the Demon
Company has one goal.

92
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,666
The rescue of Lieutenant
Colonel Guren Ichinose.

93
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,916
[gasps]

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,416
Seriously?

95
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,458
You heard him. Let's go!

96
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,791
We're not going to
abandon our friend

97
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,916
when he needs our help.

98
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,833
[CROWLEY]
Mm...

99
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,958
It looks like we missed
an impressive battle here.

100
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,125
[GUREN groans]

101
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,250
[NOBLE A]
Start talking, maggot.

102
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,125
What were your plans?

103
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,708
[chuckles] You'll have to
hit me harder than that.

104
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,208
[NOBLE B] Queen Krul
specifically ordered us

105
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,708
not to kill him.

106
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:50,541
Tch. Soon, he'll be beggin'
to be put out of his misery.

107
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,750
[GUREN]
All right,

108
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,583
This is starting to
get a little painful.

109
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,875
Time to leak some false intel
and buy myself a break.

110
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,250
Let's see...

111
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,166
I've gotta get these
bastards to Shinjuku somehow.

112
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,250
They've probably beat me enough
to believe I've broken.

113
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,833
It's not naptime
for the livestock yet.

114
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,416
[GUREN groans]

115
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,833
[FERID] What a pleasure
to see you, Crowley.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,416
It's been too long.

117
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,333
Five nobles were killed today.

118
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,583
The humans knew their locations.

119
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,041
I'm positive that
you had something

120
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,791
to do with this, Lord Ferid.

121
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,250
[FERID]
I'm hurt.

122
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,541
There's nothing worse than
selling out your friends.

123
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,916
Right? That's despicable.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,708
Yeah. True.

125
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,708
But that's not what concerns me.

126
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,791
What bothers me is that
you gave the humans

127
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,666
my location, too.

128
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,208
And here I was
under the impression

129
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,208
that I was your friend.

130
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,833
But surely you
enjoyed the fight.

131
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,625
Well, yeah.

132
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,458
I guess it was a
pretty good time.

133
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,041
Then you should be
thanking me instead.

134
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,833
Besides, everyone knows
that we're friends, Crowley.

135
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,916
No one'll suspect I leaked
info if you were attacked.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,333
[CROWLEY] I see, so you
were the one behind this.

137
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,750
You're only half right.

138
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,166
There's actually another
puppeteer pulling the strings

139
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,208
along with me.

140
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,333
Oh? Who is it?

141
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,333
[panting]

142
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,708
[FERID]
Him.

143
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,000
You must have some
kinda death wish, human.

144
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,750
Ah-- How dare you?

145
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,791
[GUREN]
Okay, I've had enough of this.

146
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,416
It's Shinjuku--

147
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,208
You're dead! Filthy human!

148
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,666
[NOBLE B] Hey, stop it.
He's saying something.

149
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,750
[NOBLE A]
I don't care!

150
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,166
[FERID] The Lieutenant
Colonel is a half-demon.

151
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,958
[CROWLEY]
Hm? A half-demon?

152
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,250
Although, he's actually
close to becoming complete.

153
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,625
Every day, he struggles
to keep two personalities

154
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,125
under control inside his body.

155
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,541
[FERID] One is an idealist
who wants nothing more

156
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,041
than to protect his troops
and his friends from harm.

157
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,250
[MAHIRU]
Come on, now.

158
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,958
You've had more than
enough of this, my darling.

159
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,833
Relax and let me
take over a while.

160
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,083

00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,125
We shouldn't have come.
This is a huge mess.

325
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,083
Humans attacking other
humans. Just look.

326
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,916
No. I'm glad we came.

327
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,375
Bastard. What are you
doing to my comrades?

328
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,875
Ah. That's one of Guren's
Black Demon kids.

329
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,083
Do it.

330
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,666
They're coming from
the container.

331
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,416
Yoichi!

332
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,875
Damn it!

333
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,208
What've they got hidden
inside that thing?

334
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,458
It doesn't matter. Stop it!

335

[SHINOA]
Let's get outta here!

338
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,250
Come on, Yu.

All units, move in.

342
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,083
I don't want a single
human to survive.

343
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,750
[VAMPIRES yell]

344
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,500
This is the end.

345
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,083
We're destroying the
vampires right here.

346
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,833
Do it for humanity!

[TROOPERS yell]

00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:17,250
Holy crap. What should we do--

349
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,916
Don't panic! This is
a great opportunity.

350
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,083
Yeah.

351
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,416
They're not paying
attention to us anymore.

352
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,750
This is our chance to escape.

353
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,000
[NORITO] You kids go ahead
and run while you can.

354
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,583
The seasoned pros
will provide you

355
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,125
with plenty of cover.

[YUICHIRO]
You guys...

357
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,458
[SHINYA] I'll clear a
path for us. Let's go!

358
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,208
For our comrades!

[VAMPIRES, TROOPERS yelling]

360
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,708
What're you doing?

361
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,125
That's it.

362
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,375
No more of my friends
are gonna die today!

363
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,291
You idiot! You're too far out!

364
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,666
No more!

Guren. You're all right!

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,041
Let's go!

368
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,625
Good. You're here.

369
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,041
I was hoping that you would be.

370
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,875
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

371
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,541
"Seraph of the End."
