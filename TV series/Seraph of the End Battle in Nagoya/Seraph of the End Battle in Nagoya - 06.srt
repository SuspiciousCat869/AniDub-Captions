00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,541
[HOSTAGE groaning]

2
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,250
Ah! I've had way
too much to drink.

3
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,750
Idiot.

4
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,750
You're not supposed to kill
any of the hostages, Chess.

5
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,250
[CHESS sighs]
Oh, crap! Hey, human.

6
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,541
You can't die without
my permission, okay?

7
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,000
[sighs]

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,791
[CHESS]
I'm so sorry, Lord Crowley.

9
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,083
I got carried away.

10
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,458
[CROWLEY]
Hm? Don't worry about it.

11
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,916
We've got plenty more
where he came from.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,333
[CHESS]
Hear that, Horn?

13
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,041
You should have some, too!
While he's still warm!

14
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,083
When are you going to learn

15
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,958
to exhibit a
little self-control?

16
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,083
You're a noble, not a savage.

17
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,458
Jeez.

18
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,166
Keep acting all uptight like
that and you'll miss out

19
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,625
on all the good stuff.

20
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,833
Wouldn't you agree
with me, Lord Crowley?

21
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,625
It wouldn't hurt for you
to take life more seriously.

22
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,750
What? Come on!

23
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,666
We need to discuss
today's attacks.

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,958
It seems the humans finally
found their backbones.

25
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,375
This Nagoya invasion of
theirs was an act of war,

26
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,250
and we must strike back.

27
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,750
[CROWLEY]
Mm... You're right about that.

28
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,208
[CROWLEY]
Hey, Chess.

29
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,875
Come here for a
second, will you?

30
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,083
Huh? Yeah, okay.

31
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,333
[gasps]

32
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,791
Um... What did you do that for?

33
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,083
Well,

34
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,583
I just wanted to see
which weapon was stronger.

35
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,291
A human's blade or
that of a vampire.

36
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,333
But, Lord Crowley,

37
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,500
whichever weapon you hold

38
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,166
is bound to be the
strongest one, isn't it?

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,291
[CROWLEY]
True.

40
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,791
But that's not what
I'm interested in.

41
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,875
[HORN]
Could you elaborate, my lord?

42
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,291
[CROWLEY] Hm. I'm afraid
the humans are gaining

43
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,208
too much power too quickly.

44
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,291
That's how they managed to
take down so many nobles.

45
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,125
[CROWLEY]
Just look at this weapon.

46
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,041
It's cursed, so it could
kill any one of us.

47
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,750
However, this isn't the sort
of thing they'd figure out

48
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,083
on their own. Someone must
be leaking them information.

49
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,458
My lord.

50
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,208
Are you suggesting there
might be a traitor among us,

51
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,958
working with the humans?

52
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,000
[CROWLEY] Yes. And a
high-ranking one at that.

53
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,291
[CROWLEY]
See?

54
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,541
Thanks to the curse, this
wound isn't healing at all.

55
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,083
You girls need to be
careful out there, okay?

56
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,958
I'll get you a
bandage right away.

57
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,458
[CROWLEY] You can drink
from it if you like.

58
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,000
Huh?

59
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,166
Ugh!

60
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,500
[HORN] But, Lord Crowley,
I'm not worthy.

61
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,333
[CHESS] In that case,
can I have a drink?

62
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,083
[HORN]
You already drained that human.

63
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,750
Now you're just being greedy.

64
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,791
I'll accept your gracious offer.

65
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,250
[CHESS] Ugh! No fair!
Why does she get to taste it?

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,458
[sighs]

67
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,750
[HORN]
Is there something wrong?

68
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,791
[CROWLEY] Hm. I was just
wondering who the puppet master

69
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,541
for this ambitious human
operation might be.

70
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,458
Let's think. Was it
Queen Krul Tepes,

71
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,416
or perhaps Ferid
Bathory's doing?

72
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,250
Or maybe even...

73
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,250
Maybe who?

74
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,583
Never mind.

75
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,666
It can't be possible that
a human's responsible

76
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,541
for pulling the strings.

77
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,125
So, how long do we have to
wait around here exactly?

78
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,625
The other squads should
be joining us by 2:20.

79
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, but what if
they don't show?

80
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,250
Then we have to assume
that they're dead.

81
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,916
What's the time?

82
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,250
Already 2:13.

83
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,166
Uh-- Ah?

84
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:26,500
[footsteps shuffling]

85
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,291
Is the Lieutenant Colonel here?

86
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,541
No, not yet.

87
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,416
[AIHARA] I see. Stand by
for the time being.

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,166
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, ma'am!

89
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,458
Hey, Shinoa.

90
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,416
Weren't there 15
soldiers on that squad

91
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,666
when we set out earlier?

92
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,291
There were.

93
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,625
They lost so many.

94
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,666
[NARUMI]
Aihara.

95
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,666
Did your team
complete their mission?

96
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,250
[AIHARA] We wouldn't
be here if we hadn't.

97
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,375
[AIHARA] You didn't lose
any members of your squad.

98
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,958
I know, I'm incredible.

99
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,458
Shut up.

100
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,625
Hey, Shinoa.

101
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,583
Tell her what a
great leader I am.

102
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,791
What?

103
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,458
Come on, why are you
dragging me into this?

104
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,541
Um, I mean...

105
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,708
Hey. I'm glad you
made it back alive.

106
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,416
We've got this area locked down.

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,333
You guys get some rest.

108
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,708
This is one of the newbies?

109
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,833
That's right.

110
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,708
Now what was his
name again? Uh...

111
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,041
Don't tell me you've
forgotten already?!

112
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,625
And after giving me
so much crap about

113
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,083
not remembering our target.

114
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:47,208
Just jokin' around.
He's Yuichiro Hyakuya.

115
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,125
I see. Thanks, Hyakuya.

116
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,958
We'll take you up on your
offer and use this time

117
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,000
to recover some of our strength.

118
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,500
Please keep your eyes open.

119
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,125
Sure! We've got your backs.

120
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:17,625
I guess... this war really
does have casualties.

121
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,208
That's right. Many
comrades will die.

122
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,375
But that's a soldier's
life. Trust me.

123
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,916
I know all about it.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,291
[SHINOA] That's why we have
to make each day count.

125
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,000
If our lives are short,
we'll live them together.

126
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:32,958
[gasps]

127
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,125
[gasps]

128
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:34,958
What are you guys
doing standing around

129
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,375
out here like lost puppies?

130
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,791
So tell me, did you
complete your mission?

131
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,291
Yeah, we killed our guy.
And what about your squad?

132
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,250
[GUREN]
Piece a' cake.

133
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,666
[YUICHIRO]
Yeah, right!

134
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,041
Narumi.

135
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,041
Yes, sir.

136
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,958
So, how did our
newbs fair today?

137
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,416
Did they drag you down too much?

138
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,708
Ha!

139
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,916
They managed to
survive, at least.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,083
Actually, they did
an outstanding job.

141
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,375
Really. Each of
them impressed me.

142
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,583
[YUICHIRO] Hah! What's that?
Say it again louder!

143
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,791
[NARUMI]
Don't get full of yourself!

144
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,458
--[blow lands]
--[YUICHIRO] Oh! That hurt!

145
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,958
Aihara. You lost
eight of your men?

146
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,958
[AIHARA]
Um. They were killed, sir.

147
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:31,958
I apologize, Lieutenant
Colonel. I failed my squad.

148
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,500
[GUREN]
I knew there'd be losses.

149
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,958
Our comrades' deaths are
on my hands, not yours.

150
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:36,958
No, sir.

151
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,916
I should have been
a better leader.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,208
[GUREN] Listen to me.
You saved six of your men.

153
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,666
Narumi. Any word
from the others?

154
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,916
[NARUMI]
Nothing, sir.

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,291
[GUREN]
All right, then.

156
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,291
There's no time to
stand around and wait,

157
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,125
we'll have to go ahead
and start our next mission

158
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,000
without them.

159
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,041
What are we gonna do, now?

160
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,375
The soldiers assigned
to kill the three nobles

00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,625
in city hall found themselves
completely overwhelmed.

162
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,208
The vampires are holding
25 of them hostage.

163
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,833
Oh, no!

164
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,291
[GUREN] We're definitely
gonna need those men

165
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,000
for future missions.

166
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,791
Our new objective is to
kill the three nobles.

167
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,875
And rescue our comrades.

[AIHARA]
Lieutenant Colonel.

169
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,833
Please let me go on
this mission, too.

170
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,375
I would really like
to be of assistance.

171
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,916
Not a chance.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,500
I've got no room for someone
who cries on the battlefield.

173
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,625
[AIHARA gasps]

I'm kidding, okay?

175
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,833
Once we're done at city hall,

176
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,125
we'll rendezvous at the airport.

177
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,333
I need you to stay here
and relay that information

178
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,333
to the other squads
that show up.

179
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm counting on you.

180
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,666
[gasps] Yes, sir!

181
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,791
Right. Let's get moving, kids!

182
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,375
[SQUAD MEMBERS]
Yes, sir!

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,666
Got a second?

184
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,666
Let me guess.

185
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
You wanna talk me
out of this plan

186
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,666
because it's likely a trap.

187
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,708
No.

188
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,875
I get that we
don't have a choice.

189
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,041
We need those squads
to win this war.

190
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,583
It's not like there're
many humans left

191
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,083
to take their places.

192
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,916
Then what are you
going to complain about?

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,125
[SHINYA] C'mon, Guren, I never
said I had any complaints.

194
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,583
Many of our
comrades were killed.

195
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,708
You don't always
handle that well.

196
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,958
I was just worried
about you, that's all.

197
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,750
This was a dangerous mission.

198
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,083
We were bound to lose
some good soldiers.

199
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,000
[SHINYA] But you're still gonna
beat yourself up about it,

200

that's part of your charm.

They're gonna be fine.

Ah--

203
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,833
Even those new
troops are elites.

204
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,125
You don't need to
worry about them.

205
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,875
Y'know, you're right.
I should believe in them.

206

I've got movement here!

You made it! I was
afraid you were dead!

208
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,000
We ran into a lot of trouble.

209
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,875
But we still managed to
kill our assigned target.

That's great. I'm so
glad to see you--

Now we can't torture them.

can't let you die yet.

vampires were killed here.

From the look of these clothes,
I'd say Lucal Wesker's dead.

No way.

An entire army of
humans wouldn't be able

to kill a noble like him.

Make one move and I'll
slit your friend's throat.

kind of slow sometimes,

but how did you miss
that she was alive?

280

Capture her.
She'll prove useful.

You can do whatever you want.
If he dies, it's his own fault.

not long ago.

Why are you telling me this now?

291
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,958
Because you called him "Yu."

292
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,333
I'm hoping that means
you're a friend of his.

That's all the intelligence
I have about Hyakuya.

what that means?

[MIKAELA] You had the rest
of your men commit suicide,

299

but here you are acting
like a desperate fool

300

trying to save your own life.

301

[AIHARA] I don't wanna die!
Please don't kill me!

303
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,125
[MIKAELA] Then tell me
where your comrades are.

304
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,208
Your squad is obviously too weak
to be behind these attacks.

I-If...

306
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,958
...I tell you, then you're
not gonna kill me, okay?

307
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,041
Right.

308
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:13,250
The Imperial Army's
strongest soldiers

in Higashiyama Park.

311
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,750
Their mission is to
execute Zane Lindau.

[AIHARA groans]

313

Do you know him?

314
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,666
How do you not know who he is?

315
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,916
Lindau is the
Seventeenth Progenitor.

316
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,958
So they know the name of a noble
and where he's located.

317
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,125
This whole setup gives
me a bad feeling.

00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,458
[RENE] We have to go
and warn Lord Lindau.

320
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,625
Otherwise, we'll end up
in big trouble. Let's go.

321
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,208
[LACUS]
Ugh. That's super far away.

322
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,375
This is gonna be such a pain.

323
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,666
[AIHARA]
Wait.

324
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,291
Please kill me. Quickly.

325
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:05,208
I've no reason to live.
There's nothing left.

326
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,041
[MIKAELA]
I'm not getting my hands dirty.

327
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,250
If you want to die,
kill yourself.

328
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,750
[AIHARA]
I can't.

329
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,083
I kill myself, and they'll
start to doubt the information

330
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,541
I gave them.

331
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,375
But if you were to kill me,
they wouldn't bat an eye.

332
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,333
[LACUS]
Hm? Hey, Mika.

333
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,125
If you don't hurry up,
we'll leave you behind.

334
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,291
And bring that
pathetic human. Come on.

335
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,458
[gasps]

336
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,458
I think she told us
everything she knows.

337
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,875
Not yet.

338
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,916
We can still get more
information out of-- Look out!

339
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,208
You bastards! I know your game.

340
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,875
You're eventually going
to kill me anyway.

341
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,583
[gasps]

342
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:07,125
[inaudible]

343
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,583
Aw, man, you killed her
before we got to play.

344
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,333
[MIKAELA] Who cares about what
the livestock has to say?

345
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,333
Well, you've got a point there.

346
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,208
[RENE] The blind loyalty
these humans have

347
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,375
is a little frightening.

348
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,375
The Japanese
Imperial Demon Army...

349
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:34,333
...may prove to be more of
a problem than we expected.

350
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,958
True. These humans
are nothing alone.

351
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,666
But when they gang up,
they're kinda dangerous.

352
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,000
[RENE] Let's head to
the botanical garden.

353
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,666
We can't allow the
Seventeenth Progenitor

354
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,750
to be killed as well.

355
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,333
[MIKAELA] I'm gonna take
a different route.

356
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,333
[LACUS]
Huh?

357
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,416
This human may have been
scared for her life,

358
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,083
but we can't take
her word alone.

359
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,250
Let me borrow five
soldiers and I'll go see

360
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,458
what's happening at
city hall, just in case.

361
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,333
That's not a bad idea.

362
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,333
We'll regroup when you're done.

363
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,916
[MIKAELA]
That story protected Yu.

364
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,500
Maybe you were his comrade.

365
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,875
No.

366
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,791
You probably just used him,
like all the others do.

367
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,875
[MIKAELA]
Okay, follow me.

368
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,375
Let's see what's
going on at city hall.

369
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,208
I'm coming, old friend.

370
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,375
[gasps]

371
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,166
Is there something wrong?

372
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,208
[YUICHIRO]
Uh-- No.

373
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,166
It's just getting really cloudy.

374
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,541
It's the perfect weather
to launch an attack.

375
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,083
Yeah. Let's get on with it.

376
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,875
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

377
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,583
"Shinya and Guren."
