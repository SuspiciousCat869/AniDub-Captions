You're that weird
kid from Shinjuku.

The one who freaked out
and almost killed

a bunch of our troops.

Huh? But look at him,
he's asking for it.

I know, but I'm betting
that Lord Ferid

will want the kid alive.

No, Shinoa. Tell me
you're joking.

They've captured Guren.

[YUICHIRO] He's a part
of our family, remember?

us do now, Lord Crowley?

[CROWLEY]
Hm. Let's see.

54
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,208
Ferid'll probably reward
us if we capture them

and keep them alive.

Illusionary Spell.

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,958
One strong enough
that it's managed

67
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,041
to affect a noble's brain.

68
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,125
Humans shouldn't be
able to control spells

69
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,166
as powerful as
this one. So then.

I wonder who's teaching you
all these new magic tricks.

Now is not the time to
start fawning over him, Chess.

[CROWLEY] Your friends
have left you behind.

like me very much.

It seemed like quite the
opposite, if you ask me.

Either way, you're mine now.

103
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,833
but I'm afraid the test subject
won't be ready for transport

104
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,708
until 1700 hours.

105
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,166
[KURETO]
We need it sooner.

106
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,125
Do whatever it takes to
have the subject ready

107
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,666
by 1600 hours.
If we screw this up,

Mm?

Brother Seishiro.
What are you doing here?

113
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,458
Father wanted me to
come by and say hello.

114
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,458
[KURETO chuckles] So he wants
you to keep tabs on me.

115
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,541
I'm surprised he didn't
send you earlier.

116
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,708
[SEISHIRO]
If our intel's correct,

117

the nobles are going
to attack soon.

118
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,875
You sure you're gonna
be able to handle

119
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,875
that kinda fight by yourself?

120
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,041
Father won't tolerate
any screw ups.

121
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,958
There'll be hell
to pay if you lose.

122
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you think I'm
worried about him?

123
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,583
[laughs]

124
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,958
Hey! Take this seriously!

125
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,833
Sorry. But you just
sound so ridiculous.

126
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,875
If I fail now, it's over.
Our entire species is dead.

127
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,333
And you still expect me
to be afraid of the old man?

128
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,041
Hey, you better watch
what you're saying!

129
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,583
If I report your
attitude to Father,

130
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,625
he might strip you of your ra--

131
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,208
Cowards who are
too scared to fight

132
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,750
on the front lines should shut
up and stay out of the way.

133
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,916
A coward?! You're
gonna regret that.

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,041
Brother. Did you just
put your hands on me?

135
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,625
Hey, I've got orders
from Father to observe you.

136
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,041
He won't let you hurt me.

137
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,708
[KURETO] Father is very
resourceful, but how could he

138
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,333
protect you if you
were to die right now?

139
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,625
Kureto Hiragi.

140
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,250
I'm arresting you for
lese-majeste against our father.

141
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,041
I order you to
restrain this man!

142
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,416
You're crazy!

143
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,208
Do you honestly think
you'll get away with this?

144
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,125
Of course I will. Well,

145
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,458
as long as I succeed at
saving the world today.

146
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,375
[AOI]
Lieutenant General.

147
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,875
All of our squads will be
ready to head out shortly.

148
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,375
I'd recommend leaving
in 30 minutes.

149
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,458
Excellent.

150
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,458
Wait, you're leaving?

151
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,291
Where do you think
you're going?!

152
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,000
The vampires are
coming to attack us!

153
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,666
[KURETO] The vampires aren't
going to step foot in Kanto.

154
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,166
We're stopping them in Nagoya.

155
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,458
You bastard.

156
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,833
I dispatched the Shibuya
troops because you said

157
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,416
you could hold off our
enemies in Shinjuku!

158
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,416
Kureto...

159
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,375
What have you been doing
behind Father's back?

160
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,750
[SEISHIRO] Do you really
think you can disobey

161
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,666
the leader of the
Demon Army and live?

162
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,750
You can't be that stupid!

163
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:49,375

hurting the way you do.

wait for that day to come.

feels like it's too painful

to go on, just concentrate
on killing vampires.

worth living again.

feel better. I promise.

00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,666
It's possible the subject
won't survive another increase.

320
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,041
If we don't stick
to the timeline,

321
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,875
then we're all dead.

322
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,166
I'll see that it's done.

323
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,416
[KURETO] Hold on. One more
thing before you go.

324
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,958
[AOI]
Sir?

325
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,458
Any update from Guren in Nagoya?

326
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,208
Guren says that...
things are fine.

327
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,666
Things are fine?

328
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,250
[chuckles]

329
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,791
[KURETO]
I'll buy that.

330
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,583
Hurry it up!

331
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,000
The Demon Company won't be able

332
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,416
to stall the vampires
very much longer!

333
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,666
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

334
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,583
"Traitorous Allies."
