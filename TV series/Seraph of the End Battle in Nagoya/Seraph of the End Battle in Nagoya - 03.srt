1
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,250
[knocking]

2
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,958
Bring Guren to me.

3
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,375
[YUICHIRO]
Argh. What is the deal?

4
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,791
Why can't I fix it?

5
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,958
[KIMIZUKI] Stop going to
sleep with wet hair, idiot.

6
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,666
Why won't it just work
with me and lay down?

7
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Guess it's not that bad.

8
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,916
[KIMIZUKI chuckles]
Right.

9
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,833
At least it still looks
better than yours.

10
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,916
[KIMIZUKI]
What'd you say?

11
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,875
[YUICHIRO]
Nothing.

12
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,166
C'mon, we're gonna be late.

13
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,083
[KIMIZUKI] I hope they
got breakfast waiting.

14
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:43,875
I'm starving.

15
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,791
Who knows with those two?

16
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,791
They've probably got
a whole feast ready.

17
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,041
[YUICHIRO]
More importantly.

18
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,250
Any idea what this is about?

19
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,416
It's kinda early for a meeting.

20
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,958
[KIMIZUKI] I hope there's
coffee and donuts, too.

21
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,166
Yeah.

22
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,458
Maybe they've got a
fancy breakfast planned.

23
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,375
[YUICHIRO]
Hey, are you guys ignoring me?

24
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,375
Tell me what's up!

25
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,291
Shinoa will explain soon enough.

26
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,750
Until then, focus on
taming your stupid hair.

27
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,000
This is ridiculous.

28
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,041
Why am I left in the dark?

29
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,875
[MITSUBA screams]

30
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,583
[MITSUBA, SHINOA screaming]

31
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,666
Hey!

32
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,250
What's wrong, why
are you screaming?

33
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,833
What the hell are you doing?

34
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,125
How can you be so bad at cooking
that you set an omelet on fire?

35
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,833
I read somewhere
that adding alcohol

36
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,500
to the pan makes
it taste better!

37
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,625
[YUICHIRO]
Is that for us?

38
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,041
[YOICHI]
Uh...

39
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,708
[MITSUBA, SHINOA gasp]

40
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,750
It's done. Now let's eat.

41
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,958
[YUICHIRO] Man, Kimizuki,
this is really good.

42
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,708
Where'd you learn how to cook?

43
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:02,500
Anyone with half a brain
can make an omelet.

44
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,000
[SHINOA] I would've made
you a great breakfast

45
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,125
if Mitsu hadn't been
there messing things up.

46
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,208
[MITSUBA]
I'm telling you,

47
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,375
flambéing is a
legitimate technique!

48
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,875
Don't worry.

49
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,041
I'm sure you were just having
an off day in the kitchen.

50
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,125
You can cook us
breakfast some other time.

51
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,750
Keep a fire
extinguisher on hand.

52
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:21,375
[YOICHI, YUICHIRO laugh]

53
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,125
So, what are we
doing here, guys?

54
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,250
I get the feeling that
I'm being left out.

55
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,291
And I thought we
weren't supposed

56
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,583
to keep secrets from each other.

57
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,666
[SHINOA] There are two
things we need to discuss.

58
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,250
First, that you've
been the subject of

59
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,541
some kind of
human experimentation.

60
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,416
and that you lost control
in the heat of battle

61
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,625
and tried to kill me.

62
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,875
[gasps]

63
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,166
[SHINOA] Second. The
lieutenant colonel...

64
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,791
Are we sure that Guren
is truly on our side?

65
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,083
What do you mean
"is he on our side?"

66
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,000
He's the one looking out for us.

67
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,583
[SHINOA] It's possible
that he's been using us

68
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,083
this whole time,
specifically you.

69
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,291
How did he manage to put such
a powerful team together

70
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,166
in such a short amount of time?

71
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,958
It could just be that
he's trying to intimidate

72
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,041
his superiors for some reason.

73
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,833
But we have to consider
that there might be

74
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,916
something bigger at stake.

75
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,083
All this stuff about
Guren is news to me.

76
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,416
[SHINOA]
Whatever the case.

77
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,166
We have to decide if we're
going to stick by Guren.

78
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,583
If we do, we might end up
traitors to the army.

79
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,666
Even if we are just
following orders.

80
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,000
That's why we called you here,

81
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,208
so we can figure all
this out together.

82
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,500
So basically,

83
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,416
you wanna discuss
the idea of abandoning

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
the Lieutenant Colonel.

85
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,833
[SHINOA]
That's one of our options, yes.

86
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,125
[gasps]

87
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,875
[VAMPIRE A sniffs]

88
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,500
[VAMPIRE A] It's blood.
I can smell his blood!

89
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,041
Blood!

90
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,166
[VAMPIRE A grunts]

91
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,041
[sighs]

92
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,708
[GUREN]
This is disgusting.

93
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,041
[GUREN]
Kureto Hiragi.

94
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,750
You took your time getting here.

95
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,208
[GUREN] Is this a
Cursed Gear experiment?

96
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,541
Yes.

97
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,666
[KURETO] I'm trying to find an
efficient way to turn vampires

98
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,208
into demons whose
powers we can harness.

99
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,208
Unfortunately, we're not making
much in the way of progress.

100
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,333
Low-level trash like these
specimens are worthless.

101
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,875
Dispose of 'em, will ya?

102
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,750
You didn't bring me
here to kill vamps.

103
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,833
Just cut to the chase already.

104
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,833
[KURETO] Did you really
come here on your own?

105
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,958
Those were the orders
that I received.

106
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,500
You weren't afraid that
I was going to kill you?

107
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,083
[GUREN] What reason do
you have to kill me?

108
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,083
Because you're a cocky idiot?

109
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,541
[chuckles] If that were the
case, you'd've killed me sooner.

110
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,208
Besides, you won't get rid of
me while I'm of use to you.

111
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,625
[KURETO]
Hm.

112
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,458
[KURETO]
You've got a point.

113
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,208
But that does make me wonder
how useful you really are.

114
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,708
And, more importantly, what
you've been working on lately.

115
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,625
I think it's time we talk about
this team you've put together.

116
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,916
Yuichiro Hyakuya.
Yoichi Saotome.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,375
Shiho Kimizuki.

118
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,500
Where did these boys come from?

119
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,291
How did you manage
to find not one,

120
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,125
but three Black Demon prospects?

121
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,666
I got lucky.

122
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,833
It was pure coincidence that
these three recruits ended up--

123
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,875
[KURETO] I don't believe
that for a second.

124
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,083
All Black Demon prospects
have been subjected

125
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,875
to human experimentation.

126
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,750
Even then, the success
rate is extremely low.

127
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,208
Don't get me wrong.

128
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,250
I'm happy to have more
Black Demon users in our ranks.

129
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,041
Perhaps you should be
in charge of overseeing

130
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,833
all our Cursed Gear trials.

131
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,083
[GUREN] Seems like a
waste of my talents.

132
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,250
Is this why you had me
meet you out here?

133
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,291
Because, if that's it,
I'll be on my way.

134
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,583
One more question.

135
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,958
What's your reason
for assembling

136
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,916
these Black Demon users?

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,541
Are you trying to plan a coup?

138
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,666
[GUREN] If my goal was
to get rid of you,

139
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,625
I would cut you down
right where you stand.

140
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,000
[KURETO]
You wouldn't land a single blow.

141
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,541
[GUREN]
Wanna bet?

142
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,375
This brings back memories.

143
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,500
I didn't mean to get
you so fired up.

144
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,166
All in all, you're
doing a good job.

145
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,375
[GUREN]
Hm.

146
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,958
[KURETO] But, I know
your weaknesses, Guren.

147
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,833
Love, friendship, honor.

148
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,083
You never learned to set aside
your emotions in order to lead.

149
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:22,333
That's something that makes you
stronger and holds you back.

150
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,291
And it's why I know
I can trust you.

151
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,000
You'll never become
a threat. Will you?

152
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,291
I don't think someone who cares
so much about his comrades

153
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,833
is capable of betraying them.

154
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,583
So, this is the part
where you play

155
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,000
the hostage card again, right?
Who'll it be this time?

156
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,458
What is it that you
want from me, Kureto?

157
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,791
[KURETO]
Don't sound so upset.

158
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,083
Tell me, Guren.

159
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,666
What do you think the
future holds for all of us?

160
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,958
What's the point in living
in a world like this one,

161
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,541
fighting extinction?

162
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,875
I'm sure you've
asked yourself that.

163
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,458
Did you call me here
so you could complain?

164
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,666
[KURETO] I'm just curious
to know what kind of faith

165
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,500
you have in humanity.

166
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,750
This forsaken world is almost
completely devoid of hope.

167
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,000
And yet, you continue to
build your military power.

168
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,875
I want to know your intentions.

169
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,333
[GUREN]
We need more power because

170
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,375
the world is this way. Right?

171
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,041
That may be true.

172
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,416
But no matter how strong
we are, we're as good as dead

173
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,875
if we don't have a clear
vision for the future.

174
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,791
Everything we do must
be for the greater good.

175
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,833
You agree?

176
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,750
Yeah. The greater good.

177
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,583
[KURETO] I'm going to
recover the world, Guren.

178
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,583
Since the vampires destroyed
our communications network,

179
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,916
we haven't been
able to make contact

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,041
with anyone outside of Japan.

181
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,125
But there must be other human
organizations that survived.

182
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,416
[GUREN] I'm sure.
So your goal is what, then?

183
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,750
To search for humans abroad?

184
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,791
Try and reestablish
communications with them?

185
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,583
[KURETO] No. My next step is
to destroy every last vampire

186
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,083
in this country. After that,
I will systematically crush

187
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:58,625
all of the remaining human
organizations that are left.

188
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,791
Putting the world under
The Demon Army's control.

189
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,041
I didn't know you
were such a dreamer.

190
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,666
[KURETO]
Sounds like fun, right?

191
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,208
[GUREN]
Heh.

192
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,958
[KURETO] As my opening move,
I'm going to thin their ranks

193
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,250
and exterminate all
of the vampire nobles.

194
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,416
[GUREN] You seem pretty
sure of yourself.

195
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,583
[KURETO]
I am.

196
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,208
There are currently
25 nobles in Japan.

197
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,166
And I know where each of them
is located at this very moment.

198
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,458
[GUREN] If you're wrong,
the army's finished.

199
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,500
Then my only option
is to win. Right?

200
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,666
[GUREN]
How do you know your intel

201
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,208
isn't some kind of setup?

202
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,083
I've considered that.

203
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,083
But we don't have time
to investigate further.

204
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,500
What's got you in such a hurry?

205
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,083
[KURETO] In one month,
the vampires are launching

206
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,458
a full attack on Tokyo.

207
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,125
[wings flap]

208
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,916
[KURETO]
If we continue as we are now,

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,208
humanity will be
crushed in an instant.

210
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,250
But if we're proactive--

211
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,583
[GUREN]
We can gain the upper hand.

212
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,458
Correct. I want you
to take your team

213
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,833
and 100 of the Moon Demon
Company soldiers to Nagoya.

214
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,041
There, you'll find a base that
houses ten vampire nobles.

215
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,833
Kill all of them and
claim the facility.

216
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,208
If we attack, they'll realize
what you're planning.

217
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,750
[KURETO]
Perhaps.

218
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,416
But it'll be worth it if we
can distract them for a while.

219
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
In the meantime, we'll
prepare for the final battle.

220
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,666
[GUREN chuckles]
So, we're disposable?

221
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,333
[KURETO] This is a very
important mission, Guren.

222
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,291
I've come to you because I
need someone that I can trust.

223
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,750
If you can accomplish this task,
I can take over from there.

224
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,750
So what you're actually
saying is that you don't

225
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,791
wanna tell me your
whole plan right now.

226
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,000
And I thought you trusted me.

227
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,291
Your directive.

228
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,416
Go. That's an order,
not a request.

229
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,125
Just wait. I'm gonna
show you a world

230
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,375
where it's the vampires who
serve as our livestock.

231
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,750
[gasps]

232
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,375
Don't be fooled, my love.

233
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,791
It's my orders that you're
supposed to be following.

234
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,125
Remember.

235
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,041
I'm the only one who can
make your wish come true.

236
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,375
Shut up.

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,375
--[door creaks]
--[gasps]

238
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,541
Lemme guess, you've spotted

239
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,291
some girl taking
off her clothes.

240
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,708
Ugh. How come
you always assume

241
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,041
I'm doing something perverted?

242
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,125
Why else would you
be staring so intently?

243
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,500
[YUICHIRO]
Is it true what you said?

244
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,500
Did I really almost
kill you, Shinoa?

245
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,125
[SHINOA] Well, yeah, but the
nice thing is you didn't

246
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,583
actually go through
with it in the end.

247
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,666
Whatever your intentions were,
I'm still alive and kicking.

248
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,041
Try not to beat
yourself up about it.

249
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,708
We'll figure out
what's going on.

250
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:12,958
But normally,

251
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,208
I would spend the entire
fight protecting you.

252
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,500
Oh. I'm glad to hear
you've finally figured out

253
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:21,250
your role in our team's
formation. You and Kimizuki.

254
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,750
You guys are like the linemen,

255
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,833
the strong knights
of Shinoa's Squad.

256
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,000
Your job is to
protect the queen,

257
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:31,708
and lay down your lives
to ensure my safety.

258
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,750
Hey, Yu?

259
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,250
[YUICHIRO] Did Guren plan
on me losing control?

260
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,208
Was that what he was
going for the whole time?

261
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,083
[SHINOA]
Probably.

262
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,208
I understand if you haven't
made up your mind yet.

263
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,166
I was looking to the West.

264
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,500
[SHINOA]
Uh?

265
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,875
Hey.

266
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,666
The next time we're up
against those bloodsuckers,

267
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,625
will you promise
to stay by my side?

268
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,500
What's gotten into
you all of a sudden?

269
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,416
Uh... Well, if I lose control,
you can stop me by--

270
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,125
[SHINOA] We'll make sure
nothing bad happens to you.

271
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,833
[YUICHIRO]
Thanks, Shinoa.

272
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,250
I'm just doing my job
as the squad's leader.

273
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,375
Don't worry. We're
in this together.

274
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:15,375
I know that. All right.
We should go back.

275
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,916
The others are probably mad
that I've taken so long up here.

276
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,125
[YUICHIRO] I've decided I'm
going to stick with Guren.

277
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,291
[MITSUBA]
Huh?

278
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,833
Family.

279
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,916
That's what he's called our
team from the very beginning.

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Mitsuba. Yoichi.
Kimizuki. Shinoa.

281
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,750
You're my new
brothers and sisters.

282
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,333
[YOICHI, SHINOA,
KIMIZUKI, MITSUBA] Huh?

283
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,166
[YUICHIRO]
I really believe that.

284
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,541
You're all important
to me, but...

285
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,875
I can't forget
about Mika, either.

286
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,750
He's also an important
member of my family.

287
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,833
My parents abandoned me,
so I never really

288
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,291
learned how families are
supposed to work, but...

289
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,166
I'm pretty sure you
don't turn your back

290
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,416
on your brother just because
he kept a secret from you.

291
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,166
Guren said he'd help
me get Mika back

292
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,958
and complete my family.
I'm going to trust his word.

293
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,666
I know I have no right
to get you all

294
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,333
involved in personal
issues like this.

295
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,291
If you want me to leave--

296
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,291
[KIMIZUKI]
I've heard enough.

297
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,500
[gasps]

298
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,708
You were right when you said

299
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,750
you can't turn your
back on family. Agreed?

300
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,625
Yeah!

301
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,958
Well, It sounds like we've
reached a conclusion.

302
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,916
We defend our family.

303
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,125
In this messed-up world,
most people are so busy

304
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,583
trying to survive,
that they forget

305
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,250
to look out for each other.

306
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,708
But Shinoa's Squad is different.

307
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,458
You can probably thank
my strong leadership.

308
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,833
[KIMIZUKI] Now, if we could
just do something about

309
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,791
our teammate's hair...

00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,416
Mika. Oh. You're here.

313
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,916
I was just getting
some blood ready--

314
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,583
Were you really that thirsty?

315
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,541
There, there.
Drink your fill, my pet.

316
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,458
[MIKAELA gasps]

317
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,708
I, I'm sorry, Krul.

318
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,916
We all get a little ravenous

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,958
when we haven't
had enough blood.

320
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,333
[MIKAELA] Um. Can you
give me a little extra?

321
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,708
Of the serum, I mean.

322
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,416
Oh, I can give you
as much as you want.

323
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,166
[KRUL]
But, you know...

324
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,333
You won't last forever
on my blood alone.

325
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,416
The day will come when

326
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,208
you'll have to
drink from a human.

327
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,708
Wait outside for now.

328
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,708
I'll send for you when I'm done.

329
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,000
Right.

330
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,416
[KRUL]
Was there something else?

331
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,708
[MIKAELA] You were supposed
to kill Yuichiro and me.

332
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,125
So what are you playing
at by letting us live?

333
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,791
[KRUL]
You sound so serious.

334
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't tell me you're worried
about my safety, Mika.

335
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,000
Why would you put yourself
at risk to save us?

336
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,125
It just doesn't make
any sense to me.

337
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,083
What are you planning
on doing with Yu?

338
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,208
And with me?

339
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,458
[KRUL]
Oh, Mika.

340
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,833
That's information I'd
rather keep to myself.

341
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,708
Don't mess with me!

342
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,208
If you're gonna
end up hurting Yu,

343
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,375
then I'll put a stop
to this right now.

344
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,166
How, exactly?

345
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,583
After all, you're just
my little pet, remember?

346
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,791
Stop it. I can't
do this anymore.

347
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,708
Come on. Now you're
just being dramatic.

348
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,416
Eventually, you'll
realize the vampires

349
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,000
aren't as bad as the humans.
It's for the better.

350
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,416
I like you and your old friend.

351
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,291
You expect me to believe that?

352
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,958
Without question.

353
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,750
[MIKAELA whimpers]

354
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,083
[KRUL sighs]
Fine.

355
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,208
If you're going to start
sulking, then I'll tell you why

356
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,875
I've kept the two of you alive.

357
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,291
And why I require the power

358
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,333
of the Seraph of
the End for myself.

359
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,041
[KRUL whispers]

360
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,333
[MIKAELA gasps]

361
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,250
Next month, we're attacking
the humans again.

362
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,166
This time we'll send in
our strongest units,

363
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,291
and we won't stop until
every one of them is dead.

364
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,916
This will be the final battle
between humans and vampires.

365
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,916
In order to save Yu,

366
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,833
you're gonna have to go
undercover and hide

367
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,708
from both sides of this war.

368
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,166
I'm giving you a secret mission.

369
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,083
And if you fail...

370
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,750
...then you'll be a
traitor to both sides,

371
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,291
and the whole world
will turn on you.

372
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:10,541
I understand. I'll save
Yu from the vampires.

373
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,125
And from the humans as well.

374
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,416
[knocking]

375
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,916
Come in.

376
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,750
Excuse me, sir.

377
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,000
[SHINOA] I thought
you'd like to know that

378
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,208
Yu and Kimizuki have
completed their training.

379
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,291
They have both
succeeded in possession.

380
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,041
Impressive.

381
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,750
Indeed.

382
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,250
[SHINOA] Last time we talked,
you had a question for me.

383
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,291
You asked if I'd fallen for Yu.

384
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,916
I don't remember
prying like that.

385
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,916
What's your answer?

386
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,416
I'm honestly not sure myself.

387
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,958
It's just, for the first time
in my life, someone needs me.

388
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,166
And I can't let him down
when he's counting on me.

389
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,083
[SHINOA] All right, then.
I'll see myself out.

390
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,791
Hold on. I've got a
new mission for you.

391
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,458
Come to the staging arena
tomorrow at 0600 hours.

392
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,791
[GUREN] We're going to kill
all the vampires in Nagoya.

393
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,083
[RENE] Looks like he
got the order, too.

394
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,000
We've been instructed to move
our main units to Nagoya.

395
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,833
We'll hit Tokyo soon after that.

396
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,500
Yes, I know.

397
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,625
[MAN 15A] Increase sensitivity
on the left side.

398
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,083
[MAN 15B]
Roger that.

399
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,750
[RESEARCHER 15A]
The preparation is complete,

400
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,125
Lieutenant General Kureto.

401
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,416
Begin.

402
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,083
[KURETO]
Increase the power.

403
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:16,958
[KURETO]
Higher.

404
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,125
[RESEARCHER 15A]
But, sir--

405
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,125
If we go higher,
it's likely she'll die.

406
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,541
Do it.

407
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,416
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

408
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,458
"The Moon Demon's Orders."
