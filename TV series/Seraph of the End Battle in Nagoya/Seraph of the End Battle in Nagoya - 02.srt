1
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,875
[YUICHIRO]
Lend me your power, Asuramaru.

2
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,875
So, that's it. Now I'm
possessed, right?

3
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,666
True, but you're at the
lowest level of possession.

4
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,083
To gain more demonic power,
you'll need to cut yourself

5
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,666
on the blade and ask your
sword to drink your blood.

6
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,875
Blood?

7
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,666
Sounds like my sword
is some kind of vampire.

8
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,583
Well, there is a pretty
interesting history

9
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,208
between demons, devils,
and bloodsuckers.

10
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,166
Let's see, where to begin?

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,833
Don't. You can spare us
the lecture, Shinoa.

12
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,333
Let's do this.

13
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,166
[MITSUBA]
Hold it!

14
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,291
[KIMIZUKI, YUICHIRO gasp]

15
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,958
You're gonna try it
at the same time?

16
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,666
What if something goes wrong?

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,916
Your demon could
get out of control.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,916
You remember when
Yoichi tried to kill us?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,291
That's why we came out here,
so you can't hurt anything.

20
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,916
Out of control?

21
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,166
Huh? What did you say?

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,791
Nothing.

23
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,000
[YOICHI]
Hey, guys!

24
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,916
[MITSUBA]
What is it?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,250
It's The Four Horsemen of John.

26
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:41,208
[YOICHI] Three of them.
No, make that five.

27
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,166
Crap. We need to deal with 'em.

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,333
All right, let's get
this over with, fast.

29
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:49,166
[exhales] Destroy our
enemies, Gekkouin!

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,083
Let's protect everyone.

31
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,958
[BOTH gasp]

32
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,041
Whew!

33
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,708
You guys, I did it!

34
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,125
Did you just
manifest your demon?

35
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,750
Since when can you do that?

36
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,750
Explain how that's
possible, Shinoa!

37
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,000
Have you been giving him
private lessons or something?

38
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,500
No, Yoichi's mastered
manifestation on his own.

39
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,250
He's always had exceptional
curse-control abilities.

40
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,375
He's got a surprisingly
strong relationship

41
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,625
with his demon.

42
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,250
Seriously?

43
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,583
Yeah.

44
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,333
I've been talking to my
demon before I go to sleep

45
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,750
and in my dreams, now I
just sorta get how to do it.

46
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,666
[chuckles]

47
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,958
[YUICHIRO]
Okay, Asuramaru. Drink my blood!

48
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,291
Yu, wait!

49
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,791
[YUICHIRO gasps]

50
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,416
Prepare to fight!

51
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,166
[gasping]

52
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:00,500
[gasps, groans]

53
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,750
Is he okay?

54
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,333
What just happened?

55
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,500
I'm not sure.

56
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,208
He didn't immediately
go berserk,

57
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,166
so that's a big improvement.

58
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,333
Right now, he's more than likely

59
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,625
trying to make contact
with his demon.

60
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,083
We'll have to
stand watch over him

61
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,208
until he regains
full consciousness.

62
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,208
Don't look so worried.
We're here to look out

63
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,708
for our family, aren't we, boys?

64
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,125
[KIMIZUKI]
Hmph. Trouble as usual.

65
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,500
What do you mean?

66
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,375
It's not Yu's fault.

67
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm just saying.

68
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,708
Yoichi and I were interrogated
and tortured by the Hiragis.

69
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,583
The whole reason is because
they wanted to know

70
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,500
more about what he did.

71
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,541
Yeah?

72
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,625
And what did you
tell them about it?

73
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,833
Exactly what you ordered us to.

74
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,125
That I didn't know what
they were talking about.

75
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,000
You did the right thing.

76
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,708
And you still think
it's smart that we don't

77
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,875
tell Yu he completely
lost control?

78
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,250
Because it kind of looks like

79
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,833
you're trying to manipulate
him for some reason.

80
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,750
But you wouldn't do that
to your teammate, right?

81
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,500
What if I did?

82
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,875
[KIMIZUKI]
I don't know.

83
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,750
I'd still follow orders
to keep my sister safe,

84
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,291
but I'd have to swallow down
vomit every time I saw you.

85
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,916
Hey, You can't talk
to your superior like that.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,583
Shinoa is just
trying to protect Yu

87
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,541
from the people in the upper--

88
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,250
It's okay, Mitsu.

89
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,916
And what about you, Yoichi?
What do you think?

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,958
Um. Well, I...

91
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,458
I get why you don't wanna
tell Yu about what happened

92
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,291
when he lost control,
because that might

93
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,125
cause him to freak out, but...

94
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,916
[SHINOA] You want a better
explanation, don't you?

95
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,000
[YOICHI]
We're comrades, aren't we?

96
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,666
So tell us your reasoning.

97
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,708
You're right about that.
We should trust each other.

98
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,416
Keeping secrets could
drive us apart.

99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,666
All right then.

100
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,625
Let's talk about all
of this when Yu's awake

101
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,375
and the training's over.

102
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,333
Not just about what
happened to him.

103
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,375
but about where we
stand as a unit, too.

found his demon.

will make me lose

underestimated me.

And how much there is at stake.

and I intend to keep it.

I couldn't save you if
you didn't want my help.

there for a second.

I know how you fight,
and this time, I was prepared.

No need to act so tough.

After all, I know
all of your secrets.

down all you want.

[YUICHIRO] It's tough being
alone, and difficult to feel

167
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,000
like you're unwanted,
or that you've been abandoned.

I know what that's like.

you were gonna die on us

Oh, sorry, I didn't know what
was going on with my body.

So, were you
actually successful?

00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,000
Then I guess it was worth it.

182

Am I the only one who's
exhausted from all this?

Well, It took you long enough.

So, how was it, are you okay?

Never mind. It's nothing.

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,708
[FERID] Well, to put it simply,
the humans are being blinded

197
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,500
by their desire to defeat
us and are partaking

in forbidden experimentation
they don't fully understand.

199

It's quite unsettling.

to the humans'
experiments when she

211

exterminated the Hyakuya Sect.

[KRUL]
That's right.

This program was
dismantled eight years ago.

But if that's true,

to this sort of success

in as the new ruler of Japan.

us to do, Queen Krul?

This doesn't change
our basic strategy.

Open the door!

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,416
Let us in! Crap.

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,416
[BLACK-HAIRED BOY]
This way.

329
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,166
We'll climb over the balcony.

Hey, Big Brother?

I don't wanna see you
wasting away just because

335
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,166
I'm too sick to get out of bed.

336
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,083
Shut up, Mirai.

Do it now and it'll all
be over before you know it,

you'll be free to live your

[KIMIZUKI]
Shut up! Just, shut up!

342
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,541
How can you say
things like that?

343
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,083
[KISEKI-O]
I can hear your thoughts.

344
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,208
Just now you were wondering

345
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,666
what it'd be like
to be rid of me.

I shouldn't have to do this.

359
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,125
[MIRAI]
Thank you, Big Brother,

360
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,958
for finally putting me
out of my misery.

361
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,791
[KIMIZUKI]
I'm so sorry, Mirai.

362
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,333
[MIRAI]
You don't need to apologize.

363
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,333
This was all my idea,
remember? It's what I wanted.

364
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,625
[KIMIZUKI] Before I do this,
can I ask you something?

365
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,500
I recently met this
really stupid guy

366
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,791
who I absolutely hate.

367
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,500
Now I can't get seem
to get away from him,

368
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:55,000
even though he might be the most
annoying person on the planet.

369
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,958
Anyway, he says
he'll risk his life

370
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,833
to protect the people
he cares about.

371
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,291
Even if his "family" isn't
related to him by blood.

372
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,666
That's crazy, right?
I mean, The guy's a moron.

373
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,958
Indeed.

374
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,208
[KIMIZUKI]
I know.

375
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,125
And it's driving me
crazy that he might be

376
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,291
a better person than me.

377
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,333
He'd give up so much for
people he's not related to.

378
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,041
So how could I possibly
kill my own sister?

379
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,208
I'd rather...

[growls] Hey!

392
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,333
If that's true, then how
come you attacked me?

run away from this fight!

413
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,083
[YUICHIRO] I'm not gonna
stand by and get killed

00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,541
by some murder coffin!

That thing looks
super scary, man!

416
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,375
[KIMIZUKI grunts]
He may be dumb,

417
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,791
but he's got good instincts.

418
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,000
[YUICHIRO]
What?

419
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,541
Still, it was my
hatred for him that

420
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,958
helped me overcome my demon.

421
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,833
[KIMIZUKI]
I was just saying that

422
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,625
you're a real pain in my ass.

423
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,875

Oh, screw you!

[YOICHI]
Come on, guys.

426
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,500
Can't we all just get along?

427
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,500
Well, I guess that
was interesting.

428
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,166
Yes. It's curious.

429
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,000
They both tried to
use special abilities

430
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,166
that should be way
above their skill levels.

431
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,416
[MITSUBA] And Yoichi was able
to conjure a manifestation

432
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,958
without any real training.

433
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,375
Where did Lieutenant Colonel
Guren find these guys, anyway?

434
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,625
[MITSUBA]
Wait, that can't be right!

435
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,958
[SHINOA]
There's nothing.

436
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,125
Their records start when
they joined the army.

437
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,125
All the data on their
past has been deleted.

438
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,666
[MITSUBA]
Who would do that?

439
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,666
[SHINOA] It had to have been
the Lieutenant Colonel.

440
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,500
[MITSUBA] You think Guren
is trying to hide his team's

441
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,541
history from the
higher ranking officers?

442
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,208
Possibly, but I
wouldn't be surprised

443
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,541
if there was more
to it than that.

444
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,041
Like what?

445
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,916
[SHINOA] Human experimentation
and war with the vampires.

446
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,708
I've got a bad feeling
that something horrible

447
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,833
is about to happen,
and that we're totally

448
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,625
unprepared for it.

449
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,166
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

450
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,375
"Ambition in the Demon Army."
