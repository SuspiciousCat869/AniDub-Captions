1
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,041
[ASURAMARU]
The non-human part of you

2
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,000
is about to lose all control.

3
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,458
[screaming]

4
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,875
[LACUS]
They suspect it's magic.

5
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,041
That the humans have discovered
a forbidden enchantment

6
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,833
that could destroy the world.

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,791
They called it.
"Seraph of the End," I think.

8
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,541
Snap out of it! Please, Yu!

9
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:49,958
[GUREN]
And so it begins.

10
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,375
[SHINOA] Yu! Stop it!
Please, you have to!

11
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,208
Or all of us are going to die!

12
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,208
Come back to us!

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,708
[SHINOA]
It's been five days.

14
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,583
What the hell did you do to him?

15
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,833
[GUREN]
What would you do to ensure

16
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,166
the future of humanity?

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,375
How can we survive
in this ruined world?

18
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,583
More importantly,

19
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,000
how do we completely
eradicate the vampires?

20
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,041
A Human victory will
require sacrifice.

21
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,250
[FERID] As usual, the
humans' lust for power

22
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,708
is out of control.

23
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,625
And we vampires are so arrogant

24
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,583
that we take things too lightly.

25
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,958
Wouldn't you agree with me?

26
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,041
Go, Shi!

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,375
Lend me your power, Mahiru.

28
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,291
[gasps]

29
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,125
[grunts]

30
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:54,000
Go ahead and kill me.
No one would blame you.

31
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,291
Don't mock me.

32
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,083
You could dodge if you wanted.

33
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,500
[GUREN] I wouldn't mind
if you were the one

34
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,000
who took my life.

35
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,916
Looking for atonement?
Sorry, but you're going to have

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,500
to live with your mistakes, sir.

37
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,208
My sister, Mahiru, loved
you, Lieutenant Colonel.

38
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,958
But she was
possessed by a demon.

39
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,000
Passion consumed her.
And then you...

40
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:19,666
[GUREN] That's right.
I killed your sister.

41
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,041
[SHINOA] But, Mahiru
didn't leave this world.

42
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,916
She became something else.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,750
You used her to create
your Cursed Gear

44
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,708
and betray the Hiragi Family.

45
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,416
You're possessed by my sister.

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,958
Is that why you're
trying to manipulate Yu?

47
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,375
Because my sister
is telling you to?

48
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,541
What's your endgame with him?

49
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,750
[SHINOA]
Lieutenant Colonel.

50
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,833
If you're going to
end up hurting Yu,

51
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,791
even a bit, then I must
humbly ask you to stop.

52
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,125
Why?

53
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,166
Don't tell me you've
fallen for that idiotic kid.

54
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,291
[gasps]

55
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,750
[GUREN] It's true that
your sister is in here.

56
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,625
But I am the one
who's in control.

57
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,958
I'm not possessed by her.

58
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,625
Would you even know?
If she had you?

59
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,708
[GUREN] I don't care whether
you believe me or not.

60
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,000
Ah.

61
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,375
[sighs, groans]

62
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,041
[SHINOA]
You're always here lately.

63
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,708
What are you reading?

64
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,541
[YUICHIRO gasps]
You scared me, Shinoa!

65
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,541
Aren't you still supposed

66
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,541
to be on bed rest
and recovering?

67
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,333
I was going nuts in that bed.

68
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,541
Besides, I feel
totally fine now.

69
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,833
The doctors will decide

70
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,708
when you're back in
fighting shape. Besides...

71
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,041
What is it?

72
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,208
Nothing. Forget it.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,833
[giggles] Wait, you're not
really reading this, are you?

74
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,166
I bet you're hiding
porn in here.

75
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,333
[giggles]

76
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,416
[YUICHIRO]
Hey, give that back. Come on!

77
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,250
Where'd you hide it?

78
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,583
[YUICHIRO]
Jeez.

79
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,750
[gasps]

80
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,083
[SHINOA]
Tell me.

81
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,583
Do you want to turn Mika
back into a human being?

82
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,791
[SHINOA]
If that's the case,

83
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,250
I might have some
helpful information.

84
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,500
Huh?!

85
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,666
[SHINOA]
Do you want to hear it?

86
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,458
Yeah. I do!

87
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,541
Aw, you're always
so cute and obedient

88
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,083
whenever you want something.

89
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,250
Hey, shut up!

90
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,333
Just tell me what
you know, okay?

91
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,333
First of all.

92
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,000
It's pretty rare that a human
is turned into a vampire.

93
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,875
The bloodsuckers like
to keep their ranks tight

94
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,625
and their numbers small.

95
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,833
More importantly,
within vampire society,

96
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,083
the nobles are the only ones

97
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,500
who have the authority
to turn a human.

98
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,625
Wait, so it wasn't random
that Mika was turned--

99
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,291
he was chosen?

100
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,458
[SHINOA]
Can you think of a noble

101
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,583
who might have picked him?

102
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,250
Yeah. Maybe.

103
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,500
You know.

104
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,583
It's our duty to destroy
vampires. All of them.

105
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,333
[YUICHIRO] Not him.
I thought Mika was dead.

106
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:35,250
But he's alive, and that's
enough. Tell me, Shinoa.

107
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,125
Do you have any idea
how to turn a vampire

108
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,958
back into a human?

109
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,916
[YUICHIRO]
I see. Well, now what?

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,333
[SHINOA] I don't think
that I've ever seen you

111
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,666
look so serious before, Yu.

112
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,625
It's almost like you've found
a whole new reason to live.

113
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,375
[ANNOUNCER] Special
Private Yuichiro Hyakuya.

114
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:00,083
Report to the First
Office immediately.

115
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
I wonder what Guren wants now.

116
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,375
No.

117
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,500
It's probably the Hiragi
family who summoned you.

118
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,333
Hold on, the Hiragi family?

119
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,000
You mean the leaders
of the Demon Company

120
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,625
that got Japan back on its feet
after the world went to crap?

121
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,041
[SHINOA] You really shouldn't
keep them waiting.

122
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,333
[YUICHIRO]
Uh-- Wait a minute.

123
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,583
Isn't your last name Hiragi?

124
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,541
Ah! You finally
figured out my secret.

125
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,083
I'm not just a sergeant,
I'm basically royalty.

126
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,708
Now, feel free to worship
me as much as you'd like!

127
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,958
[YUICHIRO sighs]

128
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,208
Okay, okay, all joking aside.

129
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,458
The Hiragis can be an extremely
intense group of people.

130
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,958
So be careful, okay, Yu?

131
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,666
[GUREN]
There's my favorite moron.

132
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,500
So, the most powerful
family in Japan pages you

133
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,958
and you come
running like a dog.

134
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,083
What?

135
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,458
Am I just supposed
to ignore them then?

136
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,958
I've got a little story for you.

137
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,083
Once upon a time, a wise
old man freed a doomed crane

138
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,458
from a hunter's trap.

139
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,000
In return, the crane
wove a beautiful cloth

140
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,500
from its own wings
as a gift for the man.

141
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,250
Huh? What are you talking about?

142
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,291
I am the wise man
who saved you.

143
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,916
Remember? And I was nice
enough to teach you

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
how to survive in this world
and protect your family.

145
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,291
[YUICHIRO]
What's gotten into you?

146
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,416
And why do I feel like
you're patronizing me?

147
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,958
[GUREN]
In a manner of speaking,

148
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,875
you can return the favor today.

149
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,375
Will you just tell me
what it is you want me--

150
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,833
[GUREN] I saved your life
and now I own you.

151
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,833
So don't go wagging
your tail for them.

152
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,750
[YUICHIRO]
So that's what this is about.

153
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,083
You don't control me.

154
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,166
You're wrong about that, Yu.

155
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,375
[YUICHIRO]
This is ridiculous.

156
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,083
I don't care about
whatever grudge you have

157
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,791
against the Hiragi Family.
It doesn't ma--

158
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,291
[GUREN]
Shut up and listen, kid.

159
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,041
You may not care
about army politics,

160
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,208
but that's the way
this world works.

161
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,708
You don't have to
worry about me, Guren.

162
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,916
Come on.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,791
I'm not someone who
abandons his friends.

164
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,125
Haven't you learned
that about me yet?

165
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:11,000
[GUREN]
Hm? Yeah, I guess.

166
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,500
But that doesn't make
me feel any better.

167
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,875
After all, I am not your friend.

168
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,125
[YUICHIRO] Oh, yeah?
Well then, what are you?

169
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,666
Guardian. Your superior.

170
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,250
Life saver. I'm
basically your god.

171
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,333
Ugh. Please!

172
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,666
Huh?

173
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,125
What's up? Did you
get called in, too?

174
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,041
How did it go?

175
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,791
It was just a stupid interview.

176
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,875
Apparently, I'm moving
up a rank for my part

177
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,625
in fighting off the vampires and
my bravery on the battlefield.

178
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,791
[YUICHIRO]
A promotion, huh? Nice.

179
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,875
It's no surprise.

180
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,791
I totally deserve it,
don't'cha think?

181
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,083
If you say so.

182
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,166
Hey, wait!

183
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,291
You can't just say that
and then leave!

184
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,583
Huh?

185
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,750
[MITSUBA] You know I
shouldn't be promoted.

186
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,166
I was completely useless
when things got tough

187
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,666
on the battlefield.

188
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,208
Sure, I can talk a big game,
but I can't follow through.

189
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,708
It's because I'm, I'm so weak.

190
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,166
And yet, I bet I'm the
only one getting promoted.

191
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,583
Just because I'm part
of the Sangu family.

192
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:27,500
Go ahead and laugh.
Go on! I'm a failure.

193
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,333
Stop it. I'm not
laughing, Mitsuba.

194
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,750
It's weird. I mean,
you and Shinoa.

195
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,208
I had no idea until today
that we basically have

196
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,875
two princesses on our team.

197
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,791
Between the Sangus
and the Hiragis,

198
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,208
shouldn't we be
living in a castle?

199
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,375
You are... such an idiot.

200
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,041
Whatever.

201
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,375
Anyway, this promotion
is good news.

202
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,958
The higher you go, the more
you can help me out.

203
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,625
You mean your family, right?

204
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,166
Yeah.

205
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,500
[MITSUBA] They're going to ask
about that in the interview.

206
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,375
They think you might be a spy.

207
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,500
So I've been ordered
to keep an eye on you.

208
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,083
Oh? Wow.

209
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,791
Do you think that I'm a spy?

210
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,791
[MITSUBA]
I told them that was impossible.

211
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,958
And that, in my opinion,
you're not smart enough

212
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,375
to be a double agent. So there.

213
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,958
[YUICHIRO chuckles]
Thanks, I guess. But seriously.

214
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,208
I'm glad that you believe in me.

215
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,083
Wait, Yu.

216
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,625
[YUICHIRO]
Hm?

217
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,250
[MITSUBA] The Hiragi family
is terrifying. Watch yourself.

218
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,000
[YUICHIRO]
I will. Thanks.

219
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,875
[MITSUBA sighs]

220
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,166
[SHINOA]
Was that a sigh?

221
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,041
What do you have to
be depressed about?

222
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,916
[MITSUBA] Shinoa. What are
you doing out here?

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,333
Oh, nothing. Just out
enjoying a little walk.

224
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,291
Did the Hiragi
family talk to you?

225
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,166
Yeah, they gave me a promotion.

226
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,166
I'm now a Special
Second Lieutenant.

227
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,583
Oh, wow, that's super
impressive, Mitsu!

228
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,833
And so shocking that
a Sangu can get promoted

229
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,666
without actually working for it.

230
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,708
Ah--

231
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,416
[SHINOA giggles]
Oh, don't be upset.

232
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, yeah? What about you?

233
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,666
I bet they were falling
all over themselves

234
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,583
to move you up a rank and
make themselves even more--

235
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,250
No promotion here.

236
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,541
And besides, if they did
try to move me up a rank,

237
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,708
I would just kindly refuse.

238
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,250
That sounds about right.

239
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,041
The Hiragis do what they want.

240
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,375
[SHINOA]
Not all of us.

241
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,583
Actually, I kinda think my
family has lost all hope

242
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,083
for me these days.

243
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,708
Sure.

244
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,500
[SHINOA]
So, how much information

245
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,166
did you have to give up
in exchange for the promotion?

246
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,166
[MITSUBA]
What do you mean?

247
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,583
[SHINOA] They wanted to
know about what happened

248
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,708
when Yu freaked out, right?
When he lost control.

249
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,083
I told them that I
didn't know anything.

250
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,083
Seemed like they didn't either.

251
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,625
[SHINOA] If that's true,
then the experimentation on Yu

252
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,291
must not have been officially
sanctioned by the Demon Army.

253
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,416
Do you have any idea

254
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,750
what that was
on the battlefield?

255
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,500
I don't. I wish I did.

256
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,583
In a world like this,
it's not always clear

257
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,833
who's on your side
and who's not.

258
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,333
I just hope Yu's smart enough
to know the difference.

259
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,125
[knocking]

260
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,708
What the...?

261
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,125
[gasps]

262
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,125
Huh?

263
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,125
But how did a
vampire get in here?

264
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,583
[growls]

265
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,000
[grunts]

266
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,458
[grunts]

267
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,500
[VAMPIRE 13A groans]

268
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,291
Jeez, what kind of crap
are they trying to pull?

269
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,041
[KURETO] That was a test
of loyalty to make sure

270
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,833
you aren't a traitor.

271
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,750
Now, shall we go ahead
and start your interview?

272
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,583
Who the heck are you?

273
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,166
Kureto Hiragi.

274
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,583
Imperial Demon Army
lieutenant general.

275
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,791
Yuichiro Hyakuya.

276
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,791
Let's get a better sense
of how skilled you are

277
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,000
with a sword. But don't
activate the curse.

278
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,416
Sounds like fun.

279
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,750
But don't get angry if I
humiliate the almighty Hiragi.

280
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,041
Oh, Yu.

281
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,750
Perhaps it would be better
if you don't listen

282
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,250
to everything
brother Kureto says.

283
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,458
What?

284
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,208
[KURETO] Ignore him.
Possess me. Raimeiki.

285
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,750
[gasps]

286
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,583
[YUICHIRO grunts]

287
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,541
[gasps]

288
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,500
So this is the best you can do?

289
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,000
I have to admit,
I'm not impressed.

290
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,791
That was dirty.

291
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,458
Complain about
someone fighting dirty

292
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,458
in a real battle and see if that
keeps them from killing you.

293
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,416
ou do take orders
well, at least.

294
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,083
You didn't even hesitate
to follow my command.

295
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,583
Hard to believe you're
that disobedient Guren's--

296
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,583
Back off.

297
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,125
[YUICHIRO]
Well, look at that.

298
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,166
You'd be dead right now if your
comrade hadn't stepped in.

299
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,541
What? Why the long face?

300
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,958
You don't think
it was a dirty move

301
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,291
for me to attack
from behind, do you?

302
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,750
Heh. I take back what
I was going to say.

303
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,291
You are indeed
Guren's subordinate.

304
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,875
We're done?
That was pretty fast.

305
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,041
[KURETO]
Shinya.

306
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,416
Huh?

307
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,791
Aw, but I don't wanna.
This isn't my kind of thing.

308
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,666
I don't enjoy bullying the weak.

309
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,916
As an adoptive son,
you will do as you're told.

310
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,333
Man... Well, if I must. Fine.

311
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,625
Stop fooling around.

312
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,708
Who are you calling weak?

313
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,458
Why, you, silly boy.

314
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,958
Wanna try me?

315
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,250
[SHINYA] Well, that is the
order I'm supposed to follow.

316
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,625
Let's begin.

317
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,541
After him, Byakkomaru.

318
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,875

[YUICHIRO grunts]

322

[grunts]

323
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,541
That's it. It's over.

324
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,500
And I'm not even that
good at close combat

325
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,541
compared to Kureto or Guren.

326
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,750
My Byakkomaru is more of a
long-range specialty weapon.

327
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,958
You do understand
what that means

328
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,791
about your skill level, yes?

329
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,416
But, it's not your fault.

330
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,083
Seems to me like you
weren't properly trained

331
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,583
to use your Cursed Gear.
What a shame.

332
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,125
But, try not to
feel too pathetic.

333
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,166
So then.

334
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,208
Does that finally clear
me of any suspicion?

335
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,708
It's obvious he doesn't know me
or my fighting style. Okay?

336
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,583
Wait. What the hell was
that test really about?

337
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,750
They actually think that
I might be a traitor, too,

338
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,166
since I'm friends with
Guren. Crazy, right?

339
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,708
It does seem there's
a vampire spy

340
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,250
in the army somewhere, though.

341
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,958
For the Hiragis,
that's a huge problem

342
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,375
that must be dealt
with immediately.

343
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,875
Then leave me out of it.

344
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,708
'Cause if you think I'm the spy,
then you're out of your--

345
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,875
[KURETO]
Bring him along.

00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,083
[gasps]

347
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,708
Let go of me!

[gasps]

349
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,625
[gasps]

350
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,083
[YUICHIRO]
Kimizuki! Yoichi!

351
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,625
All right, what have
you done to them?

352
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,250
[KURETO] I interrogated them
because we think you're the spy.

353
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,291
You're insane!

354
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's start your interview.
You will speak only the truth.

355
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,291
Deceive us, and your
friends will die.

356
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,583
[gasps]

357
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,875
There isn't much background
here in your file.

358
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,833
And yet, you managed
to somehow attain

359
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,458
a Black Demon weapon.

360
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,666
As did your two
teammates over there.

361
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,666
Normally, there are
thorough background checks

362
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,083
conducted for
anyone going through

363
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,916
the Cursed Gear ceremony.

364
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,791
But there weren't
any for you three.

365
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,541
Why not?

366
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,541
Where did the three
of you come from?

367
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,666
What is your mission?

368
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,041
My mission? I told you!

369
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,125
Do it.

370
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,833
[muffled screaming]

371
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,125
[gasps] Stop it.

372
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,625
Then answer truthfully.

373
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,041
I am! I don't know
what you want me to say!

374
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,625
[KURETO]
The next one.

375
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,125
[muffled screaming]

376
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,041
[gasps] Please, stop!
I'll do whatever you want.

377
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,750
Ask me anything!

378
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,458
Good attitude. Let's talk
more about your past.

379
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,375
You grew up in the vampire city,

380
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,708
but you somehow
managed to escape.

381
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,791
It was during your
getaway that the vampires

382
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,875
brutally murdered your family.

383
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,541
Which is why you're
so hungry for revenge.

384
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,875
At least, that's what
it says in the file.

385
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,416
Is this correct?

386
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,750
Yeah.

387
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,166
There's no way I'm working
for those bloodsuckers.

388
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,708
[KURETO] Your protests aren't
doing you any favors.

389
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,583
Afterwards, Guren
Ichinose discovered you

390
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,208
and took you in.
The question is why?

391
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,791
Why did Guren take
an interest in you?

392
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,166
What exactly are you to him?

393
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,458
[YUICHIRO]
I don't...

394
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,458
Is Hyakuya really
your last name,

395
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,833
or is that a lie, too?

396
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,541
Are you of the Hyakuya Sect?

397
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,250
[gasps] No, I'm not.

398
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,708
It was just the name of
the orphanage I grew up in!

399
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,583
Are you aware that
the Hyakuya Sect

400
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,750
was the largest spellcraft
organization in Japan?

401
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,250
They routinely brought lost
children to their orphanage

402
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,333
and used them for
human experimentation

403
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,416
and to test out
new forms of magic.

404
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,708
You were likely a lab rat
for spellcraft experimentation.

405
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,500
Huh?

406
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,458
[KURETO] This is starting
to make more sense.

407
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,458
Guren must actually be
trying to use something

408
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,500
the Hyakuya Sect put inside you.

409
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,625
Come.

410
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,083
Work for me instead,
Yuichiro Hyakuya.

411
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,875
Allow me to be your new guide.

412
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,833
Let Yoichi and Kimizuki
go right now.

413
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,750
We're all done here.

414
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,500
[KIMIZUKI, YOICHI groan, sigh]

415
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,333
[YUICHIRO] I don't know what's
up between you and Guren

416
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,333
or what you're fighting about.

417
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:35,541
But at least Guren wouldn't
use this kind of torture.

418
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,833
[KURETO]
I know.

419
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,291
That's why I'm always
one step ahead of him.

420
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,125
You're free to go now.

421
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,791
[laughs]

422
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,250
What a messed up place this is.

423
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:56,291
But still, I can't wait to see
what you do next, lab rat.

424
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,333
You're so fidgety.
Are you really

425
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,916
that worried about Yu?

426
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,083
Huh?

427
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,583
I don't know what
you're talking about.

428
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,916
I mean, why would I worry
about an idiot like him?

429
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,083
[gasps] Oh, Yu!

430
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,791
[MITSUBA]
Yu!

431
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,208
Whoa, Kimizuki and
Yoichi look terrible!

432
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,000
What happened to you?

433
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,708
What's going on?

434
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,375
That interview was total crap.

435
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,416
The Stupid Hiragi--

436
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,291
Guren! You better
start explaining!

437
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,750
[YUICHIRO]
Kureto said that me, my family--

438
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,750
all of us were used
as guinea pigs.

439
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,208
Experimented on by some weirdo
sect practicing spellcraft.

440
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,375
Tell me the truth.

441
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,083
Did you save me just
so you could use me?

442
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,791
[gasps]

443
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:52,916
That's right.

444
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,708
I don't have the
luxury of saving anyone

445
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,500
who doesn't serve
a higher purpose.

446
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,458
[YUICHIRO gasps]

447
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,458
So, what?

448
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,750
Are you gonna
start sulking now?

449
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,041
No. Regardless of your reasons,

450
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,083
I would've died if
you didn't find me.

451
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,166
All I wanna know is
if I'm of use to you

452
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,375
in our fight against
the vampires.

453
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,083
If I am, then you must wanna
recruit Mika as well, right?

454
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,750
He was a lab rat, too!

455
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't care about whatever

456
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:23,791
the Hyakuya did to me.
I can't change that.

457
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:28,375
It's done. Just tell me
how I can get Mika back.

458
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,541
But, Yu...

459
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,958
[GUREN]
Like I said before.

460
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,375
Everyone here is your family,
and that includes me.

461
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,750
That means we'll work together

462
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,250
to get the rest of
your family back.

463
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,250
If that's true...

464
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,625
Then teach me how
to be a better fighter!

465
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,583
Show me the proper way
to use my Cursed Gear!

466
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,541
That was already my next step.

[FERID] Why don't you take
a little sip already?

471
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,500
After all, Mika, this is
probably the best looking

472
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,333
you're ever going to be.
You wouldn't want to risk--

473

[DAIKI]
Excuse me.

474
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,333
Sorry.

475
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,583
But I heard that if I
offer my blood to you,

476
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,916
then you could make life
easier for me and my family.

477
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:35,333
Who told you such
a thing? Was it you?

478
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,500
[FERID]
Hm.

479
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,708
[DAIKI groans]

480
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,875
Here, Mika. Come and
taste this kid's blood.

481
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,458
Quench your terrible thirst.

482
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,916
[gasps]

483
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
[groaning]

484
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,250
[gasping]

485
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,875
[gulps]

486
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,500
[growls]

487
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,750
[DAIKI grunts]

488
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,750
It's against the rules to
drink directly from a human.

489
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,875
[FERID]
You're such a goody-two-shoes.

490
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:08,416
[DAIKI groans, coughs]

491
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Or maybe... You're just
thinking of him.

492
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,583
You're scared that Yu will--

493
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,750
What are you doing here, Ferid?

494
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,666
[DAIKI coughing]

495
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,375
[FERID]
Ah! Right.

496
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,458
I came here to invite
you to something.

497
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:24,625
You must attend the next
Progenitor Council meeting.

498
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,000
[MIKAELA]
The Progenitor Council?

499
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,416
What do they want?

500
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,958
[FERID] It'll be so
much more interesting

501
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,291
if you find out for
yourself, Mika, dear.

502
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,250
Now, shall we go?

503
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:44,375
[grunts]

504
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,416
[panting]

505
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,250
It's so painful...
I need your help. Yu.

506
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,958
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

507
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,833
"Complicated Connections."
