[YUICHIRO panting]

4
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,500
[ASURAMARU] Well, aren't
you full of surprises.

5
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,333
I was afraid you'd
forgotten about revenge.

6
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,625
But I see you're still
obsessed with family.

7
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,625
[YUICHIRO]
Power...

8
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,625
You really want
my power that badly?

9
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,125
I need it.

10
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,125
I'm not strong enough.

11
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,708
I have to go save
Guren. So, come on.

12
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,000
Gimme every last
ounce, Asuramaru!

13
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,125
Well, that's no big deal.

14
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,625
All you had to do
was ask for my help.

15
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:53,666
You know I feed off of your
hate and desire for vengeance.

16
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,291
The problem is,
taking those pills

17
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,625
was a mistake.

18
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,083
Not only do they totally
kill your passion,

19
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,125
they also enhance your curse
and make it super strong.

20
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,458
That's a dangerous combination.

21
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,166
You can't get
something for nothing.

22
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,875
If you swallow a pill
and gain power,

23
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,375
there's gotta be some
kinda price to pay.

24
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,375
[YUICHIRO]
Just tell me what to do, dammit.

25
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,916
How can I get the strength
I need to save Guren?

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,916
[ASURAMARU] Oh, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,833
There's nothing I can do
to make the deceased

28
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,166
more powerful.

You're dead, Yu.

31
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,333
Your heart and other
organs ruptured

32
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,166
after taking those extra pills,

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,250
killing you in front
of your friends.

34
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,166
You tried to get too much
power for nothing,

35
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,291
and it cost you your life.

36
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,125
This is the end. It's over.

37
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,791
[YUICHIRO]
No way.

38
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,583
Then where am I now?

39
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,291
Is this the afterlife, or what?

40
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,416
[ASURAMARU] Unfortunately,
that's not the case.

41
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,291
I bet the afterlife
is a lot better than

42
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,083
whatever trials are
in store for you.

43
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,958
What are you saying?

44
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,375
Don't get me wrong,
your body died.

45
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,291
But you're not
at peace. Tell me.

46
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,250
Why do you think that is?

00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,208
[ASURAMARU]
Not sure.

53
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,541
Looks like a trumpet to me.

54
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,916
[ASURAMARU]
That thing's no good.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,208
I'd stay far away from it.

56
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,291
Angels can be more
dangerous than demons.

[heart beats]

58
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,416
Hey, your heart started beating.

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,125
That means I can repair it,
and make you whole again.

60
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,416
But I... want it.

61
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,125
[ASURAMARU] It's better to
accept me than whatever that is.

62
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,916
Just forget about it.
I can fix you.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,500
I don't need you anymore.
I want the trumpet.

64
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,666
Dammit.

65
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,708

got him hypnotized.

I said not to touch it.

68
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,958
Then give me your
strength, Asuramaru!

69
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,041
Heh. Such a greedy little human.

70
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,291
Can't you feel it?

71
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,833
I've already given you
the power you asked for.

72
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,541
All those pills you took
are still in effect.

73
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,125
They'll help keep
you in control.

74
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,916
That means you can
safely use my power

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,208
for two or three minutes.

76

Use your time wisely, Yu.

How did you and the
other humans get

such strong powers?
Who gave them to you?

Remember, we want to
keep him alive, Chess.

He's an important hostage,

so make sure to
handle him with care.

You bastard! Give Guren back!

103
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,875
Impressive. Are you
really a human?

Or something else?

But why? I've come this far.

How's it possible
that I still don't have

enough power to save you?

Because you're human.

You're nothing more
than our livestock.

You can fight all you want, kid.

But you could never
defeat a noble like me.

I have everything under
control right now.

This isn't over yet.

You have to give me
more power. Asuramaru!

Wow, you humans are dumb.

I won't think twice
about killing you, right?

Yes. I can feel it.

I'll give you more than
you could ever imagine.

Then I'll watch your

More power. And then...

Kimizuki. What was that?

It's Kiseki-o's ability.

Anyone who hears the nine counts

You're being annoying.

Where would you wanna go?

Huh? Did you hit your
head or somethin'?

245
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,291
We can't escape 'cause
the virus would kill us

246
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,458
as soon as we got outside.

Use your imagination.

with the rest of the family.

250
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,375
If we could go to a place
without any vampires, then,

251
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,625
don't you think
we would have fun?

252

Without vampires?

253
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,875
[MIKAELA]
Yeah. Just us family.

Yeah, of course I would.

get busy working on that.

325
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,541
[SHINOA]
If we let them kill you,

326
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,541
he'll be really mad
at us when he wakes up.

327
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:54,125
So I guess, you have
to take him and run.

328
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,166
[KIMIZUKI, MITSUBA gasp]

329
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,458
[gasps]

330
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,541
What in the hell are you doing?

331
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,541
Don't make us kill you!

332
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,916
Stand down.

333
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,583
Dammit, we don't
have time for this.

334
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,625
Kill 'im!

335
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,958
Jeez. Are we doing this?

336
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,291
Well, we don't have
much of a choice. Do we?

337
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,291
Mika is Yu's family.

338
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,958
Which makes him our friend.
And we protect our own, right?

339
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,333
Keep both of them
safe. Stand guard!

340
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,375
Ally? But how can that be?

341
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:46,375
You'd protect me because you
know that I'm his family?

342
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,583
[YUICHIRO]
Hey, Mika!

343
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,958
Get over here and help me
keep these kids entertained.

344
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,000
[TAICHI]
Brother Mika!

345
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,250
[AKANE]
Mika!

346
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,458
[CHIHIRO] Come on,
Brother Mika, let's play!

347
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,416
[MIKAELA]
Hold on. Yu.

348
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,250
Take him. This is
your only chance.

349
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,875
I'll clear things up
with the other troops.

350
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,375
Join us at the airport
and we'll leave together.

351
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,541
Join you? Are you insane?
There's no way.

352
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,666
Look, we don't have time
to argue about this, okay?

353
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,375
I'm just gonna trust that
you'll take good care of him.

354
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't let me down.

355
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,125
[SHINOA grunts]

356
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,458
Go! Now!

357
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,875
You heard her. Let's move.

358
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,791
This is only a
temporary goodbye, Yu.

359
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,416
If we're lucky,
we'll meet agai--

360
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,416
Scum. You've betrayed us!

361
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,250
No! You can't kill her!

362
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,750
Didn't you hear your
commander's orders?

363
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,500
If you can't follow them,
then get off the battlefield.

364
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,791
There's no place for you here.

365
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,000
[sighs]

366
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,541
[NARUMI]
Don't look so relieved.

367
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,791
You've got a lot
of explaining to do.

368
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,708
We're out of time!
Their backup is here.

369
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,291
More vampires!

370
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,833
[TROOPERS groan]

371
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,916
Damn it! [gasps]

372
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,833
[growls]

373
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,166
[RIKA]
No!

374
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,958
[YAYOI gasps]

375
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,208
Yayoi!

376
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,833
[KAGIYAMA]
You monster!

377
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,708
Kagiyama!

378
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,500
[NARUMI]
Damn you!

379
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,541
Stay back! We're dead
if a noble comes.

380
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,375
We're leaving.

381
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,916
No way.

382
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,541
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

383
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,208
"Yu and Mika."
