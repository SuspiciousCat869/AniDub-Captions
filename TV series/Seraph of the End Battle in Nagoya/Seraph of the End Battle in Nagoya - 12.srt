00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,416
What a pain.

328
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,000
[MIKAELA] Just don't do
anything dumb like grow wings

329
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,833
and try to kill us all
when we get there.

330
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,583
[YUICHIRO] Why would you say
something like that, Mika?

331
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,250
Besides, I saved the day.

332
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,125
[KIMIZUKI] You should bring
back the demon horns.

333
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,291
It was a good look for you.

334
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,250
[YOICHI giggles]
It's gonna be a long trip.

335
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,666
[SHINOA giggles]

336
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,000
[MITSUBA]
Yu will be fine.

337
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,833
I mean, there's no way
things could get any worse

338
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,333
than they were, right?

339
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,416
[MIKAELA] Did you hear
that? It's all good.

340
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,750
[splashing]

341
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,875
[MIKAELA]
Yu?

342
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,708
[YUICHIRO]
It's starting to rain.
