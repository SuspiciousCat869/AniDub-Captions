1
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,583
Listen to me
carefully, everyone.

2
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,083
During this mission, I won't
tolerate any failures.

3
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,291
Follow my orders to the letter
and don't fool around.

4
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,750
This mission will probably be

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,541
the most dangerous
you will ever have.

6
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,416
Many of you will die.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
Remember, everyone
here is family.

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,833
That means those
who fall in battle

9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,958
are our brothers
and our sisters.

10
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,625
But they won't die in vain!

11
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,041
Their sacrifices will
ensure our success.

12
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,125
Let me be clear.

13
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,250
Our goal isn't
to come back alive.

14
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,250
It is to be victorious
no matter what!

15
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,000
Do you understand me?

16
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,708
[YUICHIRO grunting]

17
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,666
[YUICHIRO]
Hey, Shinoa. How much longer?

18
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,458
[SHINOA]
We've got about 20 minutes.

19
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,916
[NARUMI]
Everyone. Fall in line.

20
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,625
I want to go over our
plan of attack again.

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,708
[IWASAKI]
We begin at 1400 hours.

22
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,666
Our gathered troops will move
in teams attacking in unison.

23
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,500
If all goes as planned,
eight targets will be executed

24
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,125
leaving two nobles alive.

25
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,666
Our target's a strong one.

26
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,083
Lucal Wesker. The
Fifteenth Progenitor.

27
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,833
We plan to engage him here.

28
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,500
If we're unable to
take him by surprise,

29
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,333
our priority is to cut off
his retreat and prevent him

30
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,083
from joining the other nobles.

31
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,833
Once our target is dead,
we'll hold off

32
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,041
any remaining vampires until
the Lieutenant Colonel

33
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,625
supplies us with new orders.

34
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,791
Best-case scenario,
all the targets are killed

35
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,291
simultaneously and we don't
have a problem regrouping

36
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,875
and killing the remaining
two nobles in Nagoya.

37
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,833
If the targets aren't
destroyed and the nobles

38
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:59,291
join forces, there's no way
we'll be able to beat them.

39
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,833
Look.

40
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,041
All of our targets are located
fairly close to one another.

41
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,958
But since our assembled
forces have been split

42
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,666
into small groups, it should
keep the targets busy.

43
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,500
Our team's one of the smallest.

44
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,208
That means there must be
high expectations for us.

45
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,041
Even though there aren't as
many troops in our squad--

46
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,625
Failure is not an option.
If you make a mistake,

47
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,708
it'll affect the lives of
all 100 of your comrades.

48
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,333
You have to remember that.

49
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,750
We will.

50
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,375
[YUICHIRO sighs] Right, so
basically all we gotta do

51
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,208
is kill this LuLu LaLa
guy, right? No sweat.

52
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,833
Come on, man.

53
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,000
Fooling around
will get us killed.

54
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,666
This is behind enemy lines.

55
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,833
Have you forgotten what the
Lieutenant Colonel said?

56
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,166
Huh?

57
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,958
I'm just saying that it's
not gonna be that hard.

58
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,208
Show some respect.

59
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,458
This kid. He's isn't serious?

60
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,041
Sergeant Narumi.
Can't we be reassigned?

61
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,833
There's no way I can trust
these kids to have my back.

62
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,833
Whoa. Calm down, Rika.

63
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,791
We have to work alongside them.

64
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,541
We don't really have
time to switch out.

65
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,833
This kind of unrest isn't good.

66
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,666
They hate us.

67
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,333
Go apologize.

68
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,583
[SHINOA] Um. I apologize,
Sergeant Narumi.

69
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,458
I'll make sure my squad
is ready to follow order--

70
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,875
I don't need
anyone to apologize.

71
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,333
Just remember, we need
to be on our toes.

72
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:17,041
If one person drags us down,
then we're all as good as dead.

73
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,458
I don't wanna lose a comrade
because of a single screw up.

74
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,666
What is it?

75
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,333
Do you not agree
with what I said?

76
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,416
[YUICHIRO]
No. I-I mean, yes.

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,958
What I'm saying is that
I feel the same way.

78
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,166
I don't wanna lose
any comrades either.

79
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,916
I don't need excuses,
I need you to act--

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,166
[YUICHIRO] Listen! Our squads.
We're in this together.

81
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,625
So I'll make sure that
none of us get hurt.

82
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,875
[NARUMI] Then the least
you can do is remember

83
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,333
our target's name. There's
more to being a good soldier

84
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,083
than the ability
to swing a sword.

85
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,666
There's no point in
remembering the name

86
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,791
of someone you're
just going to kill.

87
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,125
But I do remember
the names of the people

88
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,458
I'm going to protect. Got it?

89
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:08,208
Shinoa. Kimizuki.
Mitsuba. Yoichi...

90
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:15,291
[YUICHIRO] Makoto Narumi.
Yayoi Endo. Rika Inoue.

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,083
Taro Kagiyama. Shusaku Iwasaki.

92
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,208
I won't let my
comrades get killed.

93
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,958
We'll show Guren
we can be victorious

94
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,791
without losing a
single teammate.

95
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,166
Uh--

96
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,750
[SHINOA] I apologize if
my subordinate's attitude

97
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,833
is out of line, Sergeant Narumi.

98
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,250
But everyone on my
squad feels the same.

99
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,416
We're with you 100%.

100
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
We may be newbs, but we'll
follow our directives

101
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,958
and try our best not
to drag anyone down.

102
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,125
I swear this on my
honor and my life.

103
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,625
Fine, then.

104
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,875
The mission will begin
in six minutes.

105
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,125
Yayoi. Report.

106
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,041
Our target should
be in site soon.

107
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,791
Any second, according
to our intelligence.

108
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,500
He visits the park around this
time every day without fail.

109
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,708
[yawns] This sounded like
a good idea in theory,

110
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,000
but now that it's time,
I'm getting kinda nervous.

111
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,208
Keep it together.

112
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,166
We've got the upper hand today.

113
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,541
We're taking them
completely by surprise.

114
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,541
Let's do this together.

115
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,125
Without any deaths. No one hurt.

116
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:19,250
A victorious mission.
With all targets executed.

117
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,916
Got it.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,791
We should get started.

119
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,791
[panting]

120
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,208
[SHINYA]
What's wrong, Yoichi?

121
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,000
You're starting to
make me nervous.

122
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,541
We've still got five minutes
before the mission begins.

123
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,500
Yeah. I know.

124
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,750
But what happens if we screw up
and the whole thing turns--

125
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,708
[SHINYA]
Don't even entertain the idea.

126
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,500
With any luck,
we'll finish him off.

127
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,083
Then we'll be war heroes.

128
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,708
[YOICHI grunts]

129
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,458
[SHINYA] Worry too much and
you'll mess up for sure.

130
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,625
Now, then.

131
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,791
This is your first
sniper mission, right?

132
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,833
Guren asked me to teach you a
few things to get you prepared.

133
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,833
Like I said, first,
you need to calm down.

134
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:09,833
Okay.

135
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,250
Great.

136
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,375
Try to take it easy and
remember that we're not alone.

137
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,375
If we don't take Wesker down,
then the others will.

138
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,458
That's the whole reason the
close-combat team exists anyway.

139
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,333
[YOICHI]
Right.

140
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,666
Snipers need to keep their cool.

141
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,750
It's the only way we're
gonna pick off enemies

142
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,541
and backup our comrades.

143
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,166
Or kill them if
they're captured,

144
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,708
saving them from
unspeakable torture

145
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,375
at the hands of the vampires.

146
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,500
[gasps] You'd kill
your own teammates?

147
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,708
If necessary, yeah.

148
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,083
But as long as we land our
shots, we won't have to worry

149
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,500
about anything like that.
So unwind, take a deep breath.

150
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,833
All right.

151
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,708
[SHINYA]
Relax your muscles.

152
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,750
Focus on trying to
slow down your pulse.

153
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,208
Once you're breathing steadily,
try calling for your demon.

154
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,791
Come out, Gekkouin.

155
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,791
Thank you for that.
I feel better.

156
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,000
Good boy. Stay alert.

157
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,458
Our target should show
himself any time now.

158
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,875
Go ahead and get the
park in your sites.

159
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,250
[YOICHI]
Okay.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,375
[YOICHI] There are lots
of normal vampires

161
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,791
walking around down there.

162
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,875
[SHINYA] Ignore them.
Focus on finding that noble.

163
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,041
[YOICHI]
Right.

164
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,708
[SHINYA]
Here he comes.

165
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,750
[SHINYA]
He's the one in the hat.

166
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,791
That's Lucal Wesker.

167
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,958
[SHINYA] Don't get an
itchy trigger finger.

168
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,583
Wait until I give
you the signal.

169
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,250
Otherwise, all our plans
will be thrown off.

170
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,333
[YOICHI]
Got it.

171
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,958
[LUCAL] Hm... Not bad
today. Where's it from?

172
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,791
This was collected in Naka.

173
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,500
Prisoner 58. Female. Age four.

174
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,291
[LUCAL]
Hm...

175
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,791
I do love the mellow taste
of frightened young girls.

176
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,583
I insist that you
have a sip, Esther.

177
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,041
Thank you.

178
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,625
But I've already had more
than my share to drink today

179
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,541
thanks to your
generosity, my lord.

180
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,000
[LUCAL]
But this is a rare treat,

181
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,666
blood of the highest quality.

182
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,875
Perfection. It should be
savored while it's fresh.

183
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,708
Please, enjoy yourself.

184
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,250
I'll try it once we've
returned to the compound.

185
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,750
Very well.

186
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,791
Now, business.

187
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,750
What do you make of the
absurd letter I received

188
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,166
from Krul Tepes?

189
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,541
[ESTHER] I assume that you
are referring to her plan

190
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,708
to annihilate the Japanese
Imperial Demon Army?

191
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,916
[LUCAL] The arrogance of that
woman, handing out orders

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,625
from her fragile
throne in Kyoto,

193
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,416
insisting that we deal with
a few insignificant humans.

194
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,208
I don't like it.

195
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,041
Since when do I
follow her commands?

196
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,833
[ESTHER] We are affiliated with
a different political party.

197
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,583
There's no need for us to act
until we've received orders

198
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,250
straight from the
Progenitor Council.

199
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,041
[LUCAL]
Hm...

200
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,250
[ESTHER]
Although,

201
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,458
rumor has it Queen Krul
is coming to Nagoya

202
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,916
to oversee things herself.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,791
Oh? Is that right.

204
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,166
Yes.

205
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,916
[LUCAL] Hm. Then perhaps it
would be wise to comply.

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,458
Difficult to say. Last I heard,

207
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,916
your actual boss,
Lest Karr, was still engaged

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,791
in a power struggle with Krul.

209
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,500
Meaning I'll be punished
if I help her.

210
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,208
Well. I suppose the
only thing to do--

211
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,125
[ESTHER]
Mm? Lord Lucal--

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,625
Everyone, take your curse
stimulant pills, now!

213
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,083
It's time. Let's
make this quick.

214
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,541
[LUCAL]
How unfortunate.

215
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,000
My sword. Drink of my blood.

216
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,375
[YOICHI, SHINYA gasp]

217
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,458
We missed!

218
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,416
[SHINYA]
Don't fall apart yet.

219
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,041
Take down as many
vampires as you can

220
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,916
before jumping to safety.

221
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,625
Yeah, okay!

222
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,625
Narumi! Let me take
the first strike.

223
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,208
I'll gauge the enemy's
strength. Just cover me!

224
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,250
You've got my permission.

225
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,583
Make it count!

226
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,875
[gasps]

227
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,833
Nice shootin', Yoichi!

228
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,416
The livestock are
attacking. How pathetic.

229
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,041
[YUICHIRO]
Call us whatever you want.

230
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,500
I'll show you who's
really pathetic.

231
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,000
I have to admit, I can't
wait to take your head.

232
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:19,708
Die!

233
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,000
[yells]

234
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,625
[YUICHIRO grunts]

235
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,458
[KIMIZUKI grunts]

236
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,500
You're finished!

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,541
Don't fool yourself, human.

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,541
[NARUMI]
This is checkmate.

239
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,500
[yelps]

240
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,791
Outta the way!

241
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,000
No!

242
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,958
[LUCAL] Such a weakling.
You were my target

243
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,958
from the beginning.

244
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:55,958
Crap!

245
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,000
[MITSUBA]
Tenjiryu! Protect them!

246
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,416
Fool.

247
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,708
[gasps]

248
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,875
[KIMIZUKI]
That's it. Die, Bloodsucker!

249
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,666
[KIMIZUKI grunts]

250
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,958
I don't think so, human.

251
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,541
[grunts]

252
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,916
Now, Shusaku!

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,708
Hurry up and do it!

254
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,208
Akahebi. Apprehend
this vampire scum.

255
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,333
[grunting]

256
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,291
Nice. Good work, team.

257
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,750
This is it!

258
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,250
[NARUMI, YUICHIRO grunt]

259
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,625
Overestimating
yourselves as usual.

260
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,583
Cover his escape!

261
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,875
We can't let him join up
with the other nobles.

262
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,833
Everyone, maintain
the formation.

263
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,500
Stick to our strategy and
we'll take him as a unit.

264
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,750
[LUCAL]
Interesting.

265
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,916
You lot must be the
humans that Krul Tepes

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,083
is so annoyed by lately.

267
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,416
You don't seem so tough.

268
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,875
We attack together.

269
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,375
[KIMIZUKI]
Hold up.

270
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,000
We can't keep this formation
and stop him from escaping.

271
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,625
We need to lure him in
close enough to surround him.

272
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,000
[NARUMI] That sounds a lot
easier than it actually is.

273
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,041
Unless you've got a plan.

274
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,541
[NARUMI]
What the hell are you doing?

275
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:41,333
Please, you can trust
them to handle this.

276
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,041
Tch.

277
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,916
[KIMIZUKI]
Hey, ugly bloodsucker.

278
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,916
You bastards can
reattach your arms,

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,791
but can you grow
a brand new one?

280
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,333
Why don't we find out?

281
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,916
You're making a mistake.

282
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,666
Human. You don't want
to make me angry.

283
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,875
It's your dominant arm, right?

284
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,541
Well, if you want it,
you better start begging.

285
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,791
I'll kill you.

286
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,041
Huh? What'd you just say?

287
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,458
That a fancy vampire noble
can't beat a couple of humans?

288
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:16,208
[LUCAL] Insufferable, livestock.
I'll kill every one of you.

289
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,458
Look sharp. This is it!

290
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,750
[yells]

291
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,291
Die!

292
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,208
[YUICHIRO] The only one
dying today... is you!

293
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,750
[yells]

294
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,083
[SHINOA]
Are you okay?

295
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,166
[YUICHIRO laughs]
Don't worry, I'm fine.

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,083
Damn... measly...
pathetic humans.

297
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,833
Yayoi! Finish him!

298
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:11,375
Right!

299
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,625
[yells]

300
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,958
I refuse to be
killed by livestock.

301
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,166
Yayoi!

302
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,250
You did it, Yu. Nice job!

303
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,708
Hey, don't forget
I provoked him.

304
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah, you're really
good at annoying people.

305
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,416
[YOICHI]
Yu!

306
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,458
[YUICHIRO] Hey, Yoichi!
Thanks for the backup.

307
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,375
We couldn't have
done it without you.

308
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,625
[laughs] Shinya taught me how
to be a much better sniper.

309
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,875
This proves it.

310
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,583
Working together, we really
can destroy the nobles.

311
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,791
[gasps] I wonder if the
other squads are doing okay.

312
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,833
[YUICHIRO]
Yeah.

313
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,625
[clanging]

314
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,541
[yells]

315
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,250
[MEL groans]

316
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:53,458
Don't think this means
you've beaten us.

317
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,166
We will destroy you!

318
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,541
Shut up. Die.

319
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,875
[pants]

320
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,458
Damn. That was too close.

321
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,125
[SAYURI]
Lieutenant Colonel!

322
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,291
Everything's fine.
This went just as planned.

323
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,250
Really? Because we almost
just got our butts handed to us.

324
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,791
Even though we're
the strongest team,

325
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,291
you should've given
us some backup.

326
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,041
Think about it, if we
struggled this much,

327
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,083
then it was definitely
the right move to increase

328
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,166
the manpower for
all the other teams.

329
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,583
Yeah, but none of
that really matters

330
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,541
if our commander gets killed.

331
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,208
And That's why I left
Shinya above ground.

332
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,833
If I die in battle, then
he'll step forward to lead.

333
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,500
[KUSUNOKI]
Lieu-Lieutenant Colonel Guren.

334
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,500
[KUSUNOKI grunts]

335
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,333
Kusunoki! What happened to you?

336
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,458
[grunts]

337
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:02,458
[panting]

338
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,333
[GUREN] Kusunoki, I'm afraid
you're not going to make it.

339
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,666
Please, report for your
comrades while you can.

340
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,583
What happened?

341
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:20,250
Sir. I'm sorry, but we
failed to kill our target.

342
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,708
Our 45-member squad...

343
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,083
They've been wiped out.

344
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,291
The vampires want you
to go to city hall.

345
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:33,000
They asked for you
specifically. You have to--

346
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,625
Why should I obey them?

347
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,166
They killed 19 of our men.

348
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,541
But the rest are
being held hostage.

349
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,750
[GUREN gasps]

350
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,541
They're all still alive.
Please forgive us--

351
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,875
It's all right,
it wasn't your fault.

352
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,250
This was my mission,
so the blame's on me.

353
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,541
You can relax now. Goshi.

354
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,125
[NORITO]
I'm already on it.

355
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,041
He'll sleep now.

356
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,625
Lieutenant Colonel, sir.

357
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,875
It's been such an honor
to fight for you.

358
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,958
To serve. Thank you.

359
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,375
[GUREN]
Rest.

360
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,791
You can watch us
defeat these bastards

361
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,833
from heaven, you poor idiot.

362
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,958
Let me be the first to say it.

363
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,458
This is clearly
some kind of trap.

364
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,166
We'd be fools to go.

365
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,291
That said. We're still
going, aren't we?

366
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,541
[GUREN] We'll join with
Narumi and Hiragi's squad.

367
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,458
Our target is the
Thirteenth Progenitor.

368
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,458
His name is Crowley Eusford.

369
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,416
[CROWLEY humming]

370
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,833
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

371
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,583
"Sword of Justice."
