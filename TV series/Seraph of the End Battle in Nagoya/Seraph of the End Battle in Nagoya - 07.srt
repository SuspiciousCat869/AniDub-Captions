1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,208
This human may have been
scared for her life,

2
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,833
but we can't take
her word alone.

3
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,458
Let me borrow five soldiers and
I'll go see what's happening

4
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,291
at city hall, just in case.

5
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,083
That's not a bad idea.

6
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,166
We'll regroup when you're done.

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,625
[MIKAELA]
That story protected Yu.

8
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,250
Maybe you were his comrade.

9
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,625
No.

10
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,666
You probably just used him,
like all the others do.

11
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,500
[MIKAELA]
Okay, follow me.

12
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,041
Let's see what's
going on at city hall.

13
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:31,916
I'm coming, old friend.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,916
[gasps]

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,416
Is there something wrong?

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,291
[YUICHIRO]
Uh-- No.

17
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,416
It's just getting
really cloudy.

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,791
It's the perfect weather
to launch an attack.

19
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,958
Yeah. Let's get on with it.

20
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,041
[GUREN]
Hm...

21
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,791
[GUREN] Well, the
vampires are definitely

22
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,083
planning to ambush us.

23
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,208
I'll have to reconsider
what we should do next.

24
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,875
[YUICHIRO]
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,041
I mean,

26
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,000
we're gonna go and
rescue them, aren't we?

27
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,583
So you're suggesting
we walk head-on

28
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,000
into something we
know is a trap?

29
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah! If we have to.

30
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,583
[GUREN]
Everyone shut up.

31
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,375
[GUREN] Okay. We'll snipe
and see how they react.

32
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,375
Just to test the waters.

33
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,833
There are three targets
inside, powerful nobles

34
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:19,708
named Crowley Eusford,
Chess Belle, and Horn Skuld.

35
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,500
If it looks like our
enemies are too strong

36
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,791
for us to defeat,
we'll leave the hostages.

37
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,791
What? Give up?

38
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,041
There's no way I'm leaving
them hanging there like that.

39
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,416
Hey. You've gotta calm down.

40
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,583
Lieutenant Colonel.

41
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,000
What do you believe
is our top priority

42
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,541
at this point in the mission?

43
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,166
We can't afford to
lose any more troops,

44
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,000
especially elites like you.

45
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,333
That makes freeing the
hostages a secondary concern.

46
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,916
Moving forward, I'm
gonna need all of you.

47
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,125
What you're saying is...
this isn't over.

48
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,000
We have to survive because
there's another mission

49
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,291
waiting after this one, right?

50
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, that's one
way to look at it.

51
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,541
We need to keep the
vampires in Nagoya.

52
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:01,208
Doing so let's our main unit
in Shibuya move undetected.

53
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,458
That's one of the primary
reasons we're here.

54
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,083
Wait, so the Shibuya team
is on the move right now?

55
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,958
Yeah. If things are
going as planned,

56
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,208
they should be on
their way to Shinjuku.

57
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,250
So basically, what
he's saying is that

58
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,083
this whole attack on Nagoya
was nothing but a decoy.

59
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,500
Not exactly, the
extermination of the nobles

60
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,791
will have a huge
impact on the war.

61
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,083
But from now on, our mission
is to keep the enemy

62
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,708
distracted as long as we
possibly can. Which is why...

63
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,000
...we're gonna see
how they react

64
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,875
to a little expert sniping.

65
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,250
If they attack
in force, we'll run.

66
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,708
But if we see an opening,

67
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,833
we'll try to save
all of the hostages.

68
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,958
Best-case scenario,
we'll kill the nobles, too.

69
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,291
Now you're dreaming.

70
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,291
Things never go that well.

71
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,125
Why are you always
such a pessimist?

72
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,708
C'mon, Guren, I'm just
telling it like it is.

73
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,375
Don't worry, I'm still
gonna kill these guys.

74
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,458
Pick a sniping perch, Yoichi.

75
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's show everyone
what you've learned.

76
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,333
Right!

77
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,666
Look alive and
get into position.

78
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,625
Be ready for a
swift counterattack.

79
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,375
[KAGIYAMA]
Roger that!

80
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,000
We're prepared. Right?

81
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,208
Yeah!

82
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,958
Okay. I've got the fourth floor.

83
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,583
Focus your attention on the
windows in the next level up.

84
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,833
Got it!

85
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,166
[gasps] Hey. I've got
a visual on a vampire.

86
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,291
It's a noble! His back's to me.

87
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,916
I don't think he's
noticed us, yet.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,375
Then take the damn shot! Now!

89
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,583
Fly true for me, Gekkouin!

90
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,083
[CROWLEY]
Hm?

91
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,875
What is this thing? How strange.

92
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,125
Sir. I failed to hit my target.

93
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,958
Ordinarily, even a
noble wouldn't have

94
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,000
been able to dodge a shot
like that. Which means...

95
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,291
...that this guy must be an
extremely powerful vampire.

96
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,291
It's no wonder nine
of our strongest teams

97
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,625
couldn't handle him.
We don't stand a chance.

98
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,916
He's right.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,375
I recognize this guy,
we've faced him before.

100
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,916
[YUICHIRO]
Huh?

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,125
He's the vampire we fought when
we were headed to Shinjuku.

102
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,875
And his comrades are with him.

103
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,291
[gasps]

104
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,875
Hey. Gimme that!

105
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,500
Are you okay, Lord Crowley?

106
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,875
What was that weird thing?
Some kind of exploding bird?

107
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,916
It would appear that
we have some visitors.

108
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,291
[gasps] Yoichi's right!
That guy is big trouble!

109
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,041
He's, like, insanely strong.

110
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,416
I see.

111
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,791
Then I highly doubt we could
beat him by force alone.

112
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,791
So then... what?

113
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,708
[SHINYA]
We've got two choices.

114
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,291
We can shoot our comrades now,

115
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,583
before they're tortured and then
get the hell out of this town.

116
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,541
[YUICHIRO gasps]
You can't be serious.

117
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,041
[SHINOA]
Hey, don't freak out yet.

118
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,541
That's one way, but
what's the other option?

119
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,916
We somehow manage to
split up the nobles,

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,625
then save the
hostages, and retreat.

121
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,166
Naturally, that plan's
more dangerous.

122
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,375
I doubt we'd all survive.

123
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,750
We're not leaving our
comrades behind, right?

124
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,000
Guren?

125
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,458
I think...

126
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,333
...the smartest move
is to kill the hostages

127
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,708
and run.

128
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,250
They didn't attack us after
Yoichi's failed shot,

129
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,791
so we're not important to them.

130
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,250
We should retreat while
we're still able to.

131
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,458
You bastard! Don't be stupid!

132
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,083
You're the one
who's acting stupid.

133
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,416
[gasps]

134
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,541
I've got close friends
in that group of hostages.

135
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,416
It's killing me to even think
of leaving them behind.

136
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,750
But you don't see me making
a scene like a spoiled brat.

137
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,041
[SHINOA]
But, Lieutenant Colonel.

138
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,708
This is still a decoy
mission, isn't it?

139
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,958
If we leave the nobles alone,

140
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,250
aren't we putting the
Shibuya unit at risk?

141
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,125
[GUREN]
Yes.

142
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,250
Well, in that case--

143
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,625
Yeah, I know.

144
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,458
There's no way around it,
we have to attack.

145
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,041
We'll put on a big
show so they think

146
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,375
we're the main unit.

147
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,750
I'm not against killing
the bloodsuckers.

148
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,250
But I don't see how we stand a
chance with them waiting around

149
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,500
for us like this.

150
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,791
If they start to overwhelm
us, we'll retreat.

151
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,541
Come on. We should
move locations.

152
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,375
[HORN]
How odd. There's no second wave.

153
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,125
We could have some fun and
go hunt them down ourselves.

154
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,375
I would bet that's exactly
what our enemies are hoping for.

155
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,791
We'll be patient and
let them come to us.

156
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,291
They must've realized
that they didn't

157
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,125
stand a chance against us after
their first attack failed.

158
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,541
Maybe they just got
scared and ran away.

159
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,625
Humans have a bad habit
of making stupid decisions.

160
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,416
Especially when the smart choice
is against their orders.

161
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,416
Huh? Wait, what do
you mean, Lord Crowley?

162
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,125
They've been commanded
to destroy us,

163
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,916
so there's little chance
they're going to back out now.

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,416
They're loyal, even in
the face of certain death.

165
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,083
[CROWLEY]
Or there's something else.

166
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,083
It's possible they
have a hidden agenda.

167
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,875
Ferid's going to want
to know everything

168
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,208
about this attack.

169
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,875
We should gather as
much intel as possible.

170
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,166
I don't like Lord Ferid--

171
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,375
he's always trying to
seem so mysterious.

172
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,083
It's annoying.

173
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,083
You know, Chess, for once,
I actually agree with you.

174
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,416
He can be a little much.

175
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,125
But you have to admit,
when he's around,

176
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,083
there's never a dull moment.

177
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,916
All right, ladies, here's
our new plan of attack.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,375
We capture the commander,

179
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,458
since he's the one who'll
have the most info. Got it?

180
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,416
--[CHESS] Okay!
--[HORN] Yes.

181
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,375
[GUREN] Pay attention.
Here's the new plan.

182
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,291
Shinya and the rest
of my team will attack

183
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,583
Crowley Eusford
and his comrades.

184
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,000
Shinoa and Narumi's teams
will attempt to rescue

185
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,958
the hostages while
we're fighting.

186
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,500
Do you think you'll be
all right with just you guys?

187
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,500
Our basic strategy will
be to strike and run away.

188
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,750
We should be able to
hold them off for a bit.

189
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,541
That's only gonna
give you five minutes

190
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,541
to rescue all the
hostages you can.

191
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,041
After that, we have to retreat
and join the other teams

192
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,000
at the Nagoya Airport at once.

193
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,375
Where are we going after
we get to the airport?

194
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,291
There should be a
transport helicopter

195
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,208
waiting for us there,
along with new directives.

196
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,250
We'll follow those orders.

197
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,750
We attack in seven minutes.
Everyone, take your positions.

198
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,208
[SQUAD MEMBERS]
Yes, sir!

199
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,750
[GUREN]
How does it look, Shinya?

200
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,958
Our enemies aren't
making any moves.

201
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,000
But then, they're most
likely waiting on us.

202
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,416
Who knows, what's
inside, though?

203
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,750
We're walking into
this partially blind.

204
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,541
Lieutenant Colonel, are we
really attacking them first?

205
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,583
Yeah. With Goshi's
Illusionary spell,

206
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,291
he can make it look like 200 men
are fighting alongside of us.

207
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,916
Isn't that right?

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,416
Sure, but there's one
big problem with your plan.

209
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,291
I'd have to get dangerously
close to our enemies.

210
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,916
Then why are you
still standing here?

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,250
Wha--?

212
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,166
[laughs] Sounds like Goshi's
our first casualty.

213
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,958
[NORITO] Geez, thanks for
the vote of confidence.

214
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,833
Should we do this together?

215
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,166
No.

216
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,583
If we're going to free
as many of them as we can

217
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,958
in five minutes...

218
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,125
[NARUMI]
...then we should go separately.

219
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,208
Okay. Good luck to you.

220
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,916
[SHINOA]
Thanks.

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,208
Oh, yeah. And one
more thing, newbs.

222
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,458
Ah.

223
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,458
Don't you dare die.

224
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,083
Same goes for you guys.

225
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,875
Oh, I'm not concerned
about my squad

226
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,291
surviving this.

227
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,416
Not when they've got an
incredible team leader like me.

228
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,791
[NARUMI]
That all. Let's move.

229
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,375
We've got comrades to save.

230
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,833
[KAGIYAMA, RIKA, IWASAKI, YAYOI]
Roger that!

231
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,833
We should move to
our positions, too.

232
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,166
Yeah.

233
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,791
All right. There's no
use putting this off.

234
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,541
If you have any last words,
now's your chance.

235
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,541
We're ready.

236
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,333
You can count on us.

237
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,166
[SHINOA] Okay, everyone,
let's synchronize our clocks.

238
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,625
Please set an alarm
for exactly five minutes.

239
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,333
When it goes off,
we have to retreat,

240
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,291
no matter what's
happening at the time.

241
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,666
Do you understand?

242
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,166
This is an order.

243
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,333
When our time is up,
we leave the battlefield,

244
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,416
no matter how many
people we've saved.

245
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,958
That's the only rule
for this mission.

246
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,541
It can't be broken.

247
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,750
That means, even if we have
to leave someone behind,

248
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:07,958
we retreat.

249
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:08,791
But--

250
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,208
No buts, Yu.

251
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,041
I'm the team leader here.

252
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,708
We can all make it out of this.

253
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,041
But disobeying puts
us all at risk.

254
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:20,000
So please. Please
follow my orders.

255
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,375
Be a good soldier.

256
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,750
[YUICHIRO]
I will.

257
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,666
It's a simple job.

258
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,708
All we have to do
is save everyone.

259
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,458
I don't think you get how
hard this is going to be.

260
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,333
No.

261
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,708
I think this is gonna work out.

262
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,333
Our teamwork has gotten
a lot better, too.

263
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,208
And, on top of that,
we've all become

264
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,708
really good friends.

265
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,000
That might be an exaggeration.

Hey. Why are you so mean?

00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,250
Are we just gonna let Guren die?

318
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,500
Let's get up there and
take out some nobles!

319
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,958
Not a bad idea.

320
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,250
We might be able to launch
some kind of pincer attack.

321
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,541
Yeah, Shinoa. Let's do it!

322
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay. We've got three minutes.

323
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:16,125
Plenty of time to save
the day. Let's go!

324
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,625
I'll come up with
a plan on the way.

325
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,916
Please promise that
you'll do as I say.

326
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,375
[SHINYA, GUREN panting]

327
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,083
Ugh. That guy's
gonna be a problem.

328
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,375
He's on a totally different
level than the other nobles.

329
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,458
I'm afraid this
might be it for us.

330
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,833
No way. Things are
all going as I planned.

331
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,791
Who are you trying
to kid, Guren?

332
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,791
At least we did a solid job
of getting their attention.

333
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,875
You and I make pretty
good bait. You done resting?

334
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,291
'Cause I'd kinda
like to escape, now.

335
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,250
[CROWLEY] You can't leave,
the fun's just getting started.

336
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,333
It'd be a shame for you two
to miss the main event.

337
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,000
I insist you stay,
I can't allow you

338
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,083
to disappoint Lord Crowley.

339
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,916
Why can't we just
start the show already?

340
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,458
I'm feeling thirsty.

341
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,833
I don't wanna be rude.

342
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,250
Then I guess we
have to stay here

343
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,833
and keep the three
of them entertained.

344
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,000
[YUICHIRO]
Why are you going that way?

345
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,083
Guren and Shinya are
on the fourth floor!

346
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,916
Just stay quiet
and follow my lead!

347
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,000
You heard her.

348
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,708
[GUREN yells]

349
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:53,500
[GUREN grunting]

350
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,500
[SHINYA]
Stop moving so much!

351
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,541
[yelps]

352
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,083
Lord Crowley. Shall we
join this dance?

353
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,083
Don't worry.

354
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,958
I can handle these
two on my own.

355
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,291
You shouldn't take
your eyes off of me!

356
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:15,833
[CROWLEY] Mm. You're finally
starting to put up a real fight.

357
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,333
[GUREN grunting]

358
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,208
Mahiru-no-yo!

359
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,250
Now!

360
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,625
[gasps, groans]

361
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,083
This is going to get boring

362
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,583
if you keep repeating
that same move.

363
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:44,083
[CROWLEY] Oh. It appears
that they've escaped.

364
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,916
So how badly are
you wounded, Shinya?

365
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,791
Could be worse.

366
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,625
I could've broken all my bones.

367
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,750
If you're strong enough to joke,

368
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,000
then walk on your own.

369
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,250
You're not getting
rid of me that easily.

370
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,750
This way, I can hold
them off behind us.

371
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,000
Hey. Why are you running away?

372
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,541
To be honest, I've never
really liked running.

373
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,875
[SHINYA] You could
always stop chasing us!

374
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,958
You guys attacked us first,

375
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,208
and now you don't want
us coming after you?

376
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,375
I'm always amazed at how
selfish humans can be.

377
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,000
[GUREN]
Are they coming?

378
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,625
No.

379
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,583
Maybe I managed to
scare the bastards off

380
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,083
with that last shot.

381
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,541
Shinya!

382
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,875
[yells]

383
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,000
[groans]

384
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,416
Guren!

385
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,291
Oops, I forgot I'm not
supposed to kill you.

386
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,791
At least, not until after you've
answered all of my questions.

387
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,041
Dammit!

388
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,791
I'm already dead, Shinya!

389
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,541
You need to take command and
finish the mission without me!

390
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,833
[gasps]

391
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,416
Go!

392
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,500
That's an order, Shinya.

393
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,500
You should listen
to your commander,

394
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,458
before I decide I need
two subjects for intel.

395
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,166
[yells]

396
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,625
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

397
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,291
"Demon's Lullaby."
