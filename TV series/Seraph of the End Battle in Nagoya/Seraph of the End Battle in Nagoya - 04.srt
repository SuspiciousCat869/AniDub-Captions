1
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,500
It's starting to get colder.

2
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,625
I like it better than the heat.
It feels so crisp outside.

3
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,375
Yeah, yeah, that's great,
now could you tell me

4
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,041
where we're going, Shinoa?

5
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,375
Relying on you to navigate for
us is getting kind of annoying.

6
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,500
Well, If we stay on this road,

7
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,500
we'll eventually
end up in Hakone.

8
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,750
There we could soak in the
hot spring, eat a feast,

9
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,458
and then wake up
relaxed and refreshed.

10
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,000
Doesn't that sound
like paradise, you guys?

11
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,500
Sure.

12
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,750
We're really headed to Ebina.

13
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,625
Ebina, huh?

14
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,125
I don't think I've heard of it.

15
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,750
Honestly, I'd rather
go to Hakone.

16
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,416
Oh, definitely.

17
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,250
But I'm afraid a vacation
just isn't in the cards.

18
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,416
Nagoya is our final destination.

Bye, bye, we'll
see you in Ebina!

Seriously?

creeping around, Goshi?

[NORITO]
A little light reading.

37
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,958
It's been a long time
since we've seen girls

lounging around
in fancy underwear.

00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:38,375
I can't even get Shigure or
Sayuri to wear bathing suits.

Ask me to again, and I'll
gouge your eyes out.

I guess I'd have to wear one...

42
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,625
If the Lieutenant Colonel
ordered me to, that is.

[NORITO]
Did ya hear that? Guren!

44
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,875
For the sake of morale, tell her
to fight in a bathing suit.

45
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,458
Will you shut up?

46
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,541
You're supposed to be
checking for vampires.

[NORITO] Oh, yeah, uh.
Mito's keeping an eye out.

Guren.

I've finished scoping
out the interior.

There are no signs that
vampires have been here.

Hey, Mito, question.

53

Would you wear a swimsuit?

Why are you asking me that?

55

Well, Pervert Guren
over here wants to know

what your body looks like
under that uniform.

Good morning!

Whoa, Shinya, where'd
you get a car like this?

65
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,625
[SHINYA] It was abandoned
on the side of the road

66
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,708
so I hotwired it. Awesome, huh?

67
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,250
It's perfect for an impractical

68

Major General like you.
What are you doing here?

69
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,458
Brother Kureto told me
about your mission.

70
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,916
Sounds like you guys
are sacrificial pawns.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,583
A hundred troops don't
stand much of a chance

72
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,250
against the vampire nobles.

73
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,333
Those bloodsuckers
are too powerful.

74
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,000
So I figured, why not bring

gonna be late.

we'll get in trouble?

I'll just tell him

will arrive in Nagoya.

00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,000
Shigure. Rearrange
the team rosters.

320
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,750
I want Shinoa's Squad
joined up with Narumi's.

321
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,250
Yes, sir.

322
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,750
[NARUMI] Wait, please rethink
this, Lieutenant Colonel!

323
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,125
This is Sergeant Makoto Narumi.

324
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,333
And that's Rika Inoue,
Taro Kagiyama, Yayoi Endo,

325
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,250
and Shusaku Iwasaki.

326
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,833
They're an excellent squad.

327
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,375
They'll train you well.

328
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,250
They don't seem too
thrilled to have us.

329
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,500
Please, sir.

330
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,041
Listen up! Playtimes'
over, so let's focus.

331
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,166
We've got a mission.

332
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,416
[TROOPERS]
Sir!

333
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,791
[YUICHIRO] I'm looking forward
to serving with you.

334
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,250
[grunts]

335
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,916
Thanks.

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,541
You had to go and open your
big mouth, didn't you?

337
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,541
Do you realize how
much work this is?

338
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,750
Well, They do seem to
have a lot of raw power.

339
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,833
With a little training, maybe
they'll turn out to be useful.

340
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,166
What's with
that Sergeant?

341
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,791
Can't really blame him.

342
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,541
He may be a complete jerkwad,
but he's dead right about us.

343
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,916
Hey. Everyone.

344
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,291
I'm sorry about how
things turned out.

345
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,791
All of this stuff is my fault.

346
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,375
Not just being late.

347
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,333
We lost because I'm incompetent.

348
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,291
I don't think I'm fit to
be called the commander.

349
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,500
Don't say that.

350
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,291
Did you not hear
what Guren said?

351
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,708
All we need to do is
learn to work as a team.

352
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,916
And the first step is
supporting each other.

353
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,291
We're a family.

354
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,708
The more we work together,
the stronger we'll be.

355
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,875
Yeah.

356
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,333
And that means we still
need a commander.

357
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,000
So, whaddya think, Shinoa?

358
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,458
Okay!

If you want to take a little
sip, now's the time, Mika.

370
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,166
I'm not interested in
drinking human blood.

371
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,416
Wait, is that some kind of joke?

372
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,708
If you're afraid of getting
caught, don't worry.

373
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,458
You can trust me.
I won't tell a soul.

374
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,333

00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,791
drink from a human.
