Everyone, get to the airport.

The escape helicopters

All right then, let's fall back!

We're not safe out

and I can't keep carrying you.

[ASURAMARU] Your devotion
to those you care about

40
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,833
is overwhelming. When your

of being harmed, you lose
all sense of right and wrong.

I'm dead again.

Not this time.

You've been knocked unconscious.

Wait, Guren. What
happened back there?

[ASURAMARU] See, this is
what I was talking about.

You're always obsessing
over someone.

Yeah, Whatever!

52
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,666
Just tell me Guren, Shinoa,
and the others are fine.

and your eyes have been
closed for a while now.

Then they might
still have Guren.

Guren? Yeah, sure. But...

...it's different member
of your family

59
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,166

Can't fight it. I need blood!

painful! I can't take it!

down my thirst.

And now... You're telling me--

00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,750
Of course it's not easy, dummy!

wanna watch my best friend

turn into a vampire?

But tell me, Mika, what
other choice do I have?

140

If you die here, then I'll--

I'll--

I'll have to start crying!

[YUICHIRO] I don't care
if you become a monster.

You'll survive! So just
suck it up and do it for me!

[MIKAELA]
You can't be serious!

147
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,916
You want me to become a vampire

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,250
so you don't have to cry?

149
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,708
Yeah I do. You got
a problem with that?

150
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,916
[sighs] Yeah.

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,333
Jeez, you haven't changed
a bit since we were kids.

[YUICHIRO]
Hmph. I'm offering.

you're attacking me.

Besides, I dunno if
I believe you really

156

fought it all that hard
if you're willing to die

157
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,041
even though survival
is right in front of you.

158
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,791
If you wanted to die,
then you should've done it

159
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,125
in secret somewhere.

160
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,041
[MIKAELA]
Listen, Yu.

161
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm here because
you need to know

00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,625
Oh, come on. Please listen.

165
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,625
Okay, but only if you'll
agree to drink my blood.

166
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,333
Stay alive. For me.

I refuse to let you die.

Just go ahead and
give in to your thirst.

You know, you're
an awful person.

174
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,375
[YUICHIRO]
Maybe.

175
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,875
But you've only got
yourself to blame

176
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,250
for making me your family.

177
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,250
[MIKAELA]
Biggest mistake of my life.

178
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,875
I'm gonna become a
monster because of you.

179
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,541
I'm gonna keep living.

180
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,208
We'll still be family,

00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,083
no matter what you become.

It's so hard to resist.

186
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,458
I want to drink blood so badly.

Welcome back, Mika.

[MIKAELA whimpers]

192
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,708
[gasps] Mika.

193
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:17,833
[MIKAELA sniffles] It's weird,
right? All of this. Everything.

194
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,458
Drinking your family's
blood just to stay alive.

195
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,083
It's not normal.

196
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,375
[YUICHIRO]
Eh, so what?

197
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,625
Like we care about being normal.

198
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:30,208
That's true.
Still, it's strange.

199
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,000
Never thought I'd
become a real vampire.

200
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,250
Ya know,

201
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,041
reminds me of
something Guren said.

202
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:38,958
[MIKAELA]
Guren?

203
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:39,958
Oh, yeah.

204
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,583
I forgot you
don't know everyone.

205
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,875
He's the army guy who
found me after I escaped

206
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,500
from the vampires. He took
me in and cared for me.

207
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,666
He likes to talk and
he gives good advice.

208
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,583
[YUICHIRO]
He told me to keep on living,

209
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,625
even if it was just for revenge.

210
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,791
That, one day, someone
who needed my help

211
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,250
would show up and give me
a new reason to exist.

212
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,666
That's why I'm still alive.

213
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,000
Even when life felt pointless,

214
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,375
even when I thought
no one needed me,

215
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,000
I forced myself to
get through each day.

216
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,958
And I'm glad.

217
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,875
Because I finally got
to see you again.

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,583
[YUICHIRO]
Hey, let's make a promise.

219
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,166
We'll survive together,
even if it's painful sometimes.

220
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,250
Who cares if you're a vampire?

221
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,625
If it's too difficult for you,

222
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,333
then I'll just have to
turn you back into a human.

223
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,041
[YUICHIRO] So please,
promise me you won't give up

224
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,750
and try to die ever again.

225
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,333
[laughs] Oh, the irony.

226
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:43,625
I fought all this time because
I thought you needed saving.

227
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,416
But you're the strong one.

228
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,166
Guess you have
changed in some ways.

229
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,291
What?

230
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,125
C'mon, I've always
been the strong one!

231
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,500
No, you used to be
a real big crybaby.

232
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,625
Huh?!

233
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,541
You're the one who's
bawling right now.

234
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,541
Ah--

235
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,625
[BOTH laugh]

236
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,166
Okay, you got me there.

237
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,125
Well, if you really
think I'm stronger

238
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,375
than before, then it's
probably all because

239
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,791
of Guren's training.

240
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,583
You may think that,
but this "Guren" guy

241
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,166
you keep talking about
is just using you to--

242
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,708
I know he's got his own plans,

243
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,583
but he's part of my family, too.

244
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,333
I was as good as dead when
my parents abandoned me.

245
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,916
I thought life was over. But...

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,083
You and Guren both made
me wanna keep living.

247
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,333
You guys're the only
reason I'm here today.

248
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,500
So, you see?

249
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,083
I could never pay
either of you back

250
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,291
for all that you've done.

251
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,000
So I don't mind if you use me.

252
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,500
I'm nothing like those
human bastards, Yu.

253
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,583
I'd never manipulate you
the way that they are.

254
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,000
You say that, but you
did drink my blood.

255
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,208
Well, yeah.

256
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,000
[YUICHIRO]
I'm just messing with you.

257
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,625
I don't care about the blood.

258
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,375
But I do have a
small favor to ask.

259
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,458
[MIKAELA]
What is it?

260
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,958
[YUICHIRO]
My teammates.

261
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,833
My family is in trouble.
Please come with me.

262
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,833
Okay?

263
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,291
No wait, hold on!

264
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,583
What are you doing?
Think about this.

265
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,083
You can't go back
to those humans!

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,250
[MIKAELA] Just hear me out
first. I'm begging you.

267
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,000
This isn't good.

268
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,958
How long have I been out for?

269
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,500
Please, Yu.

270
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,125
Mika.

271
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,416
You're the one who
carried me out here.

272
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,375
That means... you must
have some idea

273
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,208
of what happened
to my teammates.

274
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,458
Would you stop worrying about

275
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,750
those humans and start
paying attention to me?

276
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,541
I don't know what kind
of awful brainwashing

277
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,625
they've put you through,

278
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,000
but I can't let you
go back to the army.

279
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,166
They're evil.

280
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,708
They've been experimenting
on you and me

281
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,458
since we were just kids.

282
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,625
See ya.

283
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,250
[MIKAELA]
Why won't you listen to me?

284
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,791
[YUICHIRO]
You can't stop me!

285
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,166
Fine.

286
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,375
[YUICHIRO]
What are you doing?

287
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,166
Did you really
pull a sword on me?

288
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,916
[MIKAELA] I'll do whatever
it takes to protect you.

289
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,500
[YUICHIRO] If that's the case,
then you should be helping me.

290
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,875
Helping you?

291
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,250
Kill me if you
don't want me to go.

292
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,916
Because I'd rather die than
fail to protect my family.

293
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
[MIKAELA]
You're such a hypocrite!

294
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,750
You said I had to survive,

295
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,000
even if it meant
becoming a vampire!

296
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,500
Mika!

297
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,041
I won't let you go back to them.

298
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,250
Just hear what I have to say--

299
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,500
Stop!

300
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,250
[YUICHIRO] They're my family,
just like you are.

301
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,958
[MIKAELA] I think I've met the
people you're talking about.

302
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,166
You have?

303
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,166
Tell me everything.
Where did you see them?

304
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,500
Hey. Answer me.

305
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,791
Earlier. There was a girl.

306
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,833
She and her friends
saved my life.

307
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,416
She fought with a scythe.

308
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,750
That's them!

309
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,625
I told you they're
good guys. Right? Right?

310
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,333
That means we should
be helping them out.

311
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,041
Right? Yeah?

312
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,083
Only your friends.

313
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,541
I'll help the four of them.

314
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,666
[YUICHIRO]
That's great!

315
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,166
Hey, what're you
doing? Cut it out!

316
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,708
All right, let's get outta here.

317
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,458
We've got work to do.

318
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,375
Where do you think they are?

319
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,083
[MIKAELA] I don't know for sure,
but I did hear them say

320
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,541
something about
meeting at an airport.

321
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:32,375
[KIMIZUKI panting]
So, what's going on, Shinoa?

322
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,125
[SHINOA] I don't know
anything more than you do.

323
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,583
I thought there were
supposed to be helicopters.

324
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,791
But this place is deserted.

325
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,083
There aren't even
any cars around!

326
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,125
[YUICHIRO]
I could've driven, you know.

327
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,125
I'm good at it.

328
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,083
[MIKAELA laughs]
I thought you said

329
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,708
you wanted us both to survive.

330
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,708
Oh, shut up.

331
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,125
So...

332
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,000
You wanted to talk?

333
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,208
Right.

334
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,458
[MIKAELA] The humans
have ulterior motives.

335
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,458
They're using you as a test
subject for experimentation.

336
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,375
[YUICHIRO] Is that all?
I already knew that.

337
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,583
[MIKAELA]
The experiment will have

338
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,541
far-reaching consequences.

339
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,166
And, as a result,
humans and vampires

340
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,375
across the globe
are targeting you.

341
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,041
Humans and vampires?

342
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,750
Wow, I had no idea
I was so popular.

343
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,125
This is serious.

344
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,000
It's the same experiment
that messed up the world.

345
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,750
The reason all of the
adults died years ago.

346
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,291
It almost made humans extinct.

347
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,833
Hold up a second.

348
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,416
Are you saying it's my fault
the world was almost destroyed?

349
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,166
No, Yu. We didn't
do any of this.

350
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,375
We were innocent kids
who were being used.

351
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,291
Humans are the ones
who caused this.

352
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,125
The Hyakuya Orphanage
where we lived

353
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,083
was nothing but a laboratory.

354
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,916
After it was gone, the
Japanese Imperial Demon Army

355
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,791
took over the experimentation.

356
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,958
[gasps]

357
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,875
The experiment's called
"Seraph of the End."

358
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,166
Humans are ugly creatures.

359
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,500
They're animals, driven
by greed. They only want

360
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,250
to make themselves stronger.

361
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,083
They'll hurt anyone
to get more power.

362
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,833
I can't leave you in the
hands of people like that.

363
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,416
Mika, I'm also a human.

364
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,958
And, if it's at all possible,

365
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,000
I wanna turn you
back into one, too.

366
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,875
So it's not like you can say
all of humanity is bad.

367
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,833
[MIKAELA] If the wrong people
have you under their control

368
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,833
they could use you to end
this world in a heartbeat.

369
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,583
[MIKAELA]
Run away with me instead.

370
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,250
[MIKAELA] We'll make a new
home somewhere secluded,

371
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,500
far away from this war.

372
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,500
[YUICHIRO]
Where no one can find us.

373
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,458
The vampires or the
Moon Demon Company.

374
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,125
That's right.

375
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,208
[YUICHIRO]
This reminds me of another time.

376
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,625
[MIKAELA]
Uh?

377
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,208
[YUICHIRO] Remember how we
ran away from the vampires

378
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,750
because we thought we could
find paradise somewhere else?

379
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,125
[MIKAELA]
Yeah.

380
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,416
[YUICHIRO] But it didn't work.
Everyone got killed,

381
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,750
and we learned that
paradise didn't exist.

382
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,208
Instead, there's only
one thing: this world.

383
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,166
[YUICHIRO] I don't think
there's anywhere else

384
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,625
left for us to go.

385
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,375
[MIKAELA]
Isn't it worth looking, though?

386
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,833
[YUICHIRO] If so, then we can
discuss that with my friends.

387
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,458
They're smart. They can
help us run away,

388
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,875
if that's what you
really want us to do.

389
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,833
And you're certain
we can trust them, Yu?

390
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,541
[YUICHIRO]
Sure, don't worry.

391
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,250
They're the good guys.

392
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,833
Trust them just as much
as you trust me. Okay?

393
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,375
[GIRL panting]

394
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,333
[GIRL panting, whimpering]

395
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,500
[whimpering]

396
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,875
[screaming]

397
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,875
[YUICHIRO] Next time,
on Seraph of the End:

398
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,458
"Arrogant Love."
