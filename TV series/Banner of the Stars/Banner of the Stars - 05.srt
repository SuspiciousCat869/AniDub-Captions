That's great. Thanks, Jinto.

[LAFIEL]
No, it isn't.

[JINTO] I don't want you
to think I'm saying this

28
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,458
just to make you feel
better, because I'm not,

29
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,791
but looking at things...

30
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,125
[LAFIEL] Considering this
was our first campaign,

31
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,458
I don't think we did too badly

32
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,541
to get away with
just one tiny hole.

33
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,666
Don't you think?

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,916
So you do know
about that already.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,333
[LAFIEL]
Of course I do.

36
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,500
I intend to stand by the
<i>Basroil</i> in everything.

37
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,208
Okay, well, in that case...

38
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,791
I guess I'd better go and start
organizing the equipment

39
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,375
we need before the
repairs are finished.

40
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,541
By the way...

41
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,166
Do you wanna take
a little break with me?

42
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,333
Well... I guess so.

43
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,833
[JINTO]
You know,

44
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,500
there was somethin' else
I wanted to say to you

45
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,833
before I head out.

46
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,458
[LAFIEL]
Yes? What's that?

[NARRATOR speaking Baronh]

51
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,125
[DUSANYU] Have there been
any changes in the situation?

52
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,000
No.

53
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,125
There's been no movement since

54
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,125
the enemy's
reconnaissance missions.

55
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,208
However, given the information
they likely obtained,

56
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,791
it's a safe bet
they'll be proceeding

57
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,750
with preparations
for a counterattack.

58
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,791
Perhaps we've
underestimated them.

59
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,000
This couldn't have come
at a worse time for us.

60
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,500
[KENESH]
I know...

61
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,083
If the enemy had
made the decision

62
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,875
to launch their counterattack
a little bit sooner than this...

63
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,041
our course of action
would have been obvious.

64
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,625
To eliminate the enemy fleet.

65
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,875
[DUSANYU]
Of course.

66
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,583
Otherwise, they would
have had the opportunity

67
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,375
to cut us off from
the Aptic area,

68
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,333
and we would surely
have faced defeat.

69
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,041
Yes, although...

70
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,416
If they had decided
to counterattack later,

71
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,291
then our plan would have
been to make a quick advance

72
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,541
from the front line.

73
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,833
In that case, even if
they managed to cut off

74
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,500
our supply route
between the Kingdoms

75
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,416
of Suruguzede and Laseesu,

76
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,208
we wouldn't be
completely stranded.

77
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,583
[DUSANYU]
If that were to have happened,

78
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,541
my intention was to
attack the enemy fleet

79
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,250
from both directions.

80
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,000
However, it looks
as though the enemy

81
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,250
is more clever than that.

82
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,083
[KENESH]
So what do we do?

83
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,041
Do we annihilate
the enemy fleet?

84
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,583
Or do we aim to
reach the other side?

85
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,041
It's a difficult
decision. However...

86
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,333
I think you've already
made up your mind!

87
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,208
The first option:
annihilate the enemy fleet!

88
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,083
After all, that's what
we came here for.

89
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,083
[KENESH] Then my suggestion
is that we switch

90
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,791
from Plan number One of
Operation Phantom Flame

91
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,791
to Plan number Eighteen.
Do you approve?

92
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,375
If I remember correctly,

93
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,333
the Eighteenth plan was
to allocate the area

94
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,208
around the Aptic Gate
as the main battlefield.

95
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,500
Yes, that is correct.

96
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,708
The main forces of
Operation Phantom Flame

97
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,208
will be concentrated
in the Dalmav System.

98
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
We believe that
the United Mankind

99
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,291
then has two potential
routes for its fleet

100
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,166
to make any advance.

101
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,750
Firstly, from the Miofrantia
Gate to the Mystel Gate.

102
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,833
Secondly from the Wimpel Gate
to the Aptic Gate.

103
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,333
We'll station some forces
to guard the Miofrantia

104
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,750
and Wimpel Gates and also
establish defense fortifications

105
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,458
in the Mystel and Aptic Systems.

106
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,333
[DUSANYU] Whichever of those
two routes the enemy

107
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,750
chooses to take, we should
launch an attack on them

108
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,875
using a pincer formation,
with the main forces

109
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,416
coming from Dalmav.

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,375
[KENESH] Provided our
defense forces hold out

111
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,541
long enough for us to get there.

112
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,041
I've made my decision.

113
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,041
There is nothing more
to say--the time has come.

114
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,541
I want you to issue
orders to embark

115
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,166
on Plan number
Eighteen immediately.

116
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,333
There's one final thing
you must decide

117
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,708
before I can communicate
the order to the fleet.

118
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,666
Who do you want to
lead the defense forces

119
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,916
in Mystel and Aptic?

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,583
For the Mystel System, I believe

121
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,000
Admiral Mulusufa would
be an excellent choice.

122
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,125
For the Aptic System...

123
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,458
Why don't we let Admiral Bebaus
head up that fleet?

124
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:38,208
I see why you chose Mulusufa.
But Bebaus and his brother...?!

125
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,291
[NEFEE] Nereis, we've
received our orders.

126
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,208
[NEREIS]
Are they worthy of us?

127
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,291
[NEFEE]
I think so.

128
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,833
His Highness, the
commander-in-chief

129
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,250
has commanded us
to defend Aptic.

130
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,708
That sounds like a
pretty important job!

131
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,000
Isn't Aptic one of
the planetary systems

132
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,958
they expect to become
a major battlefield?

133
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,458
[NEFEE]
You'll be okay.

134
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,291
I think you can do it.

135
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,291
If it looks like you're
going to do something stupid,

136
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,791
I'll help you out.

137
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,041
[NEREIS]
What do you mean?

138
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
You're the one always
trying to put dumb ideas

139
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,708
into my head and then
making me feel like...

140
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,625
...like I'm not qualified
for the job.

141
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,875
You think there's
some common sense

142
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,750
in that head of yours.
Right, Nereis?

143
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,291
Are you saying I haven't
got any, Nefee?

144
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,166
You know what your problem is?

145
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,958
You've got no sense
of self-awareness.

146
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,416
You've got enough
for both of us!

147
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,625
I'm surprised you
haven't realized by now.

148
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,083
If you had some common sense,

149
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,875
you wouldn't be doing
these kinds of things.

150
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:38,916
[NEREIS]
Hm?

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,916
What kinds of things?

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,708
[NEFEE]
Hm.

153
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,083
Come on then.

154
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,916
If you can't think of an
example, maybe you shouldn't

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,958
act so smart with your talk
of "these kinds of things."

156
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,041
Hold on, I'm just
trying to think of

157
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,375
which example might
be the most effective.

158
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,166
I know! That's the one!

159
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,916
[NEREIS] Hm? You don't
have to try that hard

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,333
to remember something.

161
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,166
I don't have to try
hard to remember?

162
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,666
Oh, no, not hard at all!

163
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,458
In fact, it's often
hard to forget!

164
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,791
Just for the record,
go ahead and tell me.

165
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,625
What did you remember about me?

166
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,250
It was that strategy
meeting we had

167
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,708
during our last
training exercise.

168
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,708
You gave a long speech about how

169
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,250
our battles should
be full of passion.

170
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,833
Do you remember
all those blank faces

171
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,333
in the audience?

172
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,083
[NEREIS]
I didn't say anything wrong!

173
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,833
[NEREIS] It doesn't seem
right to me that battles

174
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,625
should be won in
such a clinical way.

175
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,041
Battles should have a heart--

176
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,166
they should be
fought with passion.

177
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,416
But you're not
thinking rationally.

178
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,000
Wars need to be won.
And it doesn't matter how.

179
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,375
I don't agree with you.

180
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,125
Why can't wars be filled
with artistry as well?

181
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,416
Is there anything
wrong with that?

182
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,875
[NEFEE, NEREIS]
Hm.

183
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,583
[NEREIS] It's time to
prepare for our departure.

184
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,541
It's obviously a waste of time
trying to talk with you

185
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,666
seriously about this.

186
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,916
[NEFEE] At last! You said
something sensible!

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,333
I'm going up to the bridge.

188
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,708
You coming up, too?

189
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,541
I want to hear those orders
sending us to defend

190
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,416
the Aptic System
directly from the mouth

191
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,125
of the commander himself.

192
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,125
I'll be there soon.

193
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,750
[DUSANYU] So it appears
that my chief-of-staff

194
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,041
doesn't like those two brothers.

195
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,958
No, sir, my personal
feelings are not a factor

196
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,125
in my opinion here.

197
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,916
I just doubt thier abilities.

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,208
I chose them because I believe

199
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,708
they have the abilities
necessary for this task.

200
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,458
Don't worry--they'll be fine.

201
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,375
But if they're not okay,
our entire fleet

202
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,208
is at risk of falling
apart at the seams!

203
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,541
I don't understand

204
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,333
why you have such a problem
with these brothers!

205
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,750
For a start, Admiral Bebaus
has no experience

206
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,916
on the battlefield.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,750
He has to get his
experience somewhere.

208
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,500
Now's just as good an
opportunity as any

209
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:47,458
to try him out--
throw him into the deep end!

210
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,791
But this isn't just
an exercise, sir.

211
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,750
[DUSANYU] The more commanders
we have on our side

212
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,708
with real-life
experience, the better.

213
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,083
By the way...

214
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,583
Perhaps you can explain why

215
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,916
you find it so hard to trust
my judgment in this matter.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,666
You seem to forget
that my family

217
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,791
has been entrusted
with ruling the empire,

218
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,083
which it has been
doing very successfully.

219
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,750
And I'm the one
who's next in line

220
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,708
to the Imperial throne.

221
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,708
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

222
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,250
It's just that we work
so closely together.

223
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,583
It may seem strange, but when
I'm working alongside you...

224
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,083
...sometimes it's
easy to forget.

225
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,083
[JINTO] I had heard
some interesting gossip

226
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,541
about our new
commanding officer.

227
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,916
The admiral, Prince Nereis
of Bebaus Alon Nerem,

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,750
and his chief of staff, Prince
Nefee of Bebaus Alon Nerem,

229
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,625
were actually brothers!

230
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,625
It seemed that everyone
knew the nickname

231
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,833
that had been given
to the Bebaus family:

232
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,291
"Spectacular Insanity."

233
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,000
[SUPPLY OFFICER 5A]
Jeez, of all the Admirals

234
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,625
they could have chosen,
they had to choose this one!

235
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,750
He's so difficult!

236
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,416
[JINTO] Even so, will it really
make any difference to us?

237
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,875
I mean, we're just crew
members on an assault ship!

238
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,500
How much contact do we ever have
with our commanding officers?

239
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,541
[SUPPLY OFFICER 5A]
Hm. That's very brave of you

240
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,375
to look at it that way!

241
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,958
I expect all the other pilots

242
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,458
are shaking in their boots
with fear right now.

243
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,875
[JINTO]
Huh?

244
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,208
What's that supposed to mean?

245
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,250
[SUPPLY OFFICER 5A]
Uh-oh!

246
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm afraid your allotted time

247
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,708
for collecting spare
parts has expired.

248
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,208
Sorry, but your time's up!

249
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,250
But wait a minute!
That's not fair!

250
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,000
It's not my fault you
started discussing

251
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,541
the admiral with me!

252
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,291
This is terrible.

253
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,041
I was asked to get
those replacement parts

254
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,916
for the laser cannon,
and now I'm gonna have to

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,541
go back to the
ship empty-handed.

256
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,875
If we're called
into battle before

257
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,416
the next supply fleet arrives,

258
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,666
we're going to be in trouble.

259
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,791
The ship's only got half
the equipment it needs!

260
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,500
[SAMSON]
Hey!

261
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,875
[JINTO yelps]

262
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:38,666
Huh?

263
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,125
You scared me, Samson!

264
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,125
Are you two headin'
out on a date, my boy?!

265
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,833
U-Us two?

266
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,750
Huh?

267
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,208
[SAMSON]
Well, time for a toast!

268
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,833
Let's toast to the future!

269
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,791
And to the Spectacular Insanity!

270
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,833
You're making a toast
with a Surugu?

271
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,375
Doesn't matter what the drink
is if it's from the heart!

272
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,458
I was wondering...

273
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,166
What is this
"Spectacular Insanity"

274
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,750
that everyone's talking about?

275
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,083
Don't they teach you kids
anything in school nowadays?!

276
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,833
[JINTO] Huh? Not about the
Spectacular Insanity,

277
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,083
but I remember learning
about the Bebaus family.

278
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,583
You know, how it's one
of the 29 root families.

279
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,791
And that one of their
ancestors was instrumental

280
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,083
in the development of
Plane Space technology,

281
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,750
and that the family
has produced lots

282
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,541
of great scientists since then.

283
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,875
[SAMSON groans]

284
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,250
[SAMSON] That's only one
side of the story, my boy.

285
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,916
You see, any family
which has a lot

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,250
of geniuses in its ranks
is also likely to have

287
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,541
some who are, shall we say,
a little on the crazy side.

288
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,333
Even insane!

289
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,416
Wait a minute!

290
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,041
I thought that
Admiral Bebaus came from

291
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,291
a good branch of
the family tree.

292
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,250
[SAMSON]
Ugh. No, you don't understand!

293
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,416
Not even his branch of
the family has managed

294
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,708
to escape from this very
colorful part of their history.

295
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,333
And so the nickname
that people give

296
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,041
to this "colorful" history is...

297
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,666
[SAMSON] You got it!
Spectacular Insanity!

298
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,083
But even if...

299
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,208
Even if the admiral is a little
a bit on the crazy side,

300
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,000
it doesn't really matter.

301
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,625
Not if he's surrounded
by intelligent staff.

302
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,000
Now ya mention it...

303
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,625
I've heard people say
his chief of staff

304
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,458
is also a Bebaus.
So we're outta luck!

305
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,291
Huh?

306
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,875
[laughs]

307
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,791
[PAVEURYUA]
Aviator Samson!

308
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,250
[SAMSON]
Hm?

309
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,916
Hey, good to see ya!
What's goin' on?

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,083
What do you mean
"what's going on?"

311
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,416
Didn't you check?

312
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,791
I've been trying to get
a message to you for ages

313
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,291
on your Clyuno but
you haven't responded!

314
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,750
I had no idea where you were,

315
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,500
so I've been running
everywhere looking for you!

316
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,041
[SAMSON]
Actually, I did get the message.

317
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,250
But sometimes, it's important
for a crew member to have to

318
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,541
actually find their
superior officer in person.

319
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,666
Face to face. It helps
to build character.

320
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,750
[PAVEURYUA] I've heard that
excuse three times already.

321
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,625
You better come up with
a new one sometime soon.

322
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,541
Well, there's no rest
for the wicked!

323
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,750
Guess that means this is the
end of my nice little break.

324
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,750
You two might as well stay
here and enjoy yourselves!

325
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:46,791
What?

326
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,875
See ya later!

327
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,000
Uh...

328
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,833
[JINTO]
What did he mean by "you two"?

329
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,208
Hey!

330
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,083
Oh! What is it?

331
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,500
[EKURYUA]
I was just wondering...

332
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,208
Why didn't you bring
Diaho with you this time?

333
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,125
Oh... Um...

334
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,583
I thought it would
be best if he stayed

335
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,250
aboard the <i>Basroil</i> .

336
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,958
He volunteered to work
on catching mice up there.

337
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,541
[EKURYUA]
Hmm...

338
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,583
[JINTO]
From what I've seen,

339
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,708
you really seem
to like cats a lot.

340
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,041
A-Anyway, you're always
taking care of mine.

341
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,375
[EKURYUA]
I hate cats.

342
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,875
[JINTO]
Huh? Why?

343
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,500
[EKURYUA] At my house,
we had a lot of cats

344
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,833
when I was growing up.

345
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,208
So there were always
lots of kittens around.

346
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,250
But they bullied me
because I was human

347
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,083
and not another kitten.

348
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,375
[JINTO]
They bullied you?

349
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,083
Who? The cats?!

350
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,166
Who else do you think
I'm talking about?

351
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,000
But if you hate cats,
why do you spend

352
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,208
so much of your time
taking care of Diaho?

353
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,708
[EKURYUA]
Because he's your cat.

354
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,041
[JINTO]
Huh?!

355
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,791
So... does that make you happy?

356
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,125
[sighs] Well... you know...

357
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,666
[laughs nervously]

358
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,750
[EKURYUA]
Our break's finished now.

359
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,750
I'm going back to the ship.

360
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,500
Doesn't time fly when
you're havin' fun?

361
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,208
Well, I guess I'd better
start headin' back

362
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,625
and report to the capt--

363
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,750
[JINTO yelps]

364
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:06,875
[EKURYUA]
What's wrong?

365
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,250
I--Nothing--

366
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,541
It's just... I'm sorry.

367
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,708
But if anyone saw us
here like this...

368
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,458
[gasps] Lafiel?!

369
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,958
It seems I came just
at the right time.

370
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,125
The repairs on the <i>Basroil</i>
have been completed.

371
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,708
And the Flying Section is
ready to go back on duty.

372
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,833
Second Aviator,
resume your position.

373
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,208
Yes, Captain.

374
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:32,000
I need to go to operational
headquarters now.

375
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,250
Hold on--wait a minute! Lafiel!

376
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,666
Here we go again...

377
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,583
[JINTO]
Lafiel!

378
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,458
[LAFIEL]
Hm?

379
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,291
I thought you were
off-duty at the moment.

380
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,583
There's no need for
you to tag along.

381
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,666
Yeah, I know.

382
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,833
It's just, I...

383
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,875
I wanted to talk
to you for a second.

384
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,250
Very well then. Just
make sure you keep up.

385
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,791
[JINTO]
What am I gonna do?

386
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,958
She must have
seen what happened.

387
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,375
[JINTO] Hey, did you hear
that Admiral Bebaus

388
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,125
is our new commander in chief?

389
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,416
He's gonna be in
charge of defending

390
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,916
the whole Aptic System!

391
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,500
Of course I did!

392
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,250
Don't forget that the Abriels
are one of the 29 root families

393
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,583
along with the Bebaus'.

394
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,041
I know both Admiral Neries
and his chief of staff,

395
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,375
Nefee, very well.

396
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,916
I see. Is it true they're
from the same family?

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,750
Yes, apparently they're twins.

398
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,125
They're twins? Is that possible?

399
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,041
Didn't the Abh have
complete control

400
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,708
over their children's births?

401
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,458
Obviously, their parents
made the choice

402
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,708
to have twins.

403
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,416
Normally parents don't
think that raising

404
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,250
children with the same genetic
structure is a good idea.

405
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,625
But they are the
Bebaus family after all.

406
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,958
I expect they wanted to
try something different.

407
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,166
They probably thought it would
be quite a unique experience.

408
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,666
That makes sense!

409
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,000
But... strange that one is
a higher rank than the other.

410
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,250
Huh.

411
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,916
This isn't what I wanted
to talk about at all!

412
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,583
Why can't I stop
beating about the bush

413
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,333
and get to the point?

414
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,583
A person with many loves
will not be promoted.

415
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,875
[gasps]

416
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,708
It's something the admiral says.

417
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,916
Apparently, Nereis says it

418
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,041
to his chief of staff,
Nefee all the time.

419
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,583
--Oh,

420
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,041
--[LAFIEL] But, of course...
--well that's all right then!

421
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,625
[LAFIEL] ...if you listen
to the chief of staff's view

422
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,333
of the situation, the
admiral's love of one thing

423
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,250
verges on the obsessive,
which isn't much better.

424
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:10,916
Jinto!

425
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,458
Huh? Yeah? What?

426
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,875
I can see right through you.

427
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,541
You don't hide your feelings
very well, you know!

428
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,791
Huh?

429
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,291
You were seriously hoping
I hadn't realized

430
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,500
what was going on back
there, weren't you?

431
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, all right.
I surrender, Lafiel!

432
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,583
With tactics like the
ones you used on me,

433
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,000
you'll be an admiral
any day now!

434
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,791
Well, I sincerely
hope your prediction

435
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,958
turns out to be true.
Now then...

436
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,083
After I've done what I have
to do at headquarters,

437
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,041
I think I'm gonna
take a little break.

438
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,833
If it's something that
would interest you,

439
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,625
you may accompany me.

440
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,416
Okay then! I'd love to do that!

441
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,208
Thank you, Admiral Abriel!

442
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,333
[laughs]

443
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,583
[BOTH laugh]

444
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,166
[JINTO] Our short break
together was really fun.

445
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,708
For a while we were able to
forget about the difficulties

446
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,375
that lay ahead of us
in the upcoming battle.

447
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,666
However, once I was
back on the <i>Basroil</i> ,

448
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,041
little did I know that
something was gonna happen

449
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,958
that quickly brought
us back to reality.

450
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,333
Supply Officer Lin,
are you there?

451
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,000
[JINTO]
Yes? What is it?

452
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,166
Is your cat okay?

453
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,083
Yeah, I think he's doing fine,

454
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,708
although he missed
me quite a bit!

455
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,708
But you didn't just call
about that, did you?

456
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,791
[EKURYUA] No. There's an
outside transmission for you.

457
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,708
[JINTO]
Hmm... That's unusual.

458
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,166
Who's it from?

459
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,125
[EKURYUA]
Headquarters.

460
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,166
[JINTO]
What?!

461
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,375
[EKURYUA]
I'll connect you now.

462
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,541
[yelps]

463
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,500
You mean it's from
Commander Atosuryua?!

464
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,583
Wait a minute!

465
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,458
Good morning,
Supply Officer Lin.

466
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,625
Good morning to you, too,
Commander Atosuryua!

467
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,416
[ATOSURYUA] If you don't mind,
I'd like to see you

468
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,625
when I'm talking to you.

469
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,583
Huh? Certainly! Right away!

470
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,791
Ma'am!

471
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,750
[ATOSURYUA chuckles]
There's no need for you

472
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,875
to be so formal, you know!

473
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,416
I'm calling you on a
purely personal matter.

474
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,875
Really? Okay then!

475
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,416
So, uh-- How can I be
of assistance to you?

476
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,416
I wanted to invite you
and Captain Abriel

477
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,000
to have dinner with
me tomorrow night.

478
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,708
I've made reservations
at Mitsugoiwa.

479
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,666
It's probably not the
most appropriate place

480
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,750
in which to entertain
a princess and a count

481
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,375
such as the captain and
yourself, but that being said,

482
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,708
it is by far and away the
best place to eat in Dakul,

483
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,333
and we are in a war zone.

484
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,208
I hope you don't mind too much!

485
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,375
[JINTO]
A dinner invitation? But why?

486
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,000
I simply wanted
to spend some time

487
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,333
with you and Captain Abriel.

488
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,541
What's wrong with that?

489
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,375
Look, haven't you got it yet?

490
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,166
I don't suppose this
has got anything to do

491
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,333
with the death of
your brother, has it?

492
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,750
Yes, sort of.

493
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,083
You see, tomorrow would
have been the day

494
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,125
of my brother's birthday
if he'd still been alive.

495
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,791
Obviously, he can't be here
to celebrate with us,

496
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,250
but I wanted to have
a party with people

497
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,500
who had some
connection with him.

498
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,833
That's kind.

499
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,083
But I'm not sure--

500
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,375
we weren't exactly friends
with your brother.

501
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,375
You know?

502
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,875
Look, I understand
your concerns

503
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,791
about the situation, but it
really doesn't matter to me.

504
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,416
You see, there's
only three people

505
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,125
who knew my brother
in this star system.

506
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,375
You two and me.

507
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,041
I hope you're not
suggesting I celebrate

508
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,750
his birthday all by myself?

509
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,583
[JINTO]
No, I wasn't saying that.

510
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,083
[ATOSURYUA]
All right, then!

511
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,125
Now I've got a favor to ask you.

512
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,625
[JINTO]
Huh?

513
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,166
I was hoping you might be able
to invite Captain Abriel--

514
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,333
no, use her formal title
of Viscountess Paryunu.

515
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,791
Will that be acceptable for you?

516
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,333
Of course, I realize
that etiquette

517
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,916
would normally dictate
that I should invite

518
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,875
my guests personally, but this
isn't a regular situation.

519
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,291
I mean, it's got the
potential to be...

520
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,541
[JINTO]
Let's see...

521
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,666
If Lafiel doesn't
accept the invitation,

522
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,250
I won't have to go either.

523
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,416
[ATOSURYUA]
...be too much trouble for you.

524
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,791
All right, I'll do it.
I'll ask her for you.

525
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,125
Great! Thank you!

526
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,958
Of course, if the princess
doesn't want to come,

527
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,833
you'll still be
there, won't you?

528
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:42,916
Huh?

529
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,500
If you were to
refuse my invitation,

530
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,083
I'd be very disappointed, not
to mention a bit embarrassed.

531
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,166
Oh! Of course--
I'll be there tomorrow!

532
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,750
Make sure you remember
to tell her that

533
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,875
this is a personal invitation
and nothing formal, got it?

534
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,041
Okay! I'll be counting on you!

535
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,500
Uh...

536
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,916
[JINTO] This whole thing
made me realize something.

537
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,583
I sure wasn't good
at asserting myself.

538
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,750
Look, I understand your concerns
about the situation.

539
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,750
But it really doesn't
matter to me.

540
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,875
Who knows?

541
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,166
Maybe it was a secret lover.

542
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,750
[LAFIEL]
I remember...

543
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:59,916
I had to leave your brother's
dinner before we'd finished.

544
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,708
So, it's going to be
a battle in regular space.

545
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,125
It's not very edifying for us,

546
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,875
considering we have the
power to roam around

547
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,125
in Plane Space.

548
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,833
[NEFEE] Well, ideally,
we want the end result

549
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:10,166
to be a thing of beauty.

550
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,500
But don't worry, I won't
make it my sole objective,

551
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,916
brother dear!
