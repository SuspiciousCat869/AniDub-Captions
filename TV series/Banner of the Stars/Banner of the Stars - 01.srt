[JINTO]
We lived on a well-known ship.

69
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,958
But it wasn't well-known
because it had been

70
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,666
in a famous battle or anything.

71
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,750
Its fame came from being home
to two members of royalty.

72
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,083
One of them was our captain,
Deca-Commander Abriel.

73
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,250
She was a princess of
one of the royal families

74
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,750
of the Humankind Empire Abh.

75
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,166
The other was me, Count Jinto

76
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,541
of the Lin Syune
Rocke Hyde Family.

I'm a nobleman.

78
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,708
However, this ship
was the only place

79
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,166
I had to call home.

80
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,375
And, if truth be told,
it was the only place

81
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,750
where I felt like
I really belonged.

84
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,333
[sighs] So, Navigator
Sobaash, do you think

85
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,250
the time has come to tell
him what we need him to do?

86
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,000
He's still very young--
do you think he can cope?

87
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,583
[SOBAASH] Well, as
vice-captain of this ship,

88
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,833
I could order him to do it,
but forcing someone

89
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,291
to do such a dangerous
task doesn't feel right.

90
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,958
How about you try some
gentle persuasion?

91
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,458
I'll give it a go.

92
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,666
So, young Secretary
Jinto, listen up.

93
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,541
Yes?

94
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,458
During that battle simulation,

95
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,583
the captain didn't perform
as well as expected

96
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,916
and her pride was
damaged quite badly.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,833
Do ya see what I'm getting at?

98
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,916
[JINTO] I think you're being
unfair if you're insinuating

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,875
that the captain
isn't up to the job.

100
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,125
You've gotta remember that
Hecto-Commander Kotokeil

101
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,666
has way more experience
than the captain--I mean,

102
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,791
she's only just taken
command of this ship

103
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,000
and can't be expected
to know everything from...

104
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,250
[SAMSON] Yes, Your Highness,
I'm fully aware of that.

105
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,416
I'd prefer it if you didn't
address me that way.

106
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,708
[sighs] Fine, Secretary Lin.

107
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,083
Don't misunderstand me--
none of us have a problem

108
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,333
fighting under the
captain's command.

109
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,250
However, you have to admit that
she's got a lot to learn,

110
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,041
and inexperience can be
dangerous in a battle situation.

111
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,708
[SAMSON] Even if we
join forces with other,

112
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,833
more experienced
captains in the fleet,

113
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,916
we'll still be under
the captain's command.

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,875
That said, we sincerely
believe that she has

115
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,583
great potential and we
want her to succeed.

116
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,666
Are you following
what I'm saying so far?

117
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,083
Yes.

118
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,625
[SAMSON] We have to make sure
the captain is feeling

119
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,833
positive about her
ability and gets herself

120
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,875
in the right frame
of mind to fight.

121
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,833
If we can do that,
then we all have a better

122
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,208
chance of getting
out of this alive.

123
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,750
At least we don't have to worry
about her being overconfident,

124
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,875
which can sometimes
be more dangerous.

125
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,375
[JINTO]
"Dangerous"?

126
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,208
She's just feelin' a bit down
in the dumps, that's all!

127
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,583
[SAMSON] Well, maybe dangerous
is too strong a word.

128
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,791
But a lot of fighting
is about psychology

129
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,958
and you need to
believe in yourself.

130
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,083
So our chances of success
would be improved

131
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,208
if our captain believed
we could win.

132
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,791
It's pretty straightforward,
don't you think?

133
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,041
Guess so.

134
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,500
And this is where you
come in to the picture

135
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,875
to help us out!

136
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,333
What do you mean where
I come in to the picture?

137
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,041
What do you want me to do?

138
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,541
Come on, do I really
need to tell ya that?

139
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,458
You want me to go in
and cheer her up--

140
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,166
boost her confidence?
Give her a bit of pep talk?

141
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,625
You got it--you're definitely
the best man for the job.

142
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,833
Now I'm the one with
no self-confidence.

143
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,250
[SAMSON] I'm not expecting
you to work miracles here!

144
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,583
Just spend some time
chatting with her.

145
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,041
Give her a chance to
let off a little steam.

146
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,791
[JINTO]
Her? Let off steam?

147
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,583
Um... Well, maybe you're right.

148
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,291
I guess she's not the type to do
that in front of other people.

149
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,291
After all, she is an Abriel.

150
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,875
But the fact remains
that she's feeling

151
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,416
a bit low and I think we should
give her a chance to talk.

152
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,666
Don't you think
it's a good idea?

153
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,833
Well, sure, yeah.

154
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,166
But why can't you do it?

155
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,916
Do I have to tell you that?
Isn't it obvious?

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,333
Listen, if the captain
was in a really foul mood,

157
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,500
what would you do?

158
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,083
[JINTO] Well, I'd try to
calm her down, of course.

159
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,500
How about you, Sobaash?
What would you do

160
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,166
in that situation?

161
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,083
I'd run in the other direction!

162
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,708
You know, suddenly remember
some urgent business.

163
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,666
You see that?

164
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,875
That's what most of us would do

165
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,833
if we were faced
with an angry Abriel.

166
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,250
Run away! But you're different!

167
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,041
You said you'd try
and calm her down.

168
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,416
Oh...

169
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,458
Are you sure you're not
reading too much into this?

170
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,250
The captain's perfectly capable
of taking care of herself.

171
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,666
Besides, if she knew we were
talking about her like this,

172
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,416
it would really make her mad!

173
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,708
[SAMSON] I think I'd prefer
to see an angry Abriel

174
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,208
than a depressed one.

175
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,250
Seems more natural.

176
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,708
At least we know
how to deal with it!

177
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,333
I suppose you've
got a point there.

178
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,666
Although...

179
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,333
I'm not sure that her
being angry is any better

180
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,291
for her than being
down in the dumps.

181
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,416
It might seem more natural
for her to be angry,

182
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,083
but it doesn't mean it's
a good thing, does it?

183
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,541
Of course not.

184
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,833
[JINTO] I've known her for
years and years, right?

185
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,666
Well, one thing I've
noticed is that what annoys

186
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,375
the captain more
than anything else

187
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,416
is when people treat
her like a child.

188
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,000
If she ever found out
that we've been trying

189
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
to "take care of her,"
then even I wouldn't wanna

190
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,125
be around to suffer
the consequences.

191
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,708
[SAMSON] Hm. You've got one
up on us--you certainly

192
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,708
know her better than we do.

193
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,708
[SAMSON] We're just the
crew she's been allocated,

194
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,791
but you... you're friends!

195
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,958
Over the years, you've shared
adventures with her,

196
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,125
she gives you little presents--
you're even allowed

197
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,916
to call her by her real name!

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,500
[JINTO] Huh? How did
you know about that?

199
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,500
You haven't exactly
been hiding it.

200
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,541
I've heard you use
her name three times.

201
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,041
Uh--

202
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,458
[SAMSON] No need to be
embarrassed, Secretary Lin.

203
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,125
Just because you and
the captain are friends

204
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,291
doesn't mean we're gonna
treat you any differently.

205
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,333
You're part of the team on board
this ship just like us.

206
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,500
We all have our jobs to do
and we do them well--

207
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,416
there's no reason for
us to be jealous of you

208
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,833
being friends with her.

209
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,333
[chuckles] That wasn't what
I was worried about.

210
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,958
[SAMSON] In that case,
there's nothing to stop you

211
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,083
from going to talk to the
captain to see what's up.

212
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,041
'Kay...

213
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,125
Let's just hold on
a minute here!

214
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,791
I think you're reading
way too much into this.

215
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,333
She's probably fine!

216
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,750
Besides, there's no reason
for me to go and see her now.

217
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,375
She'd think something
weird was going on.

218
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,583
If it's an excuse
you're looking for,

219
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,916
I can give you one.

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,583
[JINTO sighs]
You mean Diaho? Thanks a lot.

221
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,333
[meows]

222
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,083
It must be nice
to be so carefree.

223
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,416
[meows]

224
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,791
Huh? Is there
somebody out there?

225
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,666
[JINTO]
Lafiel? Are you okay?

226
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,000
Is Diaho bothering you?

227
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,916
[LAFIEL sighs]

228
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,166
Hey...

229
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,458
[LAFIEL] I don't know why you're
all so worried about me.

230
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,083
Worried about you?
What are you talkin' about?

231
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,958
[LAFIEL] Hm. Nothing.
It's fine. Just forget it.

232
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,666
[yawns]

233
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,708
Glad to see I have such an
effect when I come into a room!

234
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,541
Falling asleep!

235
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,291
[LAFIEL]
Jinto?

236
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,333
[JINTO]
Yeah, what?

237
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,375
[LAFIEL]
What's for dinner tonight?

238
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,250
[JINTO]
Huh? That's easy!

239
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,083
Why don't you just look
at your online menu?

240
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,416
It's all there.

241
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,833
[LAFIEL]
Yeah?

242
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,291
It's hard to concentrate

243
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,166
with you standing
over my shoulder.

244
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,875
Sorry. Let me check.

245
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,750
It looks like the main
course is some sort of

246
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,666
spicy lamb dish.

247
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,750
Do you wanna know
what else it comes with?

248
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,791
[LAFIEL]
No thank you.

249
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,916
Jinto, if you've got
something to say,

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,416
why don't you just say it?

251
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,541
[JINTO] Because I don't
know what to say.

252
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,666
Can I sit down here?

253
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,375
Suit yourself--
sit where you like.

254
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,166
That's great, thanks.

255
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,625
It's about the battle
simulation we just did...

256
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,208
[LAFIEL] You can't tell me
anything I don't already know.

257
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,041
I know that losing
to someone as good as

258
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,750
Hecto-Commander Kotokeil
isn't a surprise.

259
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,791
I don't need to
hear it from you.

260
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,250
I wasn't going to.

261
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,916
But if you're gonna
be down in the dumps,

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,041
you shouldn't do it
in front of the crew.

263
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,750
"Down in the dumps"?
What do you mean?

264
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,708
[JINTO] They're concerned
that if you, as the captian,

265
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,458
are depressed after
this little setback,

266
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,458
then it's not a good
sign for the future.

267
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,791
Do you think that, too?

268
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,250
No, not me.

269
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,583
You may remember I've seen
a certain imperial princess

270
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,833
feeling a little like
this before--if not worse.

271
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,291
Three years ago...

272
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,083
Okay, I've heard enough of this.

273
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,791
[JINTO] What? I thought you
didn't like me sitting here

274
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,791
not saying anything.

275
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,125
I said I've heard enough.

276
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,791
Not that you ever really
listen to me anyway.

277
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,000
You're right about that.

278
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,750
Look, I've gotta say this,

279
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,375
so please just listen
to me for a minute.

280
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,833
I can understand why
the crew are concerned.

281
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,541
If you get this downhearted
when you lose in a simulation

282
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,250
against someone you had
no chance of beating anyway,

283
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,125
how are you gonna react
if you lose a real battle?

284
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,375
[LAFIEL] If that ever happens,
I'll just back off.

285
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,375
I know what to do.

286
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,833
[JINTO]
Sure you know what to do--

287
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,583
it's just that not everyone's
convinced about that.

288
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,208
Everyone... Everyone...

289
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,708
Are you part of this "everyone"?

290
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,875
Are you worried about me, too?

291
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,416
Not at all.

292
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,958
I think you're mature
enough to know

293
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,791
when it's okay to feel
dejected and when it's not.

294
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,958
Or at least, you were three
years ago, and I can't believe

295
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,166
you've changed that
much since then.

296
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,166
Yeah, I'm going to be fine.

297
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,625
You know, you seem
to have become

298
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,708
rather full of yourself
since I last saw you.

299
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:27,250
I like to think of it as being
grown up and responsible.

300
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,041
But if you wanna call it
being too full of yourself...

301
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,500
...then I might as well
live up to the name

302
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,750
and tell you I think you're
simply not used to losing.

303
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,375
You're so used to
getting your own way

304
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,375
that when you lost
in that simulation today,

305
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,250
you couldn't just deal with it.

306
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,375
You're acting like
a spoiled kid.

307
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,666
Next time it happens,
don't be such a sore loser

308
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,833
and everyone will feel
differently. Understand?

309
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,125
Idiot!

310
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,541
[JINTO] Anyway, I guess
I should be going now.

311
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,916
Listen, Jinto.

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,083
I wish you'd stop acting like
you're my father or something.

313
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,625
Is it that bad?

314
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,833
Yes. I don't need
looking after anymore.

315
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,666
[JINTO]
You've got it all backwards.

316
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,791
Look, we're up in space, right?

317
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,333
This is your home territory.

318
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,708
The home of your
people, the Abh.

319
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,416
I'm just a mere Lander,
so up here in space,

320
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,041
I believe what you say
and follow wherever you go.

321
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,250
You could at least sound
a little bit sincere.

322
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,666
Then I might actually believe
you meant what you said.

323
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,916
I did mean it--why won't
you just trust me, Lafiel?

324
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,041
Why won't you believe me?

325
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,333
It's the truth.

326
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,958
Anyway, see you later.

327
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,416
[LAFIEL]
Jinto.

328
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,583
[JINTO]
Yes?

329
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,583
Nothing... No, it's nothing.

330
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,041
Okay.

331
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,708
[LAFIEL]
Three years ago,

332
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,500
we looked out for
each other all the time.

333
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,875
How can things
change so quickly?

334
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,541
[JINTO]
Three years ago...

335
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,916
That was when I first saw her.

336
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,541
My patrol ship, <i>Gosroth</i> ,
is awaiting you.

337
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,541
Please come with me immediately.

338
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,291
[JINTO]
Afterwards, we walked together.

339
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,583
We laughed together.

340
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,166
We cried together.

341
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,208
[LAFIEL]
Jinto!

342
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:23,791
You pig! I'll get you for this!

343
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,833
No, Lafiel! Stay back!

344
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,291
[KAIT]
They're over there!

345
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,041
Don't let them get away!

346
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,833
[PILOT 1A] We can't get any
closer! It's too dangerous!

347
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,750
I don't care! Ram them!
Just fly straight into them!

348
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,416
Ah!

349
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,833
Damn you! 

350
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,416
[KAIT]
Damn you! 

351
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,958
Damn you all! 

352
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,833
[JINTO] But eventually,
our adventures together

353
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,708
had to come to an end.
And by then,

354
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,083
I had lost my family, my home,

355
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:12,791
and any connection
I had with my past.

356
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,333
[RAMAJ] The Battle of
Sufugnoff was just a decoy,

357
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,583
drawing our attention away from
a larger attack on the Capital.

358
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,916
We managed to drive them
away but not before

359
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,166
incurring major losses.

360
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,708
[FARAMUNSH] The regions
surrounding the empire

361
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,666
have now been annexed
by enemy forces

362
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,333
and they've also severed all
our transportation links.

363
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,208
[RAMAJ] So they've
completely cut us off.

364
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,833
[FARAMUNSH]
I'm afraid so.

365
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,500
And we don't have
enough military power

366
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,583
left to do anything about it.

367
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,166
We're completely
at their mercy now.

368
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,916
[JINTO] It was strange how
this news affected me--

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,791
I wasn't upset or angry about
being cut off from my home.

370
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:54,541
If anything, I felt a sense
of relief. How weird is that?

371
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,375
They say that good can
come from every situation,

372
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,916
and well, I did meet you again!

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,125
You shall call me Lafiel!

374
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,250
Captain!

375
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,541
We'll be passing through
the Vobeirunei Gate

376
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,166
at any moment now!

377
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,833
[SOBAASH]
Ten seconds.

378
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:13,916
[SOBAASH]
Eight...

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,125
...7...

380
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,541
I want you to give me
a visual on screen!

381
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:22,041
[SOBAASH]
...4, 3, 2, 1.

382
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,708
We've passed through!

383
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,375
[LAFIEL] This is Battleship
number 18 <i>Basroil</i>

384
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,500
under the Exercise
and Training Fleet.

385
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,625
We have passed through
the Vobeirunei Gate.

386
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,000
[KOTOKEIL]
Very good.

387
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,166
Now join the Battleship
Squadron stationed at 5001.

388
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,541
Wait there until all
ships have assembled.

389
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,041
[LAFIEL]
Roger.

390
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,375
We will proceed to 5001 and
await further instructions.

391
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,291
[FAAKON] Deca-Commander!
You've gotta see this!

392
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,708
Oh, wow!

393
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,125
Surely they can't all be waiting
to get into formation?

394
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,166
So this is it.

395
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,583
The Naval Station of Vobeirunei.

396
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,583
Over the past three
years, the empire

397
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,791
has been rebuilding its fleet.

398
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,208
At times, the pace of the
reconstruction was so rapid,

399
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,208
that it was almost
like fireflies hatching

400
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:17,375
during breeding season.
Ship after ship.

401
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,708
The fleet soon reached
a level of grandeur

402
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,083
that had never been seen before.

403
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:26,125
It was several times larger
than even before the war began.

404
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,000
Every single day,
the fleet is reorganized

405
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,250
and every single week,
a new squadron is formed.

406
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,916
Of course, some of the
ships will head out to war

407
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,541
never to return.

408
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,708
The day will soon arrive
for our ship to leave.

409
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,416
And our battle will begin.

410
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,291
[JINTO] It feels so good to be
with you once again, Lafiel.

411
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:50,500
I always wanna be there for you,
through thick and thin,

412
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,333
through good times
and bad times.

413
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,791
I know I'll grow old
more quickly than you,

414
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,833
because I'm only a Lander.

415
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,833
But to me, that doesn't matter.

416
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,541
I'll be there. If you become
Empress, I'll be there.

417
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,833
If we get turned into dust
in the emptiness of space,

418
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:10,250
I'll be there.
Whether you like it or not!

419
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,208
[JINTO] What we do with the
freedom we have been given

420
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,583
ultimately determines
the value of our lives,

421
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,583
and I have chosen to use my
freedom to follow you, Lafiel.

422
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,541
[JINTO] A friend of mine,
Ku Dorin, once told me

423
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,750
that I'd given up my freedom
far too early in my life,

424
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,250
but I don't feel like
I've given up my freedom--

425
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,166
I feel like I'm gaining it!

426
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,833
I don't believe I will ever
have such a wonderful

427
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,875
opportunity again!

428
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,125
[JINTO] I wish you could
understand this better, Lafiel.

429
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,458
You've never experienced
true freedom.

430
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:57,375
The price you pay for being born
into the Imperial Royal family.

431
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:01,375
You have to seize the day,
or that day may pass you by.

432
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,583
We have been assigned
to the first squadron

433
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,250
of Battleship Battalion
Latouche 1058.

434
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,875
We will leave in 12 hours.

435
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,916
Commence preparations
for departure.

436
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,458
[sighs] I've never heard
anything so boring.

437
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,333
There's nothing worse than
a dull, but well-meaning

438
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,958
president attempting to speak
passionately about his planet.

439
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,791
[ALL panting]

440
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,541
You do know that she's
the younger sister

441
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,083
of Baron Febdash.

442
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,833
Huh?

443
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:13,291
How far will we get
before the enemy strikes?

444
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,000
How far...?
