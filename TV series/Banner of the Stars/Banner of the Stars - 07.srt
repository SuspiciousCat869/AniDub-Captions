[KENESH] To be honest
with you, the First Fleet,

44
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,833
led by Admiral Spoor,
had almost achieved

45
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,166
its objectives in
Operation Phantom Flame.

46
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,875
However, it appears
the enemy has been

47
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,875
undertaking further
reconnaissance missions.

48
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,333
We're certain they're preparing
a large-scale counterattack.

49
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,250
If the First Fleet
cannot make it as far

50
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,583
as the Laseese Kingdom,
the gates behind them

51
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,750
are liable to be
retaken by the enemy,

52
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,666
cutting off our supply line
and leaving the fleet stranded.

53
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,750
The logical choice
would be for us to halt

54
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,208
the advances of the First Fleet
and wait for the enemy

55
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,416
to make their first move.

56
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,333
In the current
situation, the places

57
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,166
most likely to be
targeted for attack

58
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,125
are the gates nearest
to the enemy:

59
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,875
Wimpel Gate and Miofrantia Gate.

60
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,791
If we retreat from these gates,

61
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,416
leaving only some
reconnaissance ships in place,

62
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,041
then the only place
they can attack us

63
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,625
is at the connecting gates
of Aptic and Mystel,

64
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,583
where we have time to
build a strong defense.

65
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,916
If we can defend these
gates, we can safely

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,333
secure our supply line.

67
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,208
Of course, it will take
time for the enemy

68
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,916
to rebuild their fleet.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,791
During that time,
we can easily carry out

70
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,125
our operation.

Are you sure we have to wait

86
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,458
and see what the enemy's
going to do in this situation?

87
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,833
Yes, but the key to our
success is how fast

88
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,416
can we read their movements?

89
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,916
Whatever they do, there's
going to be a show-down here.

90

And we have to win,

91

otherwise the whole operation
is in danger of collapsing.

92
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,500
In that case we need
to get reinforcements.

93
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,333
We can use reconnaissance ships
from any of the nearby gates

94
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,000
to add to our strength.

95
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,750
Our reconnaissance
missions in Wimpel

96
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,791
and Miofrantia will
prove to be the key

97
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,291
to the entire operation.

98

00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,583
[LAFIEL]
Fool!

164
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,958
[SOBAASH] We've got to
stabilize the pressure

165
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,000
on the ship!

166
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,458
I'm already working on it!

167
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,166
But the space-time bubble
generator is more important!

168
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,958
I agree. Second Aviator!

169
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:50,833
What about the Seigroil?

170
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,000
They're still with us.

171
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,708
I'm trying to establish
a connection now.

172
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,500
[LAFIEL]
I gather this is an emergency.

173
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,333
I'm gonna need an
accurate report from you

174
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,666
as quickly as you can!

175
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,416
There's been a mine
attack, Captain.

176
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,583
A mine attack?!

177
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,000
Please go on.

178
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,791
[SOBAASH] We destroyed them
with the laser cannon.

179
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,458
However, the mines
came in pretty close,

180
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,791
and several pieces of
shrapnel hit the ship.

181
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,875
The same thing happened
to the <i>Seigroil</i> .

182
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,708
[LAFIEL]
Is there any damage?

183
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,833
We're still in the process
of checking it out.

184
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,708
We suffered a pressure leak
in at least 16 places.

185
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,041
And some equipment's
been damaged.

186
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,708
And as for the rest,
it's hard to say right now.

187
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,541
Supply Officer, work with the
Line Wing Aviator to discover

188
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,458
exactly what damage
has been inflicted.

189
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,791
[JINTO]
Yes, Captain.

190
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,541
I still can't believe
how all those

191
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,125
mines were activated
at the same time.

192
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,333
At the same time?

193
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,291
There were three
aimed at us and four

194
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,791
aimed at the <i>Seigroil</i> and
they were all activated

195
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,833
within two seconds
of each other.

196
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,625
Doesn't sound like
it happened by chance.

197
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,166
No.

198
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,750
Captain! We've made
contact with the <i>Seigroil</i> .

199
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,166
They're coming through now.

200
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,750
Deca-Commander Abriel,

201
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,666
we have a serious situation
here on the <i>Siegroil</i> .

202
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,666
--[gasps]
--What's it like with you?

203
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,875
We appear to have suffered
some extensive damage,

204
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,875
but we're not sure of
the repercussions yet.

205
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,916
[SAMSON]
Captain...

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,041
Things don't look too good here.

207
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,541
The space-time
bubble communicator

208
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,000
and the radar system
are badly damaged.

209
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,750
A lot of other
equipment is out, too,

210
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,625
but those are
the worst affected.

211
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,875
We should count ourselves lucky

212
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,041
there were no
fatalities on board.

213
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,041
[RAGASH]
Hmm...

214
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,250
Sounds like you're
in pretty much

215
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,666
the same situation as us.

216
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,958
[LAFIEL]
It's that bad?

217
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,875
[RAGASH]
I'm afraid so.

218
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,666
We were in the same
area when the attack

219
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,750
was launched, so it's not
surprising that we both got hit.

220
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,875
And now it looks as though
we're stranded in Plane Space.

221
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,083
[LAFIEL] Stranded...
and we're right in front

222
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,541
of the approaching enemy fleet.

223
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,958
[SAMSON] Repairs to
stabilize the pressure

224
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,500
on board have been completed.

225
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,000
[LAFIEL]
Good work.

226
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,458
What about the space-time
bubble communicator?

227
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,125
We've got an idea about that.

228
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,708
Given the materials
we have on board,

229
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,416
we believe that to
attempt any repairs

230
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,750
would be a waste of time.

231
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,083
You're kidding!

232
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,875
We just received word
from the <i>Seigroil</i>

233
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,666
a minute ago.

234
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,375
Their space-time
bubble communicator

235
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,750
and radar system
are beyond repair.

236
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,208
[SAMSON]
So...

237
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,916
I guess we came out of this
slightly better than them.

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,708
Then does that mean our
radar system can be fixed?

239
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,250
It'll take about six
hours to do the work.

240
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,375
[LAFIEL]
Very well.

241
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,208
I suppose the only
thing we can do now

242
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,583
is sit here and wait.

243
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,208
[EKURYUA]
Transmission from the <i>Seigroil</i> !

244
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,291
They're requesting that we keep

245
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,416
the space-time
bubble stationary.

246
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,583
[LAFIEL]
Understood.

247
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,958
[SOBAASH]
At the moment we can't even tell

248
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,625
which direction the
space-time bubble is heading.

249
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,083
[JINTO] And what's worse,
for the next six hours,

250
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,625
we won't be able to tell
if there's an enemy

251
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,750
space-time bubble approaching!

252
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,916
Deca-Commander Abriel!

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
How are things going with you?

254
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,083
The emergency repairs
on our radar system

255
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,333
have now been completed.

256
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,916
But to be honest,
I can't say that

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,500
things are looking much
brighter than before.

258
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,875
[SOBAASH]
Although the radar's working,

259
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,666
its quality has deteriorated.

260
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,625
We can only detect objects
that are in close proximity.

261
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,250
[LAFIEL] But at the moment,
we haven't picked up

262
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,083
anything within our range.

263
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,208
[RAGASH] We can't just randomly
move around in the dark.

264
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,083
Even if our allies send
a ship out to rescue us,

265
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,041
there's still one big
hurdle to overcome.

266
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,916
[JINTO] While we waited,
everyone's nerves

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
were on edge as never before.

268
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:23,166
And this tension lasted
for over 40 hours.

269
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,000
[JINTO] Space-time bubbles
move around in Plane Space

270
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,208
a bit like a ball which has
fallen onto the floor.

271
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,875
When the ball is rolling,
its impetus causes it to travel.

272
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,166
But when it stops rolling,

273
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,833
it continues to spin
in one position.

274
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,166
In the same way,
although we had stopped,

275
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,166
the space-time bubble
continued to spin

276
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,750
and the generator was using up
precious anti-matter fuel.

277
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,583
To conserve that fuel,
we had to make

278
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,333
some sacrifices in
how we went about

279
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,291
our lives aboard the ship.

280
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,166
Eventually, there was
a change in the situation.

281
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,583
Captain!

282
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,666
The radar's picked up
something heading towards us.

283
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,916
How big is it?

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,666
[EKURYUA] It looks like
it could be a squadron.

285
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,916
Get a message to the
<i>Seigroil</i> immediately.

286
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,958
There're some space-time
bubbles heading this way?!

287
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,458
[RAGASH] Our fuel is only going
to last about six hours.

288
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,791
How about you, <i>Basroil</i> ?

289
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,541
I think we can survive
for about ten hours more.

290
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,500
I don't get what's goin' on.

291
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,041
We're calculating
how long we've got

292
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,291
if we decide to escape using
our remaining anti-matter fuel.

293
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,458
Escape? But what for?

294
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,541
Since our space-time
bubble communicator

295
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,833
is out of action,
we're not in a position

296
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,625
to tell if those bubbles
heading towards us

297
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,958
contain enemy ships or allies.

298
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,083
No way!

299
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,416
[RAGASH] I realize it's
a simple calculation,

300
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,458
but if we combine fuel
from the two ships,

301
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,083
we'll have 16 hours' worth.

302
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,875
[LAFIEL]
Is that all?

303
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,833
[SAMSON] It's okay,
we've got plenty of time.

304
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,500
Don't rush it, guys!

305
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,041
It would take a man
with more courage

306
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,333
than I to drop one of those
anti-matter fuel containers.

307
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,416
[SOBAASH] Transfer their
fuel and their crew

308
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,708
onto our ship and then separate?

309
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,958
It is a logical course
of action to take.

310
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,791
If we leave the <i>Seigroil</i> and all
the debris it collected behind,

311
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,958
we can increase our
speed significantly.

312
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,166
But isn't it risky?

313
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,541
Working manually inside
a space-time bubble?

314
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,041
There's still a lot of
debris scattered about.

315
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,416
Even with a Calike this

316
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,833
would've been a difficult
job to pull off.

317
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,125
Hello, Captain?

318
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,916
We have successfully
transferred both the fuel

319
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,750
and the crew of the
<i>Seigroil</i> onto the <i>Basroil</i> !

320
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,375
So, Captain Ragash,
you heard the news.

321
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,916
You should come on board now.

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,541
I'm afraid that I
and my officers

323
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,416
are not in a position
to accept your offer,

324
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,833
Deca-Commander Abriel...

325
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,666
What?! Why not?!

326
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,708
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you this earlier, but...

327
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,750
The damage to the ship
means there's no way

328
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,250
we can escape from
the bridge here.

329
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,916
There were many
other areas on board

330
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,125
which required more
immediate attention.

331
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,291
This part of the ship
took a low priority.

332
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,125
Unfortunately, we haven't
had the time or the manpower

333
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,458
to create an escape
route for ourselves.

334
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,250
But my honor would not permit me

335
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,916
to leave you out
here in Plane Space

336
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,250
without any fuel
or hope of rescue!

337
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,458
This isn't about your
own personal honor

338
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,250
or feelings about the
situation, Your Highness!

339
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,208
In the same way
that you, as a princess,

340
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,833
have responsibilities
and duties to your subjects,

341
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,083
I, as an officer
of the Star Forces,

342
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,125
am responsible for my crew.

343
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,583
But, Captain, you...

344
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,208
By choosing this
course of action,

345
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,000
I have decided to save the lives

346
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,041
of as many of my
crew as possible.

347
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,625
That is honorable.
Is that not right?

348
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,416
[RAGASH]
Deca-Commander Abriel!

349
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,083
I entrust my crew to your care.

350
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,958
Promise you'll take
care of them.

351
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,208
[LAFIEL]
I promise.

352
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,875
I'm going to end
the transmission now.

353
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,000
Over and out.

354
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,291
[gasps]

355
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,166
The connections
between the ships

356
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,666
have been released.

357
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,833
[SOBAASH]
The <i>Seigroil</i> is drifting away.

358
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,041
[SOBAASH] Captain,
what are your orders now?

359
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,625
Begin... separation.

360
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,291
Yes, Captain.

361
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,916
[JINTO] When the <i>Basroil</i>
separated from space-time fusion

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
we had to leave the <i>Siegroil</i> ,
and those left on the ship,

363
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,958
behind us.

364
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,791
With no fuel left,
the <i>Seigroil</i> couldn't avoid

365
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,166
coming into the path of the
advancing space-time bubbles.

366
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,041
They had become a decoy.

367
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,166
Giving their lives so
that we could escape.

368
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,458
And then...

369
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,625
The <i>Seigroil</i> is gone.

370
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,041
The ship and the people
that were left on board

371
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,833
will be transformed
into space-time particles

372
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,666
and float around
Plane Space for eternity.

373
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,833
[KRAN] Ugh. It's getting kind of
hard to breathe in here.

374
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,250
They're cutting back
on everything

375
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,458
to try and save fuel--
probably even the air supply!

376
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,041
[KRAN] And exactly how
much fuel do you think

377
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,583
we're gonna save by doing that?!

378
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,750
Five minutes?
Ten minutes, maybe?!

379
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,791
[PAVERYUA]
How the hell should I know?

380
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,083
Damn! Why don't we
simply surrender

381
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,041
to whoever's chasing us
in those bubbles?

382
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,041
So, a prisoner of war
camp or being

383
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:24,083
stuck in Plane Space...
both sound very appealing.

384
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,708
[LAFIEL]
No. I cannot permit it.

385
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,208
I should've known
I'd get a response

386
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,541
like that from you.

387
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,333
Captain, more than half
of the members of the crew

388
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,083
have said they
want to surrender!

389
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,083
Even if it's the enemy
in those space-time bubbles,

390
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,875
if we run out of fuel, the
alternative is just as bad!

391
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,708
It hasn't happened yet.

392
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,666
We'll continue to
retreat until we're left

393
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,958
with no choice.

394
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,708
[SAMSON sighs]

395
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,791
I think everybody's
reached their limit.

396
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:51,416
I expect their nerves'll run
out long before the fuel does!

397
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,583
[LAFIEL] It's my duty to try
and bring everyone back alive.

398
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,291
There's another group
of space-time bubbles

399
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,375
ahead of us.

400
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,500
Looks like it's the size
of one squadron.

401
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,625
From the front.

402
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,666
So, Captain, what do
you want us to do?

403
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,041
Captain?

404
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,333
Those space-time bubbles
are our allies.

405
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,625
I'm sure of it.

406
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,208
We must continue to advance!

407
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,333
I, uh... Yes, Captain!

408
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,083
Captain!

409
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,625
A small space-time bubble
has been released

410
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,125
from the lead ship!

411
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,791
I think it's probably a mine!

412
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,666
A mine?!

413
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
I hope not.

414
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,583
We can't dodge it
at this distance.

415
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,458
We don't have enough power
to fire the laser cannon!

416
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,666
I don't care.

417
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,250
Continue to advance
on the current course.

418
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,708
Ten seconds until
space-time fusion!

419
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,416
Eight...

420
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,416
Seven...

421
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,541
Six...

422
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,500
Five...

423
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,375
Four...

424
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,500
Three...

425
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,333
Two...

426
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,500
One.

427
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,125
Space-time fusion!

428
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,375
[EKURYUA] The self-destruct
system isn't responding!

429
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,166
[JINTO] Hold on--the mine's
going right past...!

430
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,541
It missed us!

431
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,625
[GAMROIL 2nd OFFICER]
This is the Star Force

432
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,333
Defense Fleet of the Aptic Gate.

433
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,541
This is a message for
our fellow attack ship.

434
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,708
Immediately enter
into space-time fusion

435
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,958
with the lead ship!

436
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,666
I repeat: This is the
Imperial Star Force...

437
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,666
We're receiving a
transmission? But how?

438
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,166
[LAFIEL]
That's simple.

439
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,250
The transmission isn't
coming from another

440
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,250
space-time bubble.

441
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,458
Then where would
it be coming from?

442
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,750
[LAFIEL]
What we thought was a mine

443
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,416
was a transmitter containing
a message for us.

444
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,583
There's only one person
who would think of this...

445
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,458
My bet is it's Unit
Commander Atosuryua!

446
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,375
[SOBAASH]
In that case...

447
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,500
[LAFIEL]
You heard the message!

448
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,708
Hurry up with the
space-time fusion!

449
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,083
[SOBAASH]
Yes, Captain!

is to have you with us again.

Thank you very much, ma'am.

I'll report on the last moments
of the <i>Siegroil</i> later on.

456
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,625
[ATOSURYUA]
Those space-time bubbles

457
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,125
that are chasing you
are from the fleet

and then retreat.

[SAMSON]
Whew!

464
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,625
Can you imagine what
would have happened

465
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,500
if we'd surrendered
to those guys?

466
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,291
Doesn't bear thinkin' about!

467
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,541
But, Captain, what I wanna
know is how you knew

468
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,125
those space-time
bubbles ahead of us

00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,083
were gonna be our ships?

00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,500
[SOBAASH]
Yes, I'd like to know that, too.

471
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,125
What evidence did you
have available to you

472
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,833
to make such a decision?

473
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:53,791
That's a... a military secret!

474
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,166
[JINTO]
It was all intuition!

475
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,916
How dare you be so rude to me!

476
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,375
I just wasn't certain,
that's all.

477
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,083
Time was running out for us.

478
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,458
We'd have run out of
fuel sooner or later.

479
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,875
I had to make a decision
one way or the other,

480
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,541
so I went with my intuition.

481
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,125
But, you seemed so confident
we were doing the right thing!

482
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,750
The captain has to act like that

483
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,291
to instill confidence
in the crew

484
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,583
in these kinds of situations.

485
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,833
Don't you remember?

486
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,875
Someone once said to me:
"when unsure whether

487
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,458
you should stop or go,
you should go."

488
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,625
Ya know something?

489
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,625
If that's all it was...

490
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:30,333
[laughs]

491
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,875
Jinto! I don't see
what's so funny.

492
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,083
It's just that maybe
we should keep this

493
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,625
a secret from everybody.

494
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,666
I mean, if they found out...

495
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,125
I don't know... and...

496
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:48,208
[laughs]

497
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,583
[DUSANYU]
So the main forces of the enemy

498
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,208
have moved into Wimpel?

499
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,416
[KENESH]
Yes.

500
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,833
The reconnaissance ships
in the Aptic region

501
00:22:56,916 --> 00:23:00,208
have confirmed the information.

502
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,291
[DUSANYU] In that case,
we can assume that Aptic

503
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,583
is going to be the main
target of the enemy assault.

504
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:52,083
[SAMSON]
You seriously think she's calm?!

505
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,333
[SOBAASH] Far more than
I thought she would be.

506
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,416
Maybe she feels a bit
out of place here.

507
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,833
And she's probably
finding it difficult,

508
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:00,250
having superiors
ordering her around,

509
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,958
given her background.

510
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,208
A toast!

511
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,375
[SOBAASH] I think they
either need to give her

512
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,208
more power to be used
at her discretion,

513
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:08,708
or it might be better
if she just acted alone.

514
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,583
Feels a bit out of place here...

515
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:13,708
I remember some kid sayin'
something along those lines.
