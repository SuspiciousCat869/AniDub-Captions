1
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,250
Huh? So! You've got an Abh
cat with a good pedigree?

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,041
And it's a Kutirowaru?
If you don't mind,

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,458
I'd like to give you some advice
about taking care of him.

4
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,375
If you're going to keep him on
board, then you should really

5
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,666
attach a transmitter
to his collar.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,208
That way, if there's
ever an emergency

7
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,250
you can find him quickly
and he'll be less likely

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,291
to come to a sticky end.

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,416
Well, you're lookin' pretty
healthy, aren't you?

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,833
Good muscles and everything!

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,083
This is the same cat

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,000
that belongs to Supply
Officer Lin, isn't it?

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,041
You know, I think the fact
that the kid even thought

14
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,333
of bringing a cat on board,
let alone actually doing it,

15
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,041
was a stroke of genius!

16
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,458
[laughs]

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,541
The Senior Aviator told me
you were worried about Diaho.

18
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,083
I think you'll find
this will help.

19
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,958
What is it? A transmitter.

20
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,833
I can understand you
wanting to have a pet

21
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,000
when we're on patrol
and have lots of free time,

22
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,375
but we're going
into battle soon!

23
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,375
And you're not gonna have
time to look after him.

24
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,791
And he's going to
get in the way.

25
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,541
[JINTO] There's nothing
I can do about that.

26
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,083
The <i>Basroil</i> 's my home.

27
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,625
There's nowhere else
for Diaho to go.

28
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,708
[LAFIEL]
Are you still alive, Jinto?

[LAFIEL grunts]

32
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,166
[LAFIEL]
You know...

33
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,708
When you're lying there asleep,

34
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,041
you kind of look like
you might be dead.

35
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,625
That's a grim way
of putting it!

36
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,541
Wouldn't "unconscious"
be more accurate?

37
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,666
Heh! I was having this dream.

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,125
Everyone was there.

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:11,041
And I saw the body of
Klasbul lying in his coffin.

40
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,666
I never imagined I'd
experience being a corpse

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,916
while I'm still alive.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,250
[LAFIEL]
Does it still hurt?

43
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,583
[JINTO]
It's just a scratch.

44
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,916
[LAFIEL] Oh, it's humiliating
to ride in a ship

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,791
with no exterior area
sensors or guhakes.

46
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,083
[JINTO] This is not a ship.
It's a coffin.

47
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,666
C-O-F-F-I-N.

48
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,125
[LAFIEL]
It's cramped in here.

49
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,625
I suddenly have the urge
to get away from you.

50
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:39,083
[JINTO]
Ouch! Be careful, I'm injured.

51
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,083
[LAFIEL]
I thought it was just a scratch.

52
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,500
[JINTO exhales]

53
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,875
[LAFIEL]
Jinto.

54
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,333
[JINTO]
Yeah?

55
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,916
[LAFIEL]
Please forgive me.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,375
[JINTO]
For what?

57
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,833
Hey, Jinto...

58
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,458
Huh?

59
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,916
Don't forget that you're
an honorable man...

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,458
Hey, Jinto, what's up?

61
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,125
[JINTO]
Uh. Nothing.

62
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,000
I was just thinking
how comfortable

63
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:02,250
this emergency pod is compared
to that coffin we got stuck in!

64
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,416
[LAFIEL]
But it only gives us 24 hours.

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,291
[JINTO] I'm sure Sobaash will
have rescued us before then.

66
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,916
[LAFIEL]
Of course she will!

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,708
[JINTO] Why're you so
angry all of a sudden?

68
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,250
[LAFIEL]
I'm not angry!

69
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,500
[JINTO laughs]

70
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,500
[LAFIEL]
What's so funny?

71
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,125
[JINTO]
Nothing really.

72
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,500
When you get angry like that

73
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:22,000
I guess I feel kind of relieved,
isn't that weird?!

74
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,833
[meows]

75
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,875
[EKURYUA] Can I pick him up?
He looks like he needs a cuddle.

76
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,250
Oh, sure. Thanks!

77
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,375
I guess I've been a careless
owner by neglecting him!

78
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,625
[EKURYUA]
Tell that to the cat!

79
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,708
No, that's okay.

80
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,333
He neglects me too
most of the time,

81
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,583
so we've got a lot in common.

82
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,541
[EKURYUA]
I see...

83
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,666
He'll come back soon,
you'll see.

84
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,166
Now the <i>Basroil</i> 's gone, I've
got nowhere I can call home.

85
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,458
Jinto.

86
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,041
[JINTO]
O Stars, listen to our plea,

87
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,291
Thy kin whose lives
are but short;

88
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,833
we ask that you might guide us.

89
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,833
Lead us throughout eternity.

90
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,750
[JINTO] It's funny,
but I really don't mind

91
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,791
being trapped in here.

92
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,750
Probably...

93
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,125
I'm sure it's because
I'm here with you.

94
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,250
[LAFIEL]
You fool.

95
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,833
[JINTO] I wonder...
who I really am...

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,375
[JINTO]
And then, 12 hours after

97
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,916
the <i>Basroil</i> had been destroyed,
we were finally rescued.

98
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,708
I really hope you
enjoyed your bath.

99
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,541
It wasn't bad, thank
you for asking.

100
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,166
Although it was rather annoying
that each time the ship fired

101
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,333
a weapon the water
splashed in my face.

102
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,333
Anything happen
I should know about?

103
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,291
No, there's nothing
much to report.

104
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,250
Except that the enemy retreated.

105
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,208
Oh, and it appears that
the main fleet has arrived.

106
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,041
What did you say?!

107
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,625
That's important! Why didn't
you inform me immediately?!

108
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,666
You've never liked having
your bath disturbed,

109
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,875
even as a kid.

110
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,041
You always ended up
being totally grumpy.

111
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,458
Only if someone was dragging
me out for no reason.

112
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,333
It's completely different when
it's a matter this urgent!

113
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,541
I'll remember that.

114
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,250
But even if I'd told
you right away,

115
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,750
you couldn't have done
anything about it, could you?

116
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,958
I'm the Commander in Chief

117
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,541
and the person who
decides that is me!

118
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,833
Now let's go get the enemy!

119
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,583
I thought you might
get all dramatic

120
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,125
and say something like that.

121
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,541
And that's why I didn't come
and get you out of your bath.

122
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,000
What do you mean by that?

123
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,208
Our fleet is in ruins
from the last battle.

124
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,166
If we go after them now,
it's going to mean

125
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,625
certain death for all of us.

126
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,958
Nothing like that's
going to happen.

127
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,583
[NEREIS sighs]
All right then.

128

I give in this time, Nefee.

129
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,458
We can't think about winning
or losing at the moment.

130
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,875
We have to regroup and
re-establish our forces

131
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,791
and let the main fleet deal
with the enemy.

132
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,000
[NEREIS]
That's all we can do?

133
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,125
"That's all we can do"?
Listen to yourself!

134

It's a tough job ahead!

135
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,916
And we're the ones who've got
to see this fleet through it.

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,041
We're the ones in charge!

137
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,666
By the way, Nereis.

138
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,125
What now?

139
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,250
You might as well go back
and finish having your bath.

140

[chattering continues]

142

[DUSANYU]
That's just like Beneej.

143
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,375
She has forcefully changed
her tactics in order to get

144
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,875
maximum advantage from
any weakness in the enemy.

145
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,583
And she thinks the Abriel
family fights rough!

146
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,166
All things considered,

147
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,250
her method of fighting is just
as violent as anybody else's.

148
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,041
But her strategy
is proving to be

149
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,791
extremely effective, isn't it?

Oh, please spare me.

151

If you're going to compliment
the head of the Spoor family,

152

at least have the grace
to do it out of my presence

153

so that I don't
have to hear it.

154
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,208
[KENESH]
It's not exactly a compliment.

155
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,250
Merely a realistic observation.

156
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,250
Anyway, we've got
the enemy confused

157

as a result of her tactics.

158
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,500
Yes, but she's left the
Allies confused as well.

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,375
We're passing through the rear
of the enemy formation now.

160
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,458
Do you think we destroyed
their ships too quickly?

161
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,666
Huh?!

162
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,333
[KUFADIS] Maybe she
regrets doing it now...

163
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,666
As I was saying, our main
squadrons will be passing

164
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,791
through the rear section
of the enemy fleet shortly.

165
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,583
But only two squadrons
have managed

166
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,750
to keep pace with us.

167
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,541
Shall we give
ourselves a little rest?

168
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,333
Seems like a good idea.
I don't see any reason why not.

169
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,750
[SPOOR]
All right then, we'll do that.

170
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,458
Relay this order
to the captains:

171
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,916
place your space-time bubbles
into stationary mode.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,083
However, should a
situation arise,

173
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,333
give them permission to alter
the space-time bubbles

174
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,125
into a mobile state
at their own discretion.

175
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,291
[KUFADIS]
Roger!

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,750
It is a good thing
for us that the enemy

177
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,458
has already used up
their supply of mines.

178
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,708
They were obviously confident
that they would recapture Aptic.

179
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,625
[DUSANYU] That's probably
not the only reason.

180
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,750
Their confidence also came from
using new fleet formations

181
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,041
and their increased
number of patrol ships.

182
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,166
[KENESH]
That could be true.

183
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,083
[DUSANYU gasps]

184
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,250
[DUSANYU]
Contact the ships

185
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,916
in the Assault Vessel
Mudoto Contingent.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,458
Tell them to pull out of
the battlefield immediately.

187
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,041
Their losses are too great.

188
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,416
[KENESH]
Roger.

189
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,708
[DUSANYU] The same goes for
Konaseeru and Garikoosh.

190
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,833
[KENESH] That means that
a total of 11 squadrons

191
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,250
will have been withdrawn.

192
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,166
I was prepared for some losses,
but this is terrible.

193
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,208
Yes, I'm afraid it is terrible.

194
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,750
Actually, your Highness,

195
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,125
I think you're doing
rather well.

196
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,375
Although the enemy
had far more ships than us,

197
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,666
we've managed to fight them

198
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,875
and still maintain control
of the battlefield.

199
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,333
[DUSANYU]
That's good of you to say so.

200
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,541
However, if those other
fleets were to arrive soon

201
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,583
our situation would
improve considerably.

202
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,166
[KENESH] You mean Admiral Rulef
with the Second Fleet,

203
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,458
and Admiral Kotoponi
with the Fourth Fleet?

204
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,333
[DUSANYU] I wonder what
those two are doing?

205
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,250
They're on their way,
aren't they?

206
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,625
It looks to me as though
the two fleets are advancing

207
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:11,916
towards us as quickly as the
laws of physics allow them to.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,291
[sighs] Don't you hate physics?

209
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,625
They can really get
in the way sometimes.

210
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,250
[DUSANYU laughs]

211
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,666
Oh, your Highness!

212
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,875
You know I've always been

213
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,041
a loyal Chief of Staff
on board this ship.

214
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,500
I suppose I should
ignore that rather silly

215
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,833
comment of yours.

216
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,791
Yes. I don't know exactly
to whom you are loyal.

217
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,875
But if you could see fit
to ignore my musings,

218
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,125
that would be the best
thing for the both of us.

219
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
questioned your loyalty.

220
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,000
[KENESH]
Right!

221
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,458
Excuse me, sir!

222
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,750
There's a message coming
through from the Second Fleet!

223
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,708
It's Admiral Rulef!

224
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,458
[FLEET OFFICER 1] Distance
to the enemy front: 100 wesdaj!

225
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,250
The First Fleet has
stopped advancing

226
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,875
and now appears to be
gathering its forces together.

227
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,166
We've made it in time!

228
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,500
[TORIIRU] The enemy appears
to be in disarray.

229
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,833
[RULEF]
All right! All ships!

230
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,916
Prepare to fire mobile
space-time mines.

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,750
We've got to make up for the
time we lost in getting here!

232
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,000
[FLEET OFFICER 2]
All ships ready to fire

233
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,583
their mobile space-time mines!

234
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,000
[RULEF] After deploying their
mines, all ships are to advance

235
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,916
in individual
space-time bubbles.

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,083
Yes, sir!

237
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,250
Standby! All mobile
space-time mines...

238
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,750
...fire!

239
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,833
The Second Fleet has begun
attacking the enemy!

240
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,750
Rest period over!

241
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,291
Notify all ships!

242
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,041
Order their individual
space-time bubbles to mobilize

243
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,791
on a course of 2-7-0!

244
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,875
Transmit the following
message to them:

245
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,375
Follow me!

246
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,916
I might get a bit more fun
bullying these weaklings around.

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,541
[KUFADIS] It's not exactly
my idea of fun...

248
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,250
[gasps] She couldn't...

249
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,916
They're a little bit
old fashioned

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,958
but there's something about
them, don't you think?

251
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,458
[KUFADIS]
She couldn't possibly say that!

252
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,541
So... Ya lousy pigs
and crawling mud turtles!

253
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,833
Prepare to meet your doom!

254
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,041
[CREW 1D] The Lashkau has
entered space-time fusion!

[CREW 1E] Ship 00!
Attack from the right side!

261
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,916
Let's turn the ship
around 180 degrees

262
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,208
and then prepare to fire
the anti-proton cannon!

263
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,208
Maneuver completed!
Fire the anti-proton cannon.

[ENEMY CREW screaming]

Enemy Three and Enemy Nine

are separating from their

[CAPTAIN 13A]
Don't let them get away!

There are more space-time
bubbles up ahead on the left!

come to help us out!

[SESKARSE]
Enemy Nine, destroyed!

271
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,291

Fire the electromagnetic cannon

00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,625
and do not stop.

273
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,000
[SANKAU OFFICER 1]
In addition to the Fourth Fleet,

274
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,666
all the other squadrons
are engaged in combat.

275
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,833
Our ships now outnumber
the enemy forces!

276
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,166
Now the outcome of
this battle is assured.

277
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,416
Could be.

278
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,250
It looks like the enemy
is planning a retreat

279
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,166
into the Wimpel region

280
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,416
What do you intend to do
once that has happened?

281
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,708
[DUSANYU] As soon as the enemy
has withdrawn into Wimpel,

282
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,125
we will seal it off using
front line ships.

283
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,791
Then, once we've
re-established control

284
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,916
of Aptic, Mystel, and Dalmav,

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,208
we'll move on and take Neopol
and Malskuty as well.

286
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,333
[KENESH] And you plan to cut off
any remaining enemy forces?

287
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,625
[DUSANYU] We'll let the
Fifth Fleet handle that.

288
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,541
Then we'll be free to
carry on with attacking

289
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,333
more enemy territories.

290
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,500
Understood, your Highness.

291
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,916
[DUSANYU]
Now that's resolved,

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,583
there's just one
problem remaining.

293
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,541
Huh? And what's that?

294
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,041
We still don't know which
of the brothers it was...

295
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:42,458
Was it Nereis that gave you such
heartache, or was it Nefee?

296
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,333
Which was it?!

297
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,916
Your Highness!

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,208
I don't know... Was it both of
them together, a double date?

299
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,625
Or could it be

300
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,500
that you don't actually know
which one it was at all.

301
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,250
[KENESH]
Your Highness...

302
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:59,583
I have devoted half my
life to the Star Forces.

303
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,250
I don't think there's
anybody who doubts

304
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,500
your loyalty and devotion,

305
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,833
but if there is, bring
them here to me.

306
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,541
I'd be perfectly happy to
convince them otherwise.

307
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,208
[KENESH]
I would also like to state

308
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,708
that I love and respect
the Imperial Family.

309
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,333
It gives me a great
deal of pleasure

310
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,000
to know you feel that way.

311
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,541
That being said, I hope you
will understand that it's

312
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,958
extremely difficult for
me to say this to you.

313
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,416
You who are the Commanding
Admiral of the Star Forces

314
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,458
and heir to the Imperial
throne, however...

315
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,500
Yes?

316
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,916
[KENESH growls]
Just shut up!

317
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,541
[JINTO] At last, it looks like I
can get someone to look after

318
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,791
Diaho in the Clyuve Palace.

319
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,875
I thought he was a
pretty friendly cat,

320
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,625
but he just seems to want to sit
around all day doing nothing.

321
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,041
[LAFIEL]
Oh, yeah.

322
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,333
I always wondered why you
and him got along so well.

323
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,041
Now I think I understand why...

324
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,250
[JINTO]
How dare you say that!

325
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,375
[ANNOUNCER 13A] The connection
process is now complete.

326
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,708
All passengers are requested
to board their ships.

327
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,166
[JINTO]
Okay, ready to go?

328
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,541
[LAFIEL] Yes. Now you have
made the arrangements

329
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,500
to send Diaho back
to the Capital?

330
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,083
[JINTO]
Of course!

331
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,458
But I figured Ekuryua would want
to say goodbye to him as well.

332
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,000
So I thought I could bring
Diaho on board just until

333
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,041
we've finished the
initial navigation period.

334
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,250
Then, I'll make sure he gets
where he needs to be.

335
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,750
Don't worry!

336
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,291
I'm not gonna forget about
him and leave him on the ship!

337
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,750
[LAFIEL] Well just make sure
you don't. Understood?

338
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,875
[JINTO]
Okay.

339
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,083
[JINTO]
The poor little guy...

340
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,541
He'll probably forget all
about me in no time.

341
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,750
[LAFIEL] I don't think we should
expect anyone to remember us

342
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,458
until the end of our days--
especially not a cat!

343
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,500
[JINTO]
Heh. Good advice.

344
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,875
You know, thinking about it,

345
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,958
in all the time we spent
together on the <i>Basroil,</i>

346
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,083
the only time we fought about
anything was to do with Diaho.

347
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,166
It's kinda weird to say this
when we're in the middle

348
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,791
of a war, but things sure
seem peaceful right now.

349
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,791
[LAFIEL] It's good that you're
feeling peaceful.

350
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,583
And by the way, we never
fought about Diaho.

351
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,875
I never heard you insisting we
should keep him on board.

352
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,166
[JINTO] I guess now that you
mention it, that's true!

353
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,458
I mean, I did think about
saying something,

354
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,208
but it didn't seem important
enough in the middle of a war.

355
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,166
[LAFIEL]
That's silly.

356
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,833
[JINTO] By the way, did you hear
the rumor about the new ships?

357
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,666
Heavy attack vessels.

358
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,875
[LAFIEL] I heard it was
light patrol ships.

359
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,625
[JINTO] Then I bet
it's neither of them!

360
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,583
Probably something
in between the two.

361
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,083
I wonder why they're
giving us ships

362
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,208
that are so awkward to maneuver.

363
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,666
[LAFIEL] Perhaps it's the attack
vessel that's awkward for them,

364
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,375
not the patrol ship.
Maybe they've decided

365
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,083
that they need to upgrade
the fleet for future battles.

366
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,583
[LAFIEL]
But I...

367
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,750
So that's what they've given
us for the new <i>Basroil</i> ?

368
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,250
It's exactly the same
as the last ship.

369
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:14,625
Of course. Why wouldn't
they give us the same?

370
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,291
Did you have some ulterior
motive in bringing this up?

371
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,916
[JINTO] Well, yeah... I thought
if the ship was big enough,

372
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,583
maybe I could keep the cat...

373
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,666
You fool.

374
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,958
[JINTO laughs]

375
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,875
[JINTO]
We lived on a well-known ship.

376
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,208
But it wasn't well-known

377
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,958
because it had been in a
famous battle or anything.

378
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:36,208
Its fame came from being home
to two members of royalty.

379
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,875
One of them was our Captain,
Deca-Commander Abriel.

380
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,041
She was a princess of
one of the royal families

381
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,666
of the Humankind Empire Abh.

382
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,583
[JINTO]
The other was me,

383
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,958
Count Jinto of the Lin
Syune Rock Hyde family.

384
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,625
I'm a nobleman.

385
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,958
However, this ship was the
only place I had to call home.

386
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,166
And, if truth be told,
it was the only place

387
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,958
where I felt like I
really belonged.

388
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,375
Welcome home.

389
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,291
It's good to see you, Captain.

390
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,166
Supply Officer Lin.

391
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,916
Please, Captain.
I would like to return this.

392
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,666
Why thank you.

393
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,125
[LAFIEL] This time I intend
to fight better for you.

394
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,708
You should know,
I'm counting on you.

395
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,583
If you're all ready,

396
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,333
let's prepare for
departure right away!

397
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,375
I'm the Empire's Deputy
Representative?

398
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,458
Are you sure?

399
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,083
It's an order straight
from the top.

400
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,083
So you don't have any choice.

401
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,083
[JINTO]
The Aptic Planetary System will

402
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,208
relinquish all rights of
sovereignty over territories

403
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,791
currently controlled
by the United Mankind.

404
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,875
From this day forward,

405
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,291
these territories will
become a part of

406
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,375
the Humankind Empire Abh, and
will be subject to its laws.

407
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,791
[LAFIEL] If the Empire has
made any demands...

408
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,625
[NEREIS]
Hmph. I hadn't realized that

409
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,125
all those famous people
were under my command.

410
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,666
[NEFEE] I know you're
bored by all of this,

411
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,166
but is there any chance

412
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,708
you might be able to tell me
the secret of how you manage

413
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,458
to be so ignorant about
your own fleet?!

414
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,583
[NEREIS] Wasn't that Count
Hyde the same young man

415
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,333
who conquered some
world or other with

416
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,666
Her Highness the
princess a while back?

417
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,083
What do you mean?

418
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,583
The story I heard was that
she successfully conquered

419
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,375
a whole planet armed
only with a laser gun.

420
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,750
I wonder, Nereis, if your
memory might be failing you

421
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,333
or if your source is feeding
you misinformation.

422
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,916
It hardly seems likely that
those stories are true.

423
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Does it really matter
if it's the truth or not?

424
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,041
I always find stories
far more interesting

425
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,916
if they've been created
out of thin air!

426
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,333
You could be right.

427
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,708
Although, I have to say
it's that kind of attitude

428
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,083
that drags our family's
reputation through the mud.

429
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,291
[LAFIEL] Do you swear that you
will not take any action

430
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,500
whatsoever to achieve
independence from the Empire?

431
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,000
No, I won't.

432
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,875
I might permit myself to dream
about it once in a while.

433
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,375
Or is that forbidden as well?

434
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,125
Depressurization complete.

435
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,000
Release the locks on the gates!

436
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,083
[ATOSURYUA]
So. I see you've been released

437
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,000
from your duties as the
Territorial Ambassador.

438
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,333
You know, it's a shame.

439
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,708
You're lucky, because you
can continue taking part

440
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,958
in the original
battle operations.

441
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,833
However, we have to complete
the initial navigation period

442
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,125
on our new ship before
we can join you.

443
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,541
Don't rush into it. The battles
will still be there for you

444
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,916
when you've finished.

445
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,791
I have no doubt there'll be
plenty of opportunities

446
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,875
for us to fight alongside
each other again.

447
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,250
And who knows, I might be
the one who's fighting

448
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,833
under your command by then!

449
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,208
Commander?

450
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,958
[ATOSURYUA] I wish you luck,
Deca-Commander Abriel.

451
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,666
And the next time we end
up fighting together...

452
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,500
Why don't you and I
share a bottle of wine.

453
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,166
It'll be my treat!

454
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,666
[SAMSON]
Gates are fully open!

455
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,333
[LAFIEL]
Request permission to depart.

456
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,458
Senior Aviator--
you care for a drink?

457
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,708
A little somethin' to celebrate
our survival, whaddya say?

458
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,958
That'd would be nice,
Line Wing Aviator!

459
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,583
But do try not to fall
asleep on me this time.

460
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,791
It was hard enough getting you
to sober up last time--

461
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,916
forcing that medicine down
your throat wasn't easy!

462
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Ha, I'll be fine, you'll see!

463
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,375
You brought the cat?

464
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,875
I'm not allowed to bring
him along with us this time.

465
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,041
So I thought you might
like to say goodbye.

466
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,291
I'm sure he'd like you
to play with him.

467
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,833
[EKURYUA]
Mm...

468
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,666
Uh. Well you see, some people
had expressed quite strongly

469
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,458
the view that having
a cat on board ship

470
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,541
wasn't really a good idea
in the first place.

471
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,166
I hope you're not implying that
I'm to blame me for this!

472
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,041
Oh, of course not!

473
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,208
Well, uh. No-- I...

474
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,416
Well, that is what
you said to me!

475
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,416
[JINTO]
I wonder who I am...

476
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,250
I'm still looking for
the answer to that one.

477
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,041
But now there's Lafiel...

478
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,250
Which means there's something
else I need to find.

479
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,708
After you rescued me,
you said to me that...

480
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,375
Well, I need to find the
right words to respond.

481
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,250
Hey, Lafiel... what's the rush?

482
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,666
The words will come
to me someday.

483
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,250
The right words
at the right time.

484
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,000
Until then, I'd like you
to stick around.

485
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,916
Just a little bit longer.

486
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,625
Then, maybe one day, I'll
find the answers I need.

487
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,916
All engines are
fully operational!

488
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,083
Living conditions on
board: operational!

489
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,416
We've been cleared for departure

490
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,166
from the Vobeirunei Naval
Station Control Room.

491
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,333
Preparations for departure
are complete.

492
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,875
Main engine! Start ignition!

493
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,083
Ignition... complete!

494
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,875
This is the new attack
vessel <i>Basroil</i> .

495
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,666
Daisiele!

496
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,708
[LAFIEL]
Are you all right, Jinto?

497
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,541
[JINTO] I was okay
before all this happened,

498
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,958
but I'm not sure anymore.
What do you think?

499
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,125
[LAFIEL]
Don't be such an idiot.

500
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,875
Would you'd have preferred
if I'd left you?

501
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,375
[JINTO]
Of course not.

502
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:02,916
If you hadn't come, I'd probably
be dead by now! Thank you.

503
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,791
[LAFIEL] What is it with you and
your fascination with vacuums?

504
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,041
[JINTO]
Gimme a break!

505
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,583
They don't mean anything to me.

506
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,250
Believe or not, Landers like me
have this odd preconception

507
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,250
that vacuums aren't
good for your health.

508
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,000
But it's probably just
an old wives' tale!

509
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,041
[LAFIEL]
You know...

510
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,000
Do you remember when you
said to me that you didn't think

511
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,291
anyone would feel sad or
miss you when you died,

512
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,958
and you'd be forgotten?

513
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,875
Yeah. I think so.

514
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,208
[LAFIEL, JINTO groan]

515
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,291
If you'd died back there...

516
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,666
I would have been sorry
that you'd gone.

517
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,416
Is that good enough for you?

518
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,916
[JINTO]
Huh?!

519
00:24:54,208 --> 00:25:00,416
