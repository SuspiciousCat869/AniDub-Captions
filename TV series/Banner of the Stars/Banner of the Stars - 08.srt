1
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,375
[JINTO]
We had been sent on a mission

2
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,208
to patrol the region
around the Wimpel Gate.

3
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,208
There we were searching
for any enemy

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,583
reconnaissance ships belonging
to the United Mankind.

5
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,750
However,

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,791
once the enemy had
arrived, we were forced

7
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,208
to retreat into Plane Space
and were trying

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,708
to get back to base
when we ran out of fuel.

9
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,125
But at the last minute,

10
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,958
we were saved by the intuition
of our Captain, Lafiel.

11
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,083
Those space-time
bubbles are our allies.

12
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,291
I'm sure of it.
We must continue to advance!

13
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,500
[JINTO]
Even though we had been plucked

14
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,333
from the jaws of death,
we didn't even get a chance

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,958
to catch our breath.

16
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,125
The next target for the forces
of the United Mankind,

17
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,125
which had attacked us
at the Wimpel Gate,

18
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,083
was gonna be right here.

19
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,166
In the Aptic region.

20
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,375
[DUSANYU] So the main
enemy forces have moved

21
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,000
into the Wimpel region?

22
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,375
[KENESH]
Yes. Reconnaissance ships

23
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,250
have confirmed the situation.

24
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,875
Well in that case, it seems

25
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,500
that Aptic is the
enemy's primary target.

26
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,833
[KENESH]
I expect so.

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,625
And do we know...
the strength of their fleet?

28
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,041
Approximately 170 squadrons
of assault ships,

29
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,625
give or take 15 contingents.

30
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,125
[DUSANYU]
Isn't that lower than expected?

31
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,375
[KENESH]
In terms of assault ships, yes,

32
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,416
but they appear to have more
patrol ships than we assumed.

33
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,625
[DUSANYU]
Hmm....

34
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,166
Perhaps they learned
their lesson

35
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,375
from the battle three years ago,
which ended in a draw.

36
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,416
[KENESH]
What lesson?

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,250
Do you mean it's better
tactically to build up a force

38
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,500
with more patrol ships
than attack vessels?

39
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,250
[DUSANYU] It's possible that's
what they may have decided.

40
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,000
There are even some factions

41
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,166
within our own ranks who
are demanding just that.

42
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,208
[KENESH] You're not
suggesting that the enemy

43
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:53,083
has learned their lesson from
that battle and we haven't?

44
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,333
[DUSANYU]
I don't know.

45
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,125
I'm not sure that
the enemy's decision

46
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,833
is necessarily correct.

47
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,250
But if they do have
a lot of patrol ships

48
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,458
it seems like a waste of
resources to fight them

49
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,625
with our attack vessels--as with
our previous interception

50
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,708
of their reconnaissance mission.

51
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,625
[KENESH] You make it sound
as though attack vessels

52
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,291
would be useless in
the upcoming battles.

53
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,500
[DUSANYU] If an enemy can
gather as many patrol ships

54
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,791
together as this one
appears to have done,

55
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,416
our attack vessels
may not be much use.

56
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,166
[KENESH] In which case,
we've been provided

57
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,958
with fighting resources that
are practically redundant.

58
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,875
[DUSANYU]
I suppose so...

59
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,958
[DUSANYU laughs] I don't think
we should register a complaint

60
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,833
until we return to
the Imperial Capital.

61
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,666
Until then, we'll
have to make do

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,750
with what we have
available to us.

63
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,958
[KENESH] But that severely
reduces our chance of victory.

64
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,416
[DUSANYU]
We knew that from the start.

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,041
We have to keep our
fingers crossed that

66
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,125
the Bebaus brothers do
their part of the job well.

67
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,208
How about moving some forces
in from the Mystel region?

68
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,000
There'll be no need to do that.

69
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,041
Even if Aptic is going to end up
being the main battlefield,

70
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,916
we shouldn't do anything to
loosen our hold on Mystel.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,916
I understand all of that,
but surely you--

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,208
Why are you so worried

73
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,875
about leaving Admiral
Bebaus to handle this?

74
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,458
I know their family can act
a little eccentric at times,

75
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,208
but you can always trust their
ability on the battlefield.

76
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,916
Certainly Nereis, anyway.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,166
Besides, he has an excellent
Chief of Staff to support him.

78
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,791
But that "excellent"
chief of staff

79
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,916
is also a part of
the Bebaus family!

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,666
[DUSANYU] Hm. It's becoming
apparent that you find it

81
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,125
difficult to trust our
admiral and his brother.

82
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,208
Did you have some sort of...
bad experience in the past

83
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,875
that caused you
to feel this way?

84
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,333
I don't want to answer
that question.

85
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,333
Very well, if you
insist, I understand.

86
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,166
You don't have an issue with
them personally, do you?

87
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,916
I've already said I don't want
to answer that question.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,458
You've made that obvious.

89
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,625
So tell me.

90
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,291
Is it the admiral
or the chief of staff

91
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,083
that you have a problem with?

92
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,416
[KENESH]
I've told you...

93
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,708
...I don't want to
talk about it!

94
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,000
So let's just change
the subject!

95
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,125
Very well, as you wish.

96
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,708
Anyway...

97
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,875
...I'll be in my room.

98
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,166
This is something
I need to spend

99
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,166
some time thinking about.

100
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,583
Call me if anything comes up.

101
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,208
Your Excellency,
what did you mean

102
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,458
when you said you've
got to think about it?

103
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,625
I'm not going to tell you!

104
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,666
We're running out of coolant
for the propellants?

105
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,750
[OFFICER 8A] Yes, sir.
We have less than 70%

106
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,375
of what is
considered sufficient.

107
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,791
That's not even
enough for our fleet

108
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,958
to undertake a battle
in regular space.

109
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,833
[NEREIS]
I see.

110
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,916
Of course, we do
have lots of water

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,833
that can be used in
place of a coolant.

112
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,666
Where is it?

113
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,958
Right over there!

114
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,333
[NEREIS] Contact the government
there, and start organiz--

115
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,541
[NEFEE]
We can't.

116
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,791
What do you mean
"we can't"? Why not?

117
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,208
Because the government of

118
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,041
the Aptic Planetary System
still hasn't surrendered.

119
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,583
Therefore, the planet
we see ahead

120
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,500
still belongs to the enemy.

121
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,833
At least, that's
the official position.

122
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,291
They still haven't surrendered?

123
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,250
Yes, that's correct.

124
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,875
[NEREIS]
I find that rather surprising.

125
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,958
[NEFEE] What I find surprising
is that you didn't

126
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,958
already know that, Nereis.

127
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,041
After all, you are
the supreme commander

128
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,041
of the defense fleet
in this region.

129
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,458
[NEREIS]
Well, yes.

130
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,125
But what I also didn't realize
was how the government

131
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,083
of those Landers would affect
the outcome of our battle.

132
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,458
Hold on a minute.

133
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,541
If they haven't surrendered,
what are we defending?

134
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,416
Surely we're not defending
the planet from their own side?

135
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,541
I always said you had a severe
lack of common sense...

136
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,083
What we're defending
is the Aptic Gate.

137
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,833
It's obvious, isn't it?

138
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,833
Of course I knew that!

139
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,166
So if they haven't surrendered,

140
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,041
and we acquired water
from their planet,

141
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,041
we'd effectively be pillaging.

142
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,041
Pillaging...

143
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,958
I wonder how long
it's been since

144
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,583
anyone in the Star Forces
did some of that?

145
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,958
You're not seriously
thinking of it, are you?

146
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,500
[NEREIS]
Why not?

147
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,375
Don't you think it's got a bit
of an artistic flair to it?

148
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,875
[NEFEE]
No, I don't.

149
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,541
[NEREIS] It would also solve
a very real problem for us.

150
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,875
We're running out of coolant.
If we want to win,

151
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,500
we're going to need
water from somewhere.

152
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,000
You do have a point there.

153
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,375
The most important
thing is that we win.

154
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,958
[NEREIS] There you are then!
We should go pillage!

155
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,416
All right--the end
justifies the means!

156
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,083
Let's go get some water!

157
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,708
And how are we gonna do that?

158
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,708
[NEREIS, NEFEE]
Hm?

159
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,625
To reach the ocean on Aptic III

160
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,166
we'd have to enter
the atmosphere.

161
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,208
Which is no mean feat!

162
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,125
It'd be easier to
contact headquarters

163
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,125
and get supplies of
water transported here

164
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,250
through Plane Space.

165
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,750
[NEREIS] But if we did that,
we'd run out again in no time!

166
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,458
[OFFICER 8B] We'd run out if it
came from the planet, too.

167
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,791
[OFFICER 8A]
I think she's right.

168
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,666
I'm happy to calculate
how much coolant

169
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,125
we can get from the planet
versus receiving supplies

170
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,375
direct from headquarters,

171
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,083
if that would help you
decide what to do.

172
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,875
[NEREIS]
No need to go to that trouble.

173
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,916
Must we go below
the planet's atmosphere

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,208
to do this? There's no other
way to get their water?

175
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,125
For instance,
couldn't we collect it

176
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,166
from the air instead
of the ocean?

177
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,916
[OFFICER 8A] Our fleet
doesn't have the equipment

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,875
that's needed to undertake
such an operation.

179
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,250
In time, we might be able

180
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,958
to make some progress
with the materials

181
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,666
we already have on board,
but I think it's unlikely

182
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,083
we'd succeed in time
for the battle.

183
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,250
How long do you think
you need to do this?

184
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,250
Approximately one year.

185
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,958
All right, that's too long.

186
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,791
We'll just have
to manage without.

187
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,958
I should've guessed that
there'd be a good reason

188
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,666
why the Star Forces
didn't go around

189
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,500
pillaging planets nowadays.

190
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,291
It's just not worth the effort!

191
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,750
It's a bit of a shame, isn't it?

192
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,166
Something that's right
in front of our noses

193
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,708
and we can't reach it.

194
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,250
[NEFEE]
Hm?

195
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,833
Such an experience isn't
entirely unfamiliar to you.

196
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,041
[laughs]

197
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,666
Not as much as it is to you.

198
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,333
Sometimes, you don't know
what's in front of you

199
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,416
unless you reach for it.

200
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,625
[NEREIS]
Anyway...

201
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,125
Back to the conference
on the battle plan!

202
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,250
I'd like to present
you with my thoughts.

203
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,416
And would value your feedback.

204
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,958
[NEREIS] These are the
mobile space-time mines.

205
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,250
We will remove them from
the battleships in advance

206
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,000
and set their targets.

207
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,375
Of course, we'll do the
same for the backup mines

208
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,500
carried by the transport ships.

209
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,875
Here we see the placement
of the attack ships

210
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,458
and the guard ships.

211
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,125
Additionally, we will
have patrol ships

212
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,458
in the outer regions.

213
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,375
We plan to position
the flagship here.

214
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,291
And these are the
front-line ships.

215
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,250
[NEFEE]
Considering this is your idea,

216
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,208
it's a fairly
impressive formation.

217
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,708
Simple but effective.

218
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,583
Thank you, Brother.

219
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,458
Now I'd like to explain
the battle process.

220
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,000
Just before the enemy
enters regular space,

221
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,208
we'll send all our mines
into Plane Space.

222
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,125
After placing and detonating
all their mines,

223
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,000
the front-line battle
ships would normally

224
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,125
have served their purpose
and would therefore retreat.

225
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,791
However, since we
have a limited supply

226
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,791
of coolant, we can leave these
ships in their positions

227
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,416
and re-assign them
as supply ships.

228
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,125
The rest is up to
the attack ships

229
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,458
and the patrol ships.

230
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,083
As soon as the enemy appears,

231
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,375
we'll strike them with
an all-out attack.

232
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,333
We just need to
make sure they never

233
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:29,125
enter regular space. That is
my strategy for the battle.

234
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,291
I think this is the
most logical approach

235
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,208
and the one that will cause
the least number of casualties.

236
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,208
The main fleet will arrive here
within 72 hours at the most.

237
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,875
We have to hold out until then.

238
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,541
Anyone have any questions?

239
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,125
I don't think so.

240
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,541
You know, this is
a very simple plan

241
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,166
and I think it might work.

242
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,708
Yes! It's excellent!

243
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,666
No sign of the usual Bebaus
Spectacular Insanity! [gasps]

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,250
[NEFEE] I can work out
all the details myself.

245
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,291
You carry on and do
whatever it is you do

246
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,125
as the commanding admiral.

247
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,583
You're saying I'm in your way?

248
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,916
Well, yes.

249
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,250
I have to admit you did
come up with a good plan.

250
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,333
We don't want you doing
anything to spoil it now,

251
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,208
so you might as well go
and do your paperwork.

252
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,416
[NEREIS growls]

253
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,083
What a feeble excuse
to get me out the way.

254
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,458
Sometimes I wonder

255
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,583
why I ever became a
commander in the first place.

256
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,083
I hate this thing.

257
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:24,041
You're not really the type
to be a chief of staff, Nereis.

258
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,291
[NEREIS]
The same goes for you, Nefee.

259
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,833
The only difference
between you and me

260
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,083
is that your personality
is not suited to being

261
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,291
a chief of staff
or a commander.

262
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,500
[NEREIS]
Hmph.

263
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,750
[BEIKAL]
Hello, Your Highness.

264
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,458
[LAFIEL]
I'm just your unit commander,

265
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,666
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop calling me

266
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,750
"Your Highness."

267
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,083
[BEIKAL]
But why?

268
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,541
Knights such as myself
don't often get the chance

269
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,833
to speak directly with
royalty. It's an honor.

270
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,916
In that case, do as you wish.

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,166
Things were pretty rough
for you the other day.

272
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,458
[LAFIEL] It's amazing that
we made it back alive.

273
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,041
We were very lucky.

274
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,416
[BEIKAL] On the contrary,
I heard it was all due

275
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
to your outstanding
performance.

276
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,708
Your reputation proceeds you.

277
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,708
You're just as good as I am.

278
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,458
With all the experience
you've had,

279
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm sure no one has any
doubt about your abilities.

280
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,500
Well, I suppose you
could be right.

281
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,000
[LAFIEL]
Come on now, or you'll be late.

282
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,583
Yeah!

283
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,083
Getting an invitation from
an Imperial princess!

284
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,750
This is a once in
a lifetime experience!

285
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,583
Steady, boy--that's not a mouse!

286
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,083
You know, whenever I bring
Diaho up to the bridge with me,

287
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,416
Samson gets kind of
annoyed about it.

288
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,750
Have you got any
idea why that is?

289
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,083
He says he doesn't want any cat
hairs getting in the equipment.

290
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,791
Convenient excuse.

291
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,083
Human hairs are just as bad.

292
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,083
The machines have been
designed to withstand

293
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,416
that sort of thing.

294
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,791
[JINTO]
I know.

295
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,208
But I think there's more
to it than that for Samson.

296
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,000
He takes pride in looking
after the equipment.

297
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,375
He feels responsible
and his pride means

298
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,250
that he doesn't want
anything around that might

299
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,875
potentially damage
the machinery.

300
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,958
Samson's pride or my enjoyment.

301
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,500
It's obvious which one's
more important to you.

302
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,458
In that case, why don't
you talk to him?

303
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,791
Try and persuade him that Diaho
should be allowed up here.

304
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,125
Sure, if he asks me.

305
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,250
[sighs]

306
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,125
[EKURYUA]
Jinto...

307
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:26,958
Huh?

308
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,291
How old is Diaho?

309
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,875
Umm... Uh...

310
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,666
I think he's four years old.

311
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,708
I see.

312
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,458
And can you tell me
how old you are?

313
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,458
I was 16 when I got him,
so that makes me 20.

314
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,458
Is there anything else?

315
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,791
What does it feel like
for you to get old?

316
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,458
[laughs]

317
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,666
[JINTO] The Abh sure don't
beat around the bush!

318
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,750
Couldn't tell you--
I'm still young!

319
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,875
Humans don't start to
show any signs of aging

320
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,541
until we're a lot older!

321
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,791
Oh, okay.

322
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,916
I'll just ask the Line
Wing Aviator instead.

323
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

324
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,375
I'm not sure he'd take
it such good spirits--

325
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,000
he can be a little sensitive
about stuff like that!

326
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,500
[SOBAASH]
You're having a drink?

327
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,500
Hey there, Senior Aviator!

328
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,375
I'm not gonna be
able to have a drink

329
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,291
for quite a while.
So I thought I'd stock up!

330
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,666
[SOBAASH]
That's gotta be bad for you.

331
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,958
So, are you gonna
offer me one or not?

332
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,750
Huh? But you just said
it was bad for ya!

333
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,833
Do you have a problem with that?

334
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,416
Sometimes the bad things
in life are the most fun.

335
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,416
Ha, ha. I'll have
to remember that!

336
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,750
Thanks. Fill her up.

337
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,041
So I heard that purebred
Abhs can't get drunk

338
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,125
no matter how much
they drink. Is that true?

339
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,958
It does affect us a little bit.

340
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,500
But we can't get
completely drunk--

341
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,166
it's just not
possible genetically.

342
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,500
Now, if we were to inject
the alcohol straight

343
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,333
into our bloodstream,
that'd be a different story.

344
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,125
Here's to genetic engineering!

345
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,416
You know, if I wasn't
able to get drunk,

346
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,041
it would be like a curse.

347
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,958
Sometimes you want
to forget things.

348
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,000
Sometimes you need to forget.

349
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,916
[SOBAASH] When we feel
like that we take a pill

350
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,666
which helps us to sleep.

351
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,166
[SAMSON]
Well, I guess that's healthier.

352
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,041
[SOBAASH]
The Abh are a healthy race.

353
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,750
[SAMSON]
That's not what most of humanity

354
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,541
thinks about you.

355
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,666
[SOBAASH] We can't always live
up to their expectations.

356
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,000
An Abh who's worried about

357
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,875
what other people
think of them?!

358
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,125
I've never heard
of such a thing!

359
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,958
To tell you the truth,
I don't really care

360
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,083
what other people think.
But on the other hand,

361
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,125
we're not going to
deny what they say.

362
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,666
Incidentally, I don't
think I've ever seen you

363
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,166
be this open with me.

364
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,416
That might be because
the Senior Aviator

365
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,916
hasn't ever seen
me when I'm drunk.

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,583
[laughs] I'm positive
I've seen you drunk before.

367
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,875
It's possible you've
seen me drinkin'.

368
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,583
But never drunk.

369
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,875
Is that so?

370
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,833
And I'm meant to believe
you're drunk now?

371
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,208
[SAMSON] Heh. Well, this is my
second bottle, after all.

372
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,583
Do you regularly drink
as much as this?

373
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,125
[SAMSON]
No, no, no!

374
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,541
This is a luxury I allow myself
maybe once or twice a year.

375
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,458
Normally, I just get
a little bit tipsy.

376
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,458
Then why allow yourself
the luxury today?

377
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,166
What's going on?

378
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,458
[SAMSON]
Hm...

379
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,541
Very soon, we are
going to be attacked

380
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,541
by an enemy ten
times our size.

381
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,125
That sort of event doesn't
tend to happen very often

382
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,375
in your lifetime.

383
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,666
Well, yes.

384
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,625
If it was something
that happened often,

385
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,500
then there probably wouldn't
be much of a lifetime

386
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,791
left to live.

387
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,458
[SAMSON]
Exactly.

388
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,958
Tell you what--
once we get through

389
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,833
this next battle, I'll buy you
a bottle of your favorite booze.

390
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,083
Huh? That's generous of you.

391
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,833
But I did hear that
the senior aviator

392
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,666
was wealthy, so I'll
accept your offer!

393
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,083
I have to say,
that rumor's a bit

394
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,416
of an exaggeration!

395
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,208
But I think I can
afford a few drinks!

396
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,375
[SAMSON]
Hm.

397
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,541
I've never been so happy
to pour my alcohol

398
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,541
into someone else's glass!

399
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,875
[ATOSURYUA]
There are no reinforcements.

400
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,541
But that was to be expected.

401
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,416
This is our position here.

402
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,916
Our mission here
is straightforward.

403
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,416
We are charged with the task
of destroying the enemy.

404
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,250
It's as simple as that.

405
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,625
[BEIKAL]
Yes, it sounds simple enough.

406
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,250
But how long do we envision
the battle lasting?

407
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,291
We haven't got the resources
to keep attacking

408
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,333
every enemy ship that
shows up in our region

409
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,916
of the battlefield.

410
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,875
A maximum of 72 hours.

411
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,083
That's what the
defensive command

412
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,875
has warned us to expect.

413
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,291
Of course nothing's certain
about this, but we'll just

414
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,125
have to take their word for it.

415
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,208
I'm afraid I can't provide
any more information.

416
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,875
After all, I'm merely
an Assault Unit Commander.

417
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,125
Any other questions?

418
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,000
[gasps]

419
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,625
[ATOSURYUA]
Very well.

420
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,041
We will have lost this
battle if we let the enemy

421
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,375
enter through the gate.

422
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,958
Therefore, we must defend it

423
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,458
without concern for
the loss of life.

424
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,583
You may consider
this to be reckless.

425
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,458
To be honest, it is reckless
and I have to admit,

426
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,833
I am concerned about you all.

427
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,333
Some of you may eventually
go on to become admirals

428
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,875
and take command of a fleet.

429
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,541
If that ever happens to you,
I want you to never forget

430
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,208
what you feel like
right here and now.

431
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,208
I get the impression
you don't aspire

432
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,875
to become an admiral
of the fleet.

433
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,208
Am I right, Commander?

434
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,416
Me? No way!

435
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,958
To be perfectly honest
with you, Captain,

436
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,291
just being in charge of a unit

437
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,166
in a desolate part of
the universe like this

438
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,375
is stressful enough.

439
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,041
No, I don't want to
command a whole fleet.

440
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,708
The difference
between royalty

441
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,833
and nobility like myself is
that we can be selfish.

442
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,333
Another difference...

443
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,666
...is that for royalty, the
territories are nothing more

444
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,875
than an amusement
to pass the time.

445
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,375
However...

446
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,500
...for us in the nobility,
the territories are our life.

447
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,458
[LAFIEL] I can't be sure,
but I think she was aiming

448
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,208
that comment specifically at me.

449
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,458
[SAMSON]
Time to change the subject.

450
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,208
So, my senior aviator friend,

451
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,083
what do you think
of the captain?

452
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,416
[SOBAASH]
What do you mean?

453
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,041
[SAMSON] Well it seems
strange. You know...

454
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,208
I mean, she's the captain
and she's only 19!

455
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,041
[SOBAASH] I don't think that's
too young to be the captain

456
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,291
of an attack ship.

457
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,166
One of the most important
qualities you need

458
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,875
is sharp reflexes, which are
better when you're young.

459
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,666
[SAMSON] No, no, no.
I haven't got any doubts

460
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,375
about her abilities.
It's just that...

461
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,041
Well, I've been workin'
for the Star Forces

462
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,958
for 20 years now!

463
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,666
Makes you think, doesn't it?

464
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,083
When I started to
work for these guys,

465
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,583
the captain hadn't
even been born yet!

466
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,833
[SOBAASH]
I'm sorry, but you've lost me.

467
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,916
I can't figure out what
your problem is here.

468
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,041
[SAMSON]
What?

469
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,958
I don't know.
It's the drink talkin'.

470
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,291
If you really want my
opinion on the captain,

471
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,333
I have a theory you
might be interested in.

472
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,583
[SAMSON]
Oh?

473
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,208
[SOBAASH] Frankly, I'm
a little disappointed.

474
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,916
You must know there
are a lot of stories

475
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,666
about the Abriel family.

476
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,125
Given those, I'd say
the captain's personality

477
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,083
is a bit too calm.

478
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,125
[SAMSON coughs]
You seriously think she's calm?!

479
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,916
[SOBAASH] Far more than
I thought she would be.

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,958
Maybe she's having a hard
time settling down,

481
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,500
feels a bit out of place.

482
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,500
And I expect she's
finding it difficult

483
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,375
to get used to her superiors
ordering her around,

484
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,416
given her privileged
background as a member

485
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,750
of the royal family with
everyone waiting on her

486
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,666
hand and foot the whole time.

487
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,541
Feels a bit out of place here.

488
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,875
I remember some kid

489
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,583
sayin' something
along those lines.

490
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,375
[SAMSON laughs] Hey!
Maybe that's my problem, too!

491
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,333
I'm just feelin' out of place.

492
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,541
When I was a regular
crew member

493
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,458
everyone around me
was ordinary

494
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,833
and regular like me:
old, young, men, women,

495
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,333
all types of people.

496
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,583
But up there on the bridge,

497
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,375
all I see is young Abhs
like you all the time.

498
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,375
I mean, you're
actually older than me

499
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,458
but you still look
like a young lad--

500
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:39,000
Sorry, I meant to say lass--
just a slip of the tongue!

501
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,041
Well, I guess...

502
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,583
...there is another
Lander around.

503
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,041
He's a nice kid.

504
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,166
But he's no more than a boy
and even he's a nobleman.

505
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,375
It's just like...

506
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:55,583
[SAMSON speaking Baronh]

507
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,250
[SAMSON]
Sorry...

508
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,583
[SOBAASH laughs] That's okay.
It doesn't bother me.

509
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:24,666
However, I don't think
I can say much in reply.

510
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,416
[ATOSURYUA] We've only
drunk half the bottle.

511
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,625
I intend to save the other
half until after the battle.

512
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,666
Unless all five of you
are here to enjoy it.

513
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,708
No one will drink it.

514
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,708
Here's to your safe
return! A toast!

515
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,166
There's a lot to do before
the battle commences.

516
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,750
The ceremony's over. Dismissed!

517
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,500
Line Wing Aviator...?

518
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,166
If you're going to go to sleep,

519
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,583
you should really sleep
in your own room.

520
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,833
[CREW 9A]
Close the hatches!

521
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,208
[CREW 9B]
Hatches closed!

522
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,041
[CREW 9A] Prepare to dismantle
pathway connectors

523
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,125
and store them!

524
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,708
[CREW 9B]
Preparations complete!

525
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,875
[CREW 9A]

526
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,041
[CREW 9C]

527
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,750
[CREW 9A]

528
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,250
[CREW 9C]
Connectors dismantling!

529
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,041
[CREW 9D]
All ships fully operational.

530
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,166
[CREW 9B] Preparations
for departure complete!

531
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,333
[CREW 9C] The Stabilization
Control Device is ready.

532
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,041
[CREW 9A]
Turn on the main engine!

533
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,625
[COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER 9A]
I repeat. The enemy fleet

534
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,041
will enter combat
range within six hours.

535
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,000
Prepare for departure.

536
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,958
[LAFIEL]
Daisiele!
