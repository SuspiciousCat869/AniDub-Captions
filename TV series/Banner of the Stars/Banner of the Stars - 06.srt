1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,583
[JINTO]
A dinner invitation? But why?

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,166
[ATOSURYUA] I simply
wanted to spend some time

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,625
with you and Captain Abriel.

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,583
Look, haven't you got it yet?

5
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,375
[JINTO] I don't suppose
this has anything to do

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,625
with the death of
your brother, has it?

7
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,333
[ATOSURYUA]
Yes, sort of.

8
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,666
You see, tomorrow would
have been the day

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,375
of my brother's birthday
if he'd still been alive.

10
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:41,041
Obviously, he can't be here
to celebrate with us,

11
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,583
but I wanted to have
a party with people

12
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,750
who had some
connection with him.

13
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,083
That's kind.

14
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,333
But I'm not sure--

15
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,541
we weren't exactly friends
with your brother.

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,750
You know?

17
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,250
Look, I understand your concerns

18
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,708
about the situation, but it
really doesn't matter to me.

19
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,250
You see, there's
only three people

20
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,000
who knew my brother
in this star system.

21
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,208
You two and me.

22
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,875
I hope you're not
suggesting I celebrate

23
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,375
his birthday all by myself?

24
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,291
No, I wasn't saying that.

25
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,625
[ATOSURYUA]
All right, then!

26
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,666
Now I've got a favor to ask you.

27
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,166
[JINTO]
Huh?

28
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,625
I was hoping you might be able
to invite Captain Abriel--

29
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,875
no, use her formal title
of Viscountess Paryunu.

30
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,291
Will that be acceptable for you?

31
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,833
Of course, I realize
that etiquette

32
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,375
would normally dictate
that I should invite

33
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,416
my guests personally, but this
isn't a regular situation.

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,791
I mean, it's got the potential
to be rather awkward...

35
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,208
[JINTO]
Let's see...

36
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,250
If Lafiel doesn't
accept the invitation,

37
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,041
I won't have to go either.

38
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,333
All right, I'll do it.
I'll ask her for you.

39
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,666
Great! Thank you!

40
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,583
Of course, if the princess
doesn't want to come,

41
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,833
you'll still be there,
won't you?

42
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:40,916
Huh?

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
If you were to
refuse my invitation,

44
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,875
I'd be very disappointed, not
to mention a bit embarrassed.

45
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh! Of course--
I'll be there tomorrow!

46
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,541
Make sure you remember
to tell her that

47
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,541
this is a personal invitation
and nothing formal, got it?

48
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,625
Okay! I'll be counting on you!

49
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,833
Uh...

50
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,375
[JINTO] When I thought
about it, I realized

51
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,500
I'd never actually met
her brother Klowal,

52
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,916
the Baron Febdash.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,208
[sighs]

54
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,875
[JINTO] But by then,
the transmission was over

55
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,833
and it was too late.

56
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,666
Are you sure Commander
Atosuryua said that?

57
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,875
[JINTO] Yeah, but I'm not
really sure I wanna go.

58
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,583
[LAFIEL]
Why not?

59
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,625
Huh?

60
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,291
Well, I'm accepting
the invitation.

61
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,208
You will be coming,
too, won't you?

62
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,958
But it's a dinner to
celebrate the birthday

63
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,458
of her brother the Baron!

64
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,250
[LAFIEL]
The late Baron--remember?

65
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,833
[JINTO]
Yeah, right...

66
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,791
I don't understand.

67
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,583
Why would you wanna help
celebrate the birthday

68
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,666
of someone you killed?

69
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,333
It doesn't make sense to me.

70
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,666
Unless you're feeling guilty.

71
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,375
Could that be the reason?

72
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,625
[LAFIEL]
Hm.

73
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,375
So what is it then?

74
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,958
Being able to
celebrate the birthday

75
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,458
of someone who has already died
can have a special significance.

76
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,833
You mean, like a funeral?

77
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,541
[LAFIEL]
It's not quite the same.

78
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,666
What happens if no one
remembers you after you die?

79
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,166
Wouldn't you find it
hard if you knew

80
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,708
no one was upset that
you'd passed away?

81
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,750
Don't you think that's kind
of sad, not being remembered?

82
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,791
[JINTO]
I guess so...

83
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,625
[LAFIEL]
So, while we're still alive,

84
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,416
I think it's good
to have an opportunity

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,375
to remember those who have died.

86
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,875
That way, maybe when
it's our turn to go,

87
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,750
someone might return the
favor and remember us.

88
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,000
I see. That's what
you're worried about.

89
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,166
Well...

90
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,083
I could be wrong,
but I doubt anyone'll

91
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,333
feel sad or miss me
much when I go.

92
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,166
I'll be forgotten
very soon after I die.

93
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,875
[growls]

94
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,041
[LAFIEL] I want you to look
after the ship for a while.

95
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,541
I'll try and be back
as soon as possible.

96
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,083
[EKURYUA]
Yes. If anything comes up,

97
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,958
I'll be sure to contact you.

98
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,041
[DIAHO meows]

99
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,250
Diaho?!

100
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,083
Hey, Diaho!

101
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,666
[EKURYUA] He doesn't seem
to want to leave my side.

102
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,958
I guess I don't need
to worry about him

103
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,333
missing me while I'm gone!

104
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,458
Looks like he'll be quite happy!

105
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,833
You will take care
of Diaho, won't you?

106
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,791
And if anything should
happen to him...

107
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,708
I'll get ahold
of you right away?

108
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,416
Do what you have
to do, understood?

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,708
Uh, yeah...
I'll leave it to you.

110
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,333
[SAMSON] We're gonna
treat Diaho real well

111
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,916
while you're gone.
You go enjoy yourselves!

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,875
This isn't really that
sort of occasion, you know!

113
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,541
All right, time to go.

114
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,750
Prepare for departure
Supply Officer Lin.

115
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,041
Okay. Everything's
ready over here.

116
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,250
[EKURYUA]
Disconnecting the Calike now!

117
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,541
[JINTO] I didn't know
there were expensive

118
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,250
restaurants in Dakul!

119
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,833
[LAFIEL]
Of course there are.

120
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,875
Didn't you have places like
that back on your home planet?

121
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,208
[JINTO]
Uh...

122
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,833
Well, yes, but I was little,
so I don't remember

123
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,958
much about any
fancy restaurants.

124
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,958
But I don't think we had
anything quite like the ones

125
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,000
you have here in space.

126
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,833
It's strange, but even the fact

127
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,666
you have things like
restaurants up here sometimes

128
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,916
makes a Lander like
me feel homesick.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,250
Sometimes I miss being on land.

130
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,041
So that's what's wrong with you!

131
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,166
You felt the same
when you were on land.

132
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,833
I mean, remember the time
we landed in Sufugnoff?

133
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,500
You felt homesick
for space, didn't you?

134
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,875
[LAFIEL] Yes, I did.
But that was different!

135
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,125
The whole situation
was ridiculous!

136
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:59,083
You can't compare a
dinner party with that!

137
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,166
[JINTO chuckles]

138
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,708
What are you laughing at?
What's so funny?

139
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,166
That disguise of yours
was pretty ridiculous!

140
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,666
Everything was ridiculous!

141
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,916
Everything from the
destruction of the <i>Gosroth</i> ;

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,125
from being stopped
by Baron Febdash;

143
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,833
from the fact that our arrival
at Sufugnoff was delayed

144
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,125
and our allies got
attacked as a result.

145
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,083
Not to mention our
emergency landing

146
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,166
on the surface of the planet!

147
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,166
Yeah... I guess
it was ridiculous.

148
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,291
Huh? But apart from that...

149
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,416
Possibly the worst thing
was you forcing me

150
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,708
to dye my hair black!

151
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,833
[JINTO]
We didn't have a choice!

152
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,333
We had to go in disguise!

153
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,500
We couldn't afford to let the
enemy find us down there.

154
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,708
No need to be defensive--

155
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,583
I wasn't accusing
you of anything.

156
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,041
Unless you were deliberately
trying to annoy me.

157
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,625
[JINTO]
Of course not!

158
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,791
[LAFIEL]
I guess you're right...

159
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,666
I suppose I was feeling
a little bit homesick.

160
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,041
All I really wanted was
to go back into space.

161
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,375
Lafiel, is everything okay?

162
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,958
Don't make me out to be a fool.

163
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,041
Of course I'm okay!

164
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,291
Ya know something?

165
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,583
I was pretty scared
with everything

166
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,333
going on in that situation.

167
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,750
I don't know if I'd
have made it through

168
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,958
if I'd been alone.

169
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:20,916
Huh?

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,583
[JINTO]
What about you?

171
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,583
--[LAFIEL] Look, Jinto...
--[JINTO] Hm?

172
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,958
I'm pretty sure
we're almost there.

173
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,125
[RESTAURANT STAFF 6A]
Welcome to Mitsugoiwa.

174
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,125
Would all customers please
identify themselves?

175
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,541
[LAFIEL]
This is First Princess

176
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,000
Abriel Nei Dubrusk
Paryunu Lafiel.

177
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,500
And she's accompanied by
Count Jinto Lin Syune Rock Hyde.

178
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,791
[LAFIEL]
There should be a reservation

179
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,083
under the name of
Unit Commander Atosuryua.

180
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,875
[RESTAURANT STAFF 6A]
Thank you, that is confirmed.

181
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,041
Please proceed to number 16.

182
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,083
Wow! This is impressive!

183
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,416
There's even a separate
entrance for Calikes!

184
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,125
[LAFIEL]
When needed, they even have

185
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,166
the security facilities
to allow the heads

186
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,208
of planetary nations
to eat together here.

187
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,958
[JINTO] This must be a pretty
high-class restaurant--

188
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,500
people opening doors
for us and everything!

189
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,041
The commander obviously shares

190
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,750
the same tastes
as her late brother.

191
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,041
[JINTO]
Yeah...

192
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,166
[LAFIEL] Actually I think
the commander has

193
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,833
much better taste than
that of the Baron.

194
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,416
I, er... Yeah, well...
Certainly looks like it!

195
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,166
Excuse me.

196
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,708
Her Highness the First
Princess Abriel has arrived

197
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,083
escorted by His
Excellency Count Hyde.

198
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,833
It was good of you
both to come here

199
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,708
to honor the memory
of my late brother.

200
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,666
I would like to
express sincere thanks

201
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,500
on his behalf. Your
Highness, Excellency.

202
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,541
The pleasure is ours, Baroness.

203
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,833
Thank you for inviting us.

204
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,541
Yes, thank you, ma'am.

205
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,750
I want us all to feel
completely relaxed

206
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,750
and comfortable in
each other's company.

207
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,166
So I have a suggestion to help
dispense with the formality.

208
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,250
You forget all about
my rank as commander

209
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,041
and I'll try and do the
same for you as royalty.

210
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,375
I've taken the liberty of
ordering the food already--

211
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,416
I hope you don't mind.

212
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,750
Let's have a toast!

213
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,333
To my brother!

214
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,208
We never recovered
my brother's body--

215
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,375
it's still inside his ship,

216
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,833
heading toward the
center of the galaxy.

217
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,291
[ATOSURYUA] Even if we
had retrieved the body,

218
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,333
we'd have sent it out
into space anyway,

219
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,875
so there's not really
any difference.

220
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,291
[ATOSURYUA] However, when we
read my brother's will,

221
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,416
it stated that he wanted
his body to be sent

222
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,666
outside the galaxy.

223
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,416
Still, I guess he
won't mind too much

224
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,708
since he's not around anymore.

225
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,333
That's a shame.
I'm sorry to hear it.

226
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,833
Oh, it's all right,
Your Highness.

227
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,833
My brother chose the
path he wanted to take

228
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,541
and that's what he's on now.

229
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,375
Besides, that ship of
his is pretty nice--

230
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,500
it's called
<i>The Lady of Febdash</i> .

231
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,458
I don't think we could have
found a more expensive coffin!

232
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,250
You know, it's funny,
but I never really

233
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,083
liked the name he
chose for the ship.

234
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,958
At first, I thought
he'd named it after me,

235
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,458
but he assured me he hadn't.

236
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,541
He was quite adamant about it!

237
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,125
But who else could
he have named it after

238
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,541
if it wasn't you?

239
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,791
Who knows?

240
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,958
Maybe it was a
secret lover of his.

241
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,583
But I don't think he
was so into flying

242
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,458
that he would name his
ship after a lover.

243
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,541
Maybe he thought
that one of things

244
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,958
you had to do when
you became an Abh

245
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,291
was to love flying more
than anything else.

246
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,875
Perhaps he was just
trying to fit in.

247
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,625
[ATOSURYUA sighs]
My poor brother...

248
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,166
The pressure to
conform as an Abh

249
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,041
was getting to him.

250
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,000
[JINTO]
Hm. I see...

251
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,083
When you think about it,

252
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,083
it is difficult fitting
into a new race.

253
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,291
It's a bit like...

254
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,500
[JINTO] You don't have
to explain it to me.

255
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,500
I know just how you feel!

256
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,833
I'm a Lander by birth and
was only given the status

257
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,625
of an Abh later on in life.

258
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,750
Your father was the same,
wasn't he, Commander?

259
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,583
He was a Lander who was
granted the status

260
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,583
of an Abh nobleman, but as his
genetically altered offspring,

261
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,416
you are a first generation Abh.

262
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,875
Whereas the captain's
family has been part

263
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,833
of the Abh nobility
from the beginning.

264
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,375
I mean, she's a princess
in the Abh royal family...

265
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,625
It's sort of like
the three of us

266
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,291
are a model for the
evolutionary process!

267
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,625
That's not true, Jinto.
You've got it wrong.

268
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,000
We weren't part of an
evolutionary process.

269
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,041
We merely adapted
using genetics.

270
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,541
Remember that we're
the Kin of the Stars.

271
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,791
[ATOSURYUA]
That's right.

272
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,375
We can't evolve using
artificial methods.

273
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,583
People are what they are
and you can't create

274
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,708
something different from that!

275
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,041
[LAFIEL]
Compared to our ancestors,

276
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,500
we have an extra sensory
organ and we live longer.

277
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,750
That's all.

278
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,416
[JINTO] Even so, that's still
quite an achievement!

279
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,041
[JINTO]
Oh--

280
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,375
[DIAHO meows]

281
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,333
[LAFIEL]
This reminds me...

282
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,750
What's wrong?

283
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,750
I'm sorry if I chose
something you don't like.

284
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,208
No, it's not that.
The food looks delicious.

285
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,833
It's just that this is...

286
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,375
This is the same
dish I was served

287
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,958
by the Baron when I dined
with him at Febdash.

288
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,875
Is that all?

289
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,333
I hope it's not a problem.

290
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,750
Actually it's intentional--

291
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,208
I tried to reproduce
the same menu

292
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,208
that my brother served
you on that occasion.

293
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,833
We found a copy of
the menu in his things,

294
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,333
so I used it tonight!

295
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,375
I trust there's nothing else?

296
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,250
[LAFIEL]
No... Nothing at all.

297
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,500
I was just a little taken aback.

298
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,916
[LAFIEL]
I remember...

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,458
I had to leave your brother's
dinner before we'd finished.

300
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,875
I didn't know about that part.

301
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,041
But then... I hope
tonight will be different

302
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,791
and you'll stay with me
until the end of the meal!

303
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,833
Obviously, the circumstances
aren't the same,

304
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,625
but at least the menu is!

305
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,041
I thought it might
be fun to get some

306
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,708
sort of feeling for how
my brother entertained

307
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,125
the princess and the count.

308
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,750
I think you might've made
a mistake--I wasn't there!

309
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,708
At the time, I was with
the previous baron.

310
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,958
Yes, that's right.

311
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,291
I was having dinner with
your father, Commander!

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,583
Well, that's something
else I didn't know!

313
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,333
So this must mean
that the only person

314
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,208
my brother invited for dinner...
was the princess!

315
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,500
[ATOSURYUA sighs] But then
that's exactly the sort of thing

316
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,458
that he'd get up to!

317
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,791
Baroness.

318
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,958
I'd like to ask you something,
if you don't mind.

319
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,916
After what happened, are you
sure you don't hate me?

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,333
No, Your Highness.

321
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,916
We haven't known each
other for very long,

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,291
but please understand
that I don't hate you.

323
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,125
How would it look if I were
to invite you for dinner

324
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,875
and then spend the
evening insulting you?

325
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,791
I wouldn't allow my family
to put up with the shame

326
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,416
of such bad behavior!

327
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,125
I'm sorry, forgive me.

328
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,458
I should have realized.

329
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,083
It was a silly question to ask.

330
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,458
My brother and I...

331
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,166
I do have some wonderful
memories of him.

332
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,291
But most of them date back
to our childhood together.

333
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,291
Once we grew up,
we kind of drifted apart

334
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,083
and we didn't see each other
very often as adults.

335
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,416
[ATOSURYUA chuckles]
This used to be

336
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,041
one of my brother's favorites!

337
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,791
[LAFIEL] I got the impression
that he didn't have

338
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,666
much of an appetite.

339
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,916
[ATOSURYUA] Really? He was
probably just nervous!

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,083
He'd often lose his appetite
when he was nervous.

341
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,000
It was very useful for us--
if he didn't touch his food,

342
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,708
we could always tell right away
that something was up!

343
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,791
[LAFIEL]
I see...

344
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,750
So, uh, what sort of food
did your brother like?

345
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,583
Anything special?

346
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,750
Let's think for a moment...

347
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,375
When he was a child, I remember

348
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,125
he really liked pears
boiled in syrup.

349
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,875
I was amazed at how he could eat
something so sickly sweet.

350
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,375
Maybe when he grew up,
his tastes changed a little,

351
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,375
but I think he still had
a bit of a sweet tooth.

352
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,750
The food here is kind of
on the sweet side,

353
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,875
so he probably
would've loved it.

354
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,416
[ATOSURYUA] You know
something else he liked?

355
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,708
He liked dogs!

356
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,750
What?!

357
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,291
He liked breeding them.

358
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,666
I didn't take you for someone

359
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,375
who'd make a such culturally
prejudiced assumption...

360
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,166
[ATOSURYUA]
He also had a cat.

361
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,291
He had the impression
that if you were an Abh

362
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,166
and wanted a pet,
it had to be a cat.

363
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,333
We couldn't persuade
him otherwise.

364
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,541
Have you ever had a pet
of your own, Count?

365
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,958
A cat or a dog?

366
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,708
Yes, I have a cat, Diaho.

367
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,083
It was the princess' nephew's--

368
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,083
You never miss a chance
to make a point, do you?

369
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,625
Well, well, well!

370
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,333
Sounds like there's a story
behind that little conversation.

371
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,083
[JINTO] From then on,
the commander took over

372
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,583
the show and spent the
evening sharing memories

373
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,166
of her dead brother with us.

374
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,666
Lafiel became more comfortable
as the night went on,

375
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,583
and it was obvious she
was listening carefully

376
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,333
to what the commander
had to say.

377
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,416
Gradually, I realized that
this was sort of a funeral--

378
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,041
a way for the commander
to say goodbye.

379
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,500
[CREW 6A] All ships have
now passed through

380
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,500
the Aptic Gate! All ships
report their condition!

381
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,500
The operation to defend the
Aptic System has now begun!

382
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,708
Any ships needing to re-supply
must follow the orders

383
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,958
of the local supply officers.

384
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,208
[NEREIS]
So, we have 12 fleets...

385
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,125
This is absolutely perfect.

386
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,458
Take a look.

387
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,458
If we had more than 12 fleets,

388
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,083
we would start to
run out of supplies,

389
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,791
and our range would
become limited.

390
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,583
Besides, we don't
have enough room

391
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,000
to spread out a massive
fleet here anyway.

392
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,708
But that's only if
we stay in the Sord

393
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,625
the whole time, right?

394
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,583
Isn't that what you intended?

395
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,541
That's exactly what I intended.

396
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,958
But one should never
make assumptions

397
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,166
about such things, Nefee.

398
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,125
Then why don't we
consider confronting

399
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,333
the enemy in Plane Space?

400
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,791
We're going to have
to stand up against

401
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,125
at least 150 enemy fleets.

402
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,916
And we can't expect
many reinforcements

403
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,916
to help us hold them at bay.

404
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,125
Yes, I know that.

405
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,416
[NEFEE]
Well, if that's the case...

406
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,250
Didn't you hear me?
I said I know that, Nefee.

407
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,583
I know you extremely well,

408
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,500
so it doesn't
bother me that much.

409
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,333
But you should consider
changing your attitude.

410
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,250
But I'm not like this with
anyone but you, brother.

411
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,625
I suppose I should feel
honored by that, right?

412
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,666
Maybe you should.

413
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,958
[NEFEE chuckles]
Look.

414
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,833
There's the battlefield
just waiting for us!

415
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,833
So, it's going to be
a battle in regular space.

416
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,333
It's certainly not
very edifying for us,

417
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:25,000
considering we have the power
to roam around in Plane Space.

418
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,458
What are you hinting at?

419
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,000
This is just a battle
in regular space.

420
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,500
This is our chance to show them

421
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,250
what we learned in our
Star Forces training.

422
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,500
Battle in regular space
on such a grand scale--

423
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,583
it's a beautiful thing
to watch, don't you think?

424
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,291
[NEREIS] It's more
important for us to win

425
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,583
than for it to be
artistically pleasing... right?

426
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,541
[NEFEE] Well, ideally,
we want the end result

427
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,916
to be a thing of beauty.

428
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,250
But don't worry, I won't
make it my sole objective,

429
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,583
brother dear!

430
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,375
You know we're very
different people, you and I.

431
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,583
I, for example,
have common sense.

432
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,000
[NEREIS]
If you're an example of someone

433
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,208
with common sense,
then I don't want to have

434
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:03,958
anything to do with common sense
for the rest of my life, Nefee.

435
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,500
[LAFIEL] It looks like
Admiral Bebaus has arrived.

436
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,208
Do you think this is
where the main battle's

437
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,458
gonna take place?

438
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,208
It sounds like you're
nervous about fighting.

439
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,083
[JINTO sighs]

440
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,666
Y'know, I think
I was more nervous

441
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,833
about going to that dinner
with the commander.

442
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,625
If it's not one thing,
then it's another!

443
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,750
Captain, you didn't
seem to enjoy

444
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,125
the dinner very much, either.

445
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,750
I have to say
mourning the dead

446
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,791
is not my favorite past-time.

447
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,541
The only time I ever
talked to the Baron

448
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,625
was when I had to communicate
with him over the radio.

449
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,666
Hardly a personal
relationship...

450
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,875
Oh, well.

451
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,333
I don't think I ever
had much of a friendly

452
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,125
conversation with him, either.

453
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:49,041
Still, we did our duty.
We helped her mourn his death.

454
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,625
Our "duty"?

455
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,000
[JINTO]
You know something?

456
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,625
I think I'd rather be forgotten
than have someone mourn for me

457
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,750
out of a sense of duty.

458
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,583
It's not something
you do for the dead.

459
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,333
You do it to support those
that they left behind.

460
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,041
I guess you're right.

461
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,166
So how was your little
dinner party, Captain?

462
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,166
Lots of fun?!

463
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:14,041
Huh? What are you all
staring at me for?!

464
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,291
Anything to report?

465
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,125
No, ma'am. There's nothing
special to report.

466
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,583
[JINTO]
The meal was pretty... average.

467
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,375
By the way...

468
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,500
If you had to choose,
which would you prefer?

469
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,458
Cats or dogs?

470
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,208
[SAMSON]
Hm?

471
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,750
Well, I guess I kinda
like them both,

472
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,750
but if I absolutely had
to choose, I'd go for cats.

473
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,416
Is that your secret?

474
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,041
Those strange eating
habits you didn't

475
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,000
wanna tell us about at the bar?

476
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,333
Don't tell anyone,
but it's sorta true.

477
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,333
Don't worry.

478
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,833
I'm not so starved
for food up here

479
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,083
that I'd steal my friend's
pets and cook them for dinner!

480
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,500
However, I'd like to give
you a word of advice:

481
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,291
don't let Diaho come up
onto the bridge so much.

482
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,541
There's a lot of sensitive
equipment there.

483
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,583
If any of that
equipment goes haywire

484
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,000
because your cat's
been sitting on it,

485
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,875
I might just get a sudden
urge to eat some Rutimond.

486
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,416
What's Rutimond?

487
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,458
[SAMSON] Hm. It's a delicacy
made by boiling the meat of--

488
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,166
let's just say
a certain animal...

489
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,166
Mm... I haven't tasted
it in over 20 years.

490
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,833
[JINTO] I wasn't seriously
concerned that Samson

491
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,291
was gonna boil Diaho up

492
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,625
and make some of
that Rutimond stuff.

493
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,416
But I was worried
about something...

494
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,583
[SAMSON]
A friend...

495
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,083
A friend...

496
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:25,958
A friend...

497
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,416
[JINTO]
A friend...

498
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,666
I don't think I ever had much

499
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,125
of a friendly conversation
with him, either.

500
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,125
Still, we did our duty.

501
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,041
We helped her mourn his death.

502
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,583
You know something?

503
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,625
I think I'd rather be
forgotten than have someone

504
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,916
mourn for me out
of a sense of duty.

505
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,708
It's not something
you do for the dead.

506
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,458
You do it to support
those they left behind.

507
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,958
[JINTO] Whatever happens,
it won't matter to me

508
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,750
whether people remember me
or not once I'm dead.

509
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,916
I won't be around to care!

510
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,666
Besides, I have no family or
friends left to mourn for me.

511
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,375
I don't even have a place
I can truly call home.

512
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,083
Certainly gives you
some food for thought...

513
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,958
In a place like this?!

514
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,083
Firing!

515
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,291
[LAFIEL]
Enemy attack?!

516
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,625
Is it a direct hit?!

517
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,458
There's been another
space-time fusion!

518
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,958
The enemy attack ship is
focusing its weapons on us!

519
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,916
We need more shield
on the right hull.

520
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,833
Use the anti-proton cannon
to shoot them down!

521
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,208
The ship will
respond to the command

522
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,083
in ten seconds!

523
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,416
Eight...

524
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,958
--Seven... Six...
--We're not going to make it!

525
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:08,958
Five...

526
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:09,916
Four...

527
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,291
Three...

528
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,833
I cannot believe that we
are stranded in Plane Space!
