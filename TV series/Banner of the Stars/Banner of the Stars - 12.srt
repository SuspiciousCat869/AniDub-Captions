1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,125
[NEFEE sighs]

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,458
[NEFEE]
We've completely failed

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,041
to fend them off
at the battlefront.

4
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,458
[NEREIS]
But surely the individual

5
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,333
squadrons are doing okay?

6
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,541
[NEFEE]
Well, yes.

7
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,125
But you haven't
reduced enemy numbers

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,500
so we can fight
at equal strength.

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,500
Don't speak as though you
had nothing to do with it!

10
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,791
You were involved
in this plan as well!

11
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,625
All right, calm down, Nereis.

12
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,291
This is our plan,
and we're both in it together.

13
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,166
[NEREIS]
Besides, how could you predict

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,625
that the enemy's mine attacks

15
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,458
would be quite as harsh and
last as long as they did?

16
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,583
Because of that,

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,208
our fleet was not in
the best formation

18
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,583
to fight when the enemy
attack vessels arrived.

19
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,958
[NEFEE] The fact that our
flagship needs to participate

20
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,250
in the battle, means
we're in pretty bad shape.

21
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,625
So what do we do next, Nereis?

22
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,875
We could retreat...

23
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,083
But there's no way
you'd do that, is there?

24
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,416
Of course not.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,416
Our forces now completely
surround the Aptic Gate,

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,916
and thanks to that,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,625
we're just about managing to
hold them off at the front.

28
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,916
[NEREIS]
If we were to retreat,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,583
that would give the enemy
time to remobilize their fleet.

30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,250
[NEFEE]
And if we let that happen,

31
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,583
we don't stand a chance.

32
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,791
[NEREIS] Do you want us
to just sit here and wait

33
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:37,000
while the enemy goes ahead
and destroys us, Nefee?!

34
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,541
[NEFEE]
I was hoping for some evidence

35
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,083
of Spectacular Insanity here.

36
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,666
I'm sorry to disappoint you

37
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,208
but you won't find
any of that in me.

38
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,083
Where do you think you're going?

39
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,208
[NEREIS]
I'm going to have a bath.

40
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,750
Have a bath?

41
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,541
Yes. I'm going to have a bath.

42
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,958
I'm feeling a bit sticky after
all we've been through.

43
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,708
You're not going to
get the best decisions

44
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,416
out of your Commander
if he's exhausted.

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
We should grab every
opportunity to rest.

46
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, yes, I suppose so.

47
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,958
Perhaps you too should
take some time out

48
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,375
and make sure you get some rest.

49
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,958
Hey, aren't you forgetting
something here?

50
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,750
We happen to be in the middle
of a battle right now.

51
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,916
This ship could be destroyed
at any second!

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,333
And where's the Commander?
Having a bath?

53
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,208
Killed in action
while having a bath!

54
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,416
It would be a great
dishonor to me to discover

55
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,916
that I'd let my men die in vain.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,625
But at least I would like to
choose where I end my days.

57
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,125
So you make the choice to
die lying in a bathtub?

58
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:20,916
[gasps]

59
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,791
[LAFIEL]
They're firing at us!

60
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,583
Okay crew, brace yourselves!
This is gonna be tough!

61
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,458
[LAFIEL grunts, sighs]

62
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,125
There's no response
from the laser cannon!

63
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,083
There're breaches in the
hull from sectors 3 to 17,

64
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,250
and the first passageway
has also lost pressure!

65
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,541
The ship's damaged everywhere!

66
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,416
Three crew are dead and
another five wounded!

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,666
[SAMSON] The temperature's
rising to dangerous levels!

68
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,708
Any hotter and
the armor will melt!

69
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,416
Request permission to
jettison the armor!

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,250
[JINTO]
Explosion in sector 23!

71
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,291
The automatic sprinkler
system has failed!

72
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,750
Things are looking really bad.

73
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,041
Lafiel! Did you hear me?!

74
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,166
[gasps] We've got to
rescue the crew members

75
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,750
who were hurt in the
explosion. Quickly!

Just do whatever
you have to do!

78
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,541
I'll try, but the situation
has gotten out of control.

79
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,166
I don't know how much
we can do now!

80
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,583
Deca-Commander Abriel!

81
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,958
Give me a report
on your current situation.

82
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,708
[sighs]

83
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,250
[LAFIEL]
Request permission to withdraw

84
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,208
from the front, Unit Commander.

85
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,416
[ATOSURYUA]
Permission granted, <i>Basroil.</i>

86
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,875
I find the news disappointing,
but it can't be helped.

87
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,291
[LAFIEL]
It's truly disappointing...

88
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,208
[LAFIEL] Wing Aviator!
Can we save the ship?

89
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,500
[SAMSON]
It's almost impossible.

90
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,250
Right now, we're
barely holding on.

91
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,291
If we dislodge the
anti-matter fuel tank,

92
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,875
we can perhaps save
the main body,

93
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,250
but there's no way we can
do it automatically.

94
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,625
We'd have to do it manually,

95
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,875
and the reduced numbers
of the crew mean-- Damn!

96
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,791
Why did we have to go
and lose him as well?

97
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,958
[LAFIEL]
I'm left with no choice...

98
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,041
All crew! Abandon ship!

99
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,708
The Calike's still
in working order?

100
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,125
Yeah, no damage.

101
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,458
Senior Aviator,

102
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,500
get the Calike prepared
immediately for departure!

103
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,208
Yes, Captain!

104
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,625
Supply Officer, get the crew
out of here onto the Calike.

105
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,166
Yes, Captain!

106
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,625
[LAFIEL]
It doesn't seem possible...

107
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,583
This is something I never
thought I'd have to do.

108
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,833
[alarm blares]

109
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,833
All crew! This is the Captain!

110
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,875
You are temporarily discharged
from your responsibilities.

111
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,375
Abandon your posts
immediately and move quickly

112
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,500
to the Calike deck. I repeat!

113
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,666
You are temporarily discharged
from your responsibilities...

114
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,791
Could you do me
a favor, Ekuryua?

115
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,875
Any chance you could
go and get Diaho?

116
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,083
He's in my room.

117
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,625
I've already put him
in his travel carrier.

118
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,625
That's a relief!

119
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,583
I'll go and prepare the
Calike for boarding now.

120
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,416
I don't think there's much
more for me to do up here. So,

121
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,833
do you mind if I go give
Supply Officer Lin a hand?

122
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,750
I'd like to check up on
the members of my crew

123
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,625
who were injured
in the explosion.

124
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,791
As I said before, just do
whatever you have to do.

125
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,375
Well, all right then.

126
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,833
In that case, I'll get
down there right away.

127
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,916
[LAFIEL]
You had a short life, <i>Basroil.</i>

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,333
Forgive me.

129
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,750
[LAFIEL groans]

130
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,083
[LAFIEL] It's obvious that we
don't have very much time left.

131
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,833
[CREW MEMBERS shouting]

How bad are the losses?

133
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,875
[DEFENSE FLEET COMM. CHIEF]
Over 45% per cent, sir.

134

[NEFEE sighs]
So this is it...

135
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,333
This is what it's come to.

136
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,125
[ATOSURYUA] All right, we're
going to protect the rear.

137

I want the <i>Neeroil</i>
to go out in front!

fleet is retreating!

[gasps]

140
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,625
[NEFEE] Hmm... That was
faster than expected.

141
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,958
The main fleet, commanded
by his Highness.

142
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,958
[KENESH] It looks like the enemy
surrounding the Aptic Gate

143
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,500
has decided to make a
definite move to retreat.

144
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,041
So they've finally given up
the struggle, have they?

145
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,875
[KENESH] We're now in a position
to force the enemy into a battle

146
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,583
before they can leave
the area near the gate.

147
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:04,083
Having said that, there are
no guarantees that we'd win.

148
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,958
[DUSANYU] Of course, if the
battle resulted in a tie...

149
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,750
...strategically it
would be no different

150
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,708
than if we'd lost.
We have to avoid that.

151
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,291
Well, well...
Would you look at that?

152
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,666
Is there something wrong,
your Highness?

153
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,875
[DUSANYU]
Can you see the formation

154
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,166
the enemy's beginning
to move into?

155
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,291
This could be a bit of
a challenge for us.

00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,791
No, I don't think so.

157
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,458
They're just choosing
the fastest way out,

158
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,750
straight through the middle.

159
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,416
[DUSANYU]
Of course they are.

160
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,791
If we were to simply let them

161
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,416
pass through without
provocation,

162
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
our losses would be
kept to a minimum.

163
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,958
Or even better,

164
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,458
we could withdraw our fleet
from the area altogether,

165
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,708
thus avoiding the need
to fight and Aptic would

166
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,333
still remain in the
hands of the Empire.

167
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,750
That way we could also
keep Mystel in the Empire.

168
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,750
Is that what you're
really planning to do?

169
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,333
[DUSANYU]
Hmph. Of course not!

170
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,166
You forget that I
am an Abriel and I

171
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,958
have the pride of an Abriel.

172
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,208
We have assembled
a large fleet of ships,

173
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,625
and coming this far to gain
control of a couple of

174
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,791
out of the way planets
isn't my idea of success.

175
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,750
The enemy has given us
the choice of whether

176
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,041
we fight or whether we don't.

177
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,250
You don't know that for sure.

178
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,583
It doesn't matter whether
I'm sure or not.

179
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,083
It's a fact that we
have that choice

180
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,500
whether or not it's the
one the enemy intended.

181
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,416
We're going to engage
them, understand?

182
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,958
I suppose if I disagree
with that course of action

183
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,291
you'll fire me on the spot?

184
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,958
Come on, you know
I wouldn't do that!

185
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,458
You're the best
Chief of Staff I have!

186
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,208
There's no question of you
being dismissed from your job.

187
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,041
Although, I'll think
twice before I listen

188
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,791
to any of your
opinions from now on.

189
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,250
I thought you might say that.

190
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,875
As it happens,
I have no intention

191
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,208
of disagreeing with you.

192
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,833
Like you said,
we've come this far

193
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,000
to eliminate the enemy fleet
and it would be a shame

194
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,500
to go home without
achieving that goal.

195
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,916
Very well.

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,125
The Third Fleet will maintain
its present position.

197
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,291
We'll have the Second and Fourth
Fleets form a cluster formation

198
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:51,000
and attack the enemy from
the side and from behind.

199
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,416
We'll station the
First Fleet out in front.

200
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,458
The Guard ships will hold
their ground for now,

201
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,541
ready to respond to
any enemy retaliation.

202
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,000
This is only a rough plan.

203
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,166
But until we see how the enemy
organize themselves,

204
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,166
it's a start.

205
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,541
I'd like you to take
a good look

206
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,708
at the efficacy of this
battle strategy.

207
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,833
Roger. Understood.

208
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,500
By the way. There
was something else

209
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,208
I wanted to get confirmation
from you about.

210
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,666
Yes? What was that?

211
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,000
Which one was it?

212
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,916
Which brother did you
have a relationship with?

213
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,291
Was it Nereis?
Or was it Nefee?

214
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,625
[KUFADIS]
Commander in Chief!

215
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,500
The First Fleet has now
completed its deployment.

216
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,500
Thank you for your effort in
getting me that information.

217
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,166
Distance to the enemy
frontline: 120.

218
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,208
They appear to be in
an oval-shaped formation

219
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,125
and all ships are facing
in this direction.

220
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,500
Their patrol ships appear
to be ready to attack

221
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,250
as well as forming
a protective shell

222
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,208
for the ships
inside in the oval.

223
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,916
If we're going to have any
chance of success in this battle

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,625
our primary task, as the First
Fleet, will be to break through

225
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,583
that shell and destroy
the weaker ships.

226
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:55,166
[SPOOR] No, no! Where's
the elegance in that?

227
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,666
[sighs] It may come
as a surprise to you,

228
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,958
but I actually quite enjoy

229
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,958
making mincemeat of those
weaker than myself.

230
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,000
[KUFADIS]
That doesn't surprise me at all.

231
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,583
I mean, trampling over frail,
clapped out assault vessels

232
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,750
and annihilating ships
that have run out of ammunition

233
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,791
can be a quite a beautiful
thing to be part of.

234
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,041
Something almost artistic
about it, don't you think?

235
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,291
Not everyone would agree.

236
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,833
Surely it's a matter of taste?

237
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,208
My dear Chief of Staff,

238
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,916
haven't you realized there's
nothing more important

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,041
in this galaxy than my taste?

240
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,250
[KUFADIS]
She's gotta be joking...

241
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,625
I hope she's joking!

242
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,583
[SPOOR] Well, that and having
25 patrol ship squadrons

243
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,625
get together and fight
to the bitter end

244
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,583
using only brute force.

245
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,166
But what other approach
can we take?

246
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,375
We've got to fight this battle
whether we like it or not!

247
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,666
If it were up to me, I'd avoid
the battlefield altogether.

248
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,166
However, we better
stay put here in Aptic.

249
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,958
[KUFADIS] But if we do that,
surely that means

250
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,125
we won't be able to fight
the decisive battle?

251
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,000
[SPOOR] I'm not saying
it's an ideal situation.

252
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,958
But it's got to be better
than the alternative...

253
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,125
I suppose...

254
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,291
All right then.

255
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,333
I guess I ought to stop
grumbling about it

256
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,083
and do something.

257
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,500
Chief of Staff?

258
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,750
Give instructions to all
contingents under our command.

259
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,375
Let the supply forces
stand down

260
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,166
and advance with
surveillance troops only.

261
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,708
Tell all ships to prepare for
battle in regular space.

262
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,041
We'll enter the
space-time bubbles

263
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,791
in small groups of
half squadrons.

264
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,041
The top priority for the
following squadrons will be

265
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,500
to stop the enemy from advancing
any further: Kuryudas, Biruka,

266
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:22,333
Kengafu, Goshitol, Ferutoni,
Saidoo, and Torarisuto.

267
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,666
Inform them immediately.

268
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,875
I want the other squadrons
to focus on penetrating

269
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,750
the main body of
the enemy fleet.

270
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,458
They are to avoid
engaging in battle

271
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,458
with enemy patrol ships.
Even if provoked,

272
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,625
I insist they wait to retaliate.

273
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,458
If they enter our
space-time bubbles

274
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,583
they'll fight until
they've returned

275
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,125
to the safety of
their own ranks.

276
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,416
We will break through the
outer shell of patrol ships

277
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,833
to cut deep into enemy lines.

278
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,666
[KUFADIS] She plans to
demoralize these guys

279
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,833
no matter what!

280
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,375
The signal to commence
the attack will be

281
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,291
when our space-time bubble
moves forward. Got that?

282
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,875
Yes, ma'am. Understood!

283
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,041
I'll relay the order immediately
to all ships under your command.

284
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,208
The communication ship has
started space-time fusion

285
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,083
with the Saidoo squadron
at the rear of the fleet.

286
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,916
Notify the captain
without delay!

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The space-time bubble is
now totally mobile,

288
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,916
on a course of zero-one-zero.

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,583
[grunts]

290
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm not sure I feel up
to this right now.

291
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,958
[KENESH] The First Fleet
has begun to advance.

292
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,791
In that case, we should
start our advance, as well.

293
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll give the order for
squadrons on the frontline

294
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,916
of battle to launch their
mobile space-time mines.

295
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,458
First wave. Space-time
separation complete!

296
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,375
Second wave. Space-time
separation complete!

297
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,250
[CREW 12C]
Third wave.

298
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,541
Space-time separation complete!

299
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,583
The Third Fleet has
begun their mine attack!

300
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,208
[CREW 12C] The space-time
bubbles which appear to be

301
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,666
enemy guard ships
have begun to retreat!

302
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,750
[CREW 12D] Distance to enemy
fleet is now 10...

303
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,916

[CREW 12D]
We've made contact!

310
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,666
I can almost hear the sound of
metal scraping against metal.

311
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,875
[SPOOR] The sound of my dear
ships being damaged.

312
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,625
The sound of my
precious men dying.

313
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,500
It's not a sound I
could ever enjoy...

314
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,541
I guess you'll just have
to get used to it.

315
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,458
[sighs] How true.

316
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,250
A pertinent observation.

317
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:45,291
[CREW MEMBERS shouting]

318
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,250
[shouting continues]

319
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,625
[CREW screaming]

320
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,916
[FLEET COMM. CHIEF]
We've passed through

321
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,208
the front line of enemy
patrol ship squadrons!

322
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,333
[SPOOR]
Heh.

323
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,833
Notify headquarters!

324
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,583
And inform Futune
and Skuni as well!

325
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,250
All ships prepare to launch
another mine attack!

326
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,583
[KUFADIS]
She looks so happy about this.

327
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,125
[SPOOR]
Once mines are deployed,

328
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,583
all ships must separate into
individual space-time bubbles!

329
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,041
[FLEET COMM. CHIEF]
All mines are now ready

330
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:22,916
to be launched!

331
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,166
In that case, fire!

332
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,125
[KUFADIS] All mines have been
successfully launched!

333
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,125
[SPOOR] Mobilize individual
space-time bubbles!

334
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,458
Let's go, get 'em!

335
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,500
Have we got everyone on board?

336
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,333
Actually, we're still waiting
for Second Aviator Ekuryua.

337
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,666
She hasn't arrived yet?

338
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,291
[SOBAASH] She had to go
back and get Diaho

339
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,250
but it's taking longer
than expected.

340
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,833
She should be here any moment.

341
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,375
But at least we know
where she is, unlike...

342
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,750
You mean we're missing
someone else?

343
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,916
[SOBAASH] Mm-hm. We had
to leave Paveryua behind

344
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,041
because of his injuries.

345
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,083
Supply Officer Lin
went to rescue him,

346
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,666
but we think he may
have got into some

347
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,000
sort of accident
on his way there.

348
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,583
His pressure helmet
malfunctioned,

349
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,791
so we can't tell where he is
or what's wrong with him.

350
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,333
My guess is he's probably
near the area of Sector One.

351
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,250
That's if he's still alive...

352
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,500
What about Paveryua?

353
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,875
[SOBAASH]
We think he managed to escape

354
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,666
using one of the
emergency pods.

355
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,958
Okay. I'm going back to try
and help Supply Officer Lin.

356
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,916
I want you to take
control of the Calike,

357
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,791
try to pick up Paveryua
in his emergency pod.

358
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,083
But Captain...?!

359
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,416
That's an order, Senior Aviator!

360
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,916
Look after that, will you?

361
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,791
[SOBAASH sighs]

362
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,916
I don't think I have
much choice.

363
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,916
Your Highness, you have
always been a captain

364
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,083
of courage and honor
on board the <i>Basroil.</i>

365
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,916
Please remember that I hold
you in the greatest affection.

366
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Thank you. I leave my
crew in your hands.

367
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,541
Please, take care of them.

368
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,791
It would be an honor.

369
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,666
After all, they are
my crew, too.

370
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,000
[SAMSON]
Captain!

371
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,625
We've only got about
five minutes!

372
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,791
Although I wouldn't be surprised

373
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,583
if this thing blew
at any second.

374
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:20,000
If after five minutes you still
haven't found the boy...

375
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,500
I know it's difficult, but we'll
have to give up the search.

376
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,916
Please take care.

377
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't want to be remembered
as the Senior Aviator

378
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,583
who abandoned her Captain in
the midst of her first battle.

379
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,000
[LAFIEL]
That won't be necessary.

380
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,333
I have every intention of coming
out of this thing alive.

381
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,166
Just make sure you remember
to pick up our emergency pods

382
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,166
once we're done!

383
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,041
We'll be there for
you, Captain!

384
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,333
[SAMSON]
Senior Aviator!

385
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,291
[SOBAASH]
Mm?

386
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,833
[SAMSON]
We've got a problem...

387
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,291
I can't get any more output
from the engine in the Calike!

388
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,125
[gasps] We can't
get out of here?!

389
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,833
We're fighting against
the clock now!

390
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,958
We gotta do somethin' fast,
before she blows up!

391
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,583
[SOBAASH]
Let me come and help!

392
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,583
[SAMSON]
Hurry!

393
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,833
[SOBAASH grunts]

394
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,041
[grunts]

395
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,208
[JINTO]
I was... What was I...?

396
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,875
Huh?!

397
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,958
[JINTO]
Paveryua, where are you?!

398
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,166
Are you in there?!

399
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,583
Huh?

400
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,000
[JINTO]
The emergency pod's been used.

401
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,291
That must mean he was
able to get out of here.

402
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,958
[sighs] Thank goodness!

403
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,541
[JINTO]
Huh?!

404
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,333
[JINTO screams]

405
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,166
[JINTO]
Oh. That was a close one...

406
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,458
I couldn't have been
out for more than

407
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,833
about five minutes.

408
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:43,875
But that five minutes
could just cost me my life.

409
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,208
[JINTO]
How typical!

410
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,000
I try to act like a hero,
and what do I achieve?

411
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,166
Nothing.

412
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,166
You would think I would have
learned my lesson by now!

413
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,708
Okay. There are no
emergency pods left.

414
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,125
No more pressure helmets.

415
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,125
The pressure in the next sector
is probably 5000 daj.

416
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:04,083
Oh, and the ship is
about to explode.

417
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,625
There's only one thing
left to for me to do...

418
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,041
But if I call for help, I'm
just gonna get someone else

419
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,750
mixed up in this, and risk
their life as well as mine.

420
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,666
[clattering]

421
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,833

[panting]

426
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,791
Are you all right, Jinto?

427
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,583
I was okay before
all this happened...

428
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,083
But I'm not sure anymore--
what do you think?

429
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,166
Don't be such an idiot.

430
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,083
Would you have preferred
if I left you?

431
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,791
Of course not!
If you hadn't come,

432
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,250
I'd probably be dead
by now! Thank you.

433
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,958
[LAFIEL] Hurry up.
We don't have much time.

434
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,125
[LAFIEL] What is it with you and
your fascination with vacuums?

435
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,250
[JINTO]
Gimme a break!

436
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,791
They don't mean anything to me.

437
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,458
Believe or not, Landers like me
have this odd preconception

438
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,458
that vacuums aren't
good for your health.

439
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,125
But it's probably just
an old wives' tale.

440
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,083
[LAFIEL]
Huh?

441
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,666
[LAFIEL, JINTO grunt]

442
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,333
[LAFIEL, JINTO panting]

443
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,000
[LAFIEL] Come on,
we can't waste any time.

444
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,333
I think there's some emergency
pods left over there.

445
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,416
[LAFIEL]
You know...

447
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,750
Do you remember when you
said to me that you didn't think

448
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,166
anyone would feel sad or
miss you when you died,

449
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,666
and you'd be forgotten?

450
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah. I think so...

451
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,750
[LAFIEL]
Well...

452
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,375
Got it!

453
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,875
Let's go!

454
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,375
[gasps]

455
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,958
[screams]

456
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,125
It's okay, I've got her!

457
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,125
Let's get outta here!

458
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:40,041
What's happened to the captain
and Supply Officer Lin?

459
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,958
[gasping]

460
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,916
They can't be... Captain. Jinto.

461
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,416
[JINTO]
O Stars, listen to our plea,

462
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,208
Thy kin whose lives
are but short;

463
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,375
We ask that you might guide us;

464
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:57,541
Lead us throughout eternity.

465
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:01,750
It's funny, but I really don't
mind being trapped in here.

466
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,666
Probably...

467
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,666
It's probably because
