Daisiele!

30
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,708
[DUSANYU] I've had a little bit
of time to think about this.

31
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,041
[KENESH]
Hm.

32
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,125
Relax. It's got nothing to
do the Bebaus brothers.

33
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,583
I knew all about you
having an affair

34
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,166
with one of them
a long time ago.

35
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,000
I suppose that's a relief.

36
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,333
So, what's this all about?

37
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,708
What do you think about us
building up the First Fleet

38
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,375
to make it more substantial?

39
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,333
The First Fleet? Are you sure?

40
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,458
We'd have to gather
together more patrol ships

41
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,916
than we had last time.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,625
[DUSANYU]
Agreed.

43
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,000
I think it's feasible

44
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,041
that we can get hold
of 12 more squadrons.

45
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,666
[KENESH]
Maybe even up to 13.

46
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,875
[DUSANYU] Ha, ha.
Looks like I miscalculated!

47
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,041
I take it you've already
considered this option?

48
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,083
Yes. The staff have
been working on it.

49
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,333
They're prepared for
all eventualities.

50
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,666
It's difficult to predict
the correct course of action

51
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,458
to take because there
are so many uncertain

52
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,083
factors in the equation.

53
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,791
Since we don't know the enemy's
exact strategy, we can't be sure

54
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,541
that increasing the
number of patrol ships

55
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,875
will be the right decision.

56
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,291
[DUSANYU]
But if I go ahead and order

57
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,041
the strengthening of the
First Fleet, you won't object?

58
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,625
[KENESH]
No, I won't.

59
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,708
However, if that's the course of
action you're intending to take,

60
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,708
I've got one piece of advice.

61
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,083
And what's that?

62
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,791
I think we should replace
the Commander-in-Chief.

63
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,250
[DUSANYU]
What's wrong with Beneej?

64
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,750
[KENESH] With all these
extra patrol ships,

65
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,708
she would be in charge
of 25 squadrons.

66
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,125
Now, I'm not concerned
about Admiral Spoor's

67
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,333
ability to command, but such
a high level of responsibility

68
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,041
is not appropriate
to her rank.

69
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,833
Surely someone with a higher
authority should be in charge.

70
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:09,791
[DUSANYU]
If you're not concerned

71
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,166
about her ability to command,

72
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,458
then I don't see
the problem here.

73
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,041
[KENESH]
I appreciate your point of view.

74
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,833
But there is another problem--
with all these extra squadrons,

75
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,250
the headquarters
of the First Fleet

76
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,791
is going to be short-staffed.

77
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,083
[DUSANYU]
It'll be fine.

78
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,666
It doesn't matter whether
they're controlling

79
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,625
12 squadrons or 25.

80
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,458
[KENESH]
Your Highness...

81
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,750
What is it now?

82
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,125
Seeing as to how you
backed up Admiral Bebaus,

83
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,166
and now the way you're
supporting Admiral Spoor,

84
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,458
I'm wondering if you're
giving members of the root

85
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,833
families preferential treatment
because of their background.

86
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,041
You should know that some
statements are unacceptable.

87
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,750
I do not show favoritism based
on an individual's bloodline.

88
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,458
And even if I did, do you
think I'd run the risk

89
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,166
of letting the head
of the Spoor family

90
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,250
be assigned to such an important
and dangerous mission

91
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,375
without being sure
she could do the job?

92
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,583
Yes, I suppose you're right.

93
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,000
[DUSANYU grunts]

94
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,500
Can't you see that
the way in which

95
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,625
I make my decisions is
perfectly straightforward?

96
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,666
Having Beneej in charge
of this operation

97
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,416
is the most rational choice.

98
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,625
That's all there is
to it, I'm afraid.

99
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,041
And you know,

100
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,291
I wouldn't be at all surprised
if she didn't even want

101
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,708
the responsibility that comes
with doing this job.

102
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,291
I see.

103
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,541
Good. So now I want you

104
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,458
to get in contact
with Beneej for me.

105
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,875

All crew are free to step
down from their stations.

120

I want everyone to keep
an eye on the schedule

and make sure
they get some rest.

Yes, Ma'am!

[JINTO]
Captain.

124
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,833
I just wondered if you'd like
me to get you a drink...?

125
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,208
Yes. I'd like that.

126
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,291
But if you want to be on your
own, that's okay, just tell me.

127
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,291
I don't want you to think
you can't get rid of me!

128
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,375
If you want to stay here
with me, that's fine--

129
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,000
it doesn't bother me.

130
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,291
Is there any chance we
could look at the view?

131
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,416
[LAFIEL]
Mm-hm.

132
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,416
As a kid, I never thought
I'd see a view like this.

133
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,750
Now here I am, looking at
it with my own two eyes.

134
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,625
[LAFIEL]
I always knew I'd see this.

135
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,083
It was decided before I
was born that I would join

136
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,416
the Star Forces,
and that one day I would be

137
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,375
found in the midst of battle.

138
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,583
However, I hadn't anticipated
being the Captain

139
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,041
of an assault ship.
I wanted more than that.

140
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,291
I wanted to wear the
uniform of an Admiral!

141
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,250
[JINTO] You've got a
long road ahead of you.

142
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,625
I'm sure it'll happen someday.

143
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,916
[LAFIEL]
True...

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,250
But what about when you
were young, Jinto?

145
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,041
What did you want to be?

146
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,166
[JINTO] I was only 10
when the Empire came

147
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,083
and took control of our planet.

148
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,791
I don't remember wanting
to do anything then.

149
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,250
I was far too young to decide.

150
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,333
But I'm pretty sure
that going into space

151
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,875
wasn't something I'd thought
of as a serious option.

152
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,958
[LAFIEL] Hm. But at least
you had some options.

153
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,166
That's true.

154
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,708
Although back in those
days on our planet,

155
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,708
I don't think there was
much to choose from.

156
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,583
Hold on--there was something!

157
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,541
My mother, before she died,
was a mining engineer.

158
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,375
I decided that was what
I was gonna do as well.

159
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,958
I didn't even know what
a mining engineer did.

160
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,625
[LAFIEL]
So, what do they do?

161
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,416
[laughs] I'm ashamed to
say I still don't know!

162
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
Anyway, I'm not
gonna be one now,

163
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,750
so I guess it doesn't matter.

164
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,666
[LAFIEL] I've always wondered
what it would be like

165
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,791
to not know what you're
going to do with your life.

166
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,750
Or what path you're
going to follow.

167
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,541
[JINTO]
It can be unsettling.

168
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,333
Sometimes you have to do
a job you hate just to get by.

169
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,916
On the other hand, that dream
job you've always wanted

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,500
might turn out to
be kinda boring.

171
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,166
To be honest with you, I
didn't think very much about

172
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,166
what I wanted to do
when I was a kid.

173
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,333
But I felt relieved
when it was decided

174
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,875
I would become an Abh.

175
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,625
'Cause, as a member of
the Empire's nobility,

176
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,250
I had a course set out for me,

177
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,666
even if I hadn't made
that choice for myself.

178
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,416
That's kinda like me--
I know what I'm going to do.

179
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,625
Whether I like it or not,

180
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,250
I've got the job of
Empress ahead of me.

181
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,375
You don't sound convinced
that being an Empress

182
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,041
is something you want.

183
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,041
What I want has
nothing to do with it.

184
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,250
If you must know,

185
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,250
I really wanted to work
on a merchant ship.

186
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,833
However, as an Abriel,

187
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,791
I have no choice but to take my
place on the Imperial throne.

188
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,666
Maybe afterwards I could
go off and do a real job,

189
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,375
once I've done my duty.

190
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,750
[JINTO] So you went into
the family business.

191
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,000
Things seem to be
so simple for you.

192
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,083
I think I envy that.

193
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,625
[LAFIEL] Don't forget,
you're an Abh, too.

194
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,750
Yes Lafiel,
of course I know that.

195
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,708
If this operation
succeeds, who knows--

196
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,541
maybe the Hyde star
system will end up

197
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,750
being recaptured by
the Empire as well.

198
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,041
[LAFIEL]
Any idea what you'll do

199
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,541
once your territories
are restored?

200
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,208
Uh, not really.

201
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,458
It'd be hard to go back
and meet people again

202
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,208
after being away for so long.

203
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,583
Sometimes I wish I could
give up my title of Count

204
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,666
to somebody else.

205
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,708
[LAFIEL]
You could always hire a deputy.

206
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,125
[JINTO]
I know, but it would feel

207
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,000
like I'm running away,
shirking my responsibilities.

208
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,666
Besides, I don't
have a good excuse.

209
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,791
[LAFIEL] You're working
for the Star Forces!

210
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,083
Isn't that a good enough?

211
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,666
[JINTO]
Possibly...

212
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,500
Anyway, if I've still not gone
back after another 10 years,

213
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,875
maybe I'll be
disqualified as a Count!

214
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,500
[JINTO gasps] Hey!
Why don't we switch titles?!

215
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,791
You can be Countess Hyde,
and I'll be Viscount Paryunu!

216
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,875
I could spend all my time
growing roses somewhere!

217
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,125
Forget it.

218
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,750
There's no way you could
do something like that.

219
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,625
S'pose you're right.

220
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,458
Seemed like a good
idea at the time.

221
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,916
Although, I might've ended up

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,541
with the nickname
"Viscount of the Roses"!

223
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,958
I'm not really sure that
would have suited me!

224
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,375
[LAFIEL] You seem to forget
that being a Count is a duty.

225
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,291
[JINTO] It's a duty
I'd happily give away

226
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,083
if there was anyone
willing to take it!

227
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,791
The noble title of Count Hyde
belongs to your family.

228
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,000
It's not possible
to give it away.

229
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,500
[JINTO]
I know. It's like it haunts me!

230
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,833
And you know what's worse?

231
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,291
I'm the only surviving
member of the Lin family.

232
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,750
So it's all up to me.

233
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,500
If I had a cousin somewhere,
I'd give the title to him.

234
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,958
Well then, you should
stay in the Star Forces,

235
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,000
or maybe work on
a merchant ship.

236
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,666
Many nobles who don't want to
live in their own territory

237
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,833
end up doing that.

238
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,958
[JINTO]
Really?

239
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,250
Then maybe that's what I'll do.

240
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,125
But, I don't want
the people back home

241
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,458
to think I'm chickening
out or anything.

242
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,708
[LAFIEL] There are pros
and cons to everything.

243
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,000
It's up to you to decide.

244
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,958
[JINTO] Hey, thanks
for the conversation.

245
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,541
It was helpful.

246
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,458
When I became an Abh,
I was worried that

247
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,083
my whole life would
be planned for me.

248
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,125
But it's nice to know
you can have fun, too!

249
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,583
Yes. Even nobles
need to have fun.

250
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,875
We, as Abhs, have
three stages of life

251
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,333
to experience before
we can become adults.

252
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,875
You and I have only
started the first stage,

253
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,791
and we need to make the most
of each part of the journey.

254
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,583
Why worry about the future?

255
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,041
Let's make the most of today.

256
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,791
Well, I don't think I spend that
much time worrying about it.

257
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,041
So what are these
"three stages of life"

258
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,375
you were talking about?

259
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,875
I think I know what
two of them are.

260
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,916
One would be spending
time as a pilot,

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,791
another spending
time as a merchant.

262
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,125
But what's the third?

263
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,041
Can't you take a guess?

264
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,750
I haven't got a clue.

265
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,208
It's the most important
of the three of them.

266
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,625
C'mon, tell me what it is!

267
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,000
When you become a parent...

268
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,708
[DUSANYU]
Hello, Beneej!

269
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,375
I see you got yourself
a new hairdresser?

270
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,500
[SPOOR]
No.

271
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,208
If you must know,
you caught me

272
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,625
just as I was going
to sleep, your Highness.

273
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,666
I apologize for any
inconvenience caused.

274
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,666
[SPOOR] It's always an
honor to receive a call

275
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,875
from you, your Highness.

276
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,083
No matter what time
of day or night it is.

277
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,791
Now then, what can I do for you?

278
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,041
Interesting.

279
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,666
From what you've said, I can see
the possibility that our fleet

280
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,291
will have to engage in combat

281
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,250
with the enemy's elite squadron
of patrol ships.

282
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,500
There is that possibility, yes.

283
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,166
[SPOOR] I thought my
fleet was to provide

284
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,791
an elegant finish to the battle.

285
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,125
You weaken the enemy,
then our cute-looking ships

286
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,875
come along and
clean up the mess.

287
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,291
Unfortunately, our
expectations must change.

288
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,083
Depending on the
enemy's actions.

289
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,500
Squadrons of patrol ships
fighting head-to-head

290
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,625
is a far from elegant
way to fight a battle.

291
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,750
It's barbaric!

292
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,458
Surely there must be
a way headquarters

293
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,750
can figure out an
alternative strategy?

294
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,500
We'll try and do
our best for you.

295
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,416
But in the end, it's
more important to win

296
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,291
even if it's done barbarically.

297
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,125
Who cares how
elegantly you fight

298
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,541
the battle if you don't win.

299
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,250
You're forcing me to
undertake this mission

300
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:07,625
in a style usually
associated with the Abriels.

301
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,625
You know, your Highness,
you're a very unkind man.

302
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,583
And now to bed...

303
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,333
How interesting that Beneej
should call me unkind.

304
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,916
Should I be annoyed by that?

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,750
Or do you think coming from her
it's some kind of compliment?

306
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,541
Don't ask me--I've got no idea.

307
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,333
[SPOOR] I just can't seem
to keep my big mouth shut

308
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,041
when I'm speaking
to his Highness!

309
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,875
I mean, I know
Abriels are famous

310
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,458
for being terribly serious.

311
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,666
It's always fun to tease them
and try and provoke a reaction.

312
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,083
But this guy... He simply
doesn't take the bait!

313
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,500
It's impossible to tease
him about anything!

314
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,041
It may surprise you to learn
that being teased by you

315
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,000
is not the royal family's
only function.

316
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,166
It might be that they have

317
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,500
better things to do
with their time.

318
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,208
Well, my dear Chief of Staff,

319
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,666
I can't say I've
seen anything

320
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,375
to back up your opinion so far.

All ships working in the
vicinity of the front-line

now clear the area.

325
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,416
I repeat! All ships
working in the vicinity

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,041

Space-time mines... launched.

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,583
[OFFICER 9A]
Space-time mines are ready

331
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,958
to be positioned for detonation!

[ATOSURYUA]
The battle is about to begin.

333
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,208
I need you to relay an
urgent message to all units!

[DEFENSE FLEET CHIEF]
All ships are in position!

350
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,541
Enemy fleet arriving
in 30 minutes!

351
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,916
[NEREIS]
So, our main fleet is over here.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,416
I guess if we wait for them,

353
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
they might arrive in
another 50 hours or so.

354
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,791
[NEFEE]
The enemy must know that, too.

355
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,125
They'll come at us
with all they've got.

356
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,416
Good. I wouldn't have
it any other way.

357
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,666
This war isn't happening
solely for the benefit

358
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,333
of your entertainment,
you know.

359
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,208
Believe me when I say
that I'm not trying

360
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,458
to turn this war into
a game. However,

361
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,375
if we do happen
to enjoy ourselves,

362
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,625
where's the harm in that?

363
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,208
If you say so.

364
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,541
[NEREIS] Besides, we have the
lives of our crew at stake here.

365
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,791
You must be crazy if you think
I'd actually change our plans

366
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,041
for the sake of a little
bit of entertainment.

367
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,625
[NEFEE] Actually, that is
what I'm worried about.

368
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,250
But I hope you won't forget
what you just said.

369
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,791
After all, we don't want
our family's reputation

370
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,708
to sink any lower
than it is already...

371
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,958
Or perhaps that should
be we don't want it

372
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,958
to get any higher.

373
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,958
[NEREIS] Don't worry.
I'm not going to do anything

374
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,166
to enhance the Bebaus
family's notoriety

375
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,208
for Spectacular Insanity.

376
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,166
In fact, all that it would
take to make me happy

377
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,625
would a normal life.

378
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,208
[NEFEE] So, being an Admiral
and commanding a fleet

379
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,833
is your idea of a normal life?

380
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,291
You know, I think your attitude
has just proved beyond the

381
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,000
shadow of a doubt that
you suffer from our

382
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,791
family's affliction more than
you realize, my dear brother!

383
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,708
In that case, my advice would be
to stop spending so much time

384
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,166
worrying about it. Otherwise,
I might get the urge

385
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,333
to add yet another
chapter to the history

386
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,291
of our Spectacular Insanity.

387
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,500
Don't worry, Brother.
I'm going to be here with you.

388
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,791
If worse comes to worst,
I'll stop you doing that.

389
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,708
Even if it means killing you.

390
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,000
Now that does make
me worry, Nefee.

391
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,583
I don't really have
a problem with you

392
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,708
getting rid of me that way,

393
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,000
but I'd've hoped it
would have been in

394
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,708
slightly more edifying
circumstances.

395
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,083
Transmission received
from the Koosururu!

396
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,208
The enemy has launched
several space-time bubbles

397
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,583
that we suspected are mines!

398
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,208
[NEREIS] While we were
wasting time talking,

399
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,750
the enemy has made
the first move.

400
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,583
What's the estimated
time of arrival?

401
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,375
About seven minutes.

402
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,500
Should we counterattack
with our own mines?

403
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,541
We don't have much
choice in the matter.

404
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,250
We can't let them tear us apart
without some retaliation.

405
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,708
At last, you're making
some sense, Nereis.

406
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,875
Thank you very much.

407
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,750
Fire all mines directly
into the Sord!

408
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,708
Issue this order
to the entire fleet!

409
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,458
So, the battle has begun...

410
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,250
[SOBAASH] All mines have
now entered the Sord!

411
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,000
[LAFIEL]
So many mines...

412
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,958
Makes you feel defenseless.

413
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,916
Come to think of it, we've been
defenseless from the start.

414
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,791
Whether it's one
mine or a hundred,

415
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,625
this ship's armor is
so thin that one hit

416
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,291
would finish us.

417
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,750
It's going to be impossible
for our side to destroy

418
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,333
all of those enemy mines.

419
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,458
So it's a safe bet that
some of them will end up

420
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,458
making their way towards us.

421
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,916
[LAFIEL]
Keep calm...

422
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,916
You have the fate of 20
lives lying in your hands...

423
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,083
[gasps]

Officers have a
responsibly to their crew.

425
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,458
Senior Aviator, do you
remember the mines

426
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,708
that misfired in Wimpel?

427
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,208
Will that happen again?

428
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,708
I don't know. I was thinking
exactly the same thing.

429
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,958
Why are you concerned
about that?

430
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,333
On that occasion, I thought
we'd destroyed all the mines

431
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,833
that had been launched.

432
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:07,875
That's right.

433
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,625
But then we realized
what was inside

434
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,333
those two space-time bubbles.

435
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,166
There were seven mines in there
that were ready to explode.

436
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,333
The enemy's...

437
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,500
...new weapon?

438
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,958
[beeping]

439
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,416
[gasps]

440
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
[SOBAASH] The enemy mines
at the head of the formation

441
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,333
are due to arrive at any second!

442
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,000
They're here. They're
right in front of us!

443
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,125
It's hard to tell what that is.

444
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,208
Second Aviator!

445
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,208
I want you to keep
a close eye on it!

446
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,333
Yes, Captain!

447
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,625
Line Wing Aviator.
Are we ready to go?

448
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,208
Oh, yes, we're ready--

449
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,541
can't you feel the atmosphere in
here bubbling with excitement?!

450
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,583
We can move forward at any
time, with maximum speed!

451
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,041
In that case...

452
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,125
...let the battle commence!

453
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,458
So, first on the scene
is the <i>Basroil.</i>

454
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,875
They sure have a lot of
energy and enthusiasm.

455
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,458
I wonder if that has to do
with her being an Abriel.

456
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,333
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I
can't let Your Imperial Highness

457
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,875
take all the glory
in this battle.

458
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,666
[sighs] Now keep calm, Lafiel.

459
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,083
[LAFIEL] Prepare to fire
the anti-proton cannon!

00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,000
[JINTO]
The three stages of life...

463
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,750
And I'm only at the first.

464
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,083
I'm not gonna give up

465
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:33,291
until I've had the chance
to experience all three!

466
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,500
[SOBAASH]
The enemy mines

467
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,333
will be within firing
range in 10 seconds.

468
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,458
8...

469
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,541
...7...6...

470
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,625
...5...

471
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,666
...4...3...

472
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,833
...2...

473
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:45,958
...1...

474
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,875
Enemy mine is now
within firing range!

475
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,500
Fire the anti-proton cannon!

476
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:52,958
Their new weapon?

477
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,541
I hope you're not fooling
around with me about this.

478
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,166
[LAFIEL]
It's almost like...

479
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:14,041
...their spirits... have gone.
