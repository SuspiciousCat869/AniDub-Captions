[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,958
So, the battle has begun.

3
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,208
The enemy mines at the head

4
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,208
of the formation are due
to arrive at any second!

5
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,583
They're here!
They're right in front of us!

6
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,458
Let the battle commence!

7
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,333
So, first on the scene
is the <i>Basroil.</i>

8
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,791
They sure have a lot of
energy and enthusiasm.

00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,833
[SOBAASH] The enemy mines
will be within firing range

00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,875
in 10 seconds.

00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:57,958

15
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,333
Enemy mine is now
within firing range!

16
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,750
Fire the anti-proton cannon!

17
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,750
It split?!

18
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,833
[SOBAASH]
The mine's still live!

19
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,041
I don't believe it!

20
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,208
The same thing
happened at Wimpel!

21
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,791

Firing!

What the hell is going on here?!

24
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,083
Damn! They're behind us now!
Keep the laser cannon firing!

25
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't ease up for a moment!

26
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,375

[CREW groaning]

29
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,875
The port side's taken a hit!

30
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,166
The armor there's
been damaged!

31
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,125
There's also damage
in Sectors 4, 11, and 15.

32
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,583
And now Sector 7, too!

33
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,250
What about the crew?
How are they doing?

34
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,208
Everyone's okay at the moment.

35
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,958
[SAMSON] The temperature
on board is rising.

36
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,541
But I don't think we
need to be too worried.

37
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,583
It's probably just a
temporary change.

38
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,958
Come in, <i>Basroil</i> !
Did you survive the attack?

39
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,125
Yes, we can continue.

40
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,000
[ATOSURYUA]
This must've been what they

41
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,041
mentioned in the report.

42
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,166
[LAFIEL]
I expect so.

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,333
There's a second wave coming!

44
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,708
[NEREIS] Exactly how many mines
did the enemy launch at us?

45
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,041
[NEFEE]
Who knows?

46
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,625
I don't understand why
they didn't save some for

47
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,625
the battle with the main
fleet when it arrives.

48
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,458
Even if they were to
defeat us and then

49
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,458
establish themselves
in the Aptic region,

50
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,250
they'd still need more mines.

51
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,541
We know that--try
telling it to them!

52
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,958
If I could, I would.

53
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,291
I don't understand the thinking
behind this attack.

54
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,875
Why so many mines...?

55
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,541
[NEREIS]
Well, whatever they're thinking

56
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,708
we have to deal with it
and persevere.

57
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,458
Let's use the mines
from the patrol ships.

58
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,875
[NEFEE]
Weren't we saving those for when

59
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,458
we have them on the run?

60
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,625
[NEREIS]
If we lose here,

61
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,708
we're never going to
get them on the run.

62
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,375
[NEFEE]
Well, what a surprise!

63
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,000
Do I detect some
common sense?

64
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,791
If that means you
actually agree with me

65
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,541
about the use of the
patrol ships' mines,

66
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,916
then I'd have to say I'm
just as surprised as you.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,416
Our surprise isn't going to
help get things done here.

68
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,250
It pains me to admit it,
but you're right.

69
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,458
Relay this message
to all patrol ships:

70
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,833
Begin the counter-attack.

71
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,625
Launch the mines! Huh?

72
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,166
What's wrong?

73
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,791
It looks like we're a little
bit too late for that, Nereis.

74
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,041
[NEREIS]
Hm...?

75
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,500
This can't be.

76
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,583
Somebody explain to me
what's going on here!

77
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,333
It's their new weapon!

78
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,708
Their new weapon?

79
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,791
I hope you're not joking
around with me about this.

squadron eliminated!

84
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,333
[NEREIS] So, this obviously
has something to do

85
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,250
with what was in the
reconnaissance report.

86
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,625
You seem to be taking
this news badly, Nereis.

87
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,083
What news?
About the situation?

88
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,791
Or the fact that the reputation
of our family is at stake here?

89
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,416
Well, it's not very good
whichever way you look at it.

90
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,916
So, what are we going to do
about our attack vessels?

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,541
We can't just let them sit there
in the middle of a mine attack.

92
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,041
We haven't got much choice.

93
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,541
We must save the firepower

94
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,666
for when the enemy finally
sends their ships in to attack.

95
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,916
But we've got to do
something about it!

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,708
[NEREIS] Let's bring in
the guard ships.

97
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,875
[NEFEE]
Huh?

98
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,375
We'll have each squadron
of attack vessels

99
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,791
accompanied by guard ships.

100
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,583
We can let the Unit
Commanders decide

101
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,583
which formation they use.

102
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,500
Seems like a reasonable idea.

103
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,125
I know. But we must get
onto it without delay.

104
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,791
Right away!

105
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,041
[NEREIS]
Oh, Nefee.

106
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,125
[NEFEE]
Huh?

107
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,958
If we gather information
from each ship,

108
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,333
do you think we
could learn about

109
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,250
the history of each warhead
of the enemy mines?

110
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,166
What are you getting at?

111
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,375
Once the mines have divided,

112
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,041
we need to find a way
to check that we've

113
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,375
destroyed every
single one of them.

114
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,333
We don't want to overlook
any dormant mines

115
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,500
by mistaking them for dead ones.

116
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,791
Then, we could
send out warnings

117
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,916
about the position of
the dormant mines.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,458
Does the flagship have
the facilities to do this?

119
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,083
[NEFEE] We'll have to process
enormous amounts of information.

120
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,541
But it's worth giving it a try.

121
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,583
I'll ask the officer in
charge if it's possible.

122
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,166
Communications Chief,

123
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,875
how long before we can expect
the main fleet to arrive?

124
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll check! The schedule says

125
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,083
that they should arrive in
about six hours' time, sir.

126
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,375
It's going to be a close call.

127
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,333
If everything is going
according to plan,

128
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,125
then I imagine the battle
at the Aptic Gate

129
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,625
will probably have
started by now.

130
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,083
Is that so?

131
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,791
Well, let's hope they manage
to deal with the situation

132
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,500
before we get anywhere nearby.

133
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,041
Given the number
of enemy ships,

134
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,583
our side is at a
great disadvantage.

135
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,083
They'll need our help,

136
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,625
as well as that of the main
Third Fleet if they're going

137
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,500
to defend Aptic successfully.

138
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,416
[SPOOR] What about Admiral
Rulef of the Second Fleet?

139
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,833
[KUFADIS]
He still considers defending

140
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,708
Mystel Gate his main priority,

141
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,583
but it's only a matter of
time before he moves

142
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,166
on to assist at Aptic.

143
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,166
The enemy is definitely
focusing their strength

144
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,708
on that one gate.

145
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,541
[SPOOR sighs]

146
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,083
Well, I suppose that means

147
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,958
we'll be the first ones
on the scene.

148
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,125
That was meant to be the plan
in the first place, remember?

149
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,583
That reminds me of something...

150
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,666
I wonder how that
princess is doing?

151
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,375
As I recall, she was going to be

152

assigned to the Aptic
region as well.

What Princess is that?

154

Three years ago at Sufugnoff,

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,458
I rescued a beautiful princess.

156

She reminded me of a
poor little kitten who

157

Line Wing Aviator!

318
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,125
The engine is up and
running again, Captain!

319
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,666
Good work, men.

320
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,583
Where are the mines our
side was going to send

321
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,500
to help us out here?!

322
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,833
The temperature's rising
on the port side!

323
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,875
That explosion
came pretty close!

324
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,500
Luckily there's no
damage to report!

325
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,750
I sincerely wish they
would put a stop to this.

326
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,958
I hope I haven't kept
you waiting, Nereis.

327
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,666
The front line ships are ready.

328
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,500
Well, let's not waste
any more time.

329
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,375
Push those enemy mines
back as far as possible!

330
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,375
Captain! Three enemy
mines spotted ahead!

331
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,875
And they're closing, fast!

332
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,166
The allies should be here
soon with mines to retaliate!

333
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,125
If we can get through this,
we're almost out of danger.

334
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,708
Concentrate!

335
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,958
[SOBAASH]
Mines located starboard!

336
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,375
The Kidroil's coming in
close to our port side.

337
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,083
It looks like they intend
to destroy the mines for us!

338
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,041
But Captain, there are
another three enemy mines

339
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,416
directly behind them!

340
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,958
Do you think they've seen them?

341
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,791
It's possible. They seem to be
attacking in that direction.

342
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,333
Okay, we're gonna go help them!

343
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,375
Just two left! Let's hurry
up and finish the job!

344
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,583
Huh?

345
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,916
It's the Princess...

346
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,541
She just saved our hide!
I guess we're even.

347
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,083
[LAFIEL grunts]

348
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:58,916
[BEIKAL]
Huh?

349
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,125
Did we get them all?

350
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,916
Uh! Not yet!

351
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,916
Give me a damage report, now!

352
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,625
We have lost one of the wings,

353
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,833
and the rear starboard section
has been destroyed!

354
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,875
[KIDROIL OFFICER A] Pressure
on board is dropping fast!

355
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,958
Serious problems reported
in sectors 13 to 22.

356
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,333
Things are starting to explode!

357
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,250
Oh, no! The temperature
in the engine room's rising!

358
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,750
The output of the engine
has decreased to 0.1.

359
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,375
No! 0.05!

360
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,625
[KIDROIL PILOT]
Captain! We're being attacked

361
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,583
with more mines
directly ahead!

362
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,208
Shoot them all down!

363
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,958
[KIDROIL PILOT] We can't!
The cannons won't respond!

364
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,208
[BEIKAL growls]

365
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,583
Huh?!

366
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,250
[LAFIEL sighs]

367
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,708
Message coming
through from Command.

368
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,750
The mines from the allies
are on their way.

369
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,458
They have signals to help
us distinguish them

370
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,625
from enemy mines,
but be careful!

371
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,916
The mines are here!

372
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,708
They've finally arrived!

373
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,541
[LAFIEL]
It's almost like...

374
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,625
...their spirits... have gone.

375
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,250
[NEREIS]
At last!

376
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,958
[NEFEE] Yes... finally we
have some room to breathe.

377
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,125
The guard ships will be

378
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,000
heaving a huge
sigh of relief.

379
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,208
They did manage to put
on quite a show for us,

380
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,500
wouldn't you agree?

381
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,458
But we mustn't forget
that the main fleet

382
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,083
of the enemy is still
present in the region.

383
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,333
[NEREIS] Why don't we just make
our way through that gate

384
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,666
into Plane Space,

385
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,375
and let our fleets battle
it out to the very end.

386
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,166
No, that's stupid.

387
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,166
If we do that, we'll
certainly be wiped out.

388
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,500
Maybe I really am
starting to show signs

389
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:30,541
of the famous Spectacular
Insanity of the Bebaus family.

390
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,833
[JINTO]
This battlefield

391
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,500
has already taken
its share of lives.

392
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,791
But we've still to catch
sight of the enemy fleet.

393
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:54,250
The real battle...
is yet to begin.

394
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:49,291
Commander! We are ready, able,
and willing to fight!

395
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:51,333
This is the moment you've
all been waiting for!

396
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:55,416
The time to fight against
enemy ships has arrived!

397
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,125
The temperature's rising
to dangerous levels!

398
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,458
Any hotter and
the armor will melt!

399
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,791
Lafiel! It's too far for us!

400
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,166
Now it's four against four.
