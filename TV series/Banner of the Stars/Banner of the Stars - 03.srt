1
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,291
[JINTO]
We had been assigned to

2
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,291
the Battleship
Squadron Latouche

3
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:24,333
as part of the First Division
of the 1058th Battalion.

4
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,583
[JINTO] Our mission was
to patrol the regions

5
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,000
of the Aptic System
which had been conquered

6
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,916
by Admiral Spoor.

7
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,916
[JINTO] Our assault ships are
small, but versatile craft

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,458
whose main weapons are
anti-proton cannons.

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,500
Unfortunately, the defense
shields are weak,

10
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,375
so we have to travel
in units of six ships.

11
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,583
After three months, the
Aptic System seemed like

12
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,000
our very own backup base.

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,125
[CREW 3A] We'll be arriving
in the Aptic System shortly.

14
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,250
[JINTO] Operation Phantom
Flame seems to be going

15
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,375
without a hitch. In fact,
it's going so well,

16
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,375
that our leaders are worried
that something isn't right.

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,458
[JINTO]
However, our captain,

18
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,041
Abriel Nei Dubrusk
Paryunu Lafiel,

19
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,333
differs from the other leaders
because she is worrying

20
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,583
about something else entirely.

21
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,458
[JINTO]
About this.

22
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,583
Captain!

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,750
There's a message
from the commander.

24
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,916
Huh?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,375
Put her on screen.

26
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,750
I would like to confirm that
today's joint training session

27
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,250
is now over.

28
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,375
All ships are to return to
Dakul moving at regular speed.

29
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,083
Understood, thank you.

30
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,458
[JINTO] Hecto-Commander
Atosuryua was Lafiel's

31
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,375
superior officer as
commander of our Battalion.

32
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,083
They had a very
unique connection,

33
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,041
but it wasn't
necessarily a good one.

34
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,708
Three years earlier, Lafiel
had killed Baron Febdash,

35
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:57,916
who was the commander's
older brother.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
[NARRATOR speaking Baronh]

37
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,625
[JINTO]
I wonder what she thinks of us?

38
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,250
[LAFIEL]
Does it really worry you?

39
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,000
[JINTO]
No, not really, but...

40
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,666
[LAFIEL] Come on,
tell the truth. That face!

41
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,250
You look like a child
who's done something wrong!

42
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,083
[JINTO] Cut it out! How come
it doesn't bother you?

43
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,333
[LAFIEL] How many times
do I have to tell you?

44
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,083
I had no choice--there was
nothing else I could've done.

45
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,916
[JINTO] Yeah, but the
hecto-commander might still

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,458
hold some sort of
grudge against us.

47
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,750
[JINTO] Lafiel got this
worried look on her face,

48
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,500
but then quickly came
up with a response

49
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,708
that told me we weren't gonna
talk about it anymore.

50
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,375
Jinto, it's a waste of time
even thinking about it.

51
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,041
[sighs] I wish I could
persuade her otherwise.

52
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,083
[EKURYUA] Captain.
May I have a word with you?

53
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,375
[LAFIEL]
What is it?

54
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,625
It's about this little one.

55
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:29,208
[LAFIEL] It's just one
problem after another.

56
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,166
So you've decided that you want
to keep him on board as well?

57
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,416
[EKURYUA] Well, I compared
the probable fatality rates

58
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,666
between keeping him
on board the <i>Basroil</i>

59
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,541
and sending him
back to Lakfakalle.

60
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,000
And what did you find?

61
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,500
[EKURYUA]
Before I give you my conclusion,

62
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,166
I've prepared an
explanatory presentation.

63
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,000
It doesn't look like I've got
any choice in the matter.

64
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,166
[sighs]

65
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,333
[TALAS] You mean you're
not going to issue

66
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,291
a summons demanding
our surrender?!

67
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,375
[DUSANYU]
That's correct.

68
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,166
We have no such plans
at the moment.

69
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,625
Besides, even if you were
to surrender right now,

70
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,541
we wouldn't gain much by it,
so there's not really any point.

71
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,375
[TALAS] Hmph! So all
that's going to happen

72
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:06,166
is that our planet will be
subject to a blockade?

73
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,500
[DUSANYU]
That's the intention.

74
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,625
The blockade will be
reinforced from ground level

75
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,583
to a height of 300 wesdaj
above the planet.

76
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,000
You will be able to move
freely within that area,

77
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,541
but if anyone makes an incursion

78
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,583
into the no-fly zone,
they will be stopped

79
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:23,833
and any aggressive action will
be dealt with accordingly.

80
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,375
But that's terrible.

81
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,000
Our planet is not
self-sufficient--we depend

82
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,833
on imports of food for survival.

83
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,666
If you impose a blockade
like this, people will starve!

84
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,083
[DUSANYU] We have no desire
to harm your society

85
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,875
by our actions.

86
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,458
The fact that we
are not actively

87
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,958
demanding your surrender
doesn't stop you

88
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,708
from surrendering
of your own accord.

89
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,458
We intend is to remain
in this region

90
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,625
for quite some time
so you are at liberty

91
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,166
to choose to surrender
at any time

92
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,791
you consider convenient.

93
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,666
What I don't understand
is why you would

94
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,041
go to all this trouble.

95
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,708
When our intelligence
reports suggest

96
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,250
that you don't have any
interest in our planet at all.

97
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,208
[DUSANYU] To be frank with you,
this is correct. We don't.

98
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,875
However, what we are interested
in is the nearby Sord

99
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,208
and the hydrogen and water
resources to be found

100
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,750
in the Fourth Aptic System.

101
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,708
[TALAS] Are you deliberately
trying to insult me?

102
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,416
[DUSANYU]
Certainly not, Mr. President,

103
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,208
I was merely trying
to be honest.

104
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,041
[TALAS] You dismiss the
importance of our planet--

105
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,666
how could I not be insulted?

106
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,625
[DUSANYU]
I'm sorry to hear that.

107
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,291
How about a compromise?

108
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,250
We will demand your
surrender, but only under

109
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,708
the following conditions:

110
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,541
One, if our operations
are settling down nicely,

111
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,333
two, if we are
still successfully

112
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,000
barricading the
planet and three,

113
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,500
if you haven't
already surrendered.

114
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,583
[TALAS] Well, that's
something, I suppose.

115
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,333
I have to say, I feel
a little relieved.

116
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,208
[DUSANYU] Of course,
we realize that our actions

117
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,625
have the potential to cause
the people on your planet

118
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,541
to fall into a state
of unrest and anarchy.

119
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,000
Having to deal with such a
situation would be an unwelcome,

120
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,083
unnecessary and
onerous task for us.

121
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,000
Therefore, I suggest you
consider surrendering before

122
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,000
things get out of hand.

123
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,791
[TALAS] I don't want
anarchy on this planet

124
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,125
any more than you do.

125
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,500
And with respect, if there
was, we wouldn't want

126
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,541
outsiders such as yourselves
dealing with it,

127
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,666
even if you were
indirectly to blame.

128
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,666
In any case, this was a useful
discussion, Your Highness.

129
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,375
At least we now understand
each other's position.

130
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,375
I'm sure we can discuss
the finer details

131
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,500
amongst ourselves
at another time.

132
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,958
[DUSANYU] Mm. Thank you and
good night, Mr President, sir.

133
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,375
[TALAS]
Huh?

134
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,250
[DUSANYU]
Hmph.

135
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:35,666
Aptic. Mystel. Dalmav.
Wimpel. Miofrantia.

136
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,583
We've come so far,
so quickly, so easily.

137
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,916
All defeated without
lifting a finger in battle.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,041
I suspect the enemy is
gathering their forces

139
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,375
elsewhere in space.

140
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,583
Somewhere out there...

141
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,625
It all looks so peaceful.

142
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,875
So, how come you didn't demand
his immediate surrender?

143
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,375
Remember that, in times of war,

144
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,000
the situation is
constantly shifting.

145
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,333
You never know, the United
Mankind might recapture

146
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,750
this system at any time.

147
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,625
And, if that happens,
the president,

148
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,166
who is so keen on surrendering
his planet to us,

149
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,000
wouldn't be in a very
good position, would he?

150
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,000
How very generous.

151
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,583
I think the real
reason was because

152
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,875
you didn't want
to do the paperwork

153
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,916
involved in drawing up a treaty.

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,916
The president was ready
for you to dictate

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,375
the terms of his
surrender to him.

156
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,166
And you ignored him completely.

157
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,958
What an excellent
commander-in-chief you are,

158
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,291
Your Highness. Always
managing to give people

159
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,416
what they don't want, and at
the same time not giving them

160
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
what they do want.

161
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,416
[DUSANYU] I prefer to describe
it as a guiltless pleasure.

162
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,750
[KENESH]
I didn't mean to criticize.

163
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,291
If I didn't know you better,

164
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,000
I'd say that your
behavior was verging

165
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,375
on being described
as incorrigible.

166
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, really?

167
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,916
And I have no doubt
that there will be

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,541
any number of times in the
future to reconfirm that,

169
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,333
given your track record.

170
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,541
Ah... There will be
no need to reconfirm

171
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,958
"any number of times."

172
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,833
Highness, I'm not he
one who needs to.

173
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,416
By that, I hope you're
not suggesting

174
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,541
that I'm the one
who needs to do so?

175
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,000
[DUSANYU] We really must
keep this a secret, Chief.

176
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,125
Keep what a secret?

177
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,666
[DUSANYU] The fact that
the commander-in-chief

178
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,416
and his chief of staff
don't get along very well.

179
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,791
It might promote
dissention in the ranks.

180
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,666
I doubt you have anything
to worry about.

181
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,083
I think we manage to
get along just fine.

182
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,500
It's hard to believe
we're in the middle

183
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,958
of a battlefield the way
everyone's enjoying themselves.

184
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,125
[ATOSURYUA] You're Supply
Officer Lin, aren't you?

185
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,000
[JINTO]
Huh?

186
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,000
H-Hecto-Commander Atosuryua!

187
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,333
Nice to meet you.

188
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,875
My father told me all about you.

189
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,833
Really? I liked your dad.

190
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,541
He was always really kind to me.

191
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,833
[ATOSURYUA]
Relax a little!

192
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,250
If you're worried
about the situation

193
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,708
with my brother,
please don't be.

194
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,583
[JINTO sighs]

195
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,875
Are you sure it's okay?

196
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,791
[ATOSURYUA]
Well, my brother being murdered

197
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,250
isn't open for discussion.

198
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,750
But it's hardly what you'd
call a good experience.

199
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,208
Well, yes, I can
certainly see that.

200
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,958
To tell you the truth,
my brother and I

201
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,958
had our differences.

202
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,750
For instance, we didn't always
see eye to eye over my father.

203
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,375
He wanted to keep him
confined as a prisoner.

204
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,750
I didn't agree with that.

205
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,791
As you might've guessed,
we weren't very close.

206
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,666
[JINTO]
Er... Well, I see...

207
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,250
I-I don't know what to say.

208
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,041
But I am sorry
about your brother.

209
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,208
[ATOSURYUA]
Thanks. It was a shame he died.

210
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,375
The problem now is what
to do with his title.

211
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,625
[JINTO]
What?

212
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,541
That's great, thanks.

213
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,875
[JINTO]
What do you mean "his title"?

214
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,583
He was the Baron of Febdash,

215
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,125
which is in the
middle of nowhere.

216
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,375
I never liked the place--
not when I was a child

217
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,666
and certainly not now.

218
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,875
Really?

219
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,041
[ATOSURYUA]
I was relieved when my brother

220
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,666
inherited the title and not me.

221
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,875
It meant I didn't
have to live there.

222
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,916
[ATOSURYUA] I wanted to
stay and enjoy myself

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,416
in Lakfakalle for
the rest of my life.

224
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,291
But then that princess
of yours showed up

225
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,791
and ruined everything.

226
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,250
No more easy life for me!

227
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,541
My princess? I'm sorry,

228
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,875
but if you're talking about who
I think you're talking about,

229
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,708
then she's not my princess.

230
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,916
She's the captain of our ship,
and that's how we address her.

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,208
Don't get touchy!

232
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,875
It was just a
stupid expression--

233
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,416
I didn't mean anything by it!

234
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,583
I see.

235
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,208
I thought that maybe
you were holding

236
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,000
some sort of grudge against her.

237
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,875
You know, from what my
father told me about you,

238
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,958
I got the impression
you were a smart kid,

239
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,833
but I don't see any
evidence of it right now!

240
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,833
Sorry if I offended you.

241
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,333
Even if I did hold a grudge,

242
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,291
why would I bother wasting
my time mentioning it to you?

243
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,916
It would be far
easier to make use

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,708
of my rank and position
to get my revenge on her.

245
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,083
I'd sit tight and wait
for the right opportunity.

246
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,583
A grudge? Hah!

247
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,041
I see, but...

248
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,750
I thought you didn't
want your title.

249
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,958
[laughs] It's no big
deal to me, you know!

250
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,333
Having said that, being the head
of a noble family isn't so bad.

251
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,875
The big house that comes
with being Baroness Febdash

252
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,958
could be nice to live
in with a few renovations

253
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,208
here and there.

254
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,041
I could even take a leaf
out of my brother's book

255
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,416
and surround myself with
lots of handsome young men.

256
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,666
Anyway, there's no point
thinking about this

257
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,083
until the war's over.

258
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,750
Well, I suppose... that's
a good way to look at it.

259
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,333
Anyway.

260
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,125
Tell that princess of yours or
captain--or whatever she is--

261
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,000
that I don't bear
a grudge against her.

262
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,750
What happened, happened,
life goes on,

263
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,125
and we should just
forget about it.

264
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,125
I don't understand.

265
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,708
Why don't you tell her yourself?

266
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,125
[ATOSURYUA]
It's... difficult.

267
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,583
[JINTO]
"Difficult"? Why?

268
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,583
[ATOSURYUA]
She's an Abriel princess, right?

269
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,083
It's fine talking business
with her, but as soon as

270
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,791
you wanna talk about anything
personal or private...

271
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,791
Well, she doesn't exactly
make it easy for you.

272
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
Is that so?

273
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,958
[JINTO]
Aw... It's not fair!

274
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,041
Why do I always have
to be the go-between?

275
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,958
Just because I seem to
get along with everyone,

276
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,875
they assume I can do
the talking for them.

277
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,666
It's not fair!

278
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,208
Don't forget to tell
her what I said.

279
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,166
[JINTO]
I won't.

[LAFIEL] Activate the
forward thrust engines

313
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,250
with minimum propulsion!

314
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,000
Engines activated!

315
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,666
[LAFIEL]
And we're off!

316
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,000
[ATOSURYUA]
This is command speaking.

317
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,125
We now have our official orders.

318
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,125
We are to seize the unidentified
space-time bubbles.

319
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,041
If we identify them
as enemy craft,

320
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,625
we are to eliminate them.

321
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,041
I'll send you the
files containing

322
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,666
the location of our rendezvous.

323
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,375
All ships must try to arrive
there as soon as possible.

324
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,083
Any questions?

325
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,333
Very well.

326
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,958
We have a number of crew
members on this mission

327
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,916
for whom this will be
their first battle!

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,500
To be honest, this is
my first time as well.

329
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,291
Hmph! I have no idea
what that squadron

330
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,625
was doing in Wimpel.

331
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,125
I guess you can't
expect too much

332
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,291
from an advance force.

333
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,708
But their mistakes
are not the issue here.

334
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,791
However you look at it,

335
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,625
the enemy has managed
to outwit us,

336
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,750
and you have to give them
credit for this maneuver.

337
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,708
Salute the courage of the enemy!

338
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,333
We have received the
location of the rendezvous.

339
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,791
I'll forward the information
to your terminal.

340
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,250
Activate the main engines!

341
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,166
[SAMSON]
Main engines activated!

342
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,750
Huh?

343
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,875
Diaho? What are you doing here?!

344
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,791
Let's see who arrives first!

345
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,958
Stay there and you'd
better keep quiet!

346
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,083
Huh?!

347
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,875
Captain!

348
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,666
There's a message from
another ship, the <i>Ryumusof</i> .

349
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,500
They say our actions are
violating safety protocol!

350
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,541
[LAFIEL]
Hm?

351
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,541
They're insisting
they have to speak

352
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,125
directly with you, Captain!

353
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,625
Tell them I'm too busy!

354
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,625
Tell them I can't
talk right now!

355
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,333
Besides, ships like the <i>Ryumusof</i>

356
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,333
probably won't be
fighting in the battle.

357
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,208
They don't seem very pleased.

358
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,916
[LAFIEL]
Senior Aviator!

359
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,583
Are there any ships from
our squadron ahead of us?

360
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,958
[SOBAASH]
Yes, Captain, there's one.

361
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,750
[LAFIEL]
Which one?

362
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,041
The squadron's lead
assault ship, the <i>Gamroil</i> .

363
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,125
[LAFIEL]
Distance?

364
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,625
Approximately two sedaj.

365
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,833
It looks like
Hecto-Commander Atosuryua

366
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,625
will have the honor
of arriving first.

367
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,208
We've been put on standby.

368
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,541
We're also receiving
debriefing information.

369
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,916
I'll display it on
the monitor now.

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,791
[LAFIEL] The yellow symbols
show the space-time bubbles,

371
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,541
which are possible enemy ships?

372
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,125
[SOBAASH] From their mass,
I'd say they're probably

373
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,125
patrol ships. Their objective
is presumably to scout the area

374
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,250
around Wimpel and the Aptic
System in an attempt

375
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,541
to estimate the strength
of our forces.

376
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,833
[LAFIEL]
They're very close.

377
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,708
If we make the decision
to act aggressively,

378
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,333
it's possible we could force
them to abort their mission.

379
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,875
Well, that's fine with me.

380
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,875
Let's get this
over with quickly.

381
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,916
The sooner we finish this,
the sooner I can be in the bar.

382
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,291
I can just see it--my favorite
bottle waiting for me...

383
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,833
I didn't get much of a
chance to drink it earlier.

384
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,083
All this talk of yours
is making me thirsty!

385
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,625
Whaddya say we get a drink?

386
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,541
We're only on standby
so we've got time

387
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,083
before we have to move--

388
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,791
Jinto, instead of
worrying about drinks,

389
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,166
worry about this cat of yours.

390
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,375
[EKURYUA] There he goes again,
getting himself into trouble.

391
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,791
If you're getting drinks,
I'll have a Teal Nom.

392
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,750
You like it hot with Lope
floating in it, don't you?

393
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,000
Coming up, Captain!

394
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,166
[EKURYUA] And I'd like
a SoyAsa, a cold one.

395
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,625
What? Don't you
wanna stay with me?

396
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,125
[DIAHO growls]

397
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,458
Well...

398
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,291
He is my cat, after all!

399
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,833
What? Are you jealous?

400
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,500
I want my drink cold,
with apple flavoring.

401
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,583
You got it.

402
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,500
[SAMSON]
Captain!

403
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,750
Request permission for me to get
something stronger from the bar.

404
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,125
[LAFIEL]
I presume that was a joke.

405
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,500
Sorry, I gotta put you in here.

406
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,958
It'll just be
for a little while.

407
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,583
[SAMSON] I was just trying
to lighten up the mood here!

408
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,833
Come on, humor me!

409
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,166
You could at least pretend
that it was funny!

410
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,500
I don't want anything
to drink, my boy.

411
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,500
Okay, but next time
don't call me "my boy"!

412
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,041
Get rid of that cat
and get involved

413
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,791
with some proper
adult relationships,

414
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,708
then I'll stop calling
you "my boy."

415
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,958
In that case, just
call me "my boy."

416
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,083
While you're there,
I'll have a SoyAsa, too.

417
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,583
There should be some
leaves down there

from the Yoni Kingdom.

419
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,791
And make it with
lots of sugar, please.

[JINTO]
Coming right up!

421

[ATOSURYUA] We have received
our next orders.

422
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,083
All ships in the squadron
are to enter Plane Space.

423

The space-time

positively identified
as enemy ships.

427
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,541
Our mission is
to eliminate them.

428

If we let even a single
one of them get away,

429
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,500
we will have failed.

As this is our first battle,
we must make a good impression.

We have to succeed,
do you understand?

00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,458
in a bid to link our territories
and divide theirs in two.

471
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,833
In doing so, the
Star Forces have conquered

472
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,625
and acquired many Sords
and planet systems.

473
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,041
The First Fleet,
commanded by Admiral Spoor

474
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,875
had led the way and,
even as we speak,

475
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,958
we're expanding our territory.

476
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,750
[JINTO] Although the Third
Aptic System that we conquered

477
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,416
seems distant from the front
line of battle in terms of

478
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,583
regular space, so long
as there are Sords,

479
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,541
which are the gateways
into Plane Space,

480
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,416
we cannot give up the
possibility of enemy attack.

481
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,916
Therefore, as long
as the Sords exist,

482
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,291
that's the front line of battle.

[SOBAASH]
Space-time fusion!

484
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,750
All ships! Attack!

485
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,625
[JINTO]
Our battle has now begun.

486
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,333
Well, maybe...

487
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,875
That's not it at all!

488
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,166
It's that we all survived
the test of our first battle!

489
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,791
Continue with space-time fusion!

490

[GAMROIL'S 2nd OFFICER]
We've just had confirmation

493
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,791
that the <i>Helzroil</i>
has been destroyed.

494
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,375
They must have
retreated too late!

495
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,541
I can't believe there are
casualties in my squadron!

496
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,500
We're being attacked!

497
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,708
[JINTO]
Lafiel!

498
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,083
It's going to be a direct hit!
