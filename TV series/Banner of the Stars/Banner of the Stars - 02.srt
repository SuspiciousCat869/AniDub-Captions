00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,583
[LAFIEL]
Diaho! What is it with you?!

3
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,750
You're supposed to be
Jinto's cat, not mine!

4
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:31,666
Faithfulness obviously isn't
one of your strong points!

5
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,833
Jinto, can't you stop your
cat wandering in here?

6
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,125
Sorry, Lafiel.

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,625
He hasn't been giving you
any trouble, has he?

8
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,500
[LAFIEL] I can understand
you wanting to have a pet

9
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,000
when we're on patrol and
have lots of free time.

10
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,375
But we're going
into battle soon!

11
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,541
And you're not going to
have time to look after him.

12
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,083
And he's going
to get in the way.

13
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,708
Don't you think
it's unfair to him?

14
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,333
It's okay, don't worry.

15
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,000
If we have to evacuate the ship,

16
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,375
I'll make sure to take
Diaho with me when I go.

17
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,125
Don't say that--
you're tempting fate!

18
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,833
Anyway, that's not what I mean.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:10,000
It's unfair to the cat because
it's kind of an artificial life

20
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,958
up here--no mice to catch,

21
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,125
none of the things a
normal cat should have.

22
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,958
There's nothing
I can do about that.

23
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,375
The <i>Basroil's</i> my home.

24
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,333
There's nowhere else
for Diaho to go.

25
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:22,333
There's nothing to stop you
leaving him with somebody else.

26
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,666
There's no regulation against
having a cat on board.

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,875
Common sense dictates
it's not a good idea.

28
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,583
You're not taking
this seriously--

29
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,166
he should leave the ship.

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,541
But, hold on--I thought the Abh

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,583
used to go into battle with
their children on board!

32
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:34,958
A cat's no big deal.

33
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,375
[LAFIEL] Yes, but those were
special circumstances.

34
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,958
We had to be ready to move
at a moment's notice.

35
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,541
We're not in that
situation. At least...

36
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,750
Not yet.

37
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,125
Oh, well, all right.

38
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,875
If I get a chance, I'll take
him back to Lakfakalle.

39
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,083
Not that I can think of anyone
who could look after him.

40
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,208
Everyone I knew from
Officer Training School

41
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,958
is away fighting.

42
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,833
If you want me to intervene
with the royal family

43
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,166
on your behalf, then why
don't you just say so?

44
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,625
[JINTO]
Thanks! That'd be great!

45
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,083
To be honest, I was
hoping you'd say that.

46
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,583
Come on, Diaho.

47
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,833
[meows]

48
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:07,958
[JINTO]
Let's get outta here.

49
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,333
Looks like you're
not welcome anymore.

50
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,416
You stupid...

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,416
[JINTO]
Well, Diaho, it's been a while

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,666
since you went home.

53
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,958
Three whole years. A lot
can happen in that time.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,291
[JINTO] Three years ago,
I got the chance to see

55
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:28,208
where Lafiel was from
for the first time.

56
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,583
A place filled
with glowing light,

57
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,750
a place where the stars meet.

58
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,125
[JINTO] But the only
light ahead of us now

59
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,541
was the light of battle
and it was starting to shine

60
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,625
brighter and brighter.

range in 30 seconds!

to retreat from the enemy's

Set the ship on a
course of 150 degrees

Huh?

[SPOOR] They must've known
they were gonna lose

81
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,208
if we beat them that easily.

82
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:17,708
Why didn't they just run away
while they had the chance?

83
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,666
[KUFADIS] Well, Admiral
Spoor, I expect they

84
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,833
simply miscalculated our speed.

85
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,416
It looks as though
most of the enemy

86
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,916
did manage to escape
before we arrived.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,583
They're probably waiting
for an opportunity

to counterattack.

things that I already know?

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,291
If you carry on this rate,
I'm going to die of boredom.

Excuse me, Commander!

[3rd FLEET COMM. CHIEF]
Message coming through

from Admiral Spoor
of the First Fleet!

97
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,958
[KENESH]
Let's hear it then.

98
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,208
[CREW 2D] The First Fleet
has successfully demolished

99

the enemy's mobile

within the Aptic System.

Full details are available
in the report which can be

102
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,541
sent to you immediately.

103
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,083
Very well then.

104
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,583
As soon as the communication
link is ready, send the file.

105
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,750
I do not expect there to be
any changes to the plans,

106
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,458
but wait until you receive
confirmation before proceeding.

107
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,625
Understood!

108
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,333
Looks like we came out
of that rather well.

109
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,750
No damage to the fleet at all.

110
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,208
[KENESH]
I presume we may now continue

111
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,666
with our plan to have
Admiral Spoor's Fleet advance

112
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,583
and capture the
enemy's major gates,

113
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,375
starting with Miskel,
Dalmav and Demetel.

114
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,041
The attack will then
be sustained in order

115
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,750
to capture further gates.

116
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,208
The Third Fleet
and the Fifth Fleet

117
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,541
will follow Admiral Spoor's
route in order to set up

118
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,375
a main supply line.

119
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,500
[KENESH]
While this is happening,

120
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,208
the Second and Fourth
Fleets will advance

121
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,708
from both sides in a pincer
movement and capture

122
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,000
any inhabited star systems
in order to strengthen

123
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,625
the defensive line.

124
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,916
[DOSANYU] Excellent. By cutting
through enemy territory,

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,583
we should be able to reach
our allies on the other side.

126
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,791
But speed is of the essence.

127
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,125
We've received the report from
the communication ship, sir.

Here you go.

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,583
How far can we advance before
the enemy strikes back?

131
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,708
How far?

132
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,500
[TALAS] Recent events have
made it clear that our fleet

133

isn't powerful enough to
challenge your control of space.

134

However, I hereby pledge
that we shall continue

135
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,916
to combat all ruthless
invaders until you

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,583
leave us alone!

[TALAS] As president
of the United Mankind,

138
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,333
I believe it is my duty
to undertake this challenge.

139
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,083
We shall not flag or fail.

140
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,833
We shall fight on the beaches,
we shall fight in the fields

141
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,458
and in the streets,
we shall fight in the hills.

142
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,250
We will never surrender!

143
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,125
Then I hope you do your best.

144
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,958
Huh? What?

00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,583

While I was wasting
my time listening

to that fool drone on, anything
happen I should know about?

Yes.

We have successfully
managed to take over

the area of space
around Aptic III.

157

percent of the enemy's

158

anti-substance fuel
production facilities

159
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,833
around the Aptic star.

160
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,250
This means that our own mobile

161
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,500
anti-substance fuel-production
factories are now

162
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,291
62 percent complete.

163
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,166
Our plan to set up
an operations base

164
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,500
on Aptic IV, complete with
a supply depot for solid fuel

165
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:27,041
and propellant extract, is now
about 17 percent complete.

166
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,958
We estimate that getting
the operations center up

167
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,958
and running will take the
greatest amount of time,

168
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,958
but in approximately
218 hours...

169
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,416
So basically, everything is
going according to plan, yes?

170
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,750
Uh... Yes?

171
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,375
[SPOOR] So next time,
do me a favor and just say

172
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,250
there's no change when
there's no change, got it?

173
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,291
How long have you been
doing this anyway?

174
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,750
Don't you think it's
about time you learned

175
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,791
to give more concise answers?

176
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,750
Of course, I understand.
I'll try to be more careful.

177
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,875
[SPOOR] This is very
boring, isn't it, Chief?

178
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,083
[KUFADIS] Jeez, what does
the admiral want from me?

179
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,291
[SPOOR]
Communications Chief!

180
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,208
I want you to call
Rosesh for me.

181
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,125
Yes, ma'am!

182
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,333
[SPOOR]
Commander!

183
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,416
How are the preparations
for departure going?

184
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,250
Perfectly, Commander in Chief!

185
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,750
Hear that? Nice and concise.

186
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,208
That was a perfect
response, dear Chief!

187
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,208
[sighs]

188
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,708
Let's prepare to
depart immediately!

189
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,875
Yes!

190
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,500
We'll send the scout
ship squadron Dikspa

191
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,666
to the Miskel system
to search the regions there

192
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,791
in accordance with our plans.

193
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,791
[sighs]

194
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,458
I am so, so bored!

195
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,708
[SAMSON] Here's a toast
to the beloved blue earth!

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,333
Samson, you should have
got off the ship

197
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,583
and gone for a visit.

198
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,791
Ah, that's good!

199
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,333
No. No way I could do that.

200
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,916
But why not?

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,416
Officers who head down there

202
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,166
are usually given the cold
shoulder by the regular crew.

203
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,583
They think we're
gonna put a damper

204
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,666
on them having a good time.

205
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,333
[SAMSON]
At least, that's how I felt

206
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,875
before I became an officer.

207
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,791
I remember giving
them some real grief

208
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,541
for intruding on our--
er--"activities"!

209
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,208
Now that the positions
are reversed,

210
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,791
I couldn't possibly
spoil their fun.

211
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,791
[JINTO] In that case, I guess
there's not much point

212
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,333
in me going down there then?

213
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,708
[SAMSON laughs]

214
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,708
Yeah, you being a
member of the nobility

215
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,208
as well as an officer...

216
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,250
You probably wouldn't
be too popular!

217
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,208
But it's all an
experience, right?

218
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,291
Waiter!

219
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,000
I mean, if you really
want to go down

220
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,666
to the planet, I won't stop you.

221
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,208
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

222
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,083
I've had plenty of experiences
like that already.

223
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,916
[SAMSON]
Huh? That's too bad.

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,625
Are ya sure you don't wanna go?

225
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,458
Yeah, I'm sure.

226
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,416
You know, the thing
I miss most is nature.

227
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,750
Cheers.

228
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,291
When you're up here in space,

229
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,208
well, sure you can have a drink,
but you don't get the chance

230
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,458
to appreciate nature
in the same way.

231
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:01,000
You know, sometimes,
I regret becoming an officer.

232
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,958
The president of the
Aptic System is trying

233
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,208
to get through to us again!

234
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,541
What does he want
to say to us now?

235
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,291
I don't wanna hear his
grumbling and complaining.

236
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,708
I think it was a bit more
serious than a complaint.

237
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,458
Really? Then what was it?

238
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,791
I've got an idea.
Why don't you take my place

239
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,625
and listen to what that bumbling
fool has to say this time?

240
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,458
Tell him I'm far
too busy right now.

241
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:25,125
[laughs] Very well, Admiral.

242
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,458
Transfer the call to me.

243
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,166
It's coming through now.

244
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,000
[KUFADIS]
Good day, Mr. President.

245
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,625
The commander in chief is
currently occupied elsewhere.

246
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,541
I have the honor of accepting
your message on her behalf.

247
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,708
[TALAS]
What is your rank?

248
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,916
I'm the chief of staff.

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,625
My name is Kufadis, sir.

250
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,916
The chief of staff?

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,333
Then you're just the man.

252
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,666
Before I speak with your
commander in chief again,

253
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,666
there's an issue I think I need
to bring to your attention.

254
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,875
I hope you don't mind.

255
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,541
[KUFADIS]
Of course not--what is it?

256
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,583
[TALAS] Well, I believe there
must be some sort of fault

257
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,750
with your communication system.

258
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,875
[KUFADIS]
As far as we're aware,

259
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,708
everything is working perfectly.

260
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,000
[TALAS]
But that's strange.

261
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,958
I thought I gave you
a very clear message

262
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,541
that we intend to fight
to the bitter end.

263
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,375
[KUFADIS] Yes. I do
recall hearing something

264
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,375
along those lines.

265
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,875
[TALAS]
Well then, I wonder if it's our

266
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,250
communication system that
isn't working properly.

267
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,958
You see, I could be wrong,
but I'm positive I heard

268
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,833
your commander in chief
encourage us.

269
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,375
[KUFADIS]
Yes, sir, that is correct.

270
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,916
Huh?! I'm puzzled.

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I declare our
intention to fight,

272
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,583
Then your commander
in chief, our enemy,

273
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,541
decides that she wants
to encourage us?

274
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,333
It doesn't make any sense!

275
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,666
Yes, I see what you mean.

276
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,750
[TALAS] I thought I'd
done my best to cultivate

277
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,416
an understanding of the Abh
culture and way of life

278
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,000
so that I could communicate
effectively with you.

279
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,791
But obviously, it
wasn't good enough.

280
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,541
I don't understand it at all!

281
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,416
So, tell us why you
became an Abh, then.

282
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,000
Huh? An Abh? Me?

283
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,416
Well, let's see...

284
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,708
Once I'd become an officer,

285
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,000
the next step to
becoming a member

286
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,000
of the elite class
was to become an Abh.

287
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,000
I like all the privileges
that go with being

288
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,208
part of that crowd!

289
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,916
But in the long run,
all I really wanna do

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,416
is go back home and retire.

291
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,958
Maybe do some farming.

292
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,958
But why did you enter
the Imperial Fleet

293
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,375
in the first place?

294
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,083
I dreamt of going into space.

295
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,333
Joining the Fleet was a way
of fulfilling the dream.

296
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,166
Once I got up here,
I realized that

297
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,833
it wasn't really what
I wanted out of life.

298
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,625
I mean, it's all very
nice and everything,

299
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,750
but knowing how to
operate a spaceship

300
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,208
isn't a lot of help to
you down on the planet.

301
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,166
So I decided to become an
officer, make as much money

302
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,625
as I could, as fast as I could,

303
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,750
and save up to buy
myself a little farm.

304
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,875
[JINTO] So does that mean
you're gonna retire soon?

305
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,125
No, not yet.

306
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,541
According to my calculations,

307
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,458
I need to take part in
a couple more battles

308
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,000
before I have enough
money saved up.

309
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,458
Gotta keep working till then!

310
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,041
What kind of calculations?

311
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,583
Well, it's not just the money.

312
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,958
The time's gotta be right.

313
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,166
I'm not ready for
retirement just yet.

314
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,041
I'm not sure how much
you know about us,

315
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,625
Mr. President, but like
every race, you will find

316
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,291
a lot of variety and
differences between us.

317
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,083
Most of us, myself included,

318
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,125
would find it unusual
to offer our enemies

319
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,833
any kind of encouragement.

320
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,416
[TALAS]
Hold on just a minute!

321
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,416
Are you trying to tell me that
your commander in chief is...

322
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
How shall I put this--
are you trying to tell me

323
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,208
that she's not normal? Well?

324
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,875
Choose your words carefully.

325
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,125
Oh, yes, my appologies.

326
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,625
So if you were in her place,

327
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,750
what would your
response have been?

328
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,250
I'd probably tell you
to do as you like...

329
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,458
...for as long as you could.

330
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,666
[TALAS sighs]

331
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,166
I'm afraid that's no better.

332
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,958
Where did you say your
home planet was again?

333
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,750
Ah, yes.

334
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,791
Ah... Midgrad.

335
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,041
You'd probably know it by
its Abh name: Planet Dakufo.

336
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,208
Heard of it?

337
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,708
[JINTO]
Sorry, no.

338
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,416
[SAMSON laughs]
That's disappointing!

339
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,625
I have to admit that
it's not very well known,

340
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,416
but we do have a place
in the history books.

341
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,541
We learned how to travel in
space before the empire did!

342
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,416
Whoa!

343
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,291
In the past, our
planet had to decide

344
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,166
between belonging
to the United Mankind

345
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,708
or to the Human Empire Abh.

346
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,041
To cut a long story short,
we pledged allegiance

347
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,875
to the empire.

348
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,458
What made you decide
to go with them?

349
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,916
[sighs] Well, if
you must know...

350
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,916
Our eating habits are,
well, quite unique.

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Outsiders are sometimes taken
aback by the things we eat.

352
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,166
Before we pledged
allegiance to one nation,

353
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,750
some people from the United
Mankind talked to our leaders

354
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,291
and tried to get us to
change our eating habits.

355
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,541
On the other hand, the Abh

356
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,375
didn't say anything
about how we ate.

357
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,125
Or at least, not in front of us.

358
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,541
That was probably what swung
things in their favor.

359
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,166
Then we figured that
if they'd let us eat

360
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,125
what we've always eaten,
we could compromise

361
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,333
and let them call
Mid Grad by another name.

362
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,875
So now it's Planet Dakufo--
to the Abh at least!

363
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,291
So that's the story
of how we came

364
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,458
to be with the empire!

365
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,375
So what do you eat?

366
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,125
[SAMSON]
Mm... You don't wanna know.

367
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,583
I've lost too many
friends this way

368
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,125
and I don't wanna lose another.

369
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,375
But I'm not your friend--
I just work with you.

370
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,541
[JINTO, SAMSON]
Hm?

371
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,875
That's pretty blunt--
you Abhs certainly

372
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,375
don't worry about holding back!

373
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,208
[JINTO chuckles]
Why are you so surprised?

374
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,375
You've been an Abh
for way longer than me!

375
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,208
I only became one three
years ago, remember?

376
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,708
Sorry, did I insult you?

377
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,958
Nah, you're okay.

378
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,208
[SPOOR]
Hm. This is interesting!

379
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,458
The president wanted me
to reply to his challenge

380
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,541
with some sort of
official counter-challenge?

381
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,958
A summons to surrender?

382
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,166
Yes.

383
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,583
Standing up and pledging
to fight to the end

384
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,875
against an invading force
is a very attractive way

385
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:18,708
to win votes.

386
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,875
[TALAS]
You see,

387
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,125
when I used the term
"ruthless invaders,"

388
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,916
I was just trying to make it
more appealing to the voters.

389
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,208
Nothing more, no offense meant.

390
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,791
[KUFADIS] The president
also asked if you could

391
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,875
spice up the summons to
surrender with some insults,

392
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,000
racial slurs,
that sort of thing.

393
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,833
Well, well, well!

394
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,541
This gets more interesting
by the minute!

395
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,416
Although it's a shame he
didn't tell me about it

396
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,708
straight away, instead
of making me think

397
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,916
he actually believed
his own bluster.

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,416
Who knows?

399
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,833
I might actually have gone
along with such a crazy idea!

400
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,375
Huh?

401
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,166
Besides, His Imperial Highness,

402
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,750
the commander in chief,
will be here soon.

403
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,208
I have to leave
all that official

404
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,333
"demand for surrender" stuff
to him--you know he loves

405
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,666
every minute of it!

406
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,833
Did you ever hear what
he told the Hyde System

407
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,208
when they had to relinquish
their sovereignty?

408
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,500
[KUFADIS]
No, I don't think I did.

409
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,541
[SPOOR]
He was actually very impressive.

410
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,250
Considering he's an Abriel,

411
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,666
it was very high-handed,
nicely sarcastic,

412
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,541
and extremely effective.

413
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,625
You should know that the task
of governing your world...

414
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,500
...is not a priority for us.

415
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,750
In fact, it is far from elegant.

416
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,791
[SPOOR] If it was me,
I'm sure that I could have

417
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,083
put it much more elegantly.

418
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,083
Oh, and by the way, Chief...

419
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,541
Yes? What do you want?

420
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,708
[SPOOR] The president wants
us to use something

421
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,208
called "racial slurs"?

422
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,916
[KUFADIS]
Hm? Yes.

423
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,333
Yes, phrases like:

424
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,875
"you lousy land-loving pig!"
or "bunch of crawling,

425
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,416
slack-jawed mud turtles!"

426
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,458
Oh, I understand now. Well...

427
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,541
They're a little bit old
fashioned but there's something

428
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,458
about them, don't you think?

429
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,583
[KUFADIS] She's not seriously
thinking of using them?

430
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,125
[DIAHO meows]

431
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,625
You can stop your
whining, Diaho.

432
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,833
I'm not gonna let you out--
not with all these squirrels

433
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,958
around to tempt you!

434
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,166
[DIAHO meows]

435
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,291
[JINTO]
When I say "no" I mean "no"!

436
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,250
[DIAHO meows]

437
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,375
Jinto! How come you
brought your cat?

438
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,708
[JINTO] Well, I couldn't leave
him on board the <i>Basroil</i> .

439
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,875
There was nobody left
there to look after him!

440
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,416
[EKURYUA]
But he hasn't been with you!

441
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,166
Did he get a little
vacation as well?

442
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,708
He was looked after.

443
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,708
I took him to a place where
there were lots of other cats

444
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,833
staying and lots of mice
to chase and catch.

445
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,000
Think he had fun?

446
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,166
I think so.

447
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,750
But the captain told me
I had to send him

448
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,375
back home to Lakfakalle.

449
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,458
Why'd she do that?

450
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,416
She didn't think havin'
a cat on board the ship

451
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
was very appropriate--especially
if we're heading into battle.

452
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,958
So now I've gotta say
goodbye to Diaho.

453
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,083
I'll be sorry to see him go.

454
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,791
I've kind of got used to having
him around all the time.

455
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,666
He's pretty cute, for a cat.

456
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,000
Hey, be careful!

457
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,625
Watch what you're sayin'
in front of him, will ya?

458
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,291
We don't want him
to get a big head!

459
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,916
I thought all cats
had big heads,

460
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,291
not just Diaho!

461
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,333
What a profound
insight that is.

462
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,000
[SAMSON]
Captain?!

463
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,583
[LAFIEL] We've finally been
assigned to a squadron.

464
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,708
We're going to be flying with

465
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,250
the Battleship
Squadron Latouche,

466
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,750
as part of the First Division
of the 1058th Battalion.

467
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,083
We'll be leaving
in about 12 hours.

468
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,375
[SAMSON] If you ask me, that
seems just a little bit hasty.

469
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,583
[LAFIEL]
I agree.

470
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,500
But it's supposedly
part of our training.

471
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,250
[EKURYUA] Do you know
what happens after this?

472
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,333
[SOBAASH]
It looks like we'll be heading

473
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,666
to a different system.

474
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,041
[EKURYUA]
Which one?

475
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,583
[SOBAASH] They haven't given
us any information yet.

476
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,458
I guess we'll just have to wait
until we arrive to find out.

477
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,291
[LAFIEL] There's still two hours
and 18 minutes of leave left

478
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,833
before we have to return.

479
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,875
However, I would
appreciate it if you'd

480
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,833
start preparing to
leave immediately.

481
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,125
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

482
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,166
Not me!

483
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,083
To be honest,
things were gettin'

484
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,791
a bit boring down here anyway.

485
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,416
Very well. Officer Ekuryua,
please get the Calike ready

486
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,208
for transport back to the ship.

487
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,791
We'll be heading
back before you.

488
00:21:58,875 --> 00:21:59,625
Right away!

489
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,250
Let's go!

490
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,375
[JINTO]
Roger!

491
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,333
And what've you got there?

492
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,250
Uh... Don't you recognize him?

493
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,125
This is Diaho, Captain.

494
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,416
[LAFIEL]
I thought I told you to send him

495
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,333
back home to Lakfakalle.

496
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,708
I was gonna do it before
I got back on board.

497
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,791
I'll have to go and make
the arrangements now.

498
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,125
There isn't enough time.

499
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,416
You can bring him with you.
But just this once.

500
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,875
Next time, make sure
you're more organized.

501
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,166
Of course. Thank you, Captain.

502
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,625
Huh! That was rough!

503
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,666
You'd never guess she was
speaking to a fellow officer

504
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,333
from that conversation!

505
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,916
Jinto!

506
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,375
Do you know the name of our new
storm troop squadron commander?

507
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,416
Why do you think I'd know
something like that?

508
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,250
I'll tell you. Her name's
Hecto-Commander Atosuryua.

509
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,750
Atosuryua, yeah?

510
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,291
That seems familiar. Where
would I have heard that before?

511
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,541
C'mon, use your head!

512
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,166
If you have any brains, that is.

513
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,083
Nope. All my brains
have turned to mush.

514
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,250
Sorry about that!

515
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,958
You do know that she's
the younger sister

516
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,791
of Baron Febdash...

517
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,166
Nicely done...

518
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,000
...Your Highness!

519
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,666
Huh?

520
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,958
You know, Your Majesty,

521
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,291
if I didn't know you
better, I'd say that your

522
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:51,625
behavior is verging
on being incorrigible.

523
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:52,791
Is that a compliment?

524
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,291
And I have no doubt
that you'll give us

525
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,875
plenty of opportunities
in the future

526
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,375
to reinforce that idea,
given your track record.

527
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,333
Hecto-Commander Atosuryua!

528
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,833
We're not in training anymore--
this is the real thing!

529
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,208
Activate the main engine!

530
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,041
Let's see who arrives first!

531
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,208
We've received a request
from the <i>Gamroil</i>

532
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,833
to perform space-time fusion.

533
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,333
Salute the enemy.
