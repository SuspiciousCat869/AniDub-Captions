1
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,958
Prepare to fire the
anti-proton cannon!

2
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,375
Preparations for opening
the front port complete!

3
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,125
[SOBAASH]
Opening now!

4
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,333
[SOBAASH] Safety devices
for number five and six

5
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,375
have been released!

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,291
[LAFIEL]
Get the laser cannons ready!

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,625
[SOBAASH]
We have less than 20 seconds

8
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,583
before space-time fusion.

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,583
[SOBAASH]
Ten...

10
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,625
Nine...

11
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:47,458
Eight...

12
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,416
Seven...

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,458
Six...

14
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,458
Five...

15
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,500
Four...

16
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,500
Three...

17
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,416
Two...

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,416
One.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,958
Space-time fusion!

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,583
All ships, attack!

21
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:17,125
[NARRATOR speaking Baronh]

22
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,375
The first group of
mines has been

23
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,833
confirmed as destroyed.

24
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,291
[sighs]

25
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,000
Our first orders
have been carried out.

26
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,916
Initiate space-time separation!

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,916
Starting space-time separation!

28
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,791
[SAMSON]
That wasn't so bad!

29
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,875
Finally, we're
seeing some action.

30
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,666
Unfortunately, while we
were watching out

31
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,000
for mines, the enemy ship
has moved further ahead.

32
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,541
Captain, there's been
a message from command.

33
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,875
They want us in single
column formation.

34
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,166
Senior Aviator!
Single column formation!

35
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,583
Roger, Captain.

36
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,291
[LAFIEL] Our assault ship
squadrons are hunting down

37
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,916
the enemy patrol
ships one by one.

38
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,000
[JINTO] This situation
reminds me of something.

39
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,333
It's just like the time
we were on the <i>Gosroth</i> .

40
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,666
[LAFIEL]
Hm.

41
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,791
[LAFIEL] Just because
we survived that time

42
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,458
doesn't mean we'll be safe here.

43
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,083
This time we're at the
forefront of the battle.

44
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,000
If we manage to get out of
this without any casualties...

45
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,833
...it'll be a miracle.

46
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,208
It wouldn't surprise me...
if they wiped us out.

47
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,458
You know, you haven't
changed one bit.

48
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,333
[LAFIEL]
Hm?

49
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,083
To be totally honest with you,

50
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,375
I'm finding this whole
situation pretty scary.

51
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,333
And if I'm honest with you...

52
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,791
...it scares me, too.

53
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,125
Knowing I'm not the only
one makes me feel better.

54
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,125
Huh?

55
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,541
How could knowing
that I'm afraid

56
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,166
possibly make you
feel any better?

57
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,250
Well... that's a good question!

58
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,416
I suppose it's nice knowing
you're not on your own--

59
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,875
it makes things
easier to handle.

60
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,708
It would seem kind of unfair
if I was the only one

61
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,458
who was afraid!

62
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,583
Well, maybe...

63
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,083
But I don't think
there's anyone here

64
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,416
who isn't afraid.

65
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,208
Perhaps with the exception
of your cat over there.

66
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,333
The only time Diaho's
afraid is when it's time

67
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,750
for him to have his bath--
he's petrified by the idea!

68
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:11,000
[JINTO] Yeah, it's true...
We are all afraid.

69
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,166
Except maybe one
person on this ship,

70
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,375
who has some
experience in battle.

71
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,250
Samson, who survived the battle

72
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,500
at Scaresche Gate
three years ago.

73
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,083
We have 12 minutes
until we experience

74
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,875
space-time fusion
with the enemy!

75
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,166
[LAFIEL]
Hm.

76
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,083
[LAFIEL] I can't believe we're
seriously going to attack

77
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,791
all those enemy patrol
ships when we only have

78
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,041
six ships in our squadron!

79
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,125
Some people would
call it brave--

80
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,583
others would call it suicidal.

81
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,875
The lead ship <i>Gamroil</i> has begun
to decrease its speed.

82
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,125
[sighs] What a relief!

83
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,541
I thought our six assault ships

84
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,208
were gonna have to
fight the enemy alone!

85
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,458
I expect we're holding back

86
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,791
so the other squadrons
can catch up with us.

87
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,958
It's a good thing
Hecto-Commander Asuryua

88
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,750
knows what she's doing here.

89
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,125
There's been a change
to the schedule

90
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,000
for space-time fusion.

91
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,083
[SOBAASH] The 4th assault
unit is approaching!

92
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,083
[EKURYUA] Transmission received
requesting us to move

93
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,791
into a parallel formation.

94
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,916
[LAFIEL] Senior Aviator,
I'll leave that to you.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,250
[SOBAASH]
Roger!

96
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,375
Estimated time until
space-time fusion is now...

97
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,791
...ten minutes.

98
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,458
I guess we just
have to sit tight

99
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,333
for the next ten minutes.

100
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,750
Yes.

101
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,166
[EKURYUA] The 2nd and 5th
assault units have entered

102
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,333
into space-time fusion with
the enemy patrol ships.

103
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,958
[LAFIEL] It's like a pack
of animals waiting

104
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,500
to launch an attack
on their prey.

105
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,458
You ever see
somethin' like that?

106
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,916
Not in real life--
just in a documentary.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,250
[JINTO]
Hm.

108
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,666
Looks to me like it's all over.

109
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,125
Yes.

110
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,583
We did suffer casualties,
but our side was victorious.

111
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,666
Everyone, it's our turn next!

112
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,541
Captain! The enemy ship's
space-time bubble has divided!

113
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,750
There's now four of them!

114
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,500
They're probably mines!

115
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,125
I'm surprised they
had some left.

116
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,583
Releasing those
mines was probably

117
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,750
an act of desperation,
only done as a last resort.

118
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,625
And what does
Squadron Command say?

119
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,541
We've heard nothing yet.

120
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,500
Wait, here's something now.

121
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,541
It's a message coming
from headquarters.

122
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,375
It says, "Do what
you have to do."

123
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,750
I see.

124
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,291
[LAFIEL]
This is like last time.

125
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,833
We can't enter space-time fusion

126
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,875
and just wait for
them to attack us.

127
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,125
Jinto, you shall quickly
return to your position.

128
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,250
You'll be in charge of
monitoring the air pressure

129
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,791
on the ship and treating
any casualties.

130
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,208
But those mines are headed
straight for us, aren't they?!

131
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,375
If we get hit by one of them,

132
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,750
we're gonna be blown to pieces!

133
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,333
I don't think there's
anything I can do to help

134
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,666
if that happens.

135
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,291
I suppose that's true.

136
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,791
Well, do what you want.

137
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,333
Just make sure you're
steady on your feet

138
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,458
and keep out the way.

139
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,291
If you fall over,
land on top of me

140
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,375
and distract me somehow,
you'll be the death of us all!

141
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,916
I'll be careful.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,583
The space-time bubbles suspected
as enemy mines approaching!

143
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,250
They've passed by
the side of the <i>Gamroil</i> ,

144
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,708
and are heading this way!

145
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,375
Distance: five...

146
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,541
...4...

147
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,000
...3.5...

148
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,375
...3.2...

149
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,958
...3.1...

150
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,000
...3.3...

151
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,583
The enemy space-time bubbles
have gone right past us!

152
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,833
[BOTH sighs]

153
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,958
That was close!

154
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,083
At least we avoided
the shame of dying

155
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,916
in our first battle ever!

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,875
The enemy space-time bubbles!

157
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,291
They're entering
space-time fusion

158
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,125
with the ship at the rear!

159
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,833
[gasps] Is it the <i>Leekroil</i> ?

160
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,416
No, it's the <i>Kidroil</i> .

161
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,375
[KIDROIL PILOT] Confirmation
of space-time fusion

162
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,708

I can see the other

They're merging their

We have to re-enter
the space-time bubble!

gave us permission

to leave the

I don't believe it!

Couldn't we have just
let the other ships

of the battle?

It's a massacre.

It doesn't seem fair at all.

[EKURYUA] It doesn't matter
whether you like it or not.

364
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,625
Assault ships like these
aren't very strong.

365
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,833
This is the best way to
fight against patrol ships

366
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,958
which are more powerful
than we are.

I'm sorry, Captain.

368

You're right. Of course it is.

369
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,708
I hope there's time
for one more shot.

[ATOSURYUA] <i>Basroil</i> !
All ships are to retreat!

I'm sorry--I know you've only
just re-entered the battlefield.

All ships!

Separate from the space-time
bubble immediately!

374
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,416
Why are we giving up now

375
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,416
when we're so close
to destroying them?!

376
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,583
You're right, I know.

377
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,750
However, we received
these orders

378
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,125
directly from headquarters.

379
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,750
The battleship squadron
is ready for action

380
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,791
on the front line.

381
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,208
They've decided to use mines

382
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,166
to destroy the patrol
ship we were after.

383
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,208
[LAFIEL]
Very well. I understand.

384
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,916
Prepare for
space-time separation.

You okay, Captain?

387
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,750
They've made the right decision.

388
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,875
The fact that we nearly
destroyed that patrol ship

389
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,291
isn't important--after all,
if we'd carried on,

390
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:51,041
we'd have run the risk of losing
another one or two of our ships.

391
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,375
Using mines means there
will be no more casualties.

392
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,416
It's definitely the most
sensible course of action.

393
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,125
[SOBAASH]
Space-time separation!

Mine attacks have now commenced.

00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,875
[SAMSON]
What a sight!

396
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,458
Enemy patrol ship is destroyed.

397
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,875
[LAFIEL] Perhaps our role
as an assault ship squadron

398
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,708
is not to fight, but simply
to keep the enemy at bay.

[JINTO]
Captain...

400
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,500
[LAFIEL]
Huh?

401
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,250
I think we should all
get ourselves a drink.

402
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,875
And then we should have a toast!

403
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,250
What do you mean "a toast"?

404

What is there to celebrate?
We didn't win a battle.

Yes, I know we didn't.

surviving our first campaign!

Hm. Well... maybe you're right.

That's very thoughtful
of you, my boy!

You're welcome! But nothing
alcoholic, right, Captain?

[CREW laughs]

413
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,625
[JINTO]
So...

414
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,083
Here on the assault
ship <i>Basroil</i> ,

415
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,708
we had successfully survived
our first campaign!

416
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,375
[JINTO] And I believe that
survival is an achievement

417
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,083
worth celebrating!

418
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,666
[JINTO] But while we were
fighting in one section

419
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,375
of the battlefield,
the relative period of calm

420
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,958
elsewhere was coming to an end.

421
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,375
The machinery of war
was moving into action.

422
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,375
The United Mankind managed

423
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,083
to send out
reconnaissance missions

424
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,000
to five different
planet systems,

425
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,666
including the Aptic system.

426
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,041
That's a lot of manpower,
but we didn't destroy them all.

427
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,750
[KENESH] We were successful
in eliminating

428
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,958
about half of them.

429
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,958
The remaining ships
probably returned

430
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,500
to the United Mankind with
important information.

431
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,083
[DUSANYU]
That cannot be helped.

432
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,833
However, these reconnaissance
missions of theirs

433
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,666
can be useful to us.

434
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,208
Surely we discovered
valuable information

435
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,250
about the strength of
their fleets from this?

436
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,666
Absolutely correct.

437
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,750
According to the analysis
made by the chief

438
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,583
of our Communications
Department,

439
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,833
the enemy's numbers
fall somewhere between

440
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,125
180 and 200 squadrons.

441
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,416
[DUSANYU gasps]

442
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,708
[DUSANYU]
Maybe I've underestimated them.

443
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,125
[DUSANYU] Allow me to consider
this for a moment.

444
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,166
I'll return to the
bridge shortly.

445
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,500
Very good, sir. Understood.

446
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,708
[DUSANYU] The enemy appears
to be recovering quickly.

447
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,916
This would suggest they
had some inside knowledge

448
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,583
of our plans.

449
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,458
But if they didn't,

450
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,208
then the situation is
much more worrying,

451
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,166
because that would mean
that the massive fleet

452
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,625
in this area is just
the tip of the iceberg.

453
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:42,000
In that case, there's only
one course of action open to us.

454
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,125
[JINTO] The battle that
the <i>Basroil</i> was involved in

455
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,708
was only one small part
of the operation.

456
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,041
As soon as we had finished
our first campaign

457
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,000
and were getting ready
for a well-deserved rest,

458
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:01,791
Operation Phantom Flame
moved into the next phase.

459
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,833
[NEREIS]
Are they worthy of us?

460
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,875
[NEFEE]
I think so.

461
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,958
Lafiel! I...!

462
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,583
I've heard people say
his chief of staff

463
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,666
is also a Bebaus.
So we're outta luck!

464
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,375
You think there's
some common sense

465
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,500
in that head of yours,
right, Nereis?

466
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,625
Huh?

467
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,458
Are you saying I
haven't got any? Nefee?

468
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,625
[JINTO yelps]

469
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,333
[DUSANYU]
Why don't we let Admiral Bebaus

470
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,250
head up that creak?

471
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,333
A person with many loves
will not be promoted.
