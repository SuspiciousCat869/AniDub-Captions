00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,541
[LAFIEL]
When I was still a child,

3
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:38,166
we always played the same game
in the zero-gravity garden.

4
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,125
[CHILDREN chattering, laughing]

5
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,458
[whistle blows]

6
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,708
[LAFIEL]
To win the game

7
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,333
you had to knock your
opponent's lance away.

8
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:52,666
It sounds easy, but it was rare
for a game to finish quickly.

9
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,916
The players would repeatedly
launch themselves

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,041
at each other, only making
contact with their lances.

11
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,416
Eventually, one of them
would lose their balance,

12
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,666
or simply be overpowered,
and the lance

13
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,791
would get knocked
out of their hands.

14
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,083
[LAFIEL]
This game was known as jousting.

15
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,166
[SHIDORYUA]
You're leaving?

16
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,125
[GUEN] Yes, my term of office
is due to end shortly.

17
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,666
Therefore, I would like you,
as Prime Minister,

18
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,541
to convey a message
of farewell to

19
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,958
her Imperial Highness
the Empress.

20
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,083
[SHIDORYUA] I'm sure that won't
be a problem, Ambassador.

21
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,125
During the past three years, the
only country to have retained

22
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,458
diplomatic ties with
the Empire was yours--

23
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,583
the Federation of Hania.

24
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,708
[GUEN] Prime Minister,
I want you to understand

25
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,416
that our country did not ally
ourselves to those countries

26
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,375
whom we consider
respectable simply

27
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,291
so we could take
part in the war.

28
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,125
However, the fact remains
that we are still members

29
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,125
of the Nova Sicily
Treaty Organization.

30
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,291
Of course. I'm well aware
of that fact, Ambassador.

31
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,250
But you have to admit
that your country

32
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,541
does act quite differently
from the other countries

33
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,041
within the Treaty,

34
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,916
so you must forgive me if your
alliance with them happens

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,083
to slip my mind occasionally.

36
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,458
Oh...?

37
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,250
And what exactly do you
mean by acting differently?

38
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,875
[SHIDORYUA] Other countries
within the treaty

39
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,041
have a tendency to
trivialize any differences

40
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,791
in our political systems.

41
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,125
For instance,

42
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,041
the difference between
imperialism and democracy.

43
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,500
But that is a vast difference
which produces a huge gulf

44
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,750
between those other
countries and our Empire.

45
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,666
I don't suppose that has
anything to do with why you,

46
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,791
a Lander, wanted to achieve
the highest rank possible

47
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,166
in the Empire's
political system?

48
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,041
[SHIDORYUA] Hm. I suppose
you could put it that way.

49
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,541
But, instead...

50
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,166
...what do you think
of this for a reason?

51
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,250
The Empire is the only
force around that is able

52
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,250
to curtail the onslaught
of the modern era,

53
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,666
which is advancing
on our worlds

54
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,041
with the power of
a raging dragon.

55
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,041
Do you follow me?

56
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,333
Hm. I'm not sure I understand

57
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,958
what you're suggesting,
Prime Minister.

58
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,375
[SHIDORYUA]
Really?

59
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,833
But then I suppose it's wise
for you to be cautious.

[CREW 11A]

[JINTO] Our ship, the <i>Basroil,</i>
was still in the middle

62
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,583
of a battle to defend
the Aptic Gate.

63

[sighs]

64
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,500
With the guard ships
on the front line,

65
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,333
things have become
a lot easier for us.

66
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,333
Yes. Did the ship
suffer any damage?

67
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,041
The armor plating was hit in
23 places, and there were

68
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,333
slight pressure leaks in
seven of those, Captain.

69
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,958
But they've already
been taken care of.

70
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,583
What about propulsion,
engine, and weaponry?

No problems to report.

I'm afraid you
don't understand.

00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,083
We can make a
temporary retreat

84
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,625
precisely because we're still
in a position to fight.

If you haven't seen enough
of the battlefield yet,

are no more queries,

we'll begin to retreat at
maximum battle speed.

transmitted to you.

[LAFIEL]
Huh?

101
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,500
I thought that maybe
a nice cold drink

102
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,000
would be good for you right now.

103
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,750
And so I took the liberty
of getting you one.

104
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,500
But if you want to drink
your own blood, go ahead!

105
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,791
I don't know what
you're talking about.

106
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,250
What are you insinuating?

107
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,666
[JINTO]
Oh, nothing!

108
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,333
It's just that it looked like
you were getting thirsty

109
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,125
for something more
than a cold drink.

110
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,125
But I'd draw the line at blood!

111
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,708
Of course. I would, too!

112
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,500
Oh, so you mean you weren't
hungry for blood after all!

113
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,916
No! Of course not!

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,625
All right, no need
to bite my head off!

115
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,750
It was only a joke!

00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,833
Sorry to interrupt this
entertaining conversation,

118
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,125
but could you give
the crew permission

119
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,958
to remove their pressure suits?

120
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,458
The danger has passed
for the moment

121
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,958
and working in
those suits can be

122
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,333
fairly uncomfortable for them.

123
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,666
[LAFIEL]
Sorry, I didn't think of that.

124
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,666
Permission granted.

125
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,875
Why, thank you, great lady!

126
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,958
And why was our
conversation so entertaining?

127
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,416
No reason.

128
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,458
Just sounded like you two
were havin' fun back there.

129
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,958
[NEFEE] It appears we
severely underestimated

130
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,083
the number of mines the enemy
had available to them.

131
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,458
So, the mine attacks
are continuing?

132
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,458
It's a completely
irrational way to fight.

133
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,708
I'd prefer to win irrationally

134
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,125
than to lose a simply because
we were being rational.

135
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,500
[NEREIS]
That goes for me, too.

136
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,958
But in this instance, we
don't have any say over how

137
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,125
the enemy chooses to fight.

138
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,833
Our patrol ships
will undoubtedly

139
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,666
run out of mines soon.

140
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,666
[NEREIS] Give them permission to
use the electromagnetic cannons.

141
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,083
[NEFEE] Yes, I suppose that's
the most rational response.

142
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,166
I'll let them know right
away and give the order

143
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,041
before you have time
to change your mind

144
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,333
and think up something
completely irrational.

145
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,708
[NEREIS] Three hours until
the main fleet arrives...

146
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,666
[NEREIS] I hope we can we
hold them off until then.

147
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,916
[KENESH] Our forces still have
control of the Aptic region.

148
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,583
[KENESH] The Fourth Fleet is
approaching from the right wing

149
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,291
to cover the path between
Wimpel and Aptic.

150
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,375
Once the enemy has gone through,
Admiral Kotoponi will then

151
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,166
close in behind and
cut off that route.

152
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,958
The Second Fleet, which is
commanded by Admiral Rulef,

153
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,416
is currently heading to the
battlefield from the left wing.

154
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,291
They are making their
way from the Mystel Gate

155
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,833
to the Aptic Gate.

156
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,875
[DUSANYU]
Mystel will be safe now.

157
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,000
I think we should let
Admiral Mulusafa know

158
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,125
that he can come out of hiding.

159
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
As soon as he
receives his orders,

160
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,541
the Mystel Defense
Fleet will become

161
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,333
the Seventeenth Fleet of
Operation Phantom Flame.

162
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,541
Yes, sir.

163
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,625
[sighs] Looks like we'll
arrive just in time.

164
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,333
That reminds me.

165
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:16,875
We've got Viscountess Paryunu
stationed in the Aptic region.

166
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,291
And the young Count Hyde...

167
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:24,166
If I remember correctly,
he's also on board her ship.

168
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,166
[DUSANYU sighs] I hope
those two are still alive.

169
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,416
If either of them were
to die under my command,

170
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,333
I don't think I would be
able to sleep at night.

171
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,958
[KRAN] Hey, I'm not getting
any increase in output!

172
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,750
[PAVERYUA]
Okay... A little to the right.

00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,416
No, left! Left!

You gotta take it
easy on that thing!

You've gotta treat it like
you were stroking a cat.

[CREW]
Okay...

00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,875
Anyway, please load as
much stuff as you can.

00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,125
We don't know when we're
gonna be refueling again.

[LAFIEL]
Diaho? Is that you?

185
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,625
I'll get you out of there.

186
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,791
Just stay there--
it won't take a moment.

187
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,375
You shouldn't wander
around like that.

188
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,166
You might get lost. And if the
crew's forced to abandon ship,

189
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,666
we don't want to
leave you behind

190
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,583
because we can't find you.

191
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,500
Although... I hope we're
never in a position

192
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:53,708
to need to do anything drastic
like having to abandon ship.

[BEIKAL growls]

In the same way that
you, as a Princess,

I, as an Officer of
the Star Forces,

198
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,833
am responsible for my crew.

It's the Princess...
She just saved our hide!

I guess we're even.

201
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,083
So, what do you think?

202
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,208
Have I really got what it takes
to be Captain of the ship?

00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,041
[meows]

204
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,250
You think so?!

205
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,041
But, no. As much as I'd like to,

206
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,583
I don't think I can
really trust your opinion.

207
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:43,291
This situation is getting
more serious by the minute.

208
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,333
[NEFEE] It looks like the
patrol ships are running

209
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,875
out of ammunition for their
electro-magnetic cannons.

210
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,416
[NEREIS]
Running out of ammunition?

211
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,458
But we were planning
to save those cannons

212
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:59,041
until the enemy ships actually
arrived on the scene.

213
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,208
I can't believe we
allowed this to happen.

214
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,791
So, what are we going to do?

215
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,375
Don't you have any ideas?

216
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,666
[NEFEE] We'll have to
conserve ammunition.

217
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,750
You don't seriously expect me
to order the fleet to do that?

218
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,875
How humiliating!

219
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,791
It's less humiliating
than losing ships

220
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,833
because we ran out of ammo.

221
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,333
Wouldn't you agree, Brother?

222
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,708
I know what we'll do.

223
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,958
Issue an order forbidding
all ships from using

224
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,583
their electro-magnetic
cannons against the mines.

225
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,333
[NEFEE] But that will only
increase the burden

226
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,916
placed on the guard ships.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,916
[NEREIS] There's nothing
we can do about that.

228
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,958
Once the enemy arrives,
the guard ships

229
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,166
can take a back seat and
let the others take their turn.

230
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,333
I suppose you're right...

231
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,916
We've located a large number

232
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,666
of enemy ships coming
from the Sord, sir!

233
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,791
And so the moment of
truth has arrived.

234
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,541
The battle is about to
enter a new phase.

235
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,416
[NEREIS grunts] Guard ships
to retreat immediately!

236
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,666
Look at that! They've run
out of ammunition, too.

237
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,083
[NEREIS]
That's not what I said.

238
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,625
Even if the guard ships have
used up all their mines,

239
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,833
they still have plenty
of nuclear-fusion bombs

240
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:05,958
available to them.

241
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,000
[NEFEE]
I know that, Nereis.

242
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,041
But don't you think that
sometimes it would be nice

243
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,958
to relax knowing you
had the upper hand?

244
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,875
This is the moment you've
all been waiting for!

245
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,375
The time to fight against
enemy ships has arrived!

246
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,125
[ATOSURYUA] Up to now, your
battles have been against

247
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,416
mines and patrol ships--
hardly difficult opponents.

248
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,666
But this time, the
enemy's assault vessels

249
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,291
will be your foe!

If any of you don't keep up,

I wonder if I'll ever be able

253

about being attacked by
dormant mines anymore!

You're right. With the
information provided

by the Command, we're in a
position to identify them now.

We can safely let the Second
Aviator deal with them.

[ATOSURYUA]
There are six enemy ships.

That puts us at a disadvantage,
but it can't be helped.

We will identify the enemy
ships from right to left

as Enemy One to Six.

attack Enemy One!

00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,791
we can set our sights
on Enemy Three.

315
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,416
[LAFIEL]
Mm-hm. Hm?

316
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,375
The Unit Commander's obviously
being quite cautious about this.

317
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,000
I have to say, I'm relieved!

318
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,083
She's right to be cautious.

319
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,791
Because we struck first,
we went from four against six

320
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,250
to four against five.

321
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,791
But that's our limit if we're
going to fight head-on.

322
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,916
If we lost just one ship,
we wouldn't stand a chance.

323
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,041
Yeah, that sounds about right.

324
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,708
There's an enemy
fleet approaching!

325
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,125
The enemy ships appear
to be targeting

326
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,708
their attack on the <i>Gamroil</i> !

327
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,125
Fire!

328
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,958
Use the laser cannons!

329
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,791
<i>Gamroil</i> ! Are you okay?!

330
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,541
[ATOSURYUA]
We're fine.

331
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,791
There's a change in plan!

332
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,291
Aim your attack on Enemy One.

333
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,791
We're finishing them off!

334
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,833
All ships turn around!

335
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,333
[CREW groaning]

336
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,166
[SAMSON] Captain! The engines
can't take much more of this!

337
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,125
They have to keep going
until the battle's over!

338
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,125
Okay.

339
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,791
Captain! Enemy One's retreating

340
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,708
in the direction of
the Aptic Gate!

341
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,708
[ATOSURYUA] Looks like we caused
more extensive damage

342
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,125
than we originally thought!

343
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,000
Now it's four against four.

344
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,333
Another change in plan!

345
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,166
We'll focus on attacking
Enemy Three!

346
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,708
It is my firm belief that when
we have equal numbers

347
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,666
it is impossible for the
Star Forces to lose a battle!

348
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,375
Certainly not my squadron.

349
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,125
And not any ship I'm Captain of!

350
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,166
[CREW groans]

351
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,875
All ships turn around!

352
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:57,791
[LAFIEL panting]

353
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,000
[ATOSURYUA]
It looks like we're starting

354
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,666
to run out of fuel
and ammunition.

355
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,250
If we can't destroy Enemy
Three in the next attack,

356
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,125
then we have to
retreat, understood?

357
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,541
Don't waste any time
in pulling out.

358
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,625
I'm not gonna run away.

359
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,333
[JINTO]
Lafiel...

360
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,458
[EKURYUA]
Enemy ships approaching!

361
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,208
I've never lost...

362
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,083
I've never lost a battle!

363
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,708
Now! [grunts]

364
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,333
[LAFIEL gasps]

365
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,708
[LAFIEL]
They're firing at us!

366
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,125
Okay crew, brace yourselves!
This is gonna be tough!

367
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,500
[LAFIEL gasps]

368
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,875
[NEREIS] Do you want us
to just sit here and wait

369
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:52,833
while the enemy goes ahead
and destroys us, Nefee?

370
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,708
Where do you think you're going?

371
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,166
It would be a great dishonor

372
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,250
to discover that I'd let
my men die in vain.

373
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,916
But at least I would
like to choose

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,958
where I end my days.

375
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,291
[LAFIEL]
Permission is granted to take

376
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,416
any steps necessary.

377
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,291
All hands! Abandon ship!
