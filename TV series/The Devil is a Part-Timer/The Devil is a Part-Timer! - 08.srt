1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,000
[EMI] So, basically
you have no confidence.

2
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:13,000
If I lose, I don't think I'll
ever be able to recover.

3
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,125
[EMI] Okay, listen--

4
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,541
[CHIHO] Ignoring the
fact that she was half

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,041
a year early for New Year's,
the girl still put together

6
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,791
a really nice bento box!

7
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,375
I just don't trust her!

8
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,458
As far as we know,

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,875
this is all part
of her elaborate plan

10
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,416
to slowly poison them to death.

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,541
If she's a real assassin
from Ente Isla,

12
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,000
the job's already done.

13
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:28,666
Right.

14
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,083
Trying to make
everything about

15
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,958
all that angel-demon stuff
is just a lame excuse.

16
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,041
You gotta tackle
this thing head-on.

17
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,000
[CHIHO] Yeah. Good point.

18
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,875
[doorbell]

19
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,791
[SUZUNO] Yes, one moment please!

20
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,625
Greetings.

21
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,708
Good Sadao, you have visitors.

22
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,083
--[MAOU] 'Kay, hold on a sec.
--[CHIHO] S-S-S--

23
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,416
--Who is it? Tax collector?
--[CHIHO] S-S-S--

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,583
--[EMI] What the what? Chiho?
--[CHIHO] S-S-S--

25
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,958
--[MAOU] Really?
--[CHIHO] S-S-Sadao?

26
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,625
[CHIHO] Oh!

27
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,750
You've been cooking
for Mister Ashiya

28
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,583
while he recovers
from heat stroke?

29
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,791
Now it all makes sense!

30
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,875
Wow.

31
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,916
That's incredible,
how do you manage

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,458
to chop the shiso
leaves so thin?

33
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,000
[SUZUNO] First you
slice them in half.

34
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,041
Then you gather them into
bunches before you julienne.

35
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,291
Yeah?

36
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,500
Well, how did you get
the lettuce so crispy?

37
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,708
That is the way
lettuce is;

38
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,333
you simply wash it
and shake the water off.

39
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,250
[CHIHO] Really? Color me
impressed, Miss Suzuno!

40
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,625
Jeez, it's getting
crowded in here.

41
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,000
Hope we have enough
bowls n' chopsticks.

42
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,833
Don't worry, Mr. Maou,
I brought mine with me.

43
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,458
[MAOU] Oh. 'Kay. Guess there's
nothing to worry about.

44
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,750
[ASHIYA] Miss Suzuno
is cooking in my stead.

45
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,541
I'm a disgrace.

46
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,833
[URUSHIHARA] Whoa.
Breakfast already?

47
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,666
Wait. Where the heck
am I supposed to sit?

48
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,666
Not cool, Bro.

49
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,750
Unacceptable!

50
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,833
You make room for Emi,
but not for me?

51
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,500
She's technically
our guest.

52
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,541
[URUSHIHARA] And
these are the bowls

53
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,791
from that stupid takeout place!

54
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,000
[MAOU] Bon appétit!

55
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:27,916
[ALL] Bon appétit.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,291
[URUSHIHARA] Screw you!

57
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,041
[CHIHO] Dang. I hope
one day I can become

58
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,458
a great cook
like you, Miss Suzuno.

59
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,750
[SUZUNO] I am certain
you will learn quickly.

60
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,875
[CHIHO] You think so?

61
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,291
As long as
you remember,

62
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,458
even when serving others, a
chef has motives of her own.

63
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,000
In this case,
I'm forcing everyone

64
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,916
to help me get through
my abundance of noodles.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,250
I bought in bulk
to save money

66
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,625
'til I can find a job,
but with this summer heat,

67
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,458
I don't know if I'll be able
to finish it before it spoils.

68
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,083
[EMI] Speaking of, what kinds
of jobs are you looking for?

69
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,333
I do not
reasonably expect

70
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,000
to find full-time work.

71
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,583
So long as my
expenses are covered,

72
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,250
I will indenture myself
wherever I am able.

73
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,500
[EMI] "Indenture"
herself? Who says that?

74
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,708
Well, you could always
come work at MgRonald's.

75
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,708
Yeah, Chi could
train you.

76
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,041
And I'd be there
to help out too,

77
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,125
so it wouldn't be
that stressful.

78
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,958
[URUSHIHARA] Yeah, the
learning-the-job part

79
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,708
is not what's
gonna be stressful.

80
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,208
We've been pretty
understaffed lately;

81
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,166
we could use another
set of hands.

82
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,875
[URUSHIHARA] Think about
how Lil Miss High School's

83
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,041
gonna take it.

84
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,916
Don't you think
she'd be a big help, Chi?

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,750
[CHIHO] Huh?

86
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,166
Uh. Right. Yeah. Sure.

87
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,666
[URUSHIHARA] And fail.

88
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,166
Well, hey, there's no need
to make a snap decision here.

89
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,166
Trust me, when it comes to
working with your friends,

90
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,166
there are just as many
minuses as there are pluses.

91
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,916
That's very kind,
Good Sadao.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,541
I'll take your extremely
generous offer

93
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,708
under consideration

94
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,541
and let you know if I
require your help.

95
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,125
[MAOU] Cool. Sounds good.

96
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,083
[SUZUNO] Perhaps I will rely
on you as well, Good Chiho.

97
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,750
Um. Great.

98
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,875
Finding a job is indeed
of high importance,

99
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,375
but in the interim, your time
may be better served helping

100
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,791
the young lady acquire new
clothing and belongings.

101
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,083
It's true my wardrobe
is a bit barren;

102
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,583
I don't even own a decent pair
of shoes, much less a purse.

103
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,166
Hang on, all of
your clothing

104
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,791
is traditional
like that?

105
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,041
[SUZUNO] Indeed it is.

106
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,041
[SUZUNO] What? Is that unusual?

107
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,333
[ASHIYA] Well, I wouldn't
exactly classify it

108
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,916
as run of the mill.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,625
[URUSHIHARA] You know where
to find this fashion stuff,

110
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,333
right Yusa?

111
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,666
Hey! No touch!

112
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,625
I don't want your slacker
germs all over my stuff!

113
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,625
Jeez, chill!

114
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,875
I've never met a person

115
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,083
who had less shame than
you, Mister Urushihara.

116
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,208
[URUSHIHARA]
What the crap?

117
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,375
Why is everyone
always such a jerk to me?

118
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,250
He does make a good
point though Miss Yusa;

119
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,875
why don't you
take her shopping?

120
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,208
Sure, maybe after
I get off work?

121
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,583
[SUZUNO] Yes, thank you.

122
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,166
I shall explore the shopping
area until you're done.

123
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,416
[EMI] Sounds like a plan.

124
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,958
[MAOU] Why do I get the
feeling this is trouble

125
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,375
just waiting to happen?

126
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,208
[EMI] Cool.

127
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,500
[SUZUNO] Many thanks.

128
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,708
Hey. Wait. Did you
just change clothes?

129
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,000
I did.

130
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,708
[EMI] Jeez, her options
really are limited.

131
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,583
[SUZUNO] Something wrong?

132
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,291
No. Not at all.

133
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,125
Well, we'd better
get a move on.

134
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,250
[CHIHO] All righty.

135
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,375
Sorry again about
visiting so early.

136
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,875
I sure hope you feel
better soon, Mister Ashiya.

137
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,166
[ASHIYA] That's very nice.

138
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,875
I sincerely appreciate
everything you've done here.

139
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,375
Now, Sire.

140
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,375
Please be the kind, trustworthy
gentleman I know you to be

141
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,125
and escort Miss Sasaki home.

142
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,583
[MAOU] Yeah, sure.
Will do, Mom.

143
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,541
[CHIHO] I like your
bike, Mister Maou.

144
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,000
[MAOU] My steed.
He's called Dullahan.

145
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,250
[CHIHO] Cool. Why doesn't
it have a carrier on back?

146
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,583
[MAOU] Well, he's
a utility bike,

147
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,541
so he wouldn't have
a feature like that.

148
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,125
It's kind
of a shame, huh?

149
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,458
[MAOU] I'd give you a pump,

150
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,041
but there's a pretty
hefty fine if we get caught.

151
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,791
"One person per bike".

152
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,458
Yeah that's not really
where I was goin' with that.

153
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,875
So hey, I'm kinda
curious about something.

154
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,166
What do your
parents have to say

155
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,041
about you coming to hang
out at my "Bachelor Pad?"

156
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,333
[CHIHO] Matter of fact,
they didn't mind one bit.

157
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,166
I was just honest about where I
was going, and they said 'okay'.

158
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,166
Guess we're "Mother
approved," as they say.

159
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,250
Like the cereal?
What about your Dad?

160
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,708
[CHIHO] He was all, "I think
it's great you've already found

161
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,791
a man you want to cook for!"

162
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,958
Speakin' of, since
Miss Suzuno won't be there

163
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,541
to cook for you, do
you have any idea

164
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,166
what you're gonna
do for lunch?

165
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,125
[MAOU] Uh. No. Guess I haven't
really thought about it.

166
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,125
[CHIHO] Oh! So--
no plans, huh? Great!

167
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,875
Do you mind if I
bring you something?

168
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,458
[MAOU] Well, I suppose Ashiya
would be happier knowing

169
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,958
I was eating your
home cooking instead

170
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,833
o' subsisting on
junk food. So, yeah.

171
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,833
Since you offered,
I'll take you up on it!

172
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,083
How wonderful!

173
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,625
Then I'll make sure
it's a hearty,

174
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,125
nutritionally balanced meal,

175
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,458
so Ashiya doesn't get
himself into a panic.

176
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,708
Alright, Chi,
tell me the truth.

177
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,875
Aren't you a little
weirded out that we're--?

178
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,208
[CHIHO] What?

179
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,958
That you're demons and
angels from another world?

180
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,833
Yeah, um-- That.

181
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,458
[CHIHO] Well, since you asked.

182
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,250
I'd be lying if I said
it didn't bother me.

183
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,125
Miss Yusa and I have
been texting each other

184
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,333
back and forth.

185
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,000
So I've learned a lot
about who you are--

186
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,583
and the things you've done.

187
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,708
But I fell for you way

188
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,500
before I knew about
any of that stuff,

189
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,791
so none of it can
change the way I feel now!

190
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,583
I mean just
look at that face.

191
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,333
That is not the face
of a person who wants

192
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,708
to take over the whole world.

193
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,833
Yeah. About that...

194
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,833
Miss Yusa did everything
she could to keep me

195
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,458
from falling for you,
'cause she was trying

196
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,250
to save me from getting hurt.

197
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,708
But I know what's in my heart

198
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,833
and I won't turn away from it.

199
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,458
The only person
who can ever stop me

200
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,625
from caring about you is me.

201
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,458
[CHIHO] Even if you just
think of me as a friend

202
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,833
or a trusted co-worker,
that's totally fine.

203
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,625
Because that
won't change things.

204
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,875
It's not going to change
my mind about how I feel,

205
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,291
and it's certainly
not going to make me

206
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,916
act differently towards you.

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,458
Ah jeez, this is
what makes you

208
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,416
humans so scary,
y'know that?

209
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,666
[CHIHO] I do.
Especially us girls.

210
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,416
Mess with one of us and
you might lose a body part!

211
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,333
I'll be sure to
keep that in mind.

212
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,416
[SUZUNO] You are truly loved,
my Good Sadao.

213
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,541
[CHIHO] Miss Suzuno?

214
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,291
How long have you
been standing there?

215
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,500
[SUZUNO] Long enough.

216
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,958
The whole ordeal
was a rare sight to behold.

217
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,625
You're extremely
virtuous,

218
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:56,041
and quite cute, to be so
honest about your feelings.

219
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,666
Regardless of whom
you've picked.

220
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,875
[MAOU] Huh?

221
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,708
[MAOU] Chi?

222
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,083
Aw, man,
she's gonna break

223
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,708
her neck riding all
crazy fast like that.

224
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,500
Surprising.

225
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,666
[MAOU] What's surprising?

226
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,750
The fact that I'm
concerned about a friend?

227
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,916
Apologies, but yes.

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,375
Be honest: what is your opinion
of a person such as yourself?

229
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,333
Whoa. What's with
the third degree?

230
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,000
[SUZUNO] Mere curiosity.
Nothing more.

231
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,750
Well, let's see.

232
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,416
After she was so straightforward
and honest with me,

233
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,750
it's not fair
to her to play dumb

234
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,291
and pretend like
I don't get it.

235
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,208
And besides,
her folks trust me.

236
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,500
At least I mean, well
her mom does anyway,

237
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,708
so I figure I should
take the olive branch

238
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,541
while it's extended.

239
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,708
What's that look for?

240
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh. Nothing, Good Sadao.

241
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,458
If you'll excuse me.

242
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,791
I've kept Good Emi
waiting long enough.

243
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,708
If you're headed to the
station, let me walk you there.

244
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,041
[MAOU] Or... not.

245
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,958
[SUZUNO] No.
That would be fine.

246
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,333
[EMI] You find your wallet?

247
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,750
[SUZUNO] Uh.
Yes--Thank you.

248
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,708
I apologize for
keeping you waiting.

249
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,000
[EMI] Please.
It's fine.

250
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,416
So--Um...

251
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,625
We're about to ride the--
what's it called? "Train"?

252
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,916
[EMI] Yeah. We're only
one stop away from Shinjuku,

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,416
but it's a bit far to walk.

254
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,041
[SUZUNO] While we're
on the subject.

255
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,541
I should mention. I've
never been on one before.

256
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,375
[EMI] Huh?

257
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,041
[SUZUNO] Although, I did
learn that Tokyo residents

258
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,916
pay for travel
with watermelons.

259
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,625
Do you know where
I might obtain one?

260
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,416
Yeah. That's
not-- wait back up.

261
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,625
Now I'm confused
about something.

262
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,166
How'd you get to Sasazuka
in the first place?

263
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,750
Well that's
a silly question;

264
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,958
I arrived here through
the Gate, obviously.

265
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,125
Oh, yeah.

266
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,333
Obviousl--

267
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,375
Wait, did you
just say the Gate?

268
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,166
Okay.

269
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,875
Just to clarify, you're
saying you're from Ente Isla.

270
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,250
[SUZUNO] Yes. Of course
I am. Did you not know?

271
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,333
[EMI] You have never said
one word about Ente Isla!

272
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,750
[SUZUNO] Maybe not,
but you did!

273
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,916
You asked if I was
after the Devil!

274
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,250
And then you warned
me that it would

275
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,666
end badly if I got too close
to him, and as a favor,

276
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,583
you advised me to
steer clear, remember?

277
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,041
[EMI] Huh?

278
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,625
[SUZUNO] Having survived
countless brutal battles,

279
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,416
I'm not one to
shy away from fear,

280
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,000
but once I heard that even you,

281
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,708
a Hero, considered him a threat,
I had no choice but to withdraw.

282
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,166
Left with no alternatives,
I asked for your assistance.

283
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,583
You then pledged
your aid and gave me

284
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,583
your contact information.

285
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,958
[EMI] Huuuh?!

286
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,333
[SUZUNO] I thought you
said all those nice things

287
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,708
because you
intuited who I was!

288
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,333
How in the world could
I possibly "intuit" that?

289
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,625
[SUZUNO] Didn't it strike
you as being a tad bit odd?

290
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,916
All of a sudden, a sweet
young girl like myself moves

291
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
next door, inveigles her way
into an all-male home,

292
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,750
and starts cooking for everyone
like some sort of slave girl?

293
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,833
[EMI] You are the last person

294
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,750
who should talk about
what's ridiculous!

295
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,916
I don't understand;

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,208
what exactly was
going through your head

297
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,833
when you asked me
if I was after him?

298
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,791
Uh. No--wait--I--
Look, I don't--

299
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,250
'cause-I'm still trying to
wrap my head around all this.

300
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,750
Why did you ask me if I had
an "intimate" relationship

301
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,666
with him?

302
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,041
Because, you imbecile,

303
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,791
I was informed the two
of you had joined together!

304
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,375
That is a load of bull!

305
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,166
We were forced, coincidentally,

306
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,291
to take down a mutual adversary
together, and that's it!

307
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,083
You sound like an idiot
saying things like that!

308
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,916
And please don't tell me
you actually believed

309
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,458
I was conspiring
with the devil

310
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,208
to exact my revenge
against the Church.

311
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,750
You were the one at
the convenience store

312
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,875
with the sneak-attack
last night!

313
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,708
What about
a convenient snack?

314
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,333
Well, guess the mystery

315
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,708
of the Ente Islan
attacker is solved.

316
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,958
[EMI] The assailant
had the power

317
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,250
to neutralize my sacred sword,

318
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,250
so I knew they
couldn't have been a Demon.

319
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:43,458
Which means it was you!
Wait. Hang on.

320
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,458
[EMI] She doesn't
have any paint marks.

321
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,125
And she doesn't smell bad.

322
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,333
I did no such
thing, you moron!

323
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:53,000
I know how powerful
Emilia the Hero is!

324
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,083
Fine.

325
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,583
If that's the case,
then who are you

326
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,333
and what are you doing hanging
around the Devil's Castle?

327
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:10,708
[SUZUNO in Ente Islan]

328
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,666
[EMI] One sec!
[SUZUNO in Ente Islan]

329
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,958
[EMI] I don't want
to be late for work,

330
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,541
so save all the
details for shopping, okay?

331
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,291
[EMI] Relax,
this is how it's done.

332
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,375
[SUZUNO shouts]

333
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,958
[SUZUNO] How dare you?

334
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,125
I haven't the time for this; you
will release me this instant!

335
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,958
[SUZUNO growls]

336
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,833
[SUZUNO] Why do you
insist upon hindering me?

337
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,125
[crash]

338
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,708
I still can't get over that.

339
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,041
"How are those tiny
people inside there?"

340
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,833
It was a flat-screen
television dummy,

341
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,166
not a puppet theatre.

342
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,666
I would appreciate
the dropping of that subject!

343
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,375
[EMI] Where did you
learn about Japan anyway?

344
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,208
Like what is up
with the kimono?

345
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,583
[SUZUNO] I did
a fair bit of research

346
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,041
into the history
of this place.

347
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,000
In every book I read,
yukata and kimono

348
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,250
were the preferred mode
of fashion for everyone.

349
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,833
[SUZUNO] I studied something
called "historical drama."

350
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,416
Several documentaries
gave me some real insight.

351
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,791
[EMI] That
explains a lot.

352
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,625
[SUZUNO] In fact some of them
were incredibly helpful.

353
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,291
"O-arashi Monjiro."
"Lone Lion and Cub."

354
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,500
As well as my personal
favorite, "Three for the Slay."

355
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,125
"Mito Fuku-shogun"
and "Oko-rinbo Shogun,"

356
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,750
though, didn't quite
resonate with me.

357
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,166
Yeah--right.

358
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,250
So. Getting back on topic,

359
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,833
why did the Doctrinal
Correction Council's

360
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,958
head investigator move
next door to the Devil's Castle?

361
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,625
Explain that part to me.

362
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,500
My investigation
started with Olba Mayer.

363
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,708
The only useful details
he had were the location

364
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,958
of Satan's residence and
a vague idea of his lifestyle.

365
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,916
I thought if I kept
tabs on the Devil--

366
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,708
[EMI] Then I'd show up.
Yeah that makes sense.

367
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,583
Okay, but what do
you want from me?

368
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,708
First, let us be certain

369
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,375
we understand one another.

370
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,041
What Father Mayer did to you
was completely deplorable;

371
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,833
I cannot apologize
to you enough for his actions.

372
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,125
And since based on
our initial conversations,

373
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,875
I assumed you knew
I was Ente Islan,

374
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,416
it became quite
clear to me the story

375
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
of you joining forces
with the Devil was false.

376
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,416
Olba's will is not the
collective will of the Church.

377
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,666
And while it is not my place
to speak on their behalf;

378
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,083
I would like
to be on your side.

379
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,750
Olba is out of the picture
now. So cut to the chase.

380
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,708
I want for you to
join me in my quest

381
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:24,041
to eliminate King Satan, and
then return home with me.

382
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,250
The Church would
make your survival

383
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,375
public information,
but they would cover up

384
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,166
Olba's insidiousness.

385
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,333
Do we have a deal?

386
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,500
[EMI] No.

387
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,083
I am doing everything
within my power

388
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,375
to restore your honor,
Hero, so why not?

389
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,791
[EMI] Because, I don't
care what the Church

390
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,916
or the kingdoms or anyone
else thinks of me anymore.

391
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,833
Surely you understand
why I can't just up

392
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,583
and trust someone who works
for your organization.

393
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,333
The same one led
in part by the jerkwad

394
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,666
who caved in a crowded mall
just to kill me and the Devil.

395
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,250
Sorry to disappoint
you, Suzuno,

396
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,291
but unfortunately, that's the
way things have to be now.

397
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,291
[EMI] Olba teamed up
with that idiot Lucifer

398
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,041
in his attempt to murder me.

399
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,375
Emeralda and Albert can
give you a first hand account

400
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,875
of how much trouble
he caused these people.

401
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,666
Or you can ask
Urushihara himself.

402
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,916
[EMI] Besides, I'm a Hero;

403
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,333
taking on the Devil
is my duty, not yours.

404
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,666
Do not interfere.

405
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,916
[SUZUNO] But if we
cooperate we could--

406
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,958
"Doctrinal Correction Council".

407
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,041
Just call it what it really
is: the New Inquisition.

408
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't believe
you're with them,

409
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,500
and you still don't get it.

410
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,041
Also, I don't know
what you're up to

411
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,666
with this whole Cooking
for Demons thing,

412
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,750
but tread lightly, 'cause
if you mess with him

413
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,500
or pull any cheap
tricks on him--

414
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,458
[EMI] I absolutely
guarantee you that Maou

415
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,166
will see right through
your little charade.

416
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,916
He may not look it,
but he's still the Devil.

417
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,333
[SUZUNO] I appreciate
the warning.

418
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,166
Good, just promise you'll
also give some thought

419
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,625
to your own position
in the Council, okay?

420
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,708
Oh, I grabbed this
at the station for you.

421
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,583
This one, too.

422
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,791
If you're gonna
be stickin' around,

423
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,666
you gotta figure out
how this place works.

424
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,958
For reals.

425
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,000
[EMI] The way you talk
and dress is more than

426
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,333
a little bit on the
old-fashioned side.

427
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,916
Anyways, I gotta run
or I'll be late for work.

428
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,916
We can go over the finer
details after my shift tonight.

429
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,375
Can you
ever forgive me?

430
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,250
Uh. Forgive
you for what?

431
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,666
[CHIHO] Well.
Your bike. I stole it.

432
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,083
[MAOU] Oh, that.

433
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,000
[CHIHO] I'm so sorry! I'm
so sorry! I'm so sorry!...

434
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,500
[MAOU] No. It's
fine. Chi, stop!

435
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,125
[MAOU] Yep, dead today.
Just like I figured.

436
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,291
The new SFC across the street
jacked all our customers.

437
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,750
[MAOU] And that menacing smile

438
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,166
on Miss Kisaki's face
is freakin' me out.

439
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,833
[KISAKI] This is bad.

440
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,000
I have to go down

441
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,375
to Corporate today
and report our numbers.

442
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,750
Not lookin' forward
to telling them

443
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,833
about our eighty
percent sales drop.

444
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,291
Yeah, no.

445
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,708
[KISAKI] One time an
employee, about my age,

446
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,416
lost big time to a competitor
and as punishment,

447
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,166
got shipped off to Greenland.

448
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,791
[MAOU] For real?

449
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,541
No way we wanna
freeze our butts off

450
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,416
in Greenland, right?

451
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,625
[MAOU] No, ma'am!

452
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,000
[KISAKI] I don't care
what you have to do.

453
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,125
I authorize any means
necessary. Beat SFC!

454
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,416
Yes, ma'am!

455
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,333
[MAOU] Aww,
man this sucks.

456
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,750
Can't believe this is my
first day as fill-in manager.

457
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,041
[BOTH] How can we help you?

458
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,458
[MAN] Pardon me
for interrupting,

459
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,166
I know you must be busy.

460
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,666
I was wondering if I could
speak to your manager, please.

461
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,625
I'm terribly
sorry, sir.

462
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,500
Miss Kisaki's out
on business right now.

463
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,208
But I'm the Shift
Manager on duty,

464
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,083
and I will be happy to assist
you in any way I'm able.

465
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,666
Sadao Maou, I've heard
a lot about you, buddy.

466
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,875
So nice to put a
face with the name.

467
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,041
[MAN] They say you're
sociable, hard working,

468
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,250
and open-minded.

469
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,166
And that you add a
wonderfully human touch

470
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,625
to everything you do.

471
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,208
Wow. I'm uh,
flattered, really.

472
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,708
[MAOU] What's with this guy?

473
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,291
How rude of me.

474
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,750
If you'd pay me the compliment
of accepting my business card?

475
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,291
Ah. Thank you, sir.

476
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,083
[MAOU] You're the manager
of Sentucky Fried Chicken?

477
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,416
Mitsuki Sarue,
how do you do?

478
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,416
Sorry for not coming by
to introduce myself sooner.

479
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,583
As you can see,
I've been a bit busy.

480
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,083
I must admit, this is
a delightful neighborhood.

481
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,041
It is the absolute
perfect combination

482
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,125
of business and pleasure.

483
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,583
And the women
are quite lovely as well.

484
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,083
Yes--that's true.

485
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,250
At any rate, I look forward
to doing business with you,

486
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,750
Mister Sarue.

487
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,833
Hm. Well!

488
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,583
It's a real shame
I can't lay eyes

489
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,833
on your famously ravishing
manager, but-- guh!

490
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,250
[SARUE] Beautiful.

491
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,750
I would be honored
if you'd utilize

492
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,833
those incredibly sensual hands
to prepare a special meal

493
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:33,625
with extra love, and a side
of passion for yours truly.

494
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,416
Sexy princess.

495
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,833
[MAOU] Sorry, Chi. I prob'ly
should've stepped in

496
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,375
and put that creeper
in his place.

497
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,875
[CHIHO] No, Mister Maou;
totally not your fault!

498
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,208
And besides, who does
that disgusting little weirdo

499
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,375
he think he is?

500
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,625
Wearing those dumb
sunglasses inside?

501
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,208
And so much cologne
I'll be smelling it all day!

502
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,166
Ugh. He won't win!

503
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,291
[MAOU] That's right!

504
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,500
[CHIHO] Huh?

505
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,416
We'll have workable
intel on the enemy soon.

506
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,250
I dispatched my top spy.

507
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,291
[CHIHO] Really?

508
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,125
[ASHIYA] I will not let
you down, my dear King.

509
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,166
I shall thoroughly investigate
'Sentucky Fried Chicken'.

510
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,958
And bring those vile
intruders to justice!

511
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,291
[RIKA] I am a hungry girl;

512
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,416
I can tell you
that much for sure--

513
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,416
Salutations.

514
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,750
Have you completed your
service for the day?

515
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,666
[EMI] Did you seriously end
up just buying more yukata?

516
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,083
Where'd you even get
that kind of money?

517
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,708
[SUZUNO] It was
quite simple really;

518
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,416
I had some easily
converted assets

519
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,666
which I took to a resale
shop called Mugi-hyo.

520
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,125
[SALESMAN] Whoa,
this is the real deal!

521
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,458
[EMI] And I'm sure
they didn't lowball

522
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,750
someone as wise to the
ways of the world as you.

523
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,750
And look here.

524
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,458
I got my own card, too!

525
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,625
[FEMALE ATM VOICE] Please
double-check the amount

526
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,458
and enter your
method of payment.

527
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,750
[FEMALE ATM VOICE] If you
would like a paper copy

528
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,875
of your receipt,

529
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,208
please select the
green "yes" button.

530
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,083
[SUZUNO] Please, what
more do you want from me?

531
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,666
[EMI] Yeah,
great job.

532
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,916
[RIKA] So Emi, I'm guessing
this girl is a friend of yours?

533
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,458
Uh. Well--She's
more like a- y'know,

534
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,916
let's just go with that.

535
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,375
[SUZUNO] I've
waited here all day

536
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,666
because I would make another
request of you, Good Emi.

537
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,166
[EMI] Oh yeah?

538
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,208
[SUZUNO] I would like to go
see Good Sadao's workplace.

539
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,375
Would you accompany me?

540
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,833
This is maybe
not the time.

541
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:19,666
"Sadao."

542
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,208
I feel like I know that name.

543
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,625
I realize you
don't want me getting

544
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,083
too close to him,

545
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,916
but unfortunately for you,
I cannot simply step aside.

546
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,791
[RIKA] So. Spill the beans...

547
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,583
[EMI] Yep, this is my life now.

548
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,541
[RIKA] I know I'm
like, way butting in,

549
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,875
but you can't work
these dramas out

550
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,291
on your own, you know.

551
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,000
You need a third party
to be an impartial judge...

552
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,625
[EMI] I'm telling you,
Rika, it's not like that!

553
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,708
Don't worry girls,
I'm on the case.

554
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,875
So, where is this Mister Sadao?

555
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:45,958
[SUZUNO] He works
at the MgRonald's

556
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,416
near Hatagaya Station.

557
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,916
[RIKA] Oh! Well the train'll
have us there in no time!

558
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,625
No way I'm going
with you, you understand?

559
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,583
[FEMALE CUSTOMER A] I know,
this place is way better

560
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,166
than MgRonald's!

561
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,791
[SARUE] Sure, I can take your
order if you're ready, go ahead!
