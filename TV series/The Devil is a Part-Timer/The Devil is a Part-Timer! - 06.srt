against these flames
which consume you?

[MAOU] Your flesh,
your entrails.

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,875
I shall nourish my ambition,

7
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,916
and devour you until
nothing remains but memory!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,125
Sire. Could you listen
to me for a moment?

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,291
Now, let the feast
of feasts begin.

10
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,125
The time for the
first sacrificial offering

11
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,500
has finally come!

12
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,208
You're mine!

13
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,458
[ASHIYA] Your Majesty!

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,458
Jeez, Ashiya,
what's your problem?

15
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,916
[ASHIYA] Please feast
a bit more quietly, Sire.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,625
You're disturbing
the people around us.

17
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,125
Whoops. Sorry, I'm
just really excited.

18
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,291
Look at this! Beef
intestines are so good!

19
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,708
For the first time,

20
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,416
I totally get those demons
who love eating entrails.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,041
That's certainly
wonderful to hear, Sire.

22
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,125
But vegetables are just as
important as vital organs.

23
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,875
A proper diet is balanced.

24
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,708
Will you lighten
up for once; c'mon,

25
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,041
we're celebrating
my promotion tonight.

26
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,708
Oh, hey. You think
we should buy dinner

27
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,958
for Urushihara
before we leave?

28
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,958
I bet we can grab
something to-go.

29
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,666
Hardly necessary.

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,250
Apparently, he learned the
"online shopping" recently.

31
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,291
That cretin is utterly
demolishing our budget.

32
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,208
I implore you to bring
the hammer down on him, Sire.

get to go out to eat

a crappy pork bowl?

From a cheap convenience store?

62
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,125
[ASHIYA] We obtained

and internet
environment for you.

64

You've no right to complain.

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,416
Yeah, but I can't
eat the computer, can I?

67
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,833
[ASHIYA] Then do what
you're supposed to do,

68
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,750
and gather information
on existing magic

Depending on your success,

71
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,833
you can get a large
pork bowl instead.

72

could do all kinds of stuff

so I made my first big

and got one for him.

94

questions for you,

but first of all,
who's Urushihara?

97
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,458

What do you think
you're doing?

118
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,208
You started it
while I was--shut up,

119
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,500

120
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,958
Excuse me. Might
I uh, interest you

00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,208

point of this thing.

126
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,583
[URUSHIHARA] I know you.

127

[ASHIYA] Cappadoshia.

128
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,875
Given all the evidence
I've amassed,

129
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,166
it is not impossible this
site is the former home

130
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,625
of a lower-level demon
who was banished to Earth.

131
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,041
And if that's
indeed the case,

132
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,333
there's a chance we may be able

133
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,208
to replenish our magic there.

134
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,500
Although there's no telling

135
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,583
how many months worth
of His Majesty's wages

136
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,833
it would take to
fund a trip to Turkey.

Thank you! Good night!

139
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,458
[MAOU] So, what do
you want from me now?

140
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,750
Oh, like you don't know!

141
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,666
What was with that
phone call yesterday?

142
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,125
I already told you;
Urushihara did it.

143
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,375
And why is Lucifer
randomly "Urushihara"?

144
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,916
Well, with the
police arresting Olba,

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,416
he's trying to lay low.

146
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,791
To answer your next
pressing question.

147
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,375
Yes, for the lack of
a better option,

148
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,416
I'm letting him stay
at my place for a while.

149
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,750
[EMI] Three men in
that tiny apartment?

150
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,916
[MAOU] I know.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,500
It's not like
I have a choice.

152
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,083
At this point, I'm
basically all out of magic.

153
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,000
We couldn't go back to
Ente Isla even if we wanted.

154
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,375
Oh!

155
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,416
Sucks for you; I can go back
there anytime I want to.

156
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,583
I don't have
to slave away

157

looking for a
source for my power.

158
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,833
Controlling the Gate
is hardly anything

159
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,125
I need to worry about.

160
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,500
Then, why don't
you leave me alone

161
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,583
and hurry on out of here?

162
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,750
Because I am a hero!

163
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,541
As long as you
stay in this world.

164
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:25,000
I have a duty to
keep my eye on you!

165
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,208
Why's she
always such a pain?

166
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,833
Hey, guys, I'm home.

167
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,833
[MAOU] Urushihara?
Hang in there!

168
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,416
Who did this to you?

169
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,833
[toilet flushes]

170
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,208
Sire, you mustn't look at that.

171
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,458
Please. It's not worth it.

172
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,875
[ASHIYA pukes]

173
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,250
You saw the
landlady in a swimsuit?

174
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,250
Correct.

175
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,583
She said she
was visiting Hawaii,

176
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,708
and for some reason
included a photo of herself

177
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,875
frolicking in the waves
at Waikiki Beach.

178
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,166
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

179
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,958
Why would she show
us something so awful?

180
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,083
Isn't vulgarity supposed
to be censored?

181
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,500
Really, guys?

182
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,458
What kind of demons freak
out over a simple picture?

183
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,208
[URUSHIHARA] Fine!
You look at it, then!

184
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,000
[MAOU] Enough of this
swimsuit business;

185
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,375
have you gathered info
on this world's magic?

186
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,666
Dude! No fair!

187
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,666
You're trying to pull
a fast one on us!

188
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,000
[ASHIYA] His Majesty is
not pulling a fast one.

189
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,750
Sometimes, a valiant retreat
is simply the best option.

190
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:34,500
[URUSHIHARA] Valiant retreat,
my butt. Whatever.

191
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,916
I just found some very
interesting magical info,

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,291
if you care.

193
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,125
How exactly
does this qualify

194
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,833
as information about magic?

195
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,250
You can find magical
spots here all over.

196
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,375
There's a lot more
to this world

197
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,458
than just the pyramids
and Stonehenge.

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,458
If you look,

199
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,375
you can find a whole
bunch close to us.

200
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,250
That info's not
necessarily available

201
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,875
at the library, though.

202
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,458
[URUSHIHARA] This might be
the best candidate in the area.

203
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,083
[MAOU] A sealed-off classroom?

204
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,125
[URUSHIHARA] Yep.

205
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,250
There's an old room
in this school

206
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,875
that's been
completely abandoned.

207
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,166
Supposedly, you can
hear stuff every night.

208
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,666
Whispers and laughter
and footsteps.

209
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,250
[URUSHIHARA]
Freaky stuff like that.

210
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,791
Y' ask me, there's prob'ly a
demon involved in that story.

211
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,125
[MAOU] Guess this is the place.

212
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,666
You know, I'm surprised
it looks so cheery.

213
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,541
Do you really think
there's a magical spot

214
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,375
and a possible demon here?

215
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,208
I don't know; I'm not
sensing anything so far.

216
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,541
[ASHIYA] Well, Sire,
one does not simply walk

217
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,375
into a high school
one does not attend

218
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,541
and start exploring
the place.

219
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,083
[CHIHO] Mister Maou!

220
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,916
[ASHIYA] Miss Sasaki?

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,208
Oh yeah.

222
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,375
I knew the name of this
school sounded familiar

223
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,333
for some reason; must
be 'cause Chi's talked

224
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,916
about it before.

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,666
[KAORI] Hey, Chi. Is that
the boy you work with?

226
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,291
Yeah, it's Mister Maou.

227
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,208
[KAORI laughs]

228
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,333
[KAORI] Who's that
guy with him?

229
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,000
[CHIHO] That's his
roommate, Mister Ashiya.

230
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,625
[KAORI] His
roommate? No way!

231
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,666
Are you're telling me two men
are sharing an apartment?

232
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,625
Oh my gosh, do they
share a bed, too?

233
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,791
I bet it's a twin, huh?
[laughs fanatically]

234
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,291
[CHIHO] No, you
got the wrong idea!

235
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,500
Quit imagining things; it's
not dirty like that at all!

236
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,250
[CHIHO] Seriously,
you need to calm down...

237
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,000
[ASHIYA] She certainly seems
to be enjoying her conversation.

238
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,458
I wonder what it's about.

239
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,083
[CHIHO] A sealed-off classroom?

240
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,666
Yeah. From what
I've been told,

241
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,125
it's supposed to be one of
your school's "seven wonders";

242
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,541
do you know what
any of that means?

243
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,916
Yeah, those stories are
pretty famous actually.

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,916
People've said they can
hear monsters groaning

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,625
and other mysterious
voices whispering.

246
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,625
Some have seen reflections
of demons in the windows.

247
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,666
[CHIHO] Wait a minute!

248
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,750
That wasn't you,
by chance, was it?

249
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,583
No. Certainly not.

250
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,875
But it still might have
something to do with Ente Isla,

251
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,041
so I was thinking
I should, you know--

252
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,083
I should probably check it out.

253
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,958
That makes
perfect sense to me!

254
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,458
I can set the whole
adventure up for you, too!

255
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,916
The old part of
the building is this way.

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,333
[ASHIYA] Why was the room
sealed off in the first place?

257
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,500
It happened
before I was even born.

258
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,875
Now, this is only a rumor,

259
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,625
but apparently, a student
disappeared from that room,

260
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,666
almost like he
was spirited away,

261
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,250
so they closed off the room
and never used it again.

262
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,375
So, how would you guys
like to take a break

263
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,666
and have a little snack?

264
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,500
[ASHIYA] You do realize
this is not a field trip.

265
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,916
Seems like you're having
a good time with this.

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,791
[CHIHO] Well, yeah.

267
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,416
Because no matter where we are,

268
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,166
I'm always the one who
ends up needing you

269
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,625
to help me out.

270
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,875
It feels pretty good to be
on the other side for once!

271
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,625
[MAOU] You're not scared?

272
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,958
No, I'm fine
as long as I'm with you.

273
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,875
Cool. So, if there
are seven wonders,

274
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,291
what are the other
six supposed to be?

275
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,666
[CHIHO] Um.
Lemme see here.

276
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,291
The north stairway with a
different number of steps

277
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,791
going up than going down.

278
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,458
The statue that walks
around covered in blood.

279
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,875
The sculpture
in the art room

280
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,333
that gets a fold in its
eyelid at three in the morning.

281
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,583
The dictionary in the
library where the words

282
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,125
for "curse" are stained red.

283
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,958
And, the piano
in the music room

284
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,000
where one of the notes
sometimes won't play.

285
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,416
With the
sealed-off classroom,

286
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
that only makes
six wonders, though.

287
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,625
[CHIHO] Nobody knows
the seventh one.

288
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,166
It is said that if
someone learns all seven.

289
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,708
If they learn
all seven, what?

290
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,625
Yeah. What happens then?

291
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,166
[CHIHO] They get a
call on their cell phone

292
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,791
from the netherworld, and
their soul is totally stolen!

293
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,416
That doesn't
make sense at all!

294
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,083
I mean, why would just finding
out get your soul stolen?

295
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,458
What if it was
like a coincidence,

296
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,583
and it wasn't even your
fault that you found out?

297
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,208
[ASHIYA] Sire, please
calm down for a moment

298
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,041
and think about it rationally.

299
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,666
Why would the story
about this room,

300
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,208
which existed well before
Miss Sasaki was born,

301
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,125
involve a cellular telephone?

302
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,416
[MAOU] Good point.

303
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,791
[phone rings]

304
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,041
[MAOU] What the
crap, Urushihara?

305
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,166
Try'nna gimme--?

306
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,791
Dude, what are you
shouting at me for?

307
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,666
Where are you?

308
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,833
D'ja make it to the sealed room?

309
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,625
No, not yet. So?

310
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,833
What are you calling for?

311
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,916
I'm trying to help you,
jeez; listen.

312
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,916
The room in question
is most likely an area

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,125
where the Gate has opened
at some point before.

314
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,208
The Gate?

315
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,291
Yep.

316
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,708
Once the Gate has
opened someplace,

317
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,541
magnetic fields at that
particular location destabilize,

318
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,708
and it's easier for it
to open there again.

319
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,375
Then, that story
about the student

320
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,708
who was spirited away
could actually be true?

321
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,958
Could be.

322
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,000
I bet the poor kid got
sucked into the Gate.

323
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,916
Anyway, if we can manage to
be there next time it opens,

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,666
or at least figure
out when that is,

325
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,375
maybe we can get
some magic from it.

326
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,625
You never know.

327
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,083
Just holler at me when
you get there. Lates.

328
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,291
Urushihara and
his inter-whatever.

329
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,750
I don't understand
how he could find out

330
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,208
so much so quickly.

331
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,916
It's like a series
of magic tubes.

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,250
[door opens]

333
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,958
[MAOU] You guys heard
that too, right?

334
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,666
[ASHIYA] Maybe it's
a security guard?

335
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,541
No, the guards
should've all left by now.

336
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,166
So, we might see a
demon who came through

337
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,791
the Gate from another world.

338
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,625
Knowing that ahead of time means
there's nothing to be scared of.

339
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,666
Bring it on!

340
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,625
But do you have
an adequate amount

341
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,541
of magic left
to fight, Sire?

342
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,166
If not, you can use this.

343
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,000
[MAOU] What is it?

344
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,791
[ASHIYA] A potent talisman.

345
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,708
It has already proven effective
against demons like us.

346
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:24,958
[MAOU] The
landlady's letter?

347
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:29,208
[footsteps]

348
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,166
I hear footsteps.

349
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:40,000
[footsteps]

350
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,458
[WOMAN] What are you
idiots thinking bringing

351
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,458
a teenage girl
here after dark?

352
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,583
[MAOU] Emi!

353
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,583
[EMI] Oh, I get it.

354
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,416
Your goal was to find
some way to get magic

355
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,833
from the sealed-off
classroom, is that right?

356
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,750
First of all,
I don't have to tell you,

357
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,583
and second of all,
what are you doing here?

358
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,458
The great hero
is trespassing?

359
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,333
Um. I'm sorry,
but uh--

360
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,416
We're not allowed to
wear shoes inside.

361
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,291
Would you mind
changing into these?

362
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,125
Look, I was following
you guys around

363
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,041
as usual and I saw you
sneaking into a school

364
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,250
after it was closed,

365
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,041
so I came in to find
out what was going on.

366
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,666
I'm still not sure what
you weirdoes are up to,

367
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,083
so just deal.

368
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,375
I'm here,
I'm going with you,

369
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,625
and there's absolutely
nothing you can do about it.

370
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,458
[EMI screams]
Maou! Get back here!

371
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,958
[CHIHO] I feel guilty.
Is it really okay to ditch her?

372
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,458
You bet it is.

373
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,625
She's annoying and nothing
but trouble; keep on walking.

374
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,250
[EMI screams] Hold it right
there, you jerks!

375
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,500
[MAOU] She's such
a freakin' pain.

376
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,416
[EMI] I'm serious!
Stop right there or else!

377
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,583
If you keep running away
from me, I will cut you!

378
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,625
Hey, what's wrong?
Is everything okay?

379
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,125
I-- No, I'm fine;
it's nothing.

380
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,125
[EMI] You'll pay
for this, demon!

381
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:06,583
[EMI] Nailed it!

382
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,250
No, you didn't, psycho!

383
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,791
[CHIHO] Miss Yusa, that's
called an "anatomical model."

384
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,291
It's like a doll.

385
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,500
[EMI] What?

386
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,583
Brave Emilia:
the only hero in the history

387
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,458
of the universe ever to
slice up an anatomical model

388
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,500
with a sacred sword.

389
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,583
Makes me question
how well

390
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,250
she'd do against
an actual opponent.

391
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,166
You need
to do something

392
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,416
about this mess, woman.

393
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,708
Man, these things've
gotta be expensive.

394
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,166
And I ain't
payin' for it.

395
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,541
Well.

396
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,958
They won't have to know
if we don't say anything.

397
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,291
But that's prob'ly out
of the question, huh?

398
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,875
[EMI] Yeah, well, technically,
it's all your fault

399
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,208
because you're the
ones who left me behind

400
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,583
and made me chase after you!

401
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,875
Learn how to take some
personal responsibility.

402
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,541
[EMI] Come on;
use your magic to fix it.

403
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,500
[MAOU] Why should
I use my precious magic

404
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,416
to cover up something you did?

405
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,666
[ASHIYA gasps]

406
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,583
[ASHIYA] This model!
It only had one heart!

407
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,916
[CHIHO] Mister Ashiya,
I don't know how demons work,

408
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,375
but humans only
come with one heart.

409
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,250
[EMI] So, it's across
this passageway, huh?

410
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,583
Would ya please quit
wavin' that thing around?

411
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,166
S'like you're compensating
for somethin'.

412
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,875
Nice try, Bucko, but
I don't take orders from you.

413
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,041
[CHIHO] That's the old
part of the building there.

414
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,958
The room we're looking for
should be on the third floor.

415
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,250
All the way up the stairs.

416
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,125
[MAOU] Okay, let's go!

417
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,500
[EMI] Yeah, I'm gonna
say this is it.

418
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,166
[CHIHO] I don't remember there
being any actual boards, though.

419
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,416
[MAOU] What did I just say
about waving that around?

420
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,916
[CHIHO] Mister Ashiya?
What was that noise for?

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,208
[ASHIYA] Look. Someone has
clearly used this door recently.

422
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,000
[MAOU] They're
not even attached.

423
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,250
[EMI] So, the door isn't
even actually sealed?

424
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,000
[MAOU] Is it me, or has
someone been living here?

425
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,125
[ASHIYA] Agreed.

426
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,333
Based on the trash,
I would hardly say

427
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,541
this place has been
sealed shut for years.

428
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,416
[EMI] What's that?

429
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,208
Isn't it a
game system?

430
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:19,250
[phone rings]

431
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,916
What now, Urushihara?

432
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,666
[URUSHIHARA] Don't be rude.
Are you there, yet?

433
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,500
[MAOU] Just walked in.
What's with you?

434
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,083
Stop calling every five seconds!

435
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,208
It's really annoying.

436
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,375
[URUSHIHARA] Do you
see anything on the floor?

437
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,833
Like, say, a game system?

438
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,875
[MAOU] Yep, it's here.
We have it right now.

439
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,291
Yeah.

440
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,250
I knew it; I had a feeling
that's where it got left.

441
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,541
[MAOU] Where it what?

442
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,166
[URUSHIHARA] Huh?
Oh, nothing; never mind.

443
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,291
Why don't you just go ahead
and bring that on home with you?

444
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,583
Just tell me one thing.

445
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,208
Do I have to punch you
when I get home?

446
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,750
[URUSHIHARA] What? Why?

447
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,041
[MAOU] You said this was an easy
place for the Gate to open.

448
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,541
Is this where you
and Olba came through

449
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,041
when you got to this world?

450
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,250
Yeah, that's the place.
Did I not say that?

451
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,500
[MAOU] What do you think?

452
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,875
[URUSHIHARA] Oh, well, huh.

453
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,333
We sorta lived
there for a while,

454
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,000
and I accidentally
forgot to grab the game

455
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,083
I was playing before we left.

456
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,250
[MAOU] Urushihara.

457
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,541
You better not've
sent us out here just

458
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,708
to bring back a stupid game.

459
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,625
[URUSHIHARA] Don't be silly!

460
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,958
Give me some credit.

461
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,791
I thought, you know,
maybe the Gate opened again

462
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,666
and someone else
came through, obviously.

463
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,833
Did you find anything?

464
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
If not, get back here already.

465
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,458
I'm starving.

466
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,791
I'd even be fine with a
pork bowl at this point.

467
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,458
[MAOU] Who does
that little jack wagon

468
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,250
of a demon think he is?

469
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,500
[ASHIYA] If you ask me, Sire,

470
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,791
we should just sell it
at the used game store.

471
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,708
We could certainly stand
to have the extra cash.

472
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,291
Your cheapness
never ceases to amaze.

473
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,083
[CHIHO] Udon?

474
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,916
[MAOU sighs]

475
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,791
Dang it; yesterday was
a complete waste of time.

476
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,625
Oh, hi, Mister Maou!

477
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,041
[strangled gasp]

478
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,875
I found that envelope on
the floor of the science room.

479
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,333
[CHIHO] Mister Maou?
What's wrong? Mister Maou!

480
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,875
[URUSHIHARA] Give that back!
It's my game, jeez!

481
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,125
You only get one hour
of gaming per day!

482
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,541
And you should be
grateful we didn't sell it

483
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,000
for cash like I wanted.

484
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,208
[door opens]

485
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,708
[MAOU] Looks like...
we have a new neighbor?

486
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,416
Hey, watch out!

487
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,791
[MAOU] Are you okay, Miss?

488
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,750
Majesty! Are
you all right?

489
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,250
Yeah.

490
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,166
But uh-- This girl just sorta
fell on me out of nowhere.

491
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,416
Carelessness,
the greatest enemy.

492
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,958
What?
