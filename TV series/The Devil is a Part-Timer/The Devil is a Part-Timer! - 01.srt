lay five islands in
the shape of a cross.

Four point in each
cardinal direction

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,708
around a larger central island
to form Ente Isla;

the islands protected
by the gods.

6
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:34,125
All who lived in
Ente Isla knew of Satan,

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,458
ruler of demons.

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,333
His very name was synonymous

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:42,291
with the terror and cruelty
that ruled his demon realm,

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,583
as well as the creatures

11

thrived in its depravity.

12

Satan was an
ambitious ruler.

13

He sought to crush the
humans and their world,

thereby creating a land
of peace and prosperity

16

Four trusted
generals served the Devil;

17
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:09,000
Adramelech, Lucifer,
Alciel, and Malacoda.

18
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,958
These four great
demons launched

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,375
merciless attacks on
the four continents.

[SATAN in Ente Islan]

[SATAN] We find ourselves
in one of Earth's nations.

An archipelago which
they call "Japan."

We stand now in its

And this building is someplace
they call a "Police Station."

82
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,375

In this world we
are only fantasies.

94
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,166
These humans don't consider
things like demons

95
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,958
or even the Devil
to be authentic;

96
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,041
no one believes magic
legitimately exists.

97
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,666

believe in magic?

[ALCIEL] I see.

100
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,125
So because there is insufficient
magic in this pathetic realm,

101
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,041
we are unable to retain
our demonic forms?

102
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,583
Yes.

103
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:59,125
But I never imagined stripping
our magic would cause this.

104
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,833
Our physical change
makes me wonder if humans

105
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,333
might actually be the foundation
for all living creatures.

109
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,916

a fraction of my magic.

to stem its outward flow.

112

[ALCIEL] Looks like
it worked, Sire.

113
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,041
[SATAN] No. I highly
doubt this carriage

114
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,958

115
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,041
[ALCIEL] Alas.

116
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,708
[SATAN] If I adjust the
amount of magic I release,

117
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,250
I won't run out for
a fair amount time.

118
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,666
The undeniable problem is

119
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,500
we currently have no way
to amass more. However,

120
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,041
if the Earth is familiar
with the concept of magic,

121
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,958
even as "imaginary,"
we may have a chance.

122
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,458
The path left to us now,

123
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:59,541
is to discover that method
and regain our natural strength.

124
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,958
Until then, we have no choice
but to live in this world,

00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,583
The name's Miki Shiba.

161
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,250
In kanji, that's with characters
meaning "beauty" and "radiance."

162
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,833
Ah. But please boys,
call me "Mi-kitty" instead.

163
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,791
That's so much more fun, no?

164
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,000
[ALCIEL] Sire.

165
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,125
Are you sure we should
waste our time here?

166
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,458
[SATAN] Remember, in this
world they like the saying,

167
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,750
"Patience is a virtue."
In the end,

168
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,958
this castle might be
a welcome change of pace.

169
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,750
[ALCIEL] Oh, Sire.

170
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,208
[SATAN] We have no other choice,

171
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,958
but we will move
forward from here. We--

172
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,458
King Satan! Sire!

173
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,750
[ALCIEL] King Satan!

174
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,000
[SATAN] I didn't realize this
body was one that required food.

175
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,583
Well, you do have a
human body now, Sire.

176
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,583
That gruesome IV drip
thing will cost us

177
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,833
as much as a full month's
rent on the castle.

178
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,416
You know what that's called?

179
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,375
"Rubbing salt in a wound!" Tis
what the nurse said, at least.

180
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,708
[ALCIEL] That uncanny
landlady spared us

181
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,500
a good deal of trouble, Sire.

182
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,208
She tells me that
Japan requires residents

183
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,000
to carry something
called "health insurance."

184
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,416
[SATAN] Never mind her!

185
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,583
Money is clearly of the
essence in this human society,

186
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,375
so we need to
possess it somehow.

187
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,875
I cannot afford to
expend more of my magic,

188
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,125
so that means we really have
only one option left to us.

189
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,208
And what is that, Sire?

190
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,083
Curses, did it wrong again.

191
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,291
You idiot!

192
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,166
Résumé forms do not
grow on trees, you know!

193
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,041
[MAOU] Okay, my new
name is Sadao Maou.

194
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,000
[ASHIYA] And mine,
Shiro Ashiya.

195
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,625
Do you find this
name strange, Sire?

196
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,666
It's a little late
to ask that now;

197
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,083
we've already
made both our IDs.

198
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,083
[ASHIYA] King Satan.

199
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:52,958
[MAOU] Yeah?

200
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,166
[ASHIYA] Might I suggest you put

201
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,791
a little more thought
into your spending?

202
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,875
Gimme a break;
I put thought in spending.

203
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,416
Summer's around the corner,
so we need a fridge.

204
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,833
Owning a washing
machine is cheaper

205
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,208
than a Laundromat
in the long run.

206
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,916
And, I have to have
the bike to get to work.

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,458
It's not <i>what</i>
you purchased

208
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,916
that concerns me, Sire.

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,666
I just think paying in
installments would have been

210
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,041
a better choice than
buying them all at once.

211
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,416
[MAOU] Well, I hate loans, so--

212
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,750
Don't "so" me, Sire.

213
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,208
Nag all you want,
but installment plans

214
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,208
come with interest and fees.

215
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,541
And I ain't gonna
pay for something

216
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,458
I can't touch with
my own two hands.

217
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,208
Impeccably worded, Sire.

218
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,666
But do tell me.

219
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,458
How are we supposed
to make it to payday

220
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,333
on milk, jelly, and--

221
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,750
Oh wait! We have cucumbers, too?

222
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,500
[MAOU] I see your point.

223
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,708
But calm down, it's not like
we don't have any money left.

224
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,083
I have still have <i>some</i> cash.

225
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,625
We'll be fine until payday.

226
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,875
Don't forget, they give me
lots of food at work, too!

227
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,458
[ASHIYA] We're gonna die.

228
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,083
[talks faster and faster] You
propose we eat burgers and fries

229
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,208
three times a day
until you get paid?

230
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,083
What is this, <i>Super Size Me</i> ?

231
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,291
You plan to eat a high-calorie,

232
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,500
high-cholesterol diet
at such a young age?

233
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,916
I'm looking forward
to the next ten years,

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,291
but now I'll have to hope
you don't die prematurely

235
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,458
of a lifestyle-related
illness before we get home.

236
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,958
I must apologize for
my cowardice, Sire;

237
00:14:59,041 --> 00:14:59,833
however, you're the one who
argued for biding our time!

238
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,000
You of all people ought to prize

239
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:01,791
constant diligence
and health maintenance!

240
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,458
[MAOU] Stop freaking out!

241
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,166
I gotta go to work.

242
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,875
[ASHIYA] Wait, Sire!

243
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,208
[MAOU] Lecture me later!

244
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,125
[ASHIYA] That's not it;
you forgot your umbrella.

245
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,083
Let's roll, Dullahan! Hiyaa!

246
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,166
And he's off.
Guess I'll get ready, too.

247
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,750
Here, you can take this.

248
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,375
Please, all yours.

249
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,333
I, um-- okay?

250
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,791
I'm not going that far--just
to the train station.

251
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,833
I work at the
MgRonald's over there.

252
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,791
Thanks.

253
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,291
You can throw it
out for all I care!

254
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,375
Whu-hoa, that is brisk!

255
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,166
[MAOU] This week is key!

256
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,500
Soon, we will know who had

257
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,000
the highest featured
item sales in our district!

258
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,333
I swear, I will be
the one who breaks

259
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,083
the sales record for
black pepper fries!

260
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,208
Hello, and welcome.

261
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,250
Would you like to
try a meal today, sir?

262
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,833
[MALE CUSTOMER 1A] Nah, just a
cheeseburger and a small Spark?

263
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:27,666
Of course, sir.

264
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,750
Might I also interest you

265
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,416
in some Black Pepper
Fries with that;

266
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,583
it's our featured item?

267
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,125
[MALE CUSTOMER 1A]
Nah; thanks, though.

268
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,250
[MAOU] Yes, these little
continuous efforts are necessary

269
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:39,208
for my eventual comeback
as lord of demons!

270
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,750
Let me get your change.

271
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,750
[CHIHO] That's one chicken
sandwich, one iced coffee,

272
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,125
and one Happiness Meal.

273
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,458
Will that be cash or card?

274
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,500
Hi, Ma'am.

275
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,958
We hope you're
having a great day.

276
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,500
I'd be happy to let you use
our microwave if you want.

277
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,291
[MAOU] Have you brought any milk

278
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,750
or baby food with you?

279
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,750
I don't mind
heating it up at all.

280
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,208
Uh... You sure that's okay?

281
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,291
Of course; my pleasure.

282
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,416
Mister Maou,
you are like super way cool!

283
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,333
I can't believe you
thought of her baby's food;

284
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,541
that was so sweet!

285
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,208
Oh, no big deal.

286
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,833
Accommodating all of
our customers' needs

287
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,750
when we have the time gives
us a long-term advantage.

288
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,666
I was just doing my thing.

289
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,333
You are beyond
incredible!

290
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,916
You're like a for-real grown up!

291
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,958
Thanks. But hardly.

292
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,750
I'm just a part-timer.

293
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,541
Curses.

294
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,416
I can't believe you
were fired again, Ashiya.

295
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,541
You suck.

296
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,250
I wish you'd keep
calling me Alciel, Sire.

297
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,583
I wish you'd get over it,
but that's not important.

298
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,291
We need to focus on
finding a way home,

299
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,500
not doing awful
day labor, capisce?

300
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,291
[ASHIYA] Right.
And your point, Sire?

301
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,625
[MAOU] You are now
in charge of finding

302
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,708
a way to get our magic back.

303
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,208
I'll work and get money;
you do research.

304
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,041
Magic's at least a concept here,

305
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,791
so if we trace that alleged
fantasy back to its source;

306
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,541
well, maybe we'll be able to
find something that's helpful.

307
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,583
Do you believe
there's a chance

308
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,166
we can recover our powers?

309
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,250
Hopin' so.

310
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,375
I mean, why stop
at just Ente Isla?

311
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,000
Why not rule this world, too?

312
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,458
I like this plan so
much better, don't you?

313
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes, Sire! I do!

314
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,083
[MAOU] It's Maou.

315
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,291
[ASHIYA]
As you wish, Sire. Maou.

316
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,625
I, Alciel, vow to discover
the path to your supremacy.

317
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,416
You will rule all worlds!

318
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,375
Thank you,
Alciel; now rise.

319
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,541
You're embarrassing me.

320
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,416
Yet still.
We got nothin'.

321
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,916
Guess what!
I totally got a raise today!

322
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,208
I don't trust
that new guy;

323
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,041
he's too good for my own good.

324
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,333
You're excited to
be the lowest person

325
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,291
on the fast-food
totem pole, Sire.

326
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,750
If the Devil is
considered nothing more

327
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,333
than an underling,
what does that make me?

328
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,583
Though, how can I judge?

329
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,541
I can't even do
research properly.

330
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,375
[ASHIYA] With only books to go
on, all I can do is speculate.

331
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
[rumbling]

332
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,000
[ASHIYA] Earthquake?

333
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,750
[CHIHO] Mister Maou,
it's an earthquake.

334
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,083
[MAOU] Mmmm.
So it is.

335
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,041
Hey, Chi.

336
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,083
Yeah?

337
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,916
Everyone
makes mistakes.

338
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,750
[CHIHO] But it's the sixth
time I've dropped fries

339
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,083
on the floor this month!

340
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,416
I'm the klutziest
person in the world!

341
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,875
[MAOU] Yeah, I guess you
do drop 'em every other day.

342
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,708
[CHIHO] All I do is
clean up after myself

343
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,916
while everyone else
waits on customers.

344
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,583
At this rate, potatoes will
start sprouting from the floor!

345
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,041
Hey, I know you
guys are on break,

346
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,666
but I need a quick minute.

347
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,250
I'm not that scary, Chi.

348
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,750
[MAOU] Is everything
okay, Manager?

349
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,041
Wouldja please
call me, Miss Kisaki?

350
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,333
It's getting crowded out there.

351
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,416
When your breaks are over,

352
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,875
I want you both at
a hundred percent.

353
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,125
This is when the fight
for number one gets real.

354
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,708
So, bring it.

355
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, and Chi, sweetie,

356
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,583
try not to plant too many
potatoes, kay? Thank you.

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,625
Yes, Ma'am.

358
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,666
[CHIHO] One Big Mig meal
with black pepper fries. Got it.

359
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,125
[MALE PART TIMER 1A]
Will that be cash or card?

360
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,416
Can I take your order?

361
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,750
[MALE STUDENT 1A]
Fries and your phone number?

362
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,958
[snickering]

363
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,333
Yeah not on the
menu, sorry!

364
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,291
[MAOU] If we keep
this up, we'll do it!

365
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,708
We can be number
one in the district!

366
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,666
[MAOU] They're not
cooked all the way?

367
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,291
Don't tell me
the fryer's broken!

368
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,875
[MAOU] Why did it have to
be the black pepper fryer?

369
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,500
Okay, Maou, focus! What now?

370
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,791
If I don't do something,

371
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,458
being number one is
the least of our problems.

372
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,708
[MAOU] Should I use magic?

373
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,708
It <i>is</i> kind of an emergency.

374
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,375
Make sure you
save your magic only

375
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,666
for extreme emergencies, Sire.

376
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,125
[KISAKI] What's wrong?

377
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,291
[MAOU] Life is fail.

378
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,083
[CHIHO] It's not
your fault, Mister Maou.

379
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,750
Everything's fine;
the guys fixing the fryer

380
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,791
will be done by tonight.

381
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,583
Yo-yo-Maa,
you got a sec?

382
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,833
Sure.

383
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,875
[MAOU] What's going on?

384
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,083
Is she gonna blame me for
us not getting number one?

385
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,416
Surely not.

386
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,250
It's not like
<i>I</i> broke the lousy thing.

387
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,333
Maybe she's suspicious

388
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,541
because I was
about to use magic!

389
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,791
[KISAKI] Thanks for
waiting. At ease, kid.

390
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,166
It's not bad. In fact,
I'm gonna make your day.

391
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,375
I was just waiting
to get final approval

392
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,666
from our district office.

393
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,833
[MAOU] Oh. For what?

394
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,083
For your promotion.

395
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,625
Sadao Maou, as of today,
you are A-level staff.

396
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,250
[MAOU] Aw yeah!

397
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,333
I am A-level staff, Ashiya!

398
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,916
I got a raise! I'm a rock star!

399
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,208
[EMILIA] Hey.

400
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,666
[MAOU] Hey, it's you.

401
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,041
I went to your restaurant
after our conversation.

402
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,208
Oh. You did, really?

403
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,625
I'm sorry; I didn't see you.

404
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,375
Next time, just say something,
and I'll come say hi.

405
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,458
[EMILIA] I watched you all day

406
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,583
from the bookstore
across the street.

407
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,041
You look so different.

408
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,583
I thought for a second
I must be wrong,

409
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,375
but then I saw you
start to cast a spell.

410
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:02,875
A spell? What?
Wait. Who are you?

411
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,416
[EMILIA] First tell me why
you're working part-time

412
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,791
at a MgRonald's!

413
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,375
Why, Satan?

414
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,250
The Hero, Emilia?
