1
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,833
Mister Maou.

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,250
I have to go.

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,416
Chiho.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
It's time for me
to return to Ente Isla.

5
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,458
Oh, please.

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,375
No!

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,916
Why can't you
just stay here?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,625
With me?

9
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,083
I'm sorry, but I cannot
linger in this world any longer.

10
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,250
I must go.

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,458
Fine, then I'll go
with you to Ente Isla.

12
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,458
Please take me with you!

13
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,750
[MAOU] That is the
one thing I cannot do.

14
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,583
By rights, you and I
live in different worlds.

15
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,708
We never should have even met.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,625
Chi.

17
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:48,833
Forgive me.

18
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,458
Mister Maou.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,750
Mister Maou!

20
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,083
And that was everything
that happened in my nightmare.

21
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:13,708
The end.

22
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,833
Well, interesting.

23
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,166
So what happened next?

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,500
Like after I said
I was going back home.

25
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,458
Pardon?

26
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,375
What happened next?

27
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,583
You uh-- You kinda--

28
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,166
[MAOU] Well, whatever.

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,333
I can't go now anyway.

30
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,458
I don't have
enough magic left.

31
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,125
Man, yesterday
was so exhausting.

32
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,166
Having to restore
all those broken buildings

33
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,000
after a fight was rough.

34
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,458
Not to mention opening
a Gate to get rid of Sariel.

35
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,041
I used up every
bit of magic I had.

36
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,375
Oh.

37
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,583
Hey Chi, have you
seen Maa around?

38
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,541
[MAOU] Right here!

39
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,666
Kawa-cchi told
me something.

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,791
Is it true last night you
grabbed a mop, ran out of

41
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,666
the restaurant like a crazy
person, and never came back?

42
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,333
[MAOU] Yeah, about that.

43
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,333
There were extenuating
circumstances.

44
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,166
Why are you
making excuses?

45
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,625
[SUZUNO] The truth is Good
Sadao saved us last night.

46
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,958
Evening.

47
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,625
[URUSHIHARA] Hm.

48
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,750
Looks like Crestia Bel's
visiting MiggyR's right now.

49
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,791
[ASHIYA] Your voyeurism
is in very poor taste,

50
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,958
even if it is
for surveillance.

51
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:26,958
Wait!

52
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,416
You did not
stop at Emilia?

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,750
You planted a tracker
on Crestia Bel, too?

54
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,291
How much did
that cost us?

55
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,625
Dude, how about you
stop touching me

56
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,333
with your soapy hands.

57
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,000
And who might you be?

58
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,000
[SUZUNO] My name
is Suzuno Kamazuki.

59
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,583
Good Chiho and I were on
our way home last night when

60
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,166
a deviant attacked us out of
the blue, and the good Sadao

61
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,583
rushed to our location
to provide assistance.

62
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,958
Yeah! He's a hero!

63
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,666
I honestly don't know
what would have happened if

64
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,625
he hadn't been here
to rescue us!

65
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,708
You fought off a
deviant with a mop?

66
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,541
[MAOU] Yeah, he was a
bit of a tough customer.

67
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,833
Well, I suppose that
does count as extenuating.

68
00:02:58,916 --> 00:02:59,958
[knock]

69
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,291
[KAWA-CCHI] Excuse
me, Miss Kisaki,

70
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,208
some dude just fell
out of the walk-in!

71
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,583
[MAOU] Sariel.

72
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,875
[CHIHO] But I thought you
threw him into the Gate.

73
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,833
[SUZUNO] Good Sadao, perhaps
that garland you used responded

74
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,916
to the Devil's magic by opening
the other end of the Gate

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,291
inside the restaurant and
dropped Sariel off here.

76
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,750
Oh good; he's alive.

77
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,958
Are you okay, sir?

78
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,166
Not dead or anything?

79
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,125
Beautiful.

80
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,875
How strange is fortune!

81
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,708
I had to travel to another world
to meet the goddess of beauty.

82
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,625
O goddess, so desperate
am I for thy forbidden love

83
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,166
that I may fall all
the way from Heaven!

84
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,125
Okay, who is
this freakshow?

85
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,875
Actually, he
manages the SFC.

86
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:41,708
Truth!

87
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,458
My beloved he speaks truth!

88
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,375
We are indeed from two
irreconcilable organizations.

89
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,250
You from MgRonald's,
I from Sentucky.

90
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,833
We are the
Romeo and Juliet

91
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,375
of the fast food industry.

92
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,250
Looks like that fall
gave you some brain damage.

93
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,708
And I think it might be too late
for an ambulance to help.

94
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,125
[SARUE] O!

95
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,333
Such kind words from such
a beautiful mouth speaking

96
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,375
of concern for my health!

97
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,625
Sadly, no miracle of medicine
can mend a lovesick heart;

98
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,916
for me, my goddess
the only cure is your love!

99
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,666
[KISAKI] All right then,
would you rather

100
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,875
I call the police, you perv?

101
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,750
[SARUE] This is what
tempts angels to fall!

102
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,458
O, please don't
stop my love.

103
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,041
What sweet, sweet agony!

104
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,166
[EMI] Again,
my name is Miss Yusa.

105
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,458
Thank you so much for
allowing me to assist you.

106
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,583
Goodbye.

107
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,250
What's going on?

108
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,000
What is this?

109
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,583
[evil laugh]

110
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,333
[MAOU] I rule over
this city at last!

111
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,791
And now, for my
next conquest--Greenland!

112
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,333
[maniacal laugh]

113
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,625
Stupid nightmares.

114
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,875
[EMI] Well, I doubt MgRonald's
will realistically be

115
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,208
the new Devil's Castle,
but that still doesn't mean

116
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,291
I can let my guard down.

117
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,083
[RIKA] So, uh, Emi, you
seem kinda fired up today.

118
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,541
Oh, you think so?

119
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,500
You got any plans later;
I was thinking we could

120
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,000
grab dinner if you want?

121
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,000
[EMI] I would love to,
but I can't tonight.

122
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,625
[RIKA] Don't tell me you're
gonna go check on Maou again.

123
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,333
[EMI] Not check on so
much as keep tabs on.

124
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,541
Seriously?

125
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,375
Don't you think it's
past time you two let go

126
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,250
of all that negativity
and bad blood?

127
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,583
[EMI] Not at all.

128
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,833
Uh.

129
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,916
It's complicated,
but it's not like a big deal.

130
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,791
[EMI] My village gone.

131
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,916
My father killed.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,500
Why would I ever
forgive that?

133
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,083
Could I?

134
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,458
No.

135
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,125
It doesn't matter; I'm a hero,
and he's the Devil.

136
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,125
Who knows when he'll be my enemy
again, just like in my dream.

137
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,916
[EMI] Knock-knock!

138
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,208
What is going
on here?

139
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,625
[CHIHO] Oh hi,
Miss Yusa!

140
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,541
Hey!

141
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,708
Miss Suzuno,
what are you doing?

142
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,375
Well, I made an attempt
to cook French food earlier,

143
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,625
so he's eating Udon Confit
with Sauce Americaine.

144
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,000
[CHIHO] Unbelievable!

145
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,666
I already said I'd be making
dinner for him today!

146
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,500
And Mister Maou,
you're just sitting there

147
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,750
going along with this?

148
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,375
[MAOU] What?

149
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,208
I uh-- What?

150
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,916
Cut it out; you're
supposed to be his enemy,

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,750
aren't you?

152
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,041
Come on!

153
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,375
And you're hand feeding
him like I wanted to!

154
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,875
Careful, Chiho,
your real feelings

155
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,166
are starting to show.

156
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,041
[CHIHO] You keep your
fat mouth out of this.

157
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:08,791
Fine.

158
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,916
Mister Maou,
whose dinner

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,750
are you gonna eat--
mine or your enemy's?

160
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,333
[MAOU] Um.

161
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,750
Budget-wise, it'd help if you
both took turns bringing dinner

162
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,875
every day but you
know, it's whatever.

163
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,458
[SUZUNO] Oh,
that's not a problem.

164
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,208
[CHIHO] No!
Not a problem at all!

165
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,625
This is evil incarnate?

166
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,750
A word, Sire.

167
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,750
Yo, Ashiya!

168
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,375
Finally; where've
you been?

169
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,333
I have grave business
to discuss.

170
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,791
[MAOU] What's with
the formality?

171
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,916
Formality is
appropriate when asking

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,750
for time off.

173
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,083
[EMERALDA] What?

174
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,333
You think Alciel
is visiting his home?

175
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,875
I don't know about that;
I've not heard about him

176
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,916
returning to Ente Isla.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,500
I know it's unexpected,
but Alciel himself said

178
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,625
he wanted time off
for something.

179
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,291
[EMERALDA] Well, there are lots
of different types of vacations.

180
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,500
Maybe he's just sick of being
cramped inside that itty bitty

181
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,958
Devil's Castle all day.

182
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,916
Yeah, I'd agree,
but that wasn't the vibe

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,958
I was getting at all.

184
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,541
You want time off?
But what for?

185
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,000
Alas, I can't
speak of it here.

186
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,666
I see.

187
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,750
Sorry, would you guys
mind excusing us for the day.

188
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,625
Ashiya needs to talk
to me about something.

189
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,666
--[SUZUNO] All right.
--[CHIHO] All right.

190
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,041
I see what you
mean; that seems

191
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,833
more than a little
suspicious to me, too.

192
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,291
[CHIHO] Miss Emeralda didn't
know what was going on, either?

193
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,500
[EMI] No, but just to be safe,
I'm having her sniff around

194
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,625
for anything happening in
Ente Isla that seems like it

195
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,541
might be out of the ordinary.

196
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,250
[thunder]

197
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,041
Well, we won't
get far in this.

198
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,000
[CHIHO] Do you think maybe--
Do you think Mister Maou might

199
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,250
go back to Ente Isla now?

200
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,375
I'm scared that what if
my dream is coming true?

201
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,208
How come? What did
you dream about?

202
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,166
Oh. Nothing really.

203
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,250
You know that's really
weird; I had a kind of

204
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,708
ominous dream, myself.

205
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,541
What? Are you serious?

206
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,083
Don't you worry about it.

207
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,500
I promise, Chiho, while
I'm around I'll never let

208
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,333
anything sad happen to you.

209
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,458
It's cool.

210
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,208
[EMI] So many boxes.

211
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,125
Did they go shopping?

212
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,333
No, there's no way they
have that kind of money.

213
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,250
What are those boys up to?

214
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,208
I got a package
from Emeralda,

215
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,166
so anything's possible.

216
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,291
Could that be stuff
from the demon realm?

217
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,250
[EMERALDA] There really
isn't anything going on.

218
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,000
I had Albert
look into it for us,

219
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,916
and he didn't hear even
the slightest buzz.

220
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,375
The only strange thing
is that nothing strange

221
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,125
is being reported.

222
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,916
Oh, but there is one major
problem that's stressing me out!

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,833
What is it?

224
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,083
I'm starting
to gain weight,

225
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,291
and I'm completely devastated.

226
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,125
What?

227
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,458
How is that at all relevant?

228
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,125
[RIKA] Huh?

229
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,333
Emi, is that you?

230
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,791
What is going on over there?

231
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,208
Nothin', just
thinking out loud!

232
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,250
[KISAKI] Unbelievable.

233
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,083
What is that dwarf
manager thinking?

234
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,500
[knock]

235
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,000
[MAOU] Miss Kisaki.

236
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,750
I'm uh-- sorry for the short
notice, but is there any way

237
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,333
I can get a little time off?

238
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,125
[KISAKI] What?

239
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,250
That's unexpected.

240
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,750
Yeah.

241
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,416
I had something major come up,
and I can't get out of it.

242
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,916
Got it. Yeah.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,041
I can work around that;
so whatever you need.

244
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,666
Great, thank
you, Ma'am.

245
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,833
[KISAKI] Just let me know what
days, and I'll take care of it.

246
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:37,791
[MAOU] Alright!

247
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,541
[MAOU] Aw.

248
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,500
It's raining again?

249
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,500
Mister Maou,
are you gonna go home

250
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,500
to Ente Isla after all?

251
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,250
That's why you're
taking off work, right?

252
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,458
Okay, but please don't tell me
you're never coming back!

253
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,625
Chi.

254
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,375
I already said I don't
have enough magic.

255
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,541
So then, why did
you get time off?

256
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,500
Because.

257
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,666
Sorry.

258
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,083
I can't tell you why.

259
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,666
[CHIHO] Mister Maou.

260
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,291
[CHIHO] Are you sure
we should be doing this?

261
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,916
Don't you think it would
be better to give him

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,833
the benefit of the doubt?

263
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,625
Who would it be
better for, though?

264
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,541
I wish I could, but
with all those boxes,

265
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,583
he's definitely
up to something.

266
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,666
Our only choice is
to find out the truth.

267
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,333
Yeah, but--

268
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,500
Sh!

269
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,833
Come on,
let's tail him.

270
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,208
[CHIHO] A construction site?

271
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,250
[EMI] Could he be starting to
build a new Devil's Castle here?

272
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,000
[CHIHO] He couldn't
afford to do that.

273
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,708
It looks like
he's just working.

274
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,958
But why?

275
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,625
[MAOU] Girls, I can see you!

276
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,625
We just needed to get our
hands on some money fast

277
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,541
so we could pay off a
couple tracking devices.

278
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,958
Tracking devices?

279
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,875
Urushihara bought 'em
online and then decided

280
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,166
to hide one tracker in your
purse and the other one

281
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,750
in Suzuno's sandals.

282
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,958
How dare he?

283
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,541
[MAOU] Stop!

284
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,166
This is not the place to
whip out your sacred sword!

285
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,541
And remember, they did help
when Sariel kidnapped you,

286
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,708
so don't be so mad!

287
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll kill him!

288
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,541
[MAOU] Anyway, they're
gonna debit our account

289
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,166
for those next week.

290
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,125
And right now,
we're completely broke.

291
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,250
I won't get my MgR's check
until after they charge me.

292
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,166
So then, Ashiya decided he
wanted to get one of those

293
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,625
temp jobs that would
pay him by the day.

294
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,833
Oh, so that's why
he asked for time off?

295
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,166
Of course.

296
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,250
I took time off my job to
temp with him so I could

297
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,125
help him out in case
things got dicey.

298
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,083
But it looks like
the agency sent Ashiya

299
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,333
to work somewhere else.

300
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,833
If that's all it was,
why'd you feel the need

301
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,708
to hide it from Chiho?

302
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,333
Well, you see because--

303
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,916
I was worried if I
told her about it,

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
she'd wind up feeling
responsible since the trackers

305
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,291
we're working to pay for are
what helped me rescue her.

306
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,625
So--

307
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,083
I'm sorry, Chi.

308
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,416
Don't worry about it.

309
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,125
I'm just glad you're
not planning to go back

310
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,041
to Ente Isla or anything.

311
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,541
Okay, so then what's the
deal with the truckload of boxes

312
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,125
you had delivered to your house?

313
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:36,833
[MAOU] What?

314
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,041
What boxes?

315
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,125
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

316
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,833
[URUSHIHARA] What boxes?

317
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,791
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

318
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,791
Gimme a break, guys,
all this stuff has been here

319
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,041
since before I moved in.

320
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,125
We both know that's
not the truth, you liar.

321
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,541
Now get out of my way!

322
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,291
[MAOU] Feather beds?

323
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,625
[CHIHO] Fire extinguishers?

324
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,250
[EMI] Water purifiers?

325
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,166
[CHIHO] And there're
so many of them!

326
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,625
[MAOU] Urushihara,
what is all of this?

327
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,708
Hah.

328
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,416
You know, it's a
funny story actually.

329
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,708
I did some online research,
and apparently what happened

330
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,208
is called a "buy-up-scam."

331
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,666
This sounds expensive.

332
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,166
[EMI] Yeah, see, someone
knocks on your door and offers

333
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,583
to buy your stuff.

334
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,416
But instead, they wind up
pressuring you into buying

335
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,916
a bunch of their crap.

336
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,125
Well, on a
positive note,

337
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,416
he did buy the external
hard drive from me.

338
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,125
Then, he kinda made
me buy all that.

339
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:30,833
[MAOU] How much?

340
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,375
How much did it cost?

341
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,500
A lot.

342
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,791
Like what you
make in a month.

343
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,916
[URUSHIHARA squeals]

344
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,666
[SUZUNO] Unfortunately,

345
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,083
it seems you fell victim to a
very underhanded salesperson.

346
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,208
He fell victim?

347
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,458
More like nose-dived.

348
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,875
I can't help it.

349
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,041
I'm socially
awkward!

350
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,000
[SUZUNO] Maou, torturing
the poor idiot at this point

351
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,333
won't accomplish anything.

352
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,791
This is the
company, isn't it?

353
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,250
[CHIHO] Deluxe Life
International Holdings?

354
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,458
What?

355
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,583
That doesn't even
sound like a real name.

356
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,333
Why not give
them a call?

357
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,916
[CUSTOMER SERVICE] Hello;
thank you for calling

358
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,666
Deluxe Life
International Holdings.

359
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,041
How may I assist
you this afternoon?

360
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,833
Yeah, the other day
a door-to-door salesman

361
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,708
sold us feather beds,
fire extinguishers,

362
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,333
and water purifiers.

363
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,375
We're not gonna use those,

364
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,583
so we'd like to
return them, please.

365
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,500
[CUSTOMER SERVICE]
I'm terribly sorry, sir,

366
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,375
but we run tests on the water
purifiers when we install them

367
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,708
to make sure they work.

368
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,750
Since they're essentially
used items we cannot

369
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,458
accept them as returns.

370
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,583
Well, we haven't used the
twenty years' worth of filters

371
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,500
that came with them,
so you can take those back.

372
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,708
[CUSTOMER SERVICE]
Unfortunately,

373
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,541
they do come as a set
with the purifiers.

374
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,083
We're unable to
refund just the filters.

375
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,791
As for the fire extinguishers,
they've already been installed

376
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,500
as well, which means,
under the Fire Service Act's

377
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,583
safety guidelines, it's illegal
for us to take them back,

378
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,791
even though they may be unused.

379
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,791
[MAOU] What about
the feather beds, then?

380
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,250
[CUSTOMER SERVICE] We accept
returns for those,

381
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,375
as long as they're
completely unused also.

382
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,916
That was a set
of seven, correct?

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,625
[MAOU] No, not correct,
it's a set of five.

384
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,750
[CUSTOMER SERVICE] I'm afraid
our company only sells sets

385
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,000
of seven.

386
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,458
We can't accept any sets
that are short parts,

387
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,458
so I'm sorry, but--

388
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,541
[MAOU] Just forget it!

389
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,958
Lemme guess, they have
no intention of taking

390
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,458
anything back, right?

391
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,958
So, what are
you gonna do?

392
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,333
Go there in person?

393
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,750
Go there in person!

394
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,041
[MAOU] This is it.

395
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,333
[doorbell]

396
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,541
[CUSTOMER SERVICE] Coming!

397
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,041
Uh?!

398
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,041
Whoa, Ashiya?

399
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,416
Your Majesty?

400
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,750
And Emilia, too?

401
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,916
What brings you here?

402
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,708
This is seriously
where the temp agency

403
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,750
sent you to work?

404
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,458
Well, now I know why that
voice seemed so familiar.

405
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,625
[EMI] Let's get to the point;
what's your deal?

406
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,041
I don't have a "deal;"
I'm just following the procedure

407
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,666
for handling unreasonable
demands for returns.

408
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,166
Wait, hold on a second!

409
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,250
Why on Earth did he
buy seven feather beds?

410
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,333
[MAOU] I told you,
he was swindled!

411
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,583
And it wasn't seven,
it was five.

412
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,708
[ASHIYA] Oh dear, that sounds
like a scam if you ask me!

413
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,000
Because it is a scam,

414
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,541
which is what I've
been trying to say!

415
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,541
Then what you're really
trying to say is I've been sent

416
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,166
to this company to practice
fraudulent business dealings,

417
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,166
and unwittingly acted as an
agent of evil in the process!

418
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,208
[EMI] Are you or are you not a
big-time demon generalissimo?

419
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,375
Now that I am aware of
the truth, I cannot remain here

420
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,958
and dishonor myself with
this association any longer.

421
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,250
[MAN] Why are we yelling?

422
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,625
Sir, you're here.

423
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,208
Do we have a problem?

424
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,083
[MAOU] Yeah.

425
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,125
You're the jerk in charge, huh?

426
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,916
Now, we don't
have to be rude.

427
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,166
Why don't we talk this
over calmly instead.

428
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,875
I'm sure this was explained over
the phone, sir, but you can find

429
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,000
the same info on the provisions
of the signed contract.

430
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,583
What do you
mean provisions?

431
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,208
I've never seen
this contract.

432
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,041
[MAN] Oh?

433
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,666
Well, you received a copy.

434
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,416
I really must ask you
to follow the rules.

435
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,375
"Rules" my
left foot!

436
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,833
This whole thing
is a scam!

437
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,958
All participants fully
consented to the arrangement.

438
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:43,708
[MAOU] Consented?

439
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,000
Consented?

440
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,750
Who'd be dumb enough
to buy seven feather beds

441
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,333
for one tiny apartment?

442
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,000
[MAN] Someone
who lives with you.

443
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,125
[MAOU] You bastard!

444
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,916
You're being smug because
you think we can't

445
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,833
do anything about this!

446
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,916
I didn't sell any
defective merchandise,

447
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,791
so you've got no reason
or right to complain.

448
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,875
Again, we have a legally
binding contract.

449
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,250
Though I don't mind
settling this outside.

450
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,750
[MAOU] We lost.

451
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,333
[ASHIYA] Perhaps the best
course of action would be

452
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,000
to consult the police.

453
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,958
[EMI] Nah, you can't rely on
cops to take care of this.

454
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,166
Sure, he's crooked, but
there's still a contract.

455
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,000
And we have no proof
it was a scam.

456
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,083
[ASHIYA] So, basically
there is nothing to be done.

457
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,416
[MAOU] Damn it!

458
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,583
How are we ever gonna get
all the money together

459
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,500
to pay for that crap?

460
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,708
[ASHIYA] My apologies, Sire.

461
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,791
I do believe I am partly
to blame; after all,

462
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,875
I've been remiss in my
duties as his guardian.

463
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,291
His guardian?

464
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,250
Hold up a sec you guys,
how old is Urushihara, again?

465
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,250
And not his Ente Isla age;
I mean here in this world.

466
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,250
[MAOU] Oh.

467
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,291
Let's see.

468
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,708
I'm pretty sure
I made him eighteen

469
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,750
on all the official records.

470
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,250
In that case,

471
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,208
I think I know a trick that
should help you demons out.

472
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,708
Help us?

473
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,041
You mean as in not having to
fork over money we don't have?

474
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,958
Tell us this trick
of yours, wench!

475
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,333
It's called "Cooling-Off."

476
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,416
[LAWYER] A guardian's consent
is required for any contract

477
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
signed by a person
under the age of twenty.

478
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,458
That is unless the
contract is for less than

479
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,958
their allowance.

480
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,333
Mister Maou, the good news is
you're Mister Urushihara's

481
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,625
recognized guardian.

482
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,208
So the "cooling-off"
rule applies

483
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,125
in this circumstance.

484
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,000
[ASHIYA] Honestly!

485
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,041
He completely bamboozled us!

486
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,083
True dat; I still can't
believe we met a human

487
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,000
who could out-bedeviled
the Devil.

488
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,916
And we were saved
by the Hero Emilia;

489
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,083
who would have thought?

490
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,375
Well, she's used to
return-happy customers.

491
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,666
Maybe one day we can get
her over on our side.

492
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,333
Surely you jest, Sire.

493
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,416
And uh-- I'm ready
to order when you are.

494
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,458
Cool, I'm gonna have
what you're having.

495
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,208
[BOTH]
Excuse us!

496
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,500
Two Cat's Dooms please!

497
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,458
[EMI] Are you
dense or something?

498
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,916
Hi, Emi.

499
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,708
To think the Devil
himself is waiting out

500
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,875
in the pouring rain
with no umbrella.

501
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,916
Shut up.

502
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,083
Take this.

503
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,458
Hmm?

504
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,958
I threw out the umbrella
I borrowed from you before,

505
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,833
so I'm replacing it
with a new one.

506
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:23,958
Don't be such an ingrate.

507
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,583
Take the thing already.

508
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,291
Just take it!

509
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,916
Yeah. Fine.

510
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:46,041
So uh-- Thanks, I guess.

511
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,916
[EMI] You are very welcome.
