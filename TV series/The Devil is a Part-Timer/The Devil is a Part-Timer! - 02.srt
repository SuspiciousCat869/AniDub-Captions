[EMILIA in Ente Islan]

00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,833
I saw you cast a spell.

6
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,875
Tell me, Satan, why
would the King of Darkness

7
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,041
be working part-time
at a MgRonalds?

8
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,833
The Hero, Emilia?

9
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,291
Yeah, forget about me,
what are you doing here?

10
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,333
[EMILIA] I leapt through
the Gate, just like you.

11
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,416
[EMILIA] This moment
shall be your last.

12
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,166
[MAOU] Emilia,
wait! I can explain!

13
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,875
No. I don't want to hear
what you have to say!

14
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,875
Prepare to die, Devil!

15
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,833
Let's chat, okay?

16
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,208
No, let's don't.

17
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,875
I'm not here to talk it out;
I'm here to kill you.

18
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,458
Cool. It's just your knife.

19
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,208
Isn't it from that crappy
hundred-yen store downtown?

20
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,833
What? I--

21
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,291
What's your stupid point?

22
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,041
[MAOU] Where's
your Sacred Sword?

23
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,708
It-- You know what, that's
not really any of your business.

24
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,833
[MAOU] Have you by chance
lost your Celestial Force?

25
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,958
Or maybe you just can't
afford to waste it?

26
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,125
[EMILIA] Well, you're in
the same boat, aren't you?

27
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,708
The magic I'm sensing
from you right now

28
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,166
is practically nothing compared
to what it was in Ente Isla.

29
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,208
Duh. Obviously;
I'm on a bike.

30
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,291
[EMILIA] Sword or no sword,
a Devil without magic

31
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,833
working fast-food is not an
adversary I need to worry about!

32
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,500
En garde!

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,958
My poor, poor ingredients.

34
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,125
[ASHIYA] His Majesty
sure is late.

35
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,875
Now, tell me why you
two were fighting

36
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,083
in the middle of the street.

37
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,833
[EMILIA] Because
I must destroy him.

38
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:59,083
"Destroy him"? Look, lady.

39
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,458
I don't know what
your boyfriend did,

40
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,708
and it doesn't really matter.

41
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,416
No knife fighting.
You can't do that.

42
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,625
Did you say
boyfriend?

43
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,833
Bet he thinks
we're dating

44
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,875
and I cheated
or dumped you.

45
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,541
I am not in a romantic
relationship with this freak!

46
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,125
I getcha.

47
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,583
If you've decided you would like
to end things with him, though,

48
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,375
you need to be
more mature about it.

49
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,958
I'm cutting you some
slack today, so get lost.

50
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:26,958
Huh?

51
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,625
But this will
be the last time.

52
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,916
And by the way,
I know where you live.

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,166
I'm confident tonight will

54
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,750
be the last good night's
sleep you'll ever have.

55
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,791
Not nice.

56
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,500
Doesn't really sound like the
kinda thing a hero should say.

57
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,125
I didn't ask for the opinion
of a part-time Devil!

58
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,833
Yeah, okay, whatever.

59
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,666
Gimme back my umbrella,
discount store hero.

60
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,291
You told me I could
throw it away, remember?

61
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,916
I took it carefully apart
and put it in the trash.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,541
[MAOU] Rude!

63
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,708
I'm a hero--I can't just
leave the Devil's umbrella

64
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,833
lying around for an
innocent to discover.

65
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,958
Ugh. You are such a pain.

66
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,375
That's right.

67
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,375
Starting tomorrow you
should watch your back. Hmph!

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,125
[MAOU] She sure doesn't
seem all that heroic to me.

69
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,791
[FEMALE OPERATOR 2A]
Yes, Sir. We can do that.

70
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,041
[FEMALE OPERATOR 2B]
I do apologize, Ma'am.

71
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,416
[FEMALE OPERATOR 2C] So which
calling plan sounds best?

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,875
Right. Again,
my name is Miss Yusa.

73
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,708
And thank you so much for
allowing me to assist you.

74
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,958
Jeez!

75
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,666
I've had like five
million complaints today.

76
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,541
Least try crackin' open a
manual for once, am I right?

77
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,083
Oh. Hey, so--
you wanna grab lunch

78
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,083
at that curry place
that just opened?

79
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,041
[EMILIA] Eh, don't you think
it'll still be too crowded?

80
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,041
[RIKA] I guess we could
just go the Miggy R's route

81
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,041
if you're worried about time.

82
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,166
No! Anything
but that. Sorry.

83
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,833
[RIKA] Gross. Another one.

84
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,750
[EMILIA] Here we go.
Back to it.

85
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,833

[MALE REPORTER 2A] It's time
for "Crash That Dinner!"

All right folks,
this is the next house

90
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,958
that's about to get crashed!

91
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,166
Wow, I've definitely
caught the scent

92
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,375
of something enticing
all of a sudden!

93
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,708
[MALE REPORTER 2A]
Why, this looks sumptuous!

94
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,166
Is that a steak I see?

95
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,583
Are we celebrating
something this evening?

96
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,000
Aha! Now, I see
why it smells so good!

97
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,791
Focus on this, camera guy!

98
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,125
You're using high-quality
meat, aren't you, Ma'am?

99
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:51,833
Could this be one of the most
expensive cuts out there?

100
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,208
How is what
I'm doing right now

101
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,458
any different than what
that buffoon is up to?

102
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,958
Wish we had a little
more protein this time.

103
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,625
You eat hamburgers on an
almost daily basis, Sire;

104
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,708
you get plenty.

Dinner crasher guy?

107
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,541
I'm gonna say no.

108
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,916
Salesperson?

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,541
[ASHIYA] I doubt we live
in the kind of neighborhood

110
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,750
where people feel comfortable
going door to door

111
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,583
in an attempt to
sell anything legal.

112
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,625
[ASHIYA] Hello. To whom
do we owe the pleasure?

113
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,583
[EMILIA] That's an
unexpectedly courteous greeting

114
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,291
coming from a demon.

115
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,500
Especially you, General Alciel.

116
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,583
I assume you
also remember me.

117
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,833
Emilia the Hero.

118
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,958
[gasps]
Emilia the Hero?

119
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,833
[EMILIA] Yes! Now, open
this door immediately!

120
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,250
Accept your punishment
with a little dignity! Hey!

121
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,416
It's the Hero, Sire!

122
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
The Hero is here
and she hath found us!

123
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,333
Yeah. I kinda
know already.

124
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,541
You knew she was here
and didn't say anything?

125
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,208
Mmm... I probably
should have mentioned it

126
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,666
to you earlier.

127
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,666
I ran into her yesterday;
she mighta tried to kill me.

128
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,375
[EMILIA] Hurry up!

129
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,875
[sighs] The cops thought
we were dating

130
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,375
and having a "lovers quarrel." 

131
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,333
[EMILIA] Yeah and it was the
most mortifying thing ever!

132
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,875
Me, dating the ruler of demons?

133
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,875
[knocking]

134
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,541
And now she's here.

135
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,583
Might I ask why you didn't feel
the need to tell me this, Sire?

136
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,375
[MAOU] Well, I figured she
didn't do any real damage.

137
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,208
Other than completely
stressing me out,

138
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,583
she doesn't have any powers
left to use against me.

139
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,875
So, she's like us.

140
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,333
And most likely
doesn't have the ability

141
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,958
to replenish her powers
in this world either.

142
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,375
Which means the Hero has

143
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,958
no more control
of the Gate than we.

144
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,541
[MAOU] Aw, let her in.

145
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,291

[door opening]

147
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,166
[EMILIA] This place is a dump.

148
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,791
It's shabby, it's tiny,
and it's got paper-thin walls.

149
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,375
[MAOU] Okay, now
you're just being mean.

150
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,500
[sniffles]

151
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,625
[ASHIYA] The Devil's
Castle prioritizes

152
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,250
functionality over comfort.

153
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,208
Oh, really? This is what
you call functional?

154
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,041
Quite the royal feast
you got there.

155
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,000
Hey, Ashiya is
an amazing cook!

156
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,000
He whips up meals out
of practically nothing;

157
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,291

00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,791
I am truly honored by
your kind praise, Sire.

Did I travel all the way

from another world just
to kill this disaster?

169

It's pathetic!

I mean, even I've
found a better way

I'm all alone here.

One of the high priests
was supposed to come, too.

176
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,166
Our plan was to go back home

177
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,791
as soon as we destroyed
you in this world.

'Tis rather amusing;

you're like a search party that

Well, now that that's settled,

you should find
yourself a way home.

at a world conquest from
this current Devil's Castle!

you are dead wrong;
I've got goals.

One of which is to
subjugate this world!

For your information, Hero.

202

MgRonald's sometimes lets

Hear me, Emilia!

204
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,458
I shall become a regular
employee in this world!

205

And thus, accumulate
wealth and social status.

I do not appreciate

you're better off
just buying a melon!

00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,208
[MAOU] Sheesh, calm down.

293
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,416
[ASHIYA] And don't
you "sheesh" me!

00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,625
Are you ready to order
some food, Miss?

299
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,666
[EMI] I need to
speak with you outside.

As soon as
you get off work,

00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,375
meet me at the intersection
where we first met.

00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,666
And I'm not taking
no for an answer.

304
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,333
[MAOU] Would you like
to make that a Meal?

305
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,500
Come alone or else.

306
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,541
Okay, we can do that.

307
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,000
Just the burger this time.

308
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,583
Could I get one
Big Mig please? To Go!

309
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,625
I don't plan on
fighting you, either.

310
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,708
So don't chicken out.

311
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,083
Great. Thanks a bunch!

312
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,875
Step to the side, please,
your food will be right out!

313
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,833
Such a pain.

314
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,541
[CHIHO] That customer was
kind of weird, wasn't she?

315
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,708
[MAOU] Sure was.

316
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,375
Takes all kinds, as they say.

317
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,250
[CHIHO] Looked like you two

318
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,416
were talking about something.

319
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,375
Do you know her?

320
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,875
[MAOU] I guess you could say
we have a bit of "history."

321
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,041
Ha! I knew she
smelled fishy!

322
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,375
How come?

323
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,291
First of all she was sort
of pretty, wasn't she?

324
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,166
Did <i>you</i> think
she was pretty? Huh?!

325
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,666
I don't understand why
you're yelling at me.

326
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,000
What's this all about?

327
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,333
It's not like you're my--

328
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,625
Welcome to MgRonald's!

329
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,541
I can take your order
whenever you're ready.

330
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,000
'Kay, I'm headin' out
for the day, Mister Maou!

331
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,291
Hm? Night, Chi. Be careful!

332
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,333
Bye; I'll be back in tomorrow!

333
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,458
Oh, by the way.

334
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,708
[MAOU] Yeah?

335
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,000
Were you all right in
yesterday's earthquake?

336
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,208
[MAOU] Earthquake?

337
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,041
Oh, yeah, I guess there was one.

338
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,875
Some reason my roommate
didn't feel it.

339
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,458
Your who did what?

340
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,125
[MAOU]
"My who did what" what?

341
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,000
You didn't tell me
you had a roommate.

342
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,333
[MAOU] Let's stick
with the earthquake.

343
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,541
Oh, right.

344
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,583
Must've hit my place super hard.

345
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,666
When I got home from school,

346
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,708
all my books and
CDs were on the floor.

347
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,208
It was such a mess.

348
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,625
What? I didn't realize it
was that big; I barely felt it.

349
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,791
Weird.

350
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,416
That's what everyone
at school said, too,

351
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,833
so I guess it was just randomly
focused on where I live, then.

352
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,500
Mister Maou, I almost forgot!

353
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,791
[MAOU] What? What?

354
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,208
[CHIHO] Remember that time--

355
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,166
you told me you have a roommate?

356
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,291
I do.

357
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,791
Might-- this, um--
Might this roommate

358
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,916
be of the girlfriend
roommate persuasion

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,583
by any chance at all?

360
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,916
No, it's not a girlfriend.

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,666
I'm broke, so I live
with an old serva--

362
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,166
I mean, old friend of mine.

363
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,125
Oh. Well, that's
totally fine, then. Heh.

364
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:52,875
Thank goodness.

365
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,291
[MAOU] For what?

366
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,791
So, whad'ya
wanna talk about?

367
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,791
I want the answer to
an important question.

368
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,041
The truth.

369
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,791
Would you prefer to stay
in this world forever?

370
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,250
What? No, of course
I wouldn't.

371
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,375
Jeez, where did
that even come from?

372
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,666
[EMI] I've watched your
behavior and attitude at work,

373
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,458
not to mention your crap home
over the last several days.

374
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,916
So now you're stalking me?

375
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,458
[EMI] You haven't
done anything evil,

376
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,208
and you're living a
simple, serious life.

377
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,083
Your manager and your co-workers
all trust you implicitly,

378
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,375
and you deal with customers
confidently and kindly.

379
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,458
You're the perfect
MgRonald's employee.

380
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,375
That's not a
compliment, is it?

381
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,958
I was ready to write
off what you said,

382
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,750
about trying to conquer
this world for yourself,

383
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,916
but now I'm starting
to think there was

384
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,625
some truth behind those words.

385
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,583
Because if you're
willing to spend

386
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,750
the rest of your
life in this world,

387
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,416
then I don't feel
a need to defeat you

388
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,166
just for the sake of it.

389
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,083
Why don't you and
Ashiya just stay here

390
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,333
and conquer stuff?

391
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,708
If telling straight men to live

392
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,458
with other straight men
forever is some sort of

393
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,166
twisted thing you've got,
you need major help, lady.

394
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,458
I think you should
give up on Ente Isla.

395
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,083
Find a new life and a
new enemy here on Earth.

396
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,291
Ha! Not gonna happen.

397
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,500
I told you, I'm going
back to Ente Isla,

398
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,583
and I will subjugate it.

399
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,583
Ugh, he's unbelievable.

400
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,583
Maybe I'm wrong;
maybe he's not the Devil.

401
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,250
[MAOU] A flat tire?
Get it together, Dullahan!

402
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,916
How could you die on me
right after I bought you?!

403
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,666
Jeez, dramatic much?

404
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,750
You know you can fix a flat

405
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,458
for practically nothing,
don't you?

406
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,958
[MAOU] Are you for real?

407
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,000
Then I'll go first
thing in the morning!

408
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,166
I think someone's
shooting at us.

409
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,833
I think you're right.

410
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,166
Blasted right
through that sign!

411
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,750
I didn't say you
could touch me!

412
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,458
Are you seriously
arguing with me right now?

413
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,791
Not bad for a girl.

414
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,333
Give me some credit.
I'm the Hero.

415
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,416
I'll give you credit
if you get off of me.

416
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,416
Eh?! That was your
fault for being weak

417
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,166
and letting me land on you.

418
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,250
[MAOU] It's early
enough for there to be

419
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,041
plenty of people
at the train station.

420
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,208
How fast can you run?

421
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,541
I bet I'm faster than you

422
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,583
since you're used to
riding a bike all the time.

423
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,625
Race ya there! Come on!

424
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,583
[MAOU] I guess they're not
following us out this far, huh?

425
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,458
We should be safe now.

426
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,791
What do you think
that was about?

427
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,708
[MAOU] I dunno, but it
was no ordinary sniper.

428
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,125
Those bullets were
made of magical energy.

429
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,708
[EMI] Magic?
So what's that mean?

430
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,083
We're dealing with
someone fairly powerful.

431
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,166
And that someone knows
who you and I really are.

432
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,458
But who could
that possibly be?

433
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,625
[MAOU] A mystery sniper
at the precise place

434
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,708
a demon and a hero meet up?

435
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,791
The logical assumption is
they've gotta be from Ente Isla.

436
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,000
Ya see the kind of
trouble you get me into?

437
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,500
Wait, you think
this is my fault?

438
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,041
[MAOU] If you'd picked
a safer time and place,

439
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,500
this wouldn't have happened.

440
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,250
So yes, I think
it is your fault.

441
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,458
[EMI] Wrong!

442
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,166
It's totally your fault
for working so late!

443
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,291
[MAOU] Well, we could
have met in the afternoon.

444
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,541
[EMI] I have to work
in the afternoon, genius!

445
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,083
[MAOU] That's not
really my problem, is it?

446
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,541
[EMI] Hey! Where're you--?

447
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,458
I gotta work early.
I'm heading home to crash.

448
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,083
[EMI] What?
You're going off alone?

449
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,500
[MAOU] That's the plan.

450
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,666
You probably oughtta
be careful out here.

451
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,041
See ya!

452
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,916
Now whaddaya want?

453
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,500
You planning to go
on a night raid?

454
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,500
Something like that?

455
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,666
No. Nothing
like that; promise.

456
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,208
Then what's the big idea?

457
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,041
My landlady lives in the
apartment right next door to us!

458
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,791
I'd rather avoid
running into her,

459
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,791
so no making a scene, okay?

460
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,666
Jeez. What is it?

461
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,083
[EMI] This makes me
wanna puke just asking.

462
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,291
And more importantly, it's a
breach of my faith, but still.

463
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,875
Did you come here just
to try and piss me off?

464
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,416
Um. Would you--

465
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,791
[MAOU] What?

466
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:14,791
Would... you let me
stay the night with you?

467
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,541
When we ran,
I dropped my wallet.

468
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,083
[ASHIYA] Emilia the Hero!

469
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,500
[MAOU] Keep your pants on;

470
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,291
she doesn't have the energy
to fight at the moment.

471
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,250
Unacceptable!

472
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,541
You are the King of Darkness;

473
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,250
you cannot simply
"party the night away"

474
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,666
with some fucshia-haired floozy!

475
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,541
We got shot at earlier
tonight with magical bullets.

476
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,333
Both of us were targeted, too.

477
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,458
No, my Liege!

478
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,750
[MAOU] Yes, and she
dropped her wallet

479
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,916
while we were running away.

480
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,666
So, apparently she lives
too far away to walk.

481
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,916
Guess having a bike is
better than you thought, huh?

482
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,250
I'm confused, Sire.

483
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,208
Are you saying she's
spending the night with us?

484
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,375
That's what I'm saying;
come on in, Emi.

485
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,750
Um, thank you
for having me.

486
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,291
[MAOU] You can sit wherever.

487
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,125
And FYI, don't expect
any luxuries or anything,

488
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,833
like a bed to sleep on.

489
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,375
[EMI] No worries; I won't.

490
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,916
What kind of
disrespectful attitude

491
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,750
is that in the face of King
Satan's act of benevolence?

492
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,291
[MAOU] Shut it, Ashiya,
or the landlady will show up.

493
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,708
Here, Emi. You can use this.

494
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,708
[EMI] That's the
same detergent I use.

495
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,500
[MAOU] If you want a pillow,
use some of those magazines.

496
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,125
Suppose I can lend you
a little money for now, too.

497
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,166
Use it to get out of
here on the first bus.

498
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,791
'Kay.

499
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,458
[ASHIYA] His Evilness
graciously lends you

500
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,583
that money from his
less-than-meager savings.

501
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,625
Treat it with reverence!

502
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:33,916
You've made yourselves clear!

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,041
I'll leave in the morning,
thanks for the loan.

504
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,791
Goodnight!

505
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,583
I dislike this one.

506
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,208
[MAOU] We should turn in, too.

507
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,375
Right.

508
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,750
But know that I shan't
let my guard down!

509
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,666
So none of your funny business!

510
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,083
[EMI] This is the worst.

511
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,625
How did I end up here?

512
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,000
[MAOU] Y'know,
we were pretty miserable

513
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,041
at first, too, remember?

514
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,583
[ASHIYA] Yes, Sire.

515
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:10,833
[MAOU] And we got
through it okay

516
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,375
because there were two of us.

517
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,750
But Emi doesn't have anyone.

518
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,833
[ASHIYA] Is it just me, King
Satan, or are you growing soft?

519
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,458
[MAOU] Who's this? Earthquakes?

520
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,416
There are more of them coming?

521
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,708
Oh. I've got a
text from Chi, too.

522
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,625
"There's going to
be another earthquake.

523
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,916
What do I do?" Weird.

524
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,958
Something wrong, Sire?

525
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,416
[MAOU] What's going on?
