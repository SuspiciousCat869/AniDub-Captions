00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,416
[doorbell]

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,041
Why would someone
come by so early?

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,416
Not sure.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,708
It does seem a rather unusual
time for a salesperson.

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,166
[doorbell]

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,625
Salutations.

7
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:20,666
Salutations?

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,333
Perhaps that
girl from yesterday?

9
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,166
You mean that girl who
fell down the stairs?

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,041
[ASHIYA] Yes, Sire.

11
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,458
[doorbell]

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,041
[GIRL] Salutations!

13
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,333
[MAOU] Yeah. Coming!

14
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:38,750
Good morning.

15
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,291
Forgive the early hour.

16
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,041
My name is Suzuno
Kama-zuki, and,

17
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,583
as of yesterday,
I am your new neighbor.

18
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,208
I'm afraid I've already been
rude and caused trouble,

19
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,666
so I must humbly apologize
for my wretchedness.

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,333
Your wretchedness?

21
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,208
Um. Thanks,
that's very courteous.

22
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,083
I'm pleased to
formally meet you.

23
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,958
My name is Sadao Maou.

24
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,833
This is but a small
gift of my thanks

25
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,250
and good wishes,
as your new neighbor.

26
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,208
I have been told that
noodles are the best gift

27
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,208
for someone to give
their new neighbor.

28
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,500
New neighbor, got it.

29
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,000
That's very nice of you.

30
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,916
Sire. Do you
need assistance?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That looks heavy.

32
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,416
[MAOU] That's because it is!

33
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,958
Oh. G'd morning, Miss.

34
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,333
My name is Ashiya,
I'm an old friend of Maou's;

35
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,541
it is a pleasure to meet you.

36
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,291
Likewise; I actually
know who you two are.

37
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,500
I have never met the landlady

38
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,541
of this fine
establishment before.

39
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,083
But I received a
letter from a person

40
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,083
whom I believe to be her,
and it instructed me

41
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,458
to come to you if
I had any issues.

42
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,333
Oh? Does it now?

43
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,958
Yes, there was
a photo enclosed,

44
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:40,291
[slow-motion talking]
if you would like to see it.

45
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,458
No, no, that's fine;
I'm sure it's her!

46
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,833
[toilet flushes]

47
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,083
At any rate.

48
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,041
I'm relieved to have such
helpful new neighbors.

49
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,291
I wonder if you
would be kind enough

50
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,791
to instruct me in the
"lower class living"?

51
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,041
[URUSHIHARA]
Heh, the lower class living?

52
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,583
Is there
another person here?

53
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,833
[MAOU] Yeah, we inherited
a third roommate recently.

54
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,500
I'm Urushihara.
Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,625
[MAOU, mockingly]
"And I'm a lazy bum!"

56
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,375
Well, that's not
my choice, is it?

57
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,291
[MAOU] And why is that exactly?

58
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,458
'Cause--you-- Shut up.

59
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,000
[SUZUNO] I see. I understand.

60
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,833
You understand what?

61
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,000
I shall excuse
myself for now.

62
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,583
Salutations, again.

63
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,958
[MAOU and ASHIYA]
Yeah. Salutations.

64
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,666
[phone rings]

65
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,500
[EMERALDA] Hello! You're
speaking to Emeralda Etuva!

66
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,708
[EMI] Yeah, I actually know

67
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,541
who I'm speaking to
because I called you.

68
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,708
This is Emilia.

69
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,833
I just got a package,

70
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,583
and the label says
it came from you.

71
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,916
Did you send something?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,166
[EMERALDA] I can't believe
it already arrived!

73
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,375
How amazing; I only put it
out for delivery yesterday.

74
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,666
That is surprisingly fast!

75
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,583
I sent you a gift--
celestial force!

76
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,625
What? Celestial force?

77
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,625
That's right.

78
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,125
I tried to process
it into a form

79
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,458
that wouldn't seem out
of the ordinary there.

80
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,500
Oh, I do hope you like it!

81
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,666
Interesting. So, it's
called "Holyvitan B"?

82
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,125
[EMERALDA] That's not a
"b," silly! It's a "beta!"

83
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,458
Right, beta, whatever.

84
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,708
Anyway, you're saying downing

85
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,916
this energy drink will
replenish my force?

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
[EMERALDA] Yep.

87
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,958
But let me be
absolutely clear here,

88
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,500
be very careful with the dosage!

89
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait, how careful?

90
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,750
Are you saying I can
drink too much of it?

91
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,833
[EMERALDA] Uh-huh.

92
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,916
Under no circumstances
are you to drink

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,583
more than two
bottles in one day.

94
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,208
You can have
one bottle in the morning

95
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,000
and another in the afternoon.

96
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,958
That said, if you
skip your first dose,

97
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,958
you can't simply
double up on them later

98
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,458
in the day to
make up for it, okay?

99
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,458
Yeah. Seems easy
enough; I think I got it.

100
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,833
[EMERALDA] Wonderful!

101
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,166
And, please follow the
instructions to the letter.

102
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,166
I know how you can get.

103
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,500
Talk to you later!
[disconnects]

104
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,125
Weird. Where is
that girl, anyway?

105
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,416
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

106
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,541
[EMI] Why does it always
seem to be so hot outside?

107
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,750
And it's not like those
guys are up to much.

108
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,125
I feel like I'm sweating
out here for nothing.

109
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,125
It's all about perspective!

110
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,000
The fact that
they're just working

111
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,750
and eating like normal people
is a good thing, right?

112
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,708
They're behaving.

113
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,458
I guess another
way of looking at this,

114
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,250
could make me seem
like a weirdo stalking

115
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,416
a nice group of boys who all
live together. Whatever.

116
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,375
[SUZUNO] Honestly!

117
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,666
Can you not adequately
hang one piece of laundry?

118
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,541
You truly know
nothing of chores,

119
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,541
do you, good Hanzo?

120
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,666
Dude, lay off me. Ugh.

121
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,666
[SUZUNO] You cannot allow
clothes to dry wrinkled...

122
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,625
[EMI] Who is that?

123
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,875
Yeah, yeah, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

124
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,791
Jeez, you're like
the ghost of Ashiya

125
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,375
haunting me before
he's even dead.

126
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,500
[EMI] Okay. What's
going on? Think, Emi.

127
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,708
Could she possibly
be a new demon?

128
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,583
Ah, this might
be a little risky,

129
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,375
but what choice do I have?

130
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,291
[SUZUNO] You need to
get your act together

131
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,916
in times of crisis like this.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,125
Pay attention.

133
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,458
Chop the Welsh onions,
grate the ginger,

134
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,291
and dilute the
broth with cold water.

135
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,666
Now, all you
have to do is boil

136
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,833
some udon noodles,

137
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,833
and you've got a
delicious meal in a flash.

138
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,000
Once the noodles are done,
give them a quick rinse,

139
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,083
and you'll have a very
respectable cold udon.

140
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,291
If we had a raw egg,
it would be even better.

141
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,791
[URUSHIHARA] Ugh.

142
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,291
How can you stand to boil
anything when it's this hot out?

143
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,958
Good Shiro does this
for three meals every day.

144
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,833
Do you feel no filial piety?

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,125
Thank you,
Miss Kamazuki,

146
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,250
and please keep
trying with the boy.

147
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,375
That creature refuses to
listen to his own family.

148
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,458
[SUZUNO] Go on.
Grate some ginger.

149
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,458
Surely you can handle
a simple grater.

150
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,291
[URUSHIHARA]
Don't call me Shirley.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,125
Uh-oh.

152
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,083
Ashiya, it looks like
we're out of ginger.

153
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,083
[ASHIYA] Oh right, I finished
the last of it yesterday.

154
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,583
I beg your pardon,
Miss Kamazuki,

155
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,458
but let's just add
Welsh onions this time.

156
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,791
[EMI] What are they even doing?

157
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,125
[SUZUNO] I shall fetch
ginger from my room

158
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,500
and return forthwith.

159
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,750
Crap!

160
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:46,041
[EMI screams]

161
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,708
[crash]

162
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,166
[MAOU] I don't think you
actually know how to use stairs.

163
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,416
[EMI] Wha--? Maou?

164
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,583
[MAOU] Seriously.

165
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,458
You need to, like,
practice or something.

166
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,291
[URUSHIHARA] What's
going on? Who fell?

167
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,666
[EMI groans]

168
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,583
[SUZUNO] I apologize.

169
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,041
This is because I opened
the door so suddenly.

170
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,750
No, so not your fault.

171
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,916
I'm the one who's sorry;

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,041
I should have been
paying better attention

173
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,166
to what I was doing.

174
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,416
Yep, totally.

175
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,250
Yet she claims to be a hero.

176
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,208
So yeah!

177
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,416
You're welcome, Emi;

178
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,000
I picked up all the crap
you dropped outside.

179
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,250
Oh, good.

180
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,625
I suppose you can just
put it over there, then.

181
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,625
[URUSHIHARA] And I
suppose you can just

182
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,041
cut the stupid
pretentious tone.

183
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,208
What is this?

184
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,083
Never pegged you as
an energy drink fan.

185
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,000
Give that back!

186
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,291
Stuff'll give you heat stroke

187
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,166
like Our Lady Ashiya
of the Floorboards.

188
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,208
For real?

189
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,916
You're suffering
from heat stroke?

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,958
No, I just get sick
every once in awhile

191
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,458
like most human beings do.

192
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,625
I'm afraid my gift

193
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,333
was the culprit for
your current state.

194
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,500
I should have chosen

195
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,708
something more thoughtful
and nutritious.

196
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,875
Oh no.

197
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,875
You're hardly responsible,
Miss Kamazuki.

198
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,166
[SUZUNO] Sorry, I haven't
introduced myself!

199
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,250
I moved in next door to these
kind gentlemen last week.

200
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,375
Nice to meet you;
I'm Suzuno Kamazuki.

201
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,708
As I hail
from an ancient

202
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,125
and old-fashioned
family in another land,

203
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,083
I am still fairly unaccustomed
to this particular area.

204
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,250
I would be most happy

205
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,875
if you could instruct
me in "city life."

206
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,375
[EMI] Sounds a lot like me.

207
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,625
[SUZUNO]
Pardon?

208
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,791
Nothing! My name's
Emi Yusa. It's a pleasure.

209
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,750
Yum. Thanks
for the grub.

210
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,333
[MAOU] There's too much
to do and memorize.

211
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,583
I am exhausted.

212
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,416
[EMI] Because your part-time
job is just so hard?

213
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,958
I'll have you know
while you spend your days

214
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,625
dilly-dallying through
your little life

215
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,750
on your little telephone,

216
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,458
I've been greatly
maturing as a human.

217
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,000
In what way?

218
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,000
Also you don't
really count as "human."

219
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,458
Did you forget, Emi?

220
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,583
A mere two days
from now, this Sunday,

221
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,958
I will be the new shift manager

222
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,375
at the MgRonald's over
by the train station!

223
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,583
I will be the assistant boss!

224
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,750
[EMI] Whoopee.

225
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,125
Hey, don't act
like it's not a big deal.

226
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,583
Shift managers get paid more

227
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,208
and have a major position of
responsibility, so there!

228
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,291
Yes, I'm sure
it's a big deal to you;

229
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,666
but the point you
seem to be missing

230
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,041
is that I couldn't care less.

231
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,291
Fine, be that way.

232
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,041
But don't act surprised
when I eventually climb

233
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,625
past heights you
can't even imagine!

234
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,791
[EMI] Are you an idiot?

235
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,916
[ASHIYA] No, ma'am!

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,541
I cannot allow you
to speak to the head

237
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,833
of our household in such
a disrespectful manner.

238
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,875
[EMI] What?

239
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,833
[SUZUNO] Good Emi,
do you perchance

240
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,791
have an intimate relationship
with Good Sadao?

241
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,291
Not funny, Suzuno!

242
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,416
Well.

243
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,791
I have noticed your
conversations seem

244
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,000
to flow back and
forth quite easily.

245
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,916
It is rather as though there is
no restraint between you two.

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,291
H'yeah, like an old married
couple or somethin'.

247
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,583
Shut up, twerp,
nobody asked you!

248
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,083
No, there's no
restraint between us.

249
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,625
But more importantly,
there's no trust,

250
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,875
or friendship,
or anything positive!

251
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,250
In fact, I pretty seriously
want him to drop dead,

252
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,250
so don't get it twisted;
we will never be "intimate."

253
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,250
Oh. I see.

254
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,083
[EMI] I'm gettin' some
serious deja vu right now.

255
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,500
Look, I'm sure
I'm reading this wrong,

256
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,458
but are you maybe
crushing on Maou?

257
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,791
Gah. Emi.

258
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,125
That was so loud; what if
he heard what you said?

259
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,375
Oh. No--I'm sorry.

260
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,625
I didn't actually think
you were, so uh--

261
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,666
Well, be that as it may,
I'm very impressed.

262
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,000
How did you figure it out?

263
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,958
I dunno, I can't
really explain it.

264
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,083
[EMI] Probably shouldn't
mention I've been

265
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,750
through this before
with another girl.

266
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,333
You know, I guess it's
just our ladies' intuition.

267
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,875
Of course.
How remarkable.

268
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,750
[EMI] At first, I thought
she was an assassin

269
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,708
from Ente Isla, or
possibly another demon.

270
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,958
But assassins don't normally
stay still for a whole week.

271
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,500
And as far as demons go,
she's way too polite.

272
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,916
Maybe I should
give her a warning.

273
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,541
[EMI] Hey, um, Suzuno.

274
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,416
I'm sure you'll think
this is none of my business,

275
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,958
but I need to
tell you something.

276
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,375
[SUZUNO] You do?

277
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,875
[EMI] Yeah, you shouldn't get
too close to those guys.

278
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,625
It'll only end badly for you.

279
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,416
What do you mean badly?

280
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,208
[EMI] Maou's not the kind of
boy a normal girl can handle.

281
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,250
I just think it's best
to steer clear of him.

282
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,041
No, I'll be fine!

283
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,708
I know I may not look
it at the moment,

284
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,000
but I'm a seasoned warrior!

285
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,125
Still, though.

286
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,041
Since this warning
is coming from you,

287
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,416
I'll be careful.

288
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I doubt you'd mention this
to me if you didn't have

289
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,875
a reason to believe it.

290
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,666
Nevertheless, it's too
late for me to leave.

291
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,708
I'm sorry if this
is impertinent,

292
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,208
but would you lend me
your aid should I need it?

293
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,083
Sure.

294
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,708
I'll do whatever I can to help.

295
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,708
You will?

296
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,583
Wonderful, I can
rest easier, now.

297
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,500
I have an idea;
wait here a sec.

298
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,500
You guys didn't go
and do anything stupid

299
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,125
while I was out there, did you?

300
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,708
What, n' incur the wrath
o' the daring hero?

301
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,791
Here ya go, I've written
down my cell number,

302
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,625
my email, and my address.

303
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,083
If these buttheads
are rude or make you

304
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,250
feel uncomfortable at all,
just let me know, okay?

305
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,125
Thank you.
I am in your debt.

306
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,375
Come on.

307
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,166
Quit freaking out;
what do you think we are?

308
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,333
Bloodthirsty demons

309
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,208
who are more despicable
than cockroaches?

310
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,291
I'm sure I don't
have to say this,

311
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,750
but if you pull
anything with that girl,

312
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,083
I'll cut off your
head and display it

313
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,833
on your filthy windowsill.

314
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,250
Jeez, what are you now?

315
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,666
The evil police?

316
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,125
All righty then, I think
that should take care of that.

317
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,250
Don't worry, though.

318
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,541
They're actually
a lot better behaved

319
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,708
than I generally
give them credit for.

320
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,958
See you later!

321
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,708
[EMI falls down the steps]

322
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:25,291
I'm fine! I am OK
this time; I'm good!

323
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,041
Nothing to see here.

324
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,583
[MAOU] She
make it okay?

325
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,083
[SUZUNO] No, but she only
fell half-way this time.

326
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,250
Baby steps, Emi,
baby steps.

327
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,500
[EMI whines]

328
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,791
[MAOU] Awright, I'm out.

329
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,333
May the tides of war
be with you, Sire.

330
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,583
[MAOU] Don't worry about seeing
me off, just stay in bed.

331
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,000
Ugh, dealing with Emi
saps my energy every time.

332
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,666
[SUZUNO] Good Sadao.

333
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,083
[MAOU] Oh, Miss Kamazuki.

334
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,083
Sorry about Emi earlier.

335
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,333
She can be kind
of a handful;

336
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,458
I hope she didn't say
anything rude to you.

337
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,416
No, she didn't say
anything rude at all.

338
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,166
Oh good; that's
a relief.

339
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,166
Well, I've gotta head to
work, so I'll see ya later.

340
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,625
Um, here. It's for you.

341
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,833
What is it?

342
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,958
[EMERALDA] So, how's it
going over there, Emilia?

343
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,583
Is the Holyvitan Beta
working out so far?

344
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,375
[EMI] Well, I've been
drinking it regularly,

345
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,666
but I haven't
really had a chance

346
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,166
to see if it's
doing much quite yet.

347
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,291
We haven't
been in any fights,

348
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,166
so I haven't needed
celestial force.

349
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,375
[EMERALDA] Wow, really?

350
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,750
Does that mean you're
getting along better

351
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,458
with the Devil and his
demon friends these days?

352
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,166
[EMI] I wouldn't say that.

353
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,625
We bicker pretty much
whenever we see each other.

354
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,250
And we're both so busy
working, neither of us

355
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,125
has the energy to actually
go out and get a life.

356
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,708
[EMERALDA] You
know what's funny?

357
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,875
That sounds like the
quintessential complaint

358
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,458
of couples who
don't get to spend

359
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,500
enough time together.

360
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,666
Whoa. Wha-- What?

361
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,208
Where did that come from?

362
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,958
I'm Ente Isla's hero and
he's the freaking Devil!

363
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,333
Maou's my enemy no matter
what situation we're in.

364
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,791
Couple? Seriously?

365
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,250
That makes me furious
just thinking about it!

366
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,666
I've been literally
stalking him

367
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,000
to make sure he's behaving.

368
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,500
How could you say
something like that?

369
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,208
[EMERALDA] You're right.
I'm sorry.

370
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,083
But, please, don't do
anything to make things

371
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,625
more difficult than
they need to be, okay?

372
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,000
With everything
else that's going on,

373
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,916
we can't afford to start
fighting demons, too.

374
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,541
Why would I do that?
I am the hero.

375
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,000
If it makes you feel better,

376
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,583
I swear on my parents' names
I won't screw anything up.

377
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,041
Now. How are things
progressing on your side?

378
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,125
[EMERALDA] I suppose
they're better

379
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,250
than we thought
they'd be at the moment.

380
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,083
None of the countries have made
any obvious moves, per se.

381
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,250
[EMI] "No obvious moves"
is a good thing?

382
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,583
[EMERALDA] Well, it's
the best we can hope for.

383
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,708
I'm getting information from
a lot of sources right now,

384
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:44,583
but so far it's all just
whispers and rumors. Also...

385
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,958
[EMI] Also what?

386
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,791
[EMERALDA] I heard the
Church's Missionary Division

387
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,500
is trying to uncover the truth
behind Olba's disappearance.

388
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,416
It's possible some people
are setting their sights

389
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,958
on finding you
hoping it might help them

390
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,458
figure out what happened.

391
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,000
Bottom line is,
under no circumstances

392
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,916
are you to let your guard down.

393
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,166
From what I've been told,

394
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,458
some of these interested
parties may not be above

395
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,541
taking out Japan if it
gets them faster answers.

396
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,791
I guess catching a break

397
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,333
is too much for a hero
to ask for. Lucky me.

398
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,541
[EMERALDA] Seems
that way. Well, then.

399
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,916
This bill will be
out of control

400
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,541
if we stay on the
phone much longer,

401
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,291
so I'm going to hang up now.

402
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,583
Be safe; talk to you later.

403
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,375
Sure. You be safe, too.

404
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,833
[KISAKI] As you know, Sentucky
Fried Chicken across the road,

405
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,333
which is expected to
pose a huge threat to us,

406
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,125
will finally be open tomorrow.

407
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,875
Unfortunately,
I'll be out of town,

408
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,000
so I'm counting on
you to run the ship.

409
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,500
This is a big
deal for you, Maou;

410
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,875
think you'll be
able to handle it?

411
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,125
Yes!

412
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,500
[KISAKI] Of course, in
case there's an emergency,

413
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,583
I'll let you know where
you can reach me at any time.

414
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,625
But, unless it's
"someone-died" serious,

415
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,500
I want you to try and
handle things on your own.

416
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,958
This is a chance for major
personal development.

417
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,041
I understand, ma'am!

418
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,208
Tonight, you're
low on staff,

419
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,041
so stay out of the weeds.

420
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,375
In case you couldn't tell,

421
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,541
your new job as shift manager
is starting right now.

422
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,083
[KISAKI] You might
as well take a break now

423
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,041
since you won't be
getting one later.

424
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,708
If you can get
back here by six,

425
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,666
you can run and
grab some dinner.

426
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,041
Or, if you'd rather,
you can eat here no charge.

427
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,625
I brought food today,
but thanks anyway.

428
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,833
Hi Mister Maou! Are
you taking a break?

429
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,375
[MAOU] Yep. Gotta
refuel and all.

430
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,041
Excuse me. What's that?

431
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,041
[MAOU] What? My bento box?

432
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,333
Your bento box?

433
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,500
Because it looks pretty
darn fancy to me.

434
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,875
Did Mister Ashiya
splurge on that for you?

435
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,625
[MAOU] No. It's not
really my bento box.

436
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,750
A new neighbor moved in next
door, and let me borrow it.

437
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,958
New neighbor, huh?

438
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,541
Living right next door to you?

439
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,416
Yeah, she's cool;
I think you'd like her.

440
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,125
Your neighbor is a she?

441
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,000
Why are you yelling?

442
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,083
There's no
reason for yelling!

443
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,416
Wrong! A she moved
next door to you.

444
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,875
She's already loaned you her
personal fancy bento box.

445
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,125
Something's going
on! What is it?

446
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,083
Please stop shaking me;
it feels not good!

447
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,625
What you're telling me
here is the new girl

448
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,041
who moved in next door lent you

449
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,083
her personal bento box,
is that correct?

450
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,875
Yes, Chi.
That is correct.

451
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,125
Now Mister Maou,

452
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,375
I'm sure my fears are
completely unfounded.

453
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,208
I'm sure it could not
possibly be the case.

454
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,500
But I have to ask.
Is the meal homemade?

455
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,791
Uh. Yeah?

456
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,541
I'm fairly certain
she put it together herself.

457
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,708
I'm sorry, I need to see
the food now, please!

458
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,916
Sure, do whatever
you want!

459
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,333
Just stop shaking me!
Please, I'm begging you!

460
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,000
[CHIHO] A New Year's meal?

461
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,500
[MAOU] What's that mean?

462
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,000
You wanna see
what's on the bottom?

463
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,125
No wait; just
hold on a sec;

464
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,875
I'm not mentally
prepared for that yet!

465
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,541
Um. Okay.

466
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,416
[CHIHO] I've got
a bad feeling about this.

467
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,666
Something's wrong.

468
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,500
I know the adrenaline
has gotten me this far,

469
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,958
but if this is
my chance to turn back,

470
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,625
I should probably take it.

471
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,416
But, on the other hand,
after coming this far,

472
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,416
how can I just quit?

473
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,583
Now, Mister Maou.
Show me the bottom!

474
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,958
Right. Yes, Ma'am!

475
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,791
[CHIHO screams]

476
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,583
[door alarm]

477
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,208
[MALE CLERK]
Good evening sir, welcome.

478
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,416
[EMI] Great.

479
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,041
Yet another uneventful
day stalking demons.

480
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,708
I swear, I buy
the same meal every night.

481
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,750
[MALE CLERK]
Thank you very much.

482
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,791
I'm sure we'll see
you again tomorrow.

483
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,125
[MALE CLERK] Hey.
What just happened?

484
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,500
[MALE CLERK] Ah, jeez.
Sir! Are you okay?

485
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,791
[EMI] Stay back!

486
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,458
[EMI] Don't leave this store!
And call the police immediately!

487
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,083
I'm not scared of you.

488
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,750
And whether you're
a demon or a human being,

489
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,833
you should be ashamed for
attacking me out in the open

490
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,458
when other people are around.

491
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,333
It's one thing
coming after me,

492
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,958
but if you so much
as think of hurting anyone

493
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,333
in this world,
I will show you no mercy!

494
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,958
What did you do?

495
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,208
Heh.

496
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,166
[MALE CLERK] Hey!

497
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:24,791
[ATTACKER running away]

498
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,000
Take this!

499
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,583
Miss! Please tell
me you're okay!

500
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,250
[EMI] Are you all right?

501
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,208
I'm sorry for
pushing you, by the way.

502
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,791
[MALE CLERK] Oh, I'm fine.

503
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,875
I just hit my
forehead, s'no biggie.

504
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,833
Did you call
the police like I asked?

505
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,208
I'm pretty
sure tripping the alarm

506
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,500
called the security company,

507
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,166
so they should have
contacted the cops for me.

508
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,666
By the way, I have to tell you.

509
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,083
Yeah, what?

510
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,666
[MALE CLERK] I know this
sucks, but the emergency manual

511
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,583
states that we're to have
the customers remain

512
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,708
in the store until
the police arrive.

513
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,833
So uh, would you mind
waiting until they show up?

514
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,875
I'm sorry. I hate to even ask.

515
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,666
Fine.

516
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,625
[EMI] It is working.

517
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,458
The Better Half that
I activated this time,

518
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,041
it contained a heck
of a lot more power

519
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,750
than back when I fought
Lucifer two months ago.

520
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,875
With this power,
I might even be able

521
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,458
to use the Evil-Crushing Robe.

522
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,875
But, that just makes it
harder to figure out

523
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,041
what that purple
light might have been.

524
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,458
I've never
encountered an enemy

525
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:31,916
who nullified a sacred sword
and celestial force.

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,333
[MALE CLERK]
'Scuse me, Miss!

527
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,000
I picked these up;
they're yours, right?

528
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,375
Oh, yeah. Thank you
for grabbing them.

529
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,500
[phone rings loudly]

530
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,333
Crap, I have that
turned up loud!

531
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,916
Wow, that scared me; I seem to
still be a little jumpy, huh?

532
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,166
[MALE CLERK] Me too.

533
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,125
[CHIHO] Miss Yusa?

534
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,916
Yeah? Chiho?

535
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,875
[CHIHO] Yes, it's me.
And there's trouble!

536
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,875
[EMI] Chiho, what is it?
What happened?

537
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,708
[CHIHO] It's Mister Maou.
Mister Maou.

538
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,125
What about Maou?
What did he do?

539
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:01,625
[CHIHO] Maou um--Today
he brought-- he brought.

540
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,458
He brought what?

541
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,791
[CHIHO] He-- He brought
the heart with the bento

542
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,625
in the rice!

543
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,666
And the homemade New Year's,

544
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,541
and the two layers and the she!

545
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,083
What?
