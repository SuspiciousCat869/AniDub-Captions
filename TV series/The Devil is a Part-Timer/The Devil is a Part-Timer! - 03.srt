1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:09,416
[MAOU] What's this?

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,125
Vegetables, Sire.

3
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:14,166
I suppose this is her
way of saying thank you.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,708
Allow me to ascertain
their safety for you.

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,083
Is it good?

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,875
Yes, Sire.
It's quite good.

7
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,375
[ASHIYA] That's unusual, why
is there a key on the floor?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,250
[MAOU] I'm guessing she opened
the window on her way out,

9
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,083
and locked the door
from the outside,

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,125
then tossed the key back in.

11
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,916
Typical hero.
All exemplary in her conduct.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,833
What would you have
done if you were her?

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,291
[ASHIYA] Isn't it obvious?

14
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,416
First, I would've
locked the door,

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,625
and then I would've
taken the key with me.

16
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,000
[MAOU] Typical Demon.

17
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,041
[ASHIYA] Would you have
me any other way, Sire?

18
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,083
[EMI] I feel so violated.

19
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,166
[MALE NEWSCASTER 3A] In other
news, multiple shots were fired

20
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,083
in the Shibuya area
before dawn this morning.

21
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,916
The area was littered
with numerous bullet holes.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,416
An abandoned bicycle,

23
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,833
hit multiple times, was found
at the scene of the crime.

24
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,750
[EMI] Oh, unbelievable!

25
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,250
Those jerk wads.

26
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,541
Well, guess it's not my problem.

27
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,708
[MALE NEWSCASTER 3A]
Police are also investigating

28
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,250
possible links between this
incident and a recent string

29
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,708
of late-night muggings
and storefront robberies.

30
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,333
Although the exact nature of
the connection remains unclear.

31
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,625
[CHIHO'S MOTHER] That's a hop,
skip, and a jump from here.

32
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,375
Darling, isn't that really
close to where you work?

33
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,833
[CHIHO] I'm not joking
or imagining things!

34
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,125
I really think an
earthquake is coming!

35
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,541
So, if you don't mind,

36
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,375
could I ask your advice
about this in person?

37
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,750
[CHIHO] And "Send!"

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,958
[MAOU] Okay. Does
tomorrow evening work?

39
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,666
I've got the day off.

40
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,041
And you're not on
shift either, are you?

41
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,375
[CHIHO'S MOTHER] Chiho,
are you working today?

42
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,875
Uh. No. I'm not.

43
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:51,166
But I am real busy today--you
know, with lots of other stuff.

44
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,958
[CHIHO'S MOTHER]
You just be safe out there.

45
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,083
Why wouldn't
I be? Safe, heh.

46
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,333
That's my middle name!

47
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:56,958
[CHIHO'S MOTHER]
This neighborhood's not like

48
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,333
it used to be.

49
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,833
Yeah. I know, Mom.

50
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,583
[CHIHO'S MOTHER]
What is the matter with you?

51
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,000
Um. Nothing, I'm fine.

52
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,333
[CHIHO'S MOTHER] Chiho!

53
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,458
[RIKA] Emi. You heard
about the shooting, yeah?

54
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,458
Wasn't that pretty close
to where you live?

55
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,166
No, I'm like three
stops from there.

56
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,416
[RIKA] That's crazy.

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,041
Anyway, whatcha doin' for lunch?

58
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,208
Wanna hit that curry place
I told you about?

59
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,583
Yes, there'll be a line but
it is totes worth the wait.

60
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,791
Uhh.. Thanks, but I'm way too
busy to stand in line today.

61
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,125
Plus, I lost my wallet.

62
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,833
What? That sucks!

63
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,875
[EMI] Yeah, and
now I have to fill out

64
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,208
a bunch of forms on my break.

65
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,916
Thank you
for your call today.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,250
I'm Emi Yusa,
how can I help you?

67
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,416
[MALE YOUTH] "Yusa"?

68
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,875
Sounds to me like you're fitting

69
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,000
in quite nicely,
Emilia the Hero.

70
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,166
[EMI] May I ask who is calling?

71
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,375
[MALE YOUTH] Someone who knows
'bout "the Hero and the Devil."

72
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,875
And that's not all.

73
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,916
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to destroy you both.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,375
[EMI] Understood, sir.

75
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,250
I'll do whatever it takes to
keep that from happening.

76
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,416
[MALE YOUTH] I gotta admit,

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,791
I didn't expect you
two to join forces.

78
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,000
[EMI] That was not our
company's desired result either.

79
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,958
[MALE YOUTH] I guess not.

80
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,666
Either way, King Satan
will be taken out.

81
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,875
As will Emilia the Hero.

82
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,708
It's Ente Isla's will.

83
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,875
[EMI] Is that right?

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm afraid we won't
have any specifics

85
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,791
'til we've had a chance to
investigate the situation.

86
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,541
[MALE YOUTH] The Devil
and the Hero running away

87
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,875
from a little gunfire?
That "situation"?

88
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,666
And how're you
gonna investigate?

89
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,166
[EMI thinking] A vile tone
that seems to echo

90
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,583
from the pits of darkness.

91
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,333
He's a Demon.

92
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,041
[EMI] Alciel is the
only reputable general

93
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,875
still walking among us.

94
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,333
So that would make you nothing.

95
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,708
If you think
you can scare me

96
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,750
with words like "Ente Isla's
will" you're dead wrong.

97
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,291
I don't listen to idle threats
from nobodies like you.

98
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,333
[MALE YOUTH] When this
is all said and done...

99
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,791
I guarantee you'll be
singing a different tune.

100
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,958
[EMI] Takes all kinds, huh?

101
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,958
[EMI] Hey, so how
'bout that curry place.

102
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,208
I remembered how busy
the bank is during lunch.

103
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,875
Yeah, hello?

104
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,208
[MALE COP 3A] Hello there.

105
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,875
I'm trying to get in touch
with a Miss Emi Yusa?

106
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,250
[EMI] Yes. That's me.

107
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,208
[MALE COP 3A] I'm calling
from the Yoyogi Police Station.

108
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,916
[EMI] Huh? The police?

109
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,833
[MAOU] Didn't think there
was a snowball's chance

110
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,833
at home they'd ID
us from that bike.

111
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,208
These cops are good.

112
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,583
Well, we were
definitely right

113
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,916
about one thing.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,291
Regarding her age,
the Hero "fudged the truth."

115
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,791
If I remember correctly,

116
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,708
she's only about
seventeen or eighteen.

117
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,166
Yeah, I told you that.

118
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,625
But she must've registered
as being at least twenty;

119
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,166
no idea why though.

120
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,041
I thought women lied about
their age to appear younger.

121
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,833
I don't understand
why "fudge" means "lie."

122
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,958
[EMI] Who the
crap cares about that?

123
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,250
Why me?

124
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,375
I wanna know, 'cause
I'm a little confused.

125
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,708
I'm a Hero!

126
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,625
So please tell me why
I just had to post bail

127
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,708
for a couple asinine
good for nothing demons?

128
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,583
Dude. Wouldja
please calm down?

129
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,125
I'm sorry but we couldn't
think of anybody else.

130
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,583
We weren't
positively overjoyed

131
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,166
about asking for
your help either,

132
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,208
but we had no choice.

133
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,000
Well I for one never
thought I'd have

134
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,541
to use my seal and ID card

135
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,375
for something
that's just so dumb!

136
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,541
I suppose I could've asked

137
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,708
my manager at work
to help us out first.

138
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,875
We can't annoy your
boss with such trifles.

139
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,541
[EMI] So you annoy me, instead?

140
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,833
Well, duh, causing trouble

141
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,375
for heroes is the whole
point of being a devil.

142
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,583
You win. Can't argue
with that logic.

143
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,083
Don't be mad; we let
you stay at our place.

144
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,000
Emi, relax, heroes
aren't supposed

145
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,500
to have nervous breakdowns.

146
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,666
Yeah?

147
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,833
That's 'cause they
never met you! Jerks!

148
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,458
Your fridge was
completely empty.

149
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,250
Put a little more thought into
your grocery list next time!

150
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,250
You're a Demon General and you
don't even know how to shop!

151
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,583
[ASHIYA] I'm on a diet.

152
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,291
I'm watching my calories.

153
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,500
[EMI] Just so you know,

154
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,958
I got a threatening
phone call at work today

155
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,708
and it wasn't very pleasant.

156
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,333
They're after you, too, Maou.
Mister King Satan himself.

157
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,625
Thanks for the heads-up.

158
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,083
It was just a heads-up.

159
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,666
So don't get the wrong idea,

160
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,708
I'm still going to be
the one to take you down.

161
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,583
And don't you forget it!

162
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,833
Just a reminder:

163
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,541
we're in public so stop
acting like a psycho.

164
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,625
You suck.

165
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,333
Just make sure you don't get
murdered by some loser nobody

166
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,916
before I get the
chance to kill you first!

167
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,750
[MAOU] They're after
both of us, huh?

168
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,791
And they called her
at work of all things.

169
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,125
[ASHIYA] It's a diet
and workout plan...

170
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,458
Oh, get a grip! Really!

171
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,500
Nobody cares about your
stupid exercise routine!

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,791
[CHIHO] I'm home!

173
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,416
[ASHIYA] To clarify: What time
are you meeting Miss Sasaki,

174
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,041
where are you meeting her,
and when can I expect you back?

175
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,583
[MAOU] What are you, my mom now?

176
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,041
Five o'clock, Shinjuku station.

177
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,375
We do have a bit of
time to spare then.

178
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,375
In that case,
Sire, you and I must go.

179
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,125
Wait. Go where?

180
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,375
[ASHIYA] Oh yes. Quite fabulous.

181
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,583
Whatever, where
did you get the money

182
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,791
to pay for this stuff anyway?

183
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,791
Naturally I've set aside
a secret stash of savings

184
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,833
for just this sort of emergency.

185
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,333
[MAOU] "Emergency"?

186
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm just gonna sit
there, hear her out,

187
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,875
and come home; I don't
think this is necessary.

188
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,375
Au contraire, Sire!
Do you not see?

189
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,875
A fragile teenage girl never
divulges her deepest fears

190
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,125
to anyone but her
closest confidants!

191
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,416
And that's you!

192
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,583
Did she or did she
not reveal it to you?

193
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,541
Surely you cannot be blind to
what such a disclosure means?

194
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,791
Yeah. Okay,
will ya just chill out?

195
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,958
N'besides.

196
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,750
There is no way I'll
allow you to go on a date

197
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,041
dressed like some
dowdy transient bum.

198
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,166
Ouch. Why so harsh?

199
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,250
I do not dress like
a "transient bum"

200
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,375
and you will take that back!

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,166
Got this!

202
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,750
[CHIHO] There you are!

203
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,625
Hey Chi.

204
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,125
Oh wow, is that a new haircut?

205
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,250
[CHIHO] Glad you noticed!

206
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,125
Yeah. It's short.

207
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,416
So what do you think?

208
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,041
[MAOU] Uh. Looks good.

209
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,333
[CHIHO thinking] Score!

210
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,875
[CHIHO] I like your outfit.

211
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,125
I don't think I've ever seen
you all cleaned up like this.

212
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,375
Huh?

213
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,458
[CHIHO] Uh, not to say
you looked bad before;

214
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,791
you always look good.

215
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,583
It's just now you
look better is all.

216
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,625
Um, I didn't mean better.

217
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,500
What I mean is--
You look so cool.

218
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,708
Yeah, my roommate
told me I needed

219
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,583
to dress a little
nicer for our date.

220
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,500
Wow. So are you saying you
think of this as a date?

221
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,625
[MAOU] Uh. I guess so. Yeah.

222
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,666
[CHIHO thinking] Score!

223
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,083
[MAOU] So, what now?

224
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,250
[CHIHO] There's a great café
not too far from here.

225
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,708
It's cheap and
pretty laid back, too.

226
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,125
[CHIHO] You'll love it!

227
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,541
And since you're giving me
advice, it'll be my treat!

228
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,958
Does that sound
like a good plan?

229
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,541
I can't let you do that.

230
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,416
I mean, thank you.
But I can't accept.

231
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,583
This lunch is on me.

232
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,208
[CHIHO] Uh, Mister Maou!

233
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,416
Hm?

234
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,333
You see. The thing is--

235
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,041
What's up?
Are you all right?

236
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,083
Yeah. I just wanted
to hold your hand.

237
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,000
[MAOU] Oh that's all?
Yeah, no problem.

238
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,291
You okay?

239
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,166
Huh? Yeah, I'm great.

240
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,291
Never better actually!
Thank you for asking, though.

241
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,750
[MAOU] This way, making
our way through the crowd,

242
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,666
we won't get separated.

243
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,125
You're right, that's true.

244
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,458
Better safe than
sorry, I suppose.

245
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,875
What sort of
"no good" are you up to?

246
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,833
Ahh! Eh... Em... Em... Eh...
Emilia, 'tis you!

247
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,666
[EMI] Don't use my real name!

248
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,041
You realize how creepy

249
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,833
and suspicious you're
acting right now, don't you?

250
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,250
What are you doing,
tailing somebody?

251
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,208
No! I mean, it's none
of your business!

252
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,041
I'm a Hero; so
it is my business

253
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,083
when I see you behaving like
some creepster weirdo, isn't it?

254
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,416
Yeah, I guess so.

255
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,125
Drop it, just this once, for me?

256
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,583
[EMI] You've gotta
be kidding me.

257
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,083
I knew you when
you were a demon,

258
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,500
or have you forgotten?

259
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,875
Curses.

260
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,750
I've really done it this
time, haven't I, Sire?

261
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,083
You scum bag! Ass face!

262
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,083
What are you planning to
do to that girl? Tell me!

263
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,333
You've got it wrong!

264
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,041
His Majesty's intentions
are nothing but pure,

265
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:37,916
I can assure you!

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,125
He's a Devil;

267
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,625
I seriously doubt he
knows what "pure" is!

268
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,541
I beg you!
Listen to what I have to say!

269
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,791
Well, that's unexpected.

270
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,375
[ASHIYA] So you
understand me now?

271
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,583
[EMI] If you mean,

272
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,041
do I understand that
"His Majesty's" as much

273
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,291
of a "you know what"
as ever, then yes.

274
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,041
But what I don't understand is
why they need to go on a date.

275
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,708
[ASHIYA] I wondered
the same thing initially.

276
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,208
But it's clear to me,
after observing her,

277
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,458
that this "Sasaki" girl is more

278
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,708
than just a little
fond of your old rival.

279
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,000
[EMI] It seems so.

280
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,666
Um. I'm sorry, that
doesn't bother you at all?

281
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,000
[EMI] You want it to?

282
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,000
Well-- No, I--I just
find it extremely unbearable

283
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,250
and highly insolent that
a mere human girl has

284
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,541
become so enamored of my King.

285
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,041
[EMI] Personally,
I'm surprised a girl

286
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,416
that cute would waste her time

287
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,958
with a no-good, very-bad
miscreant like "Your King."

288
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,625
You dare insult
His Majesty so?

289
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,500
[EMI] Of course I do. Anyway.

290
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,791
From a girl's point
of view at least,

291
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,166
it's pretty obvious
she's into him.

292
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,625
The trendy little
dress she just bought.

293
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,291
Brand new hairdo,
fresh from the salon.

294
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,541
[EMI] And those
boots are new, too.

295
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,250
[ASHIYA] Oh? How can you tell?

296
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,000
[EMI] Well, it's not so
apparent to a man, I guess.

297
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,791
Her dress is screaming,
"I'm young and available."

298
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,041
And the form-fitting
cut is there

299
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,500
to emphasize her--damn
those are huge.

300
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,500
[ASHIYA] What're huge?

301
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,041
Nothing, pervert!
I said nothing!

302
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,583
Besides, big ones
just get in your way

303
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,875
when you're
fighting in a battle.

304
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,125
Small ones mean small armor,

305
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,541
which saves money

306
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,250
and means you're less
constricted in your movements!

307
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,500
I think you've lost me.

308
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,833
[EMI] Just forget it!

309
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,125
Back to the matter at hand.

310
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,416
Do you think he can get
anything useful out of her?

311
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
[ASHIYA] Don't ask me.

312
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,791
I'm only trailing in the event

313
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,916
that any undesirables
decide to show up.

314
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,208
[EMI] You're here,
so you fail by default.

315
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,916
[EMI] Still, this whole
earthquake thing

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,791
is definitely a
cause for concern.

317
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,250
One thing I know for sure;

318
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,291
I'm not going to sit here
and find out the hard way.

319
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,666
Not really any point in
spying on 'em from out here.

320
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,000
Follow me in.

321
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,333
[ASHIYA] Follow you in where?

322
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,458
To get a table.
Now are you comin' or not?

323
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,041
Wait a second!

324
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,000
How could I expect His Majesty
to excuse such extreme audacity?

325
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,416
No! Stop right there!

326
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,500
[MAOU] Maybe you
could just go over

327
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,416
the details one
more time, please.

328
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,250
Yeah. Sure.

329
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,583
I told you how my tinnitus
got really bad, didn't I?

330
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,750
It happened right
around the time

331
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,083
I started working at MgRonalds.

332
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,541
At first, I thought
I was just tired

333
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,000
from doing a bunch of
work I wasn't used to.

334
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,625
But then, last night--

335
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,625
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

336
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,291
Hmm...?
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

337
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,291
Someone there?
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

338
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:17,041
Hello? Hm?
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

339
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,708
Hey. I can hear you.
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

340
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,250
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

341
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,208
What the heck?
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

342
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:28,041
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

343
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,166
Wait, a "big one"?
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

344
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,750
Uhhh...
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

345
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,250
[MALE VOICE in Ente Islan]

346
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,750
Not only could I
hear what he said,

347
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,458
but I understood him.

348
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,541
So you can see why I'm confused.

349
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,708
[MAOU] Yeah.

350
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,833
And because of the
quakes we've had lately,

351
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,250
you assume they're
the disturbances

352
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,666
he was referring to?

353
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,791
Yeah.

354
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,166
[MAOU] The Idea Link.

355
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,375
A method of communication
where beings

356
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,333
in different worlds tune
their minds to each other

357
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,125
and share impressions
and concepts.

358
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,083
They're able to transfer
these ideas across time

359
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,500
and space by utilizing
sonar probe technology.

360
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,458
When the signal reaches
the desired target,

361
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,041
it causes a magical explosion

362
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,666
that creates various phenomena.

363
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,416
In this case, these
pulses could've easily

364
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,083
caused all the
recent earthquakes.

365
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,416
And if that's true,

366
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,250
given the number
of quakes we've had,

367
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,250
the only possible
explanation is that somebody

368
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,458
is dead set on tracking
down me and Emilia.

369
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,291
A big one
is coming soon indeed.

370
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,166
Things are happening
faster than I expecte--

371
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,875
[splutters]

372
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,375
[CHIHO] What's the
matter, Mister Maou?

373
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,541
Are you all right?

374
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,833
[MAOU thinking] Oh, come on!

375
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,458
What is Emi doing walking
in here with Ashiya?

376
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,500
What's wrong?

377
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,500
[MAOU] Nothing.

378
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,416
I haven't done anything wrong.

379
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Huh?

380
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,791
So anyway. To wrap this up.

381
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,041
The tinnitus and weird voices
you've been hearing aren't

382
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,125
really a cause for concern,
so don't worry about that.

383
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:55,125
The real issue is whether or not
a big one is actually coming.

384
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,583
And assuming that it is,

385
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,750
I think simply being able to
warn the people around you

386
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,791
will make a big
difference, don't you?

387
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,833
I'm glad I built up the nerve

388
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,833
to actually ask you about this.

389
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,583
I feel a million
times better already.

390
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,916
[MAOU thinking] Hear that, Emi?

391
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,166
I'm doing a good thing here!

392
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,750
Anyone can see I'm just
trying to help this girl out!

393
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,791
Can't tell my parents about it.

394
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,583
Or school friends, either.

395
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,875
That's why-- Well,
I guess I knew you'd

396
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,791
be the only one
who'd believe me.

397
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,416
You're kind, and so gentle.

398
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,458
I love talking to you.

399
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,541
See. Thing is.

400
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,708
You're real nice and--uh.

401
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,500
I uhh--Well,
Mister Maou, I like-

402
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,166
That's enough!

403
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,000
I hope you know
you're conversing

404
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,541
with the worst
being in the world.

405
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,958
Please. Not now.

406
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,583
Trust me, little girl,
this one is not what he seems.

407
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,958
He's cruel, cunning, and stupid.

408
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,833
Hey now.
Don't pop up out of nowhere

409
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,666
and start saying
hateful things like that!

410
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,750
That's about as rude
as a person can be!

411
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,416
Who are you to him anyway?

412
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,291
I'm his archenemy. Look.

413
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,541
Take it from someone
who knows. He sucks.

414
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,083
Nothing good will
come from knowing him.

415
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,708
[MAOU] Emi, cut it out.

416
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,958
Never tell me what to do!

417
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,166
You need to calm down too, Chi!

418
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,166
No, Mister Maou,
I won't calm down!

419
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,625
I remember you.

420
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,166
You came into our restaurant
a couple days ago, right?

421
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,375
Yeah, so what?

422
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,458
[CHIHO] What's the deal?

423
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,208
Are you his ex or something?

424
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,250
[EMI] Where'd you get that idea?

425
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,000
I was dead on,
you totally are!

426
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,208
In that case, what I do

427
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,625
with him is none of
your business, got it?

428
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,791
And if you know
what's good for you,

429
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,333
you'll stay out of my way!

430
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,291
You don't even know what
you're saying right now!

431
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,958
It's not like that with us,
so why don't you just relax?

432
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,166
Oh yeah?

433
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,083
If that's true, tell me
why you're always

434
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,791
around him like a stalker!

435
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,958
[EMI] You need to stop yakking,
little girl, and listen:

436
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,708
There is nothing between us!

437
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,958
If anybody here needs

438
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,166
to stop "yakking"
it's you, sister!

439
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,958
You better take that back! Now!

440
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,916
You think I'm afraid
of you? Please!

441
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,416
[MAOU] Can we please take
it down a notch or three?

442
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,291
[rumbling]

443
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,333
[loud crashing]

444
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,208
[MALE CUSTOMER 3A] Earthquake!

445
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,416
[MALE CUSTOMER 3B] A big one!

446
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,916
Mister Maou!

447
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,583
[CHIHO] Wha-- What happened?

448
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,291
[EMI] Oh, good.
I'm glad you woke up.

449
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,083
[CHIHO] Where are we?

450
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,500
[EMI] Well, we're trapped.
This used to be the café.

451
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,333
[CHIHO] Where's Mister Maou?

452
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,291
[EMI] Not with us, I can
tell you that much for sure.

453
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,791
[CHIHO] Yeah, but do
you think he's okay?

454
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,750
[EMI] Oh. You're worried
he got crushed

455
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,625
by the rubble, are you?

456
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,875
Well, it's true he'd
make a lot of people happy

457
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,791
if he kicked off, me included.

458
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,416
But I guarantee he's alive.

459
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,458
[EMI thinking] I'll be
the one to defeat him.

460
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:42,833
He's not allowed to
die here. No way, no how.

461
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
[CHIHO] Yeah, right.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

462
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,791
[EMI] Oh, he will.

463
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,500
Trust me on that.
Emi Yusa, by the way.

464
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,000
In case you're still wondering,

465
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,375
there really is nothing
between Maou and me, I swear.

466
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,833
[CHIHO] Chiho Sasaki.

467
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,375
And I guess I'll pretend
to believe you for now.

468
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,625
[EMI] So, what made
you fall for him anyway?

469
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,875
[CHIHO] What are
you talking about?

470
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,375
I haven't fallen for him!

471
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,166
[EMI] Then you picked a fight

472
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,916
with me in a public restaurant
because you <i>don't</i> like him?

473
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,750
[CHIHO] No, I do! I mean, I--!

474
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,125
Not like... Nnnnn...

475
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,625
I guess I really
am super obvious.

476
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,416
[EMI] Don't worry,
your secret is safe with me.

477
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,750
[CHIHO] That might
be more comforting

478
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,583
if you told me how you really
feel about Mister Maou.

479
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,333
[EMI] How I feel?

480
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,250
[CHIHO] For someone
who claims to be his enemy,

481
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,250
you sure do seem chummy

482
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,625
with him whenever
you're together.

483
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,916
[EMI] Like the Godfather says,

484
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,958
friends close and
enemies closer.

485
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,166
[CHIHO] Huh?

486
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,666
[EMI] I've known
him for a long time,

487
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,250
Chiho, almost my entire life.

488
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,750
[EMI] Just 'cause I'm friendly

489
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,625
with him doesn't mean what
I said to you is any less true.

490
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,625
Loving Maou <i>will</i> get you hurt.

491
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,291
[CHIHO] I guess I don't quite
understand what you mean.

492
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,833
[EMI] You'll get it.

493
00:20:55,916 --> 00:21:00,208
But, in reality, maybe
it's better if you don't.

494
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:04,500
For now. Rest up.
You could use a little sleep.

495
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,041
[EMI] I hear you breathing.

496
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,083
She's asleep; you can come out!

497
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,083
[rocks tumbling]

498
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,750
[DEEP VOICE]
Stay outta my business!

499
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,125
[EMI] Maou? What
happened to your body?

500
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,166
[MAOU] Don't know.
It just changed on me.

501
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,666
[EMI thinking]
His magic. It's back.

502
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,541
[MAOU] Man. This is the worst.

503
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,625
How'm I supposed
to explain this?

504
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,625
[EMI thinking] This is it.

505
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,250
Now's my chance.

506
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,250
If I focus all of the
celestial force I have left.

507
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,208
I can still make a
Sacred Sword strong enough

508
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,916
to defeat him!

509
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,125
[MAOU] Take care of Chi.

510
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,958
These people need me.

511
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,041
Hopefully there
aren't many casualties.

512
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,000
But we don't have time to
wait for the rescue squad.

513
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,416
I'll figure something out.

514
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,458
[EMI thinking] Is he serious?

515
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,583
[MAOU] Alright. It's time to go.

516
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,791
[EMI thinking] What? Why?

517
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,333
Why would the
Devil rescue humans?
