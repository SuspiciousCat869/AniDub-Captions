1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,791
Oh, for shame; I am a
complete and utter failure.

2
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,583
I dare not even
think about how much

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,708
just this single IV will cost.

4
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,500
Even if I do
manage to get better,

5
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,458
I can never again look
His Majesty in the eye.

6
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,833
Ah!

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:29,833
Well, well.

8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,708
Look who's back
among the living.

9
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,125
Yes--well.

10
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,375
Kind Miss.

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,250
I just want to be clear
about one minor detail.

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,416
I'm correct in assuming you take
public health insurance, yes?

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,125
Oh, don't worry
about that.

14
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,291
For now.

15
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,541
We need to give you
a little more medicine.

16
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,916
No, thank you!

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,541
[ASHIYA] What's this?

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,250
Excuse me.

19
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,833
Are you all right, sir?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,708
A policeman?

21
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,541
What is going on here?

22
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,708
[ASHIYA groans]

23
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,208
[ASHIYA] Olba!

24
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,791
Mister Ashiya!

25
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:21,958
[NURSE A]
Didn't I say you weren't ready

26
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,083
to get out of bed yet?

27
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,166
That's it,
I'm adding another bag.

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,375
You're getting two now!

29
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,833
[ASHIYA] I can't believe it!

30
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,666
[NURSE A]
And I can't believe you!

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,916
How do you feel?

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,208
[OLBA]
"Villa Rosa Sasazuka."

33
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,750
[NURSE A]
...You most certainly are not!

34
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,375
Hold on, Chi.

35
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,583
I'm coming!

36
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,708
[EMI screams]

37
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,291
[EMI screams]

38
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,333
If you want the pain
to end, all you have to do

39
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,416
is stop resisting and
hand over Better Half.

40
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,458
[EMI] It's not materializing, so
what do you expect me to do?

41
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,416
If you wanna know what
I think, I'd say the sword

42
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,833
is rejecting you.

43
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,708
[SARUE] By all rights, the
Sacred Sword shouldn't be

44
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,833
in the hands of
a mere human being.

45
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,583
Therefore, we must take it
back once and for all;

46
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,875
this is Heaven's
collective will.

47
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,708
[EMI] Either way, Chiho's got
nothing to do with this.

48
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,291
Please, let her go.

49
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,916
Sorry, but I'm afraid
I can't do that.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,916
She's a precious
specimen, this one.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,125
A human who loves the
Devil--even after learning

52
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,416
the truth of who he really is.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,083
She'll serve
as our lab rat,

54
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,750
and through her we will discover
what impact the Devil's power

55
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,500
has on the human ecosystem.

56
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,375
You're sick;
you know that?

57
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,041
You watch your
tongue, human.

58
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:12,291
None may speak in such a manner
to the Great Archangel Sariel!

59
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,333
[EMI screams]

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,125
[MAOU] Ah, son of a--!

61
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,041
Damn.

62
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,291
It's a barrier field!

63
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,750
You're very durable.

64
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,166
But you and I both know
your body can't withstand this

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,375
much longer, plus I hate
to cause a lady pain.

66
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,375
[EMI screams]

67
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,750
Although,
on second thought,

68
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,666
that horrific howl
isn't exactly ladylike.

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,250
You're far more attractive when
you aren't screaming, darling--

70
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,750
Ah.

71
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,333
Everyone, it seems we have
an uninvited guest tonight.

72
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,500
Maou... help.

73
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's give our very
special friend

74
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,625
a very special welcome.

75
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,333
Say hello.

76
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,541
Satan's current power
level makes you quite able

77
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,291
to defeat him, Bel.

78
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,625
[EMI] So that's it then?

79
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,541
The Devil and I both
perish in another world.

80
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,666
And back in Ente Isla,
things continue on the same

81
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,458
as they did before
you came here.

82
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,750
That's it?

83
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,125
That's what you want?

84
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,666
[SARUE] Enough chit-chat.

85
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,583
As patron angel of the
Doctrinal Correction Council,

86
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:26,000
I hereby grant Crestia Bel
moral authority to end this.

87
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,583
Do your worst.

88
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,708
[CHIHO] Miss Suzuno.

89
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,750
Why?

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,708
Tell me why!

91
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,500
[SUZUNO] No.

92
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,791
I can't!

93
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,583
I don't want to
sacrifice anyone else!

94
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,125
Aw man, what a pain
in the butt.

95
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,875
[MAOU] Suck on this!

96
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,208
Woozy.

97
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,250
[MAOU yells]

98
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,041
What was that?!

99
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,666
[MAOU] Suzuno?

100
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,458
[MAOU] Suzuno!

101
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,041
You totally smashed my bike!

102
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,750
How could you do
something like that?

103
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,583
What the heck did Dullahan
ever do to you, huh?

104
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,375
Now you're gonna
owe me for the new bike,

105
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,166
the bike registration fee
and the over-sized

106
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,291
garbage disposal fee!

107
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,333
No, I am not even kidding!

108
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,000
[MAOU] Wait! Hey!

109
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,333
[SUZUNO] Shut up!

110
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,291
I don't want to hear
any more nonsense from you!

111
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,958
[MAOU] Stop!

112
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,875
Please, just gimme
a minute here, will ya?

113
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,916
[pants being unzipped]

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,833
You're embarrassing me.

115
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,333
Put your clothes
back on, please.

116
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,583
[MAOU] Right.

117
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,250
Now I'm ready!

118
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,791
[SUZUNO] What
is wrong with you?

119
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,208
[MAOU] Ha! You probably
won't understand,

120
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,708
since you've never had a job.

121
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,083
But try anyway.

122
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,375
MgRonald's uniforms are
given to employees on loan.

123
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,083
If I damage one in
a non-work situation,

124
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,291
then it'll come out
of my paycheck.

125
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,166
And the Devil's Castle is
running pretty low on treasure!

126
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,541
[SUZUNO] Give me a break!

127
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,791
[MAOU] Hey!

128
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,500
Stop taking your
clothes off in public,

129
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,625
you pervert!

130
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,125
[MAOU] That was your fault!

131
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,541
You got guts comin' here
alone and movin' in next door.

132
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,041
Plus you're a decent cook,
so I let some things slide!

133
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,375
But now you're in my way,
trying to hurt my crew?

134
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,000
Sorry, but as a Substitute
Manager, you shall not pass!

135
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,208
[SUZUNO] You knew
who I really was?

136
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,166
The whole time?

137
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,750
[MAOU] How could I not?

138
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,208
A sweet young girl moves next
door to an all-male household,

139
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,875
inveigles her way in, and starts
cooking and doting on them?

140
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,500
It just doesn't happen.

141
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,583
[URUSHIHARA] We still have
leftovers from Suzuno.

142
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,333
Seems a little
celestial force-y, but hey.

143
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,875
YOLO.

144
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,125
[MAOU] You sure did a number
on Ashiya though, didn't you?

145
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,750
It really is too bad.

146
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,583
I thought you showed
a lot of promise.

147
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,333
I mean, you even
got along with Emi.

148
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,833
But in the end, you're
no better than Olba.

149
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,375
You pretend to be good.

150
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,833
But you don't care what you
have to sacrifice to get power,

151
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,333
isn't that right?

152
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:01,958
Quiet!

153
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,291
If your M.O.

154
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,500
is doing whatever it takes
to get what you want,

155
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,958
how are you any different
from the demons you hunt?

156
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,208
[SUZUNO] Shut up!

157
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,416
You buddied up to Emi
and Chi and helped them

158
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,875
with the bazaar.

159
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,000
They were your friends and
you dragged them right down

160
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,125
into your mess.

161
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,291
You should be ashamed.

162
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,625
[SUZUNO] Just shut up!

163
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,666
[SUZUNO] You're insane.

164
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,708
Oww...

165
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,291
[SUZUNO]
Why didn't you...?

166
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,541
Didn't have a choice.

167
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,416
I used up my magic
destroying the barrier.

168
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
What's wrong?

169
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,083
You not gonna fight me?

170
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,500
Well, in that case,
I'm just gonna go.

171
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,416
Chi's waiting for me.

172
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,958
It's no use.

173
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,375
You can't defeat him.

174
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,083
Not the way you are right now.

175
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,500
[MAOU] Great, so you are working
with someone; who is it?

176
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,541
The archangel Sariel.

177
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,500
Lovely.

178
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,541
But thanks.

179
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,458
Emi couldn't take
him down either.

180
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,166
Ow.

181
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,458
The moon is his source.

182
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,208
The closer he gets to it,
the more powerful he is.

183
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,208
With no magic, you
don't have a chance.

184
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,166
It would be pointless
to even try.

185
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,375
[MAOU] So what,
you gonna run?

186
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,958
[SUZUNO] I don't
get why you won't.

187
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,541
'Cause it's my job.

188
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,041
Chi works under me; I've gotta
make sure she's looked after.

189
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,041
Plus, I don't abandon
my people and run;

190
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,416
I do have some dignity left.

191
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,583
And let's be real, you're
counting on me, too, right?

192
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,958
To do what?

193
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,458
To put the screws
to your pal Sariel.

194
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,000
That's why you didn't
stop Chi from calling me,

195
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:26,958
isn't it?

196
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,375
So that I'd
take him out?

197
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,458
No.

198
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,333
I mean, I only meant to--

199
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,958
Well, it's all
the same to me!

200
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,375
[SUZUNO] Why?

201
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,333
Why would a Demon
like him act this way?

202
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,708
He's supposed to
be the bad guy.

203
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,375
If caring for his
friends makes him evil--

204
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,250
Then so am I.

205
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,333
From now on I'm fighting
for my dignity, too.

206
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,333
[URUSHIHARA] What is Maou doing?

207
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,000
I bet he's gotten
himself mixed up

208
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,125
in some kind of trouble again.

209
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,583
So yeah, what else is new?

210
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,250
[doorbell]

211
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,750
'Zat Maou?

212
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,625
He didn't bail on Emilia
and leave her to deal?

213
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,500
[URUSHIHARA] Coming.

214
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,416
Was there a problem down at--?

215
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,250
Olba?

216
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,833
Good to see you, Lucifer.

217
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,333
How've you been?

218
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,083
You got out, huh?

219
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,958
You look like
you're doing well.

220
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,666
[OLBA] As do you.

221
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,125
Not a bad set-up you
have here, my friend.

222
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,583
[URUSHIHARA] I like it okay.

223
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,958
Tell me: how would you
like to go back to Heaven?

224
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,041
[OLBA] I know you
want to, Lucifer.

225
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,250
And I can make
that wish come true.

226
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,583
[SARUE] If the Sacred Sword
won't reveal itself after

227
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,083
you've endured
this much torture.

228
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,291
I suppose I have no
choice but to remove it

229
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,916
from your body directly.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
What are you
talking about?

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,583
[EMI] Hey!

232
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,458
Wait!

233
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,041
What do you think you're doing?

234
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,375
[SARUE] Come now, you know
precisely what I'm doing.

235
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,916
I'm taking the heavenly
silver that forms Better Half

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,625
straight out of your flesh.

237
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,708
[CHIHO] You take your hands
off of her, you big pervert!

238
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,833
[SARUE] Well, look
who found her voice.

239
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,291
Trust me, little girl, I'm
not lusting over 'flat chest'

240
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,458
over here; she's
not my cup of tea.

241
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,666
Flat chest?

242
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,166
I'd take that
back if I were you!

243
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,541
[SARUE]...have more of the
attributes I'm interested in.

244
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,125
I'll have plenty of time
for a more thorough examination,

245
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,958
but my initial impression
is quite positive.

246
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,708
You're depraved beyond all
redemption, you bucket o' crap!

247
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,208
Perv!

248
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:32,875
Dirty old man!

249
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:33,666
Deviant freak!

250
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,625
Filthy peeping Tom!

251
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,708
Panty snatcher!

252
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,750
[SARUE] Now that
is just going too far!

253
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,125
I've had all the lip
I can take from you!

254
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,250
[EMI] You lay so much
as a finger on Chiho,

255
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,458
and you'll live just
long enough to regret it.

256
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,916
For someone
in your position,

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,458
you seem quite confident
in yourself, Hero!

258
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,916
You misunderstand.

259
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,375
It's not me; you hurt that
girl and you will literally

260
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,625
have the Devil to pay.

261
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,875
[SARUE] Is that a fact?

262
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,166
Does Emilia, the mighty Hero,
rely on the Devil

263
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,250
to save her skin?

264
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,916
[EMI] That's not
what I'm saying.

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,750
You ran a competing
restaurant across the street

266
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,250
from MgRonald's, and
you still don't get it?

267
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,875
What, that my place
was better?

268
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,250
[EMI] That girl is
a MgRonald's employee.

269
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,083
And the Devil is
her shift manager.

270
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,208
If one of their
people is in danger.

271
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,666
It is the duty and the
obligation of the manager

272
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,500
to protect her,
no matter what the cost.

273
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,375
Have you lost
your mind, Hero?

274
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,541
Are you honestly foolish enough
to believe that the Devil

275
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,541
is in any way bound by the
conventions of this world?

276
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,666
[MAOU, breathing heavily]
Damn it. This sucks.

277
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,166
Elevator out of order.

278
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,416
So tired.

279
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
[EMI] He's not bound
by them, you're right.

280
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,833
But he still chooses to follow
them of his own free will.

281
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,166
That's him.

282
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,166
The A-level staffer and
substitute manager of the

283
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,916
Hatagaya MgRonald's franchise:
the man called Sadao Maou.

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,250
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Oh, this is hilarious!

285
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,958
The Devil and his Hero,
like two peas in a pod!

286
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:51,875
[MAOU] Yo.

287
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,166
Mister Maou!

288
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,875
I'm sorry I kept
you waiting, Chi.

289
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,208
[CHIHO] You're naked!

290
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,416
[MAOU] Glad to see
you're safe, Emi.

291
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,958
Stay away, jerk!
And don't look!

292
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,125
[MAOU] Oh, come on!

293
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,750
I can't believe you'd
show your face here.

294
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,791
[MAOU] And I can't believe
the little perfumed dwarf of

295
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,291
a Manager from SFC is
Mister Gaze from the Fall.

296
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,041
I'm not above going
undercover to get what I want.

297
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,166
The divine silver that forms
Better Half is Heaven's

298
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,708
most prized possession;
I'm taking it back.

299
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,583
After all, we can't let
the Hero hang onto it, can we?

300
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,291
[MAOU] Frankly, I couldn't care
less about Heaven's problems.

301
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,416
Trouble is, you decided to
mess with my co-workers,

302
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,166
that we have an issue, "buddy."

303
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,875
How dare you make
Chi go through such

304
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,541
a frightening experience?

305
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,333
He really does care!

306
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,750
[MAOU] Chi is a valued
employee of MgRonald's.

307
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,416
As the Devil and
as Shift Manager,

308
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,208
I protect those
under my charge.

309
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,083
It is my job!

310
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,750
He doesn't care.

311
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,541
What can you do with
that frail little body of yours?

312
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,208
Mister Maou!

313
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,791
With the pittance
of magic you have left,

314
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,291
you're no match for me!

315
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,875
[CHIHO] You're
hurting him!

316
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,041
[EMI] Maou!

317
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,041
[MAOU] Don't worry, Chi.

318
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,291
I'm fine.

319
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,666

You're truly unbelievable.

00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,916
How far is that false
courage going take you?

322
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,125
[MAOU] Damn it.

323
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,125
With no magic, I can't
do any real damage.

324
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,916
C'mon Maou, think!

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,333
Unlike you Demon King,

326
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,958
I get stronger the closer
I get to the moon!

327
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,250
I'd say you're
in a bit of a pickle.

What will you do?

[OLBA in Ente Islan]

330
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,458
Destroying this place
would cause a panic.

[URUSHIHARA] That's
putting it mildly.

[SUZUNO] Lucifer?

333

a whole lot of magic from

the fear and anger, right?

335

Forget about it,
it won't do you any good.

336

Too late.

[SARUE] Can't you see
your resistance is futile?

With this much
power at hand,

Whoa, wait.

This was not part of the plan!

357

That's not Celestial Force,
it's magic.

Which means that--There must
be panic down in the streets.

up, douchebag.

You may be invincible against
anyone with celestial force.

But you decided
to dance with the Devil.

458
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,666
[EMI] I said, put me down.

459

before I was interrupted,

460
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,333
you decided to dance
with the Devil.

461
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,041
So now I'm gonna mop
the floor with ya!

462
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,250
If you want
a Sacred Sword,

00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,458
come and try to take mine.

464
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,458
Go on, you creepy
angel freak.

465
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,916
Beg for mercy and see
what good it does you!

466
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,416
Oh. Dear God.

467
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,541
Please forgive me for being
such a complete and total tool.

468
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,833
[MAOU] Yeesh.

469
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,916
That idiot sure did
a number on this place.

470
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,166
Man, I finally get my
magic back and now I have

471
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,166
to fix everything again!

472
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,500
Your fault for taking
so long to get here.

473
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,125
Uh.

474
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,833
When someone saves your butt,
most people just say thank you.

475
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,125
I don't recall asking
for your assistance.

476
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,166
[MAOU] Whatever, Tiny Tits!

477
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,916
Your tits are small!

00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,583
'More importantly?'
This is very important!

481
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,041
[CHIHO] Please everyone
just calm down!

482
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,125
Stop fighting!

483
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,625
I am here, Sire!

484
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,583
Sincerest apologies
for being late,

485
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,458
I had to stop at
home for my cape.

486
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,416
Your cape?

487
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,041
Dude! Why even come?

488
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,708
The battle's already over!

489
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,875
[EMI] Who cares?
Just put on some clothes!

490
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,291
[ASHIYA] Again I
have failed you!

491
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,375
[MAOU] Aw crap, I left
my uniform downstairs.

492
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,875
And I missed work!

493
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:01,125
My perfect attendance record!

494
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,166
[ASHIYA] I brought
your cape, too!

495
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,875
[URUSHIHARA] Wonder
if it's all over.

496
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,541
[stomach grumbles]

497
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,208
[URUSHIHARA] Man, that
was a lotta work for me.

498
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,083
I need some fried fish.
