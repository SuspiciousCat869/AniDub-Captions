00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:12,375
[ASHIYA moans]

2
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,791
[MAOU] You gonna be okay?

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,375
[ASHIYA] I apologize, Sire.

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:16,875
I've failed you.

5
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,458
I'm so debilitated, I can't
even manage to go shopping.

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,000
[MAOU] Yeah.

7
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,291
Just stay here.

8
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,916
I'll take care
of dinner tonight.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,416
Sire.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Yet again you shower me
with your kindness.

11
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,333
Such a hopeless servant
does not deserve you.

12
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,750
[MAOU] We've got
some rice left.

13
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,416
Maybe I can mix
that with an egg.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,375
[doorbell]

15
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,083
[MAOU] Great.

16
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,291
Emi again?

17
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,625
[DELIVERYMAN]
Special delivery!

18
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,041
Son of a bastard.

19
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,833
Did you go behind my back and
place more orders online?

20
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,333
No, I did not.

21
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,125
And if I did, I'da had 'em
delivered while you were gone.

22
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,583
[DELIVERYMAN]
Have a nice day!

23
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,250
[MAOU] "I've found lots of
wonderful things in Hawaii.

24
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,625
So would you sell them for me

25
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,333
at the Neighborhood
Association's Summer Bazaar?"

26
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,625
[coughs]

27
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,791
[URUSHIHARA]
One-two-three, not it!

28
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:02,541
[ASHIYA] You!

29
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,875
[ASHIYA coughs]

30
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,291
[URUSHIHARA] Hey, either
complain or cough, but pick one!

31
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:12,708
[ASHIYA coughs]

32
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,291
[SUZUNO] It's you.

33
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,083
[MAN] Yes, I remember
you from the church.

34
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:20,916
You are Crestia Bel,
the Deathscythe.

35
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,208
I'm starting
to get worried.

36
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,625
I haven't seen Tom at his
shop for several days now.

37
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,333
Do you know if
he's been sick?

38
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,916
[MAN B] I haven't heard
anything, but you know,

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,083
that guy was always defying
the Grand Hoshin Church.

40
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,333
An' rumor has it, he
even gave the Federation

41
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,000
of Knights priority when he
passed out food and supplies.

42
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,833
You think he'll have to
face the Inquisition?

43
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,625
Keep it down,
you fool!

44
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,583
What if they're
listening to us?

45
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,791
[CADRE A] I've received
intelligence that Lucifer's army

46
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,875
is invading Porridge Village.

47
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,041
Most unfortunate for
the platoon of Church knights

48
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,208
who are stationed there;
they don't stand a chance.

49
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,958
Why don't we
send in reinforcements,

50
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,500
and then they
can owe us one?

51
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,500
[CADRE D] No, it wouldn't
make much difference.

52
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,666
The enemy force is too large.

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,333
The most intelligent
course of action is

54
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,291
to just pretend we never heard
about it in the first place.

55
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,041
[CADRE B] Following such
a strategy will let the world

56
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,458
know the Church failed
to protect the village,

57
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,083
allowing doubt to set in.

58
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,500
Our federation will then be able
to take advantage of the mess

59
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,458
and proceed with our plans
to subdue Satan.

60
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,958
Right.

61
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,208
And we will lose only one
minor village in the process.

62
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,958
A sacrifice well worth it if
we can win back the people.

63
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,541
[door creaks]

64
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,500
[CADRE B] Who goes there?

65
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,000
[gasps, chokes]

66
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,458
Wait, what?

67
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,083
Poison!

68
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,166
No!

69
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,208
It's in the wine!

70
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,125
[chokes]

71
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,750
[chokes]

72
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,500
[CADRE A] You wench!

73
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,791
You are with the
Inquisition, are you not?

74
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,291
Damn you!

75
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:37,291
[chokes]

76
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,000
[CADRE A] Church lapdog.

77
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,708
You will pay!

78
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,500
No!

79
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,250
Spare me!

80
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,125
[halted scream]

81
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,333
[OLBA] Well done.

82
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,000
Your work was as
efficient as always.

83
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,250
I'm impressed.

84
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,458
Now wipe off all that blood.

85
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,708
A portion of the blame
for the knights' inability

86
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,208
to band together against Satan's
army lies with the Church.

87
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,833
Why does no one
try to compromise?

88
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,000
We should not be at
war with each other.

89
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,625
Do not think
above your pay grade, dear.

90
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,500
Your only concern
is your duty as

91
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,333
the Bailiff of the Inquisition.

92
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,958
A questioning spirit
is a prideful one.

93
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,875
[OLBA] Here is the
next list of heretics.

94
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,958
[SUZUNO] In the end, it was the
Hero who saved the world.

95
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,375
We were just
part of the problem.

96
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,208
[RIKA] What?

97
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,750
The amusement park?

98
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,000
Did you go
with Maou?

99
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,750
Why would you jump
to that conclusion?

100
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,125
[RIKA] You mean
you didn't?

101
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,875
Okay, well I guess technically
I did see him there,

102
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,833
but I went with Chiho
and Suzuno, not him.

103
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,500
[RIKA] You can keep
denying it all you want,

104
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,333
but I still think Maou the
Shift Manager is on your mind.

105
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,583
Amirite?

106
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,208
If you want the truth,
Suzuno's the one most

107
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,833
on my mind at the moment.

108
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,375
Sorry to burst your bubble.

109
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,791
[CHIHO] Good afternoon!...?

110
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,000
[MAOU] Oh, Chi, we've
been waiting for you!

111
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,208
[CHIHO] Um, Mister Maou,
what's going on?

112
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,958
Our landlady sent all
this junk from Hawaii.

113
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,625
She said to sell it
in the summer bazaar

114
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,333
at the shopping arcade.

115
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,791
[ASHIYA] Apologies,
Miss Sasaki.

116
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,333
I'm afraid we had to
bother you because of me.

117
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,083
I'm still rather ill.

118
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,750
[ASHIYA grunts]

119
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,750
[URUSHIHARA] Watch it, yo!

120
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,166
[MAOU] Be careful
with those boxes!

121
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,166
Oh.

122
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,750
Are you all right,
Mister Ashiya?

123
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,500
Having help is
fine, I get it,

124
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,166
but are you sure we're even
gonna have enough room in here?

125
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,958
You know, with Emi
comin' over, too?

126
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:44,833
What?

127
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,458
How do you know she's coming?

128
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,000
Because I planted
a tracker in her purse.

129
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,875
Like, forever ago.

130
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,458
[MAOU] Yeah,
she's gonna kill you.

131
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,416
[MAOU] What on Earth
is wrong with her, anyway?

132
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,875
We're busy, whacko--!

133
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,125
Huh?

134
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,166
[MAOU] Oh, you're
at that door.

135
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,541
Why should I have to help
you out with this weird sale;

136
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,833
it's not like I live here!

137
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,833
I only came over
to check on Suzuno!

138
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,291
Speaking of weird Emi,
I don't understand why you feel

139
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,750
I need to be checked on.

140
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,833
[URUSHIHARA] I'monna
go back to our place.

141
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,125
I'm a hermit, remember?

142
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,166
I have a strict rule...

143
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,666
[MAOU] You're helping!

144
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,083
You'll be fine so long as
you don't leave the building.

145
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,208
I didn't think our
landlady could freak me out

146
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,375
more than she already has,
but what's she doing with

147
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,791
a bikini top like this?

148
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,416
Well, I actually think
this one's kind of cute.

149
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,541
Yeah, it
kind of is.

150
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,708
Maybe I should
buy it!

151
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,666
Doubt it'll fit.

152
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,500
[EMI] Shut it, hermit!

153
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:40,958
[MAOU] There's food, too.

154
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,416
[CHIHO] Pineapples.

155
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,458
Macadamia chocolates.

156
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,458
Ew, Sp'Ham.

157
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,458
Oh, and there's juice!

158
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,750
This note says
she wants us all

159
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,208
to eat the
food together.

160
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:51,666
Ugh.

161
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,541
Lame.

162
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,250
[SUZUNO] What's Gu-a-va juice?

163
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,625
[MAOU] Why don't
we try it?

164
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,166
[CHIHO] I'll go get cups.

165
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,333
Y'know where
they are, right?

166
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,583
[CHIHO] I think so.

167
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,041
[SUZUNO] I don't believe
that's how you open it.

168
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,250
Watch your eyes, everyone.

169
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,458
That cork's about to fly.

170
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,041
[cork pops, MAOU screams]

171
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,000
[MAOU] Oops.

172
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,750
[EMI] What is your problem?

173
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,416
Here, this'll help some.

174
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,291
What's wrong?

175
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:17,583
Oh.

176
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,291
Um.

177
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,041
It's uh, nothing.

178
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,583
[MAOU] I really am sorry.

179
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,583
I could only find
five, Mister Maou.

180
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,375
Well, none for
Urushihara then.

181
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,583
Dude, why not?

182
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,333
There are exactly five of us!

183
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:34,041
[MAOU] Me, Emi, Suzuno, Chi,
and Ashiya's not dead yet.

184
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,541
[EMI] How about
you stick to water.

185
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,250
[CHIHO] I might have
seen a used to-go cup.

186
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,666
[URUSHIHARA] Gah!
What the crap?

187
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,458
Why do you keep treating me
like the plague?

188
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,208
What did I do to deserve this?

189
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,583
You guys suck so hard!

190
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,041
[MAOU exhales]

191
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,916
Thanks, you all were
a massive help today.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,083
Oh, no worries;
it was fun!

193
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,416
Feels like the day before
my school's culture fest.

194
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,208
Yeah, it seems the prep
for stuff like this always

195
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,750
gets people more excited than
the actual event, you know?

196
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,708
[CHIHO] Something wrong?

197
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,708
Not at all.

198
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,166
I was just thinking.

199
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,041
It's been years since
I've had the time to enjoy

200
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,041
a proper festival.

201
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,500
Well in that case we have
to hang out and enjoy it!

202
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,333
We'll do the prep first, and
then go check out the rest!

203
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,625
I would love to,
but I gotta head out.

204
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,458
I work tonight,
so I've gotta get ready.

205
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,041
[CHIHO] Okay,
have a good shift.

206
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,958
We can finish up
what's left for you.

207
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:24,000
[EMI] Jeez, Chiho, you don't
have to spoil the poor idiot.

208
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,833
[MAN] Why do you waste time

209
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,125
with silly festival
preparations?

210
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,333
You need to carry out
the objective.

211
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,291
If the Devil regains his magic,
it will be too late.

212
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,666
[SUZUNO] I know, but--

213
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,166
[MAN] I believe
we're past hesitation.

214
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,541
Your hands have been thoroughly
stained with blood already,

215
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,208
have they not?

216
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,875
[ROBERTIO] Curse Saint Aire.

217
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,541
Always so self-righteous
the moment there's peace.

218
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,041
[HIGH PRIEST A] Their
current goal is to prevent us

219
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,083
our rightful access to the
rebuilding of the central lands.

220
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,291
They will exploit any
weakness to come after us.

221
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,291
How did they acquire

222
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,291
the assassinated
nobleman's corpse?

223
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,500
Not to mention the transcript
of the trial proceedings

224
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,625
from the cathedral.

225
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,291
What has the
Prince-Bishopric of Bel

226
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,375
been doing?

227
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,833
It may seem wise to
let our lead bailiff

228
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,833
take the fall, but I don't
think handing her over

229
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,625
would change the situation.

230
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,375
After all, the Inquisition
conducts a number of unfair

231
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,958
trials without her.

232
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,791
What do you
suggest we do?

233
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,583
The Hero Emilia
is a former knight

234
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,166
of the church who defeated
the Devil's army with the

235
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,000
assistance of by the
high priest Olba.

236
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,291
I would imagine that means the
people owe this peacetime

237
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,750
to the Church.

238
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,291
Not so fast.

239
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,666
You are still the ones who made
the trials severe and unfair

240
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,666
to begin with, and those actions
will not be left unpunished!

241
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,000
One of us should
most assuredly

242
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,041
take the blame.

243
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,833
Nonsense, why should
we be blamed when

244
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,333
the high priest Olba was
in charge of the trials.

245
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,666
And now that he's conveniently
disappeared on us,

246
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,500
we have no reason
to take responsibility.

247
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,000
Exactly.

248
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,708
[CERVANTES] To avoid delays
in trying the heretics while

249
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,125
the Grand Inquisitor is absent.

250
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,541
Father Robertio will establish a
"Doctrinal Correction Council"

251
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,583
and transfer all officers
of the Inquisition to it.

252
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,916
The Inquisition will be
suspended until the return

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,125
of Father Olba.

254
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,375
Under this new leadership,

255
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,958
the council shall
conduct fairer trials.

256
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,083
That should be a sufficient
story to feed the kingdoms.

257
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,166
[SUZUNO] It is always this way.

258
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,458
They refuse to
discipline themselves,

259
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,875
out of shame and fear of
damage to the institution.

260
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,000
They keep their hands
from getting dirty,

261
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,083
while stealing their
glory from others.

262
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:27,416
I-- I never wanted
to execute anyone.

263
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,541
[MAN] For the last time, Bel.

264
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,166
You have a job to finish.

265
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,958
Kill the Devil.

266
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,166
[SUZUNO] He shall die.

267
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,750
I swear it.

268
00:11:47,625 --> 00:12:01,708
[ASHIYA moans]

269
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,000
No way.

270
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:07,458
[ASHIYA moans]

271
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,791
[URUSHIHARA] Look, dude.

272
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,833
If you're that sick,
why not go to the hospital?

273
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,125
I'll even call an ambulance!

274
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,916
No, that's way
too much to pay.

275
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,416
Tough nuts.

276
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,791
I'm calling for help, and
you're going to the hospital.

277
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,833
[ASHIYA] Wait!

278
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,958
Do you know how much
an ambulance costs?

279
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,750
I don't know if
insurance will cover it!

280
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:34,541
[emergency sirens]

281
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,916
[EMI] Oh, there she is.

282
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,875
[CHIHO] Miss Suzuno!

283
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,541
Where have you been?

284
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,916
[EMI] Is everything okay?

285
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,458
[SUZUNO] Yes, fine.

286
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,916
I was just doing some thinking.

287
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,125
[CHIHO] So, uh.

288
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,750
I've been wonderin,
how's your job search?

289
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,416
'Cause, if you
haven't found one yet,

I'm sure we could get you
hired at MgRonald's with us!

291
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,083
Can you imagine
how much fun

292
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,541
we'd all have
working together?

293
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,083
[SUZUNO] Good Chiho.

294
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,625
Yeah?

295
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,375
You should not associate
with Maou any longer.

296
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,083
What the
crap, Suzuno?

297
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,416
[SUZUNO] Emilia,
please stay out of this.

298
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,916
"Emilia"?

299
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,375
Miss Yusa, how does
she know your real name?

300
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,500
So you do know
about King Satan.

301
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,958
My instincts were correct.

302
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,583
Something has been
telling me you knew

303
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,916
the awful truth already.

304
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,625
[EMI] Suzuno.

305
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,958
[SUZUNO] Emilia.

306
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,291
Believe me, I know you
have your own agenda here.

307
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,291
But you must understand
I do as well.

308
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,541
It was my mistake.

309
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,375
I should have
killed him immediately.

310
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,750
[CHIHO] Miss Suzuno.

311
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,750
Please, where is
all this coming from?

312
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,958
How could you
want to kill him?

313
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,416
Listen to me.

314
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Don't you remember how as
soon as the Devil decorated

315
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,375
those trees for the festival,
your MgRonald's was suddenly

316
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,250
flooded with customers?

317
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,208
What do you
think that means?

318
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,416
That he's good?

319
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
It means he used magic.

320
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,916
Those slips of paper were
filled with human desires,

321
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,208
and then tied to bamboo to
exorcise the bad energy.

322
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,333
Satan subconsciously used
that whole thing as a medium

323
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,708
for casting a spell.

324
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,750
He only wanted customers
to come in so the store

325
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,250
would do well!

326
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,375
I mean, yes, I guess cheating
isn't exactly fair, but still.

327
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,250
Not so bad
if that were all.

328
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,250
But there's no guarantee
he won't start making more

329
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,625
dangerous magic and hurting
people in the process.

330
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,625
No!

331
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,791
Mister Maou would
never do that!

332
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,750
Remember those
alligators in the pool?

333
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,291
What do you think
will happen if the Devil

334
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,000
works his way up
in this world?

335
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,500
What if everybody ends up
trusting and respecting him

336
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,583
like you do?

337
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,083
It'll be the perfect
opportunity for him

338
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:28,958
to betray us all.

339
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:29,958
I don't think so.

340
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,291
You don't?

341
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,125
No offense, but uh--
do you really think getting

342
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,333
a promotion at a fast food
joint means he's capable

343
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,375
of taking over
an entire world?

344
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,583
[SUZUNO] Demons
live a long time.

345
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,083
We have no idea how
elaborate his plans are.

346
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,750
We should kill him now,
while we still can.

347
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,666
No, please!

348
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,708
I realize this
must be painful,

349
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,791
but we are from an entirely
different world, Good Chiho.

350
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,625
You and Satan should
never even have met.

351
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,041
The best course now
is to erase your memory,

352
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:01,000
and eliminate all traces
of Ente Isla from this land.

353
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,000
[bag drops]

354
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,458
[EMI] Chiho?

355
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,583
Erase my memory?

356
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,666
Why?

357
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,583
Why would you
do something like that?

358
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,541
I don't want to forget
about all of you.

359
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,666
Not Mister Maou, or Miss Yusa.

360
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,750
Or Mister Ashiya, or you.

361
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,416
Or-- even Mister Urushihara.

362
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,416
[CHIHO] We were lucky
enough to become friends.

363
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,583
And we've gone through
so much together.

364
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,791
But now you want to make
me forget part of my life

365
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,958
because of your
precious Ente Isla?

366
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,625
That's not fair;
what about me?

367
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,833
[SUZUNO] This situation
is not about you, Chiho.

368
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,416
That being said, taking
advantage of your feelings

369
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,458
may actually be
part of his plan.

370
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,000
He might be trying to sow
seeds of doubt and confusion.

371
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,291
[CHIHO] I'm telling you
he's just not like that!

372
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,958
Why would you say
such horrible things?

373
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:51,458
He's worked hard, and he's
been so nice to everyone!

374
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,791
So how can you do this?

375
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,541
How can you defend him?

376
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,041
The Devil has killed
thousands in Ente Isla!

377
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,708
He's the ruler of demons!

378
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,833
Fine, since you know so
much, tell me something:

379
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,833
did you ever meet him
before he came to this world

380
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,750
and turned into my
friend Sadao Maou?

381
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,833
[SUZUNO] I--

382
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,666
[CHIHO] You only
fought with his army.

383
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,541
You never even met him
in person, so how would

384
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,291
you know anything about him?

385
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,500
 False logic!

386
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,500
Every commander bears
full responsibility

387
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,000
for the actions
of his troops.

388
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,875
If he was evil
and plotting to do

389
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,333
all the things you think he's
doing, then why would he bother

390
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,291
saving people and fixing the
expressway after it collapsed?

391
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,375
[SUZUNO] There must have
been an ulterior motive.

392
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,458
Something to do with
his nefarious plans!

393
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,208
[CHIHO] What reason is
there other than just being

394
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,541
an actual nice guy?

395
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,916
When a good person
causes someone else problems,

396
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,083
they apologize and then
try to fix the situation.

397
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,625
Maou did what good people do.

398
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,750
Did you know?

399
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,458
I learned everything
about my job from him.

400
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,000
He has taught me so much.

401
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,500
When I screwed up,
which I did a lot,

402
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,250
he always made me feel better.

403
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,625
He's kept
his promises, too.

404
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,958
Even when he turned
back into a demon.

405
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,375
I wanted to learn how to
use the ice cream machine,

406
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,041
and he remembered!

407
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,958
If you still think he wants
to take over the world

408
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,833
with his army, well--

409
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,291
I'm sure he must have a
pretty good reason to do it!

410
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,166
So you believe we should
just forgive and forget

411
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,750
all the atrocities and horrible
things he's done to us?

412
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,208
Just pretend it never happened?

413
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,666
Is that what you want us to do?

414
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,333
[EMI] Calm down, both of you.

415
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,208
Crestia Bel.

416
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,666
To be perfectly honest,
I agree with you.

417
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,916
[SUZUNO] Then join me--

418
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,791
[EMI] However, I don't
agree with all of it.

419
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,250
I hope for a peace
that will allow

420
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,458
every person to be happy,
not just a select few.

421
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,583
And that peace is what I've been
fighting for all this time.

422
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,541
Looking the other way while
we make our friends cry

423
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,375
is not acceptable.

424
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,458
Believe me.

425
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,291
The means don't
always justify the end,

426
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,000
and I won't allow you
to behave as though they do.

427
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,708
You cannot
truly be serious.

428
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,583
[EMI] I am.

429
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,166
Then, you're dreaming.

430
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,833
There's no way we can win this
without someone getting hurt.

431
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,125
[EMI] I'll find one.

432
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,125
Sacrifices will
have to be made!

433
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,416
This is war!

434
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,708
[EMI] No one needs to suffer.

435
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,333
I'll figure it out.

436
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,541
I am a hero, after all.

437
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,916
It's what I do.

438
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,291
Thank you.

439
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,291
Fine.

440
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,625
So right now you have no
intention of defeating

441
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,750
the Devil?

442
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,833
[EMI] Nope.

443
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,583
Not right now.

444
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,208
[SUZUNO] Understood.

445
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,666
[CHIHO] Miss Suzuno!

446
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,458
[CHIHO] I think I went too far.

447
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,250
I don't know anything
about Ente Isla,

448
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,041
so how can I understand
where she's coming from?

449
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,583
I wish I hadn't've
been so mean.

450
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,750
Don't worry.

451
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,000
Suzuno realizes we don't
always get to choose

452
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,375
who we fall in love with.

453
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,750
You think so?

454
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,666
[CHIHO screams]

455
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,541
[EMI] You again!

456
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,416
[chuckle]

457
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
[EMI] And just like last time.

458
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,541
It's like you have a thing for
attacking me out in the open.

459
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,625
I suppose it doesn't
really matter, though.

460
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,208
This won't take long.

461
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,041
Careful, things
might get rough!

462
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,208
No!

463
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,541
I gotta call for help.

464
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,208
[EMI] Who are you?

465
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,750
[MAN chuckles]

466
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,500
I tried to warn you.

467
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,875
Men will always take
advantage of vulnerable women.

468
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,416
Chicken creep?

469
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,541
Please oh please,
pick up!

470
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,625
No!

471
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,958
[SARUE] It's no use.

472
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,083
The power of my gaze makes
angels fall from grace.

473
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:43,166
It subdues all who use Celestial
Force; and belongs to me alone.

474
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,083
Angels?

475
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:44,708
Hold on.

476
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,458
Does that mean--?

477
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,083
Yes, that's right.

478
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,208
You're welcome, Emilia;
I'm here to release you

479
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,916
from your painful mission.

480
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,625
Since you don't need the
Better Half anymore,

481
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,208
I'll be taking it back.

482
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,375
Miss Yusa!

483
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,833
Miss Yusa!

484
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,583
Not you, too.

485
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,416
You're just like that
awful man Olba, aren't you?

486
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,708
She's in your way, so you think
it's okay to get rid of her.

487
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,041
How can you do this?

488
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,916
Mister Maou may be
a demon, but you're the one

489
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,958
who's got no problem
betraying the only person

490
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,166
who fought for your world!

491
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,750
So what does that make you?

492
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,416
Good Chiho.

493
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,916
I'm sorry.

494
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,583
[MAOU] Oh.

495
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,625
Chi called, huh?

496
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,625
[phone rings]

497
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,125
Yeah.

498
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,291
Hello?

499
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,750
[WOMAN] Hi, this is
Chiho Sasaki's mom.

500
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,166
I just wanted to thank you for
taking such good care of her.

501
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,416
Oh, yeah, uh--
You're welcome.

502
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
[CHIHO'S MOM] So,
Chiho's not home yet.

503
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,541
Is she with you, by chance?

504
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,625
Have I seen Chiho?

505
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,541
Sorry dude.

506
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,000
No, she hasn't been by here.

507
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,250
While I've got you, I
investigated that SFC place.

508
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,208
For a chicken joint,
it smells fishy.

509
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,583
[MAOU] What does that mean?

510
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,958
[URUSHIHARA] Well,
you said the manager's name

511
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,750
was Mitsuki Sarue, right?

512
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,166
That name is not on their
employee list anywhere.

513
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,291
Seriously?

514
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,500
Yeah, the data's
been manipulated.

515
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,416
[MAOU] You planted
that tracker on Emi.

516
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,666
Is it still on her?

517
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,375
Can you tell me
where she is right now?

518
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,708
Gimme just a sec.

519
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,083
That's creepy.

520
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,875
She's moving in a straight line,
through buildings!

521
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,916
Wait, I'm wrong,
it's not Emilia; it's Suzuno.

522
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,125
[MAOU] Where's she headed?

523
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,000
[URUSHIHARA] Looks like
government building?

524
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,500
[KAWA-CCHI] Whoa,
Maou, where are you going?

525
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,833
On my way, Chi!
