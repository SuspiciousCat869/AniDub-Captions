you leave here so suddenly.

I know this must seem abrupt,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.235 position:50% align:center
and I'm just as
surprised as you are,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
but I can't keep ignoring
the lives of other people.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
I've realized it's
not just about me.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
And after 12 years,
I'd say it's about time.

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
Seeing you suffer is
what first motivated me.

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
I instinctively moved toward you
and wanted to give you help.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
Before I knew it, I developed
the kind of feelings for you

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
that I'd always
mocked in others.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
If I'd had the medical training
at the time you became ill,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
I could've taken
care of you myself.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
It was frustrating
to be so helpless.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.769 position:50% align:center
I'm okay now.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
Of course, just because
I wanted to help you

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean I'd
even be allowed to.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
No one from the Shima family

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
would ever be trusted
to serve others.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
Be that as it may, I just...

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
I still want to be known as
someone who helps people.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
So that's the plan.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
I'll become a doctor,
then marry a nobleman,

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center

and I'll save countless lives!

[VILLAGER D]
Her? Really?

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER A]
Wow, she's still so small.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I'd like some
vegetables, please.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
Sure thing!

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Which ones would
you recommend today?

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
Let's take a look.

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's--

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Hm?

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko!
Why are you here?

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Well, when you left,

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
I remembered that I wanted
to get a new, um, a new book.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:37.095 position:50% align:center
Also, since I'm here, why don't
you let me carry the basket?

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
So that you can stock up.

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
At least make the long
trip worthwhile.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.936 position:50% align:center
Um. Unless you don't want to.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
That's a great idea!

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Just as I thought.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
They're gossiping
about Yuzu, now, too.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
And it's all my fault.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Everyone is staring at her.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
She must be so embarrassed.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Hold on.
What are you grinning about?

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
Huh? I didn't know I was.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI giggles]

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
Maybe because I was
thinking about the time

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
you took me out
shopping in Tokyo.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
I remembered how much fun
we had in that cute shop.

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center
Is that silly?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
Um, no, I guess not.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Hmm...

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
What is it you're looking for?

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
Some nice stationery
to write letters.

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
I think Miss Tamako
would like this.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
This is for Miss Midori.

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
Who's Midori?

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
Just one of my friends from
back at the girls' school.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
It looks like they're selling
some good books over there.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
[BOOKSELLER A]
Welcome!

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Wow!

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
Take your time and
see what you like.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you! I've been
wanting to read this one!

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
And that one, too! Wow.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
Oh my goodness!
Is that Tanizaki?

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO laughs]

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
It's wonderful knowing how
much you love reading!

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
Glad you found something!

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I was very young

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
when my parents decided
to give up on me.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
But I discovered I'd always
have a friend in books.

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
Guess what, Father.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
Today is the first
day of September.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what that means?

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.261 position:50% align:center
[TAMAYOSHI]
Ugh. I know what day it is!

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
Do you think I'm
so much of an idiot

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
that I need you to teach me
how to use a calendar?

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
I don't have time for this!
Get out of my sight, now!

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
But why?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
Why does everyone
hate me so much?

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
I'm worthless.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I'll take this one.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.417 position:50% align:center
[BOOKSELLER A]
That'll be 70 sen.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
Okay, you're set!

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
If you like that genre,
I've got another for you.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
Come back anytime!

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Dinner's ready!
Hope you're hungry!

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] <i>Chirashi</i> ,
simmered fish, and <i>hittsumi</i> .

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
Looks great!
So what's the occasion?

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
Surprise!

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
Did you really think
you'd get away

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
with never telling
me your birthday?

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50% align:center
Wait. How'd you know?

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
When women are
chosen to be wives,

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
there are certain things
the universe tells us.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
Wow. Does that really happen?

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
Well, no.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
I asked Miss Tamako when
she was here visiting us.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
Gotcha. Sorry.

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's not much...
but happy birthday!

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
I made this for you.
I hope you like it.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
It's a...

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] A pressed-bellflower
bookmark. Sort of.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
I know, it's not as well-made
as I'd like it to be,

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
but I thought it'd be useful.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
Especially with
how much you read

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
and how many books you have.

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
The bellflowers
remind me of you,

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
so this seemed like the
perfect way to use them.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
I hope it makes you smile.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko?

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
Huh? What? I'm listening.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. It's just that
this is a first for me.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.436 position:50% align:center
My hands are shaking so much.

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
Happy birthday!
May there be many more.

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.702 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
It's okay, I'm used to it.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
It's my birthday,
and nobody ever...

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
No one remembers.
I'm always alone.

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI gasps]

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
Did I...? Did I say
something wrong?

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:52.035 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
She wished me a happy birthday.

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.913 position:50% align:center
I've never heard anyone
say those words before.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
Not to me.

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
I think the boy inside me just
smiled for the first time.

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
My treasure, always and forever.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
Uh, I mean the
bookmark, of course.

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center

Whoa. Not good.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
What have I done?

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
Yuzu's probably going to think

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
I'm some kind of weirdo
after all this.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
If she doesn't think
that already!

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
But still, never received
a birthday present before.

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center

it's in my room.

I'm Ryo.

I actually live further
down in the village,

She doesn't seem to be nervous

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center

here to rob you.

I do have to say.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
Did you seriously fall for that?
I was clearly joking!

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.277 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
Oh, that was so much fun!

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
I suppose my work
here is finished.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
Time to go. It was
so nice to meet you.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Wha--?! Hold on!

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
Aren't you forgetting
about something here?

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
What about these caramels?

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
Not sure I follow. Oh, right.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
No thanks, they're way too sweet
for me and stick to my teeth.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
Seriously? It's not
supposed to be a gift!

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
I'm asking what you'll do
with the jar you broke!

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
She's fast!

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
Thanks! Bye!

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
What? What just happened here?

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Is everything okay?

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah!

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
Was it Haru? I thought
I heard another voice.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Huh? Uh, right.
I had to chase the cat outside.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
And I tripped and broke the jar
of caramels in the process.

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. You didn't hurt
yourself, did you?

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
Poor kitty. I wonder
if Haru's okay.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
Um, I don't think you
have to worry about that.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
Listen, Yuzu. I wanted to
thank you for the bookmark.

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
I really needed one.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna start
using it right away.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
Now to choose which
book to use it in.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO chuckles]

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
I'm happy you like it!

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
I was so worried it wouldn't
be good enough.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:35.985 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] There's no way
I could tell her the truth.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Where is it?

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh?!

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
Gone.

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Don't tell me...

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh? What's going on?

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:56.881 position:50% align:center
Are you upset about something?

00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I'll be right back!

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Not that. I can't handle it!

00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:14.190 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] She can have
anything in that wallet,

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
just not the bookmark!

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu made that.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
It's a gift that came
straight from her heart!

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:33.460 position:50% align:center
Somebody else was
in here. A woman.

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
[RYO laughs]

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
That was too easy!

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
That little rich boy needs
to keep a better eye

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
on his pockets.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
Never even noticed I took
his wallet. Dummy.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:53.146 position:50% align:center
Uh? Is that a bookmark?
With a flower on it?

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
Didn't expect to see that.

00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:57.984 position:50% align:center
Whatever! I'm not complaining!

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
Looks like I got
a bonus tonight!

00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:39.336 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
I'm glad we could celebrate

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.629 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko's birthday.

00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:43.798 position:50% align:center
I think it was a
good day for him.

00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:46.259 position:50% align:center
He seemed to love
the bookmark, too.

00:23:46.343 --> 00:23:48.553 position:50% align:center
Even with the bellflower on it.

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:51.806 position:50% align:center
Although he's been
acting a little strange.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.392 position:50% align:center
I hope something isn't wrong.
