I noticed you and Tamako have
been exchanging letters lately.

Actually, this one
is addressed to you.

[TAMASUKE] Tamahiko, Tamako's
kept me thoroughly abreast

of your current situation.

with great enthusiasm

and an even greater desire
to become a doctor.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
That said, Tamahiko,
I was hoping you'll allow me

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
to assist you as well.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
Tamahiko says he's been studying

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
so he can eventually
return to high school!

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
Is that his plan?

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
Yes. To think, my brother,

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
who barely had enough
motivation to move,

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
much less take action
on his own behalf,

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
suddenly gathering all
this determination!

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
And I'm quite certain Yuzu
deserves all the credit.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
[TAMASUKE laughs]

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.229 position:50% align:center
But still, although I'm pleased,

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
what particularly worries me is,
will our father allow it?

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
[TAMASUKE]
Hm.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
[TAMASUKE]
It would be a terrible waste

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.909 position:50% align:center
for a talented man
such as yourself

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
not to return to school.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I would be glad
to lend my support.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
As overwhelming as
this proposal may be,

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
I ask that you please
take time to consider it

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
in a positive light.

Yes, um, regarding
your proposal,

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
I would be deeply
honored to accept.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
I promise you, I will repay
your kindness one day.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
Thank you so very much.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
My plan would be to skip a grade

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:46.870 position:50% align:center
and transfer into the second
year of high school.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
No matter how hard I study,
it feels like it's not enough.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Regardless, it's only
natural that I'd do all this.

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
To regain the time
I lost as a shut-in,

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
and more importantly,

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
to become someone who
can keep Yuzu safe.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:21.279 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I'll be
in your kitchen!

need any more tending to!

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
Wow, he's huge!

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D]
So tall!

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E]
That height.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
What'dya know!

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
I can't believe we're
attending the same school

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
as someone like him.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
Please excuse the intrusion,
but, um, I'm new here.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A] Ah, yes,
yes, the second one.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Second?

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS whispering]

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.216 position:50% align:center
I'm a transfer student
from Third Higher School,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.052 position:50% align:center
Hakaru Shiratori.

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
Did you say Shiratori?

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you're
Kotori Shiratori's--?

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:22.974 position:50% align:center
That's right,
I'm her twin brother.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:25.685 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Whoa!

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.854 position:50% align:center
My sister and I have
recently come to live

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
with our relatives
here in Chiba.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
Let's have a great
year, everyone!

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT J]
He looks just like her!

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT K]
I wanna meet Kotori!

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A] Shima, if you'll
introduce yourself.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh, right.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
I'm Tamahiko Shima.
Nice to meet you.

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT J] Shima? So he's
from that awful rich family?

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT K]
No, it can't be.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
Now, boys, you should
know that Shima here

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
lost the use of his right hand
in an unfortunate accident.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
I expect you all to show
him some leniency.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT L]
Avoiding him entirely

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
is probably the better bet.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO grunts]

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT H]
We're going to the café later.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
You coming, Shiratori?

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
Or how about joining
the baseball club?

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
If you have any trouble
settling in here at school,

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
we'll help you out!

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:19.197 position:50% align:center
By the way, about your sister--

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
Hey! Gym class is in a few
minutes. Hurry up and change.

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
[GYM TEACHER A]
You're late, Shima!

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
My apologies.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
[GYM TEACHER A] Everyone,
laps for the rest of the hour!

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
A lesson in joint
responsibility!

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT K]
Sheesh, this is harsh.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.851 position:50% align:center
Why'd we get punished, too?

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
I mean, if you're that slow,
maybe ask for help next time.

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT H]
Ugh. Finally! I'm starving!

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:02.824 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shiratori, we're headed
over to the dorms now

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
if you wanna come along with us.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can tell us all
about Kotori during lunch.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
Well, I...

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it'll be fun, let's go.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Let's see...

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yuzu really
outdid herself today.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Tasty.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
A boxed lunch is different,
but still good.

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
It tastes like... home.

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Hm?

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
You must be as curious as I am

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
about how Mister
Tamahiko is doing.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.812 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.107 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Oh.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
I hope you're not feeling
too uncomfortable

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
on your first day of school,
Mister Tamahiko.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
Have you made any
new friends yet?

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
[ART TEACHER A] Today you'll
be drawing somebody

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
important to you.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
A relative or even that special
someone--your choice.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.833 position:50% align:center
I guess I can draw my mom.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna pick Miyo
from the maid café.

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:40.213 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
Sorry, this seat
isn't taken, is it?

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:51.141 position:50% align:center
Let's see. How's yours going?

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:59.107 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU chuckles]

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.109 position:50% align:center
Such talent!

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Go right
ahead, laugh it up.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
Oh, I would never.
Absolutely not.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Wow.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
No one asked you to sign
this delightful portrait,

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.420 position:50% align:center
and yet here we are!

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
A masterpiece!

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU laughs]

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
You know you're a
terrible liar, right?

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hmm. Okay, fine, I admit.

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
Your portrait is horrendous.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.727 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO gasps]

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling generous, so I'll
share something with you.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
Observe: A professional's work.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:44.069 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO spits, chuckles]

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
Who's that supposed to be?

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
What? This is my
sister, obviously!

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:51.576 position:50% align:center
I would advise getting a new
pair of eyeglasses immediately

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
if that's what your sister
looks like to you.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Ugh! You cannot be serious!

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.625 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I assure you I am.

00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
Your portrait is
worse than mine!

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
Yours is worse, profoundly so.

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
No, yours is worse
by a longshot.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
Yours is objectively
the very worst.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
You two, keep it down, please!

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center
Gracious! What are these?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
Unacceptable! I won't
tolerate shoddy work!

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
The arts are important!
Look here, you may be new...

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
What was that about?

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I'm home!

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.356 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Be right there!

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
Welcome home, Mister Tamahiko.
I'm so glad you're back!

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.574 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO grunts]

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
And good day to you, miss!

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh?!

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Yuzu, this is Hakaru
Shiratori, from my class.

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
He's actually Kotor--

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
Oh, my! We have a visitor!

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
Please, make yourself
at home, sir!

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back
with some tea!

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI chuckles]

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
What's got her so excited?

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.718 position:50% align:center
Who wouldn't be
thrilled to encounter

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
a handsome young
man such as myself?

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO grumbles]

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Your homework
is to draw each other?

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
So that's the reason
for your visit today.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
My apologies for
intruding so suddenly.

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
Not at all, I think it sounds
like an interesting assignment.

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] More like
punishment if you ask me.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
You two be sure to give
it your very best, okay?

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.287 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Hey, Shima.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
Yes, Shiratori.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU] That Yuzu is
a nice girl, isn't she?

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Mhm.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:26.171 position:50% align:center
With an adorable smile,
might I add!

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Indeed.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
I'm quite captivated
by her smile as well.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
Whenever I see it, I can't
help but feel more at ease.

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.263 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Ah.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO gasps]

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
Uh, anyway, I'll go and
get us some more tea.

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
Great. Thanks!

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Do you have a second?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
Always!

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
May we have some
more tea, please?

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
Huh? Of course.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
By the way, how did your
first day at school go?

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.829 position:50% align:center
My first day.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
Well, there's nothing quite
like the first day of school.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
The studies are pretty rigorous.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
But the teachers
are outstanding,

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
and the students are all
so patient with me.

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
Everyone's been incredibly kind.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
We ran a full hour of
laps at gym today,

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
and we were so tired,

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:17.806 position:50% align:center
all we did was grumble about
how exhausted we were.

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
After that, I got to relax
with the exceptional lunch

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
you prepared for me, Yuzu.

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, I've just
been so anxious all day.

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
What a relief.

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:36.783 position:50% align:center
Now I understand. It wasn't just
the homework assignment.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
You invited Shiratori here
because he's your friend.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu, forgive me.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
Right! Then I'll do my best

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
to make all your lunches
as special as the first.

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
I'm lucky to have you.

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
My, aren't you the liar?

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO, HAKARU]
And finished!

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
So... this is me, huh?

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
Let me guess, you think it
looks horrendous, don't you?

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Mh-mh.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
Nope, I find it simply lovely!

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
And why's that?

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.192 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
You have a way of capturing

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
your subjects' smiles on paper.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
I noticed it with
Yuzu's portrait.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
Her smile is special, like
a gentle breeze in spring.

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
Or, rather, spring itself.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
That being said, to make
her smile through a lie,

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
now that would be a shame.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
You heard that, huh?

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
I did, sorry.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
I-I just couldn't bear to see
Yuzu unhappy because of me.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever, even lie, if
it means I get to see her smile.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
But you're right, I need
to be honest with her.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Dummy.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.569 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be easier to turn
your lies into the truth?

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
Then it'd be almost like
you weren't lying.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
Lies are troublesome,

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
but you had a good
reason to tell this one.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I guess that's pretty
rich coming from me.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Oh, nothing!

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
Dinner is ready, you two!

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Coming! Thank you!

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO groans]

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
Time to go turn my lies
into truth, I guess.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
What on earth is this
tasty dish? It's amazing!

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:32.148 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
It's called <i>hittsumi</i> .

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
You'll make a splendid
wife one day, Yuzu.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
I'm flattered, thank you!

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
My, what great friends
we've become today.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
You'll feed me again
next time I visit, yes?

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
So it's her food you're after?

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:46.579 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Mh-hm!

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:48.081 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI, HAKARU laugh]

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
Wait. Hold on. Back up a second.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.003 position:50% align:center
Am I imagining it,

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
or did you just say something
about us being friends?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
Indeed, you and I
are friends now!

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
So be gentle with me!

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Does the idea...

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Okay, what is he
going on and on about?

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
He saw how badly I
managed at school.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
Everyone there
despises me! And yet...

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
It's the first time I've seen

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
this look on your face,
Mister Tamahiko.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.536 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
[HAKARU]
Shima! Pardon the intrusion!

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you
know? He's back.

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center
It's nice to see you again!

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
To what do we owe the pleasure?

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI chuckles]

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
Ah, and who might this be?

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. Did I forget
to mention it before?

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
Yuzu, this is my twin sister.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
Kotori Shiratori.

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.946 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.240 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
[DRAWING]
Oh, my!

00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:42.088 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Huh? Kotori
and Shiratori are twins?

00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:43.923 position:50% align:center
I can't believe my eyes!

00:23:44.007 --> 00:23:46.968 position:50% align:center
My idol, Kotori,
standing right before me!

00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:48.386 position:50% align:center
And what's this?

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.764 position:50% align:center
She wants me to teach her
the meaning of true love?

00:23:50.847 --> 00:23:52.682 position:50% align:center
Oh, my!
