00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.062 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I'll go to Tokyo.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:48.942 position:50% align:center
And then, Yuzu and I will
come home together!

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:51.403 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hi, Mister Tamahiko!

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.863 position:50% align:center
Hey, gang! I'm glad to
see you're all okay!

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.658 position:50% align:center
Tamahiko, I'm gonna
go with you.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:57.992 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.120 position:50% align:center
I need to know if
my brother's okay.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.623 position:50% align:center
If that quake could do this much
damage in our little village,

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
I can't help wondering
how much worse

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.585 position:50% align:center
everything must be
for him in Tokyo.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.838 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
We're thinking the same thing.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50% align:center
Please don't argue with me.
I need to come with you!

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
But then, who's gonna take
care of Keita and Yamato?

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.263 position:50% align:center
We can all look
after each other!

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.098 position:50% align:center
I promise, we're gonna be fine!

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.058 position:50% align:center
[SACHINO, REIMI]
Yeah, we swear!

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
Please, don't worry about us.

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.895 position:50% align:center
We just wanna make
sure our brother is safe.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
Of course,
and I don't blame you.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.108 position:50% align:center
What about everybody
else's families

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
and the rest of the village?

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:32.485 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
Actually, a lot of
people got injured.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:39.075 position:50% align:center
I think most of our houses
collapsed or burned down.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.578 position:50% align:center
And the clinic's
been destroyed, too.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:46.207 position:50% align:center
My grandpa, he's sick, but
he has to sleep outside now.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.920 position:50% align:center
Okay, here's the plan.
First, go find your families.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
Then any other villager
left without a home,

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
have them all take
shelter at my house.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN]
Uh?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
It's all right.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
They may not like
the idea at first,

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.015 position:50% align:center
but if you remind them
my grandfather built it

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:04.726 position:50% align:center
to be extra-sturdy,
that'll convince them.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
Help yourselves to
the medicine cabinet

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
and any food you can find.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
If you can promise me that
everyone will be safe,

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
I'll take Ryo with me.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
Wow. Do you mean that?

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
What do you think?
Can you do that for me?

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.698 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN]
We can!

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
I'm the mayor's son, and I
wanna make my family proud!

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.914 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much,
Mister Tamahiko!

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
You be sure to find Miss Yuzu
and bring her back, okay?

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
I promise I will!

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN]
See ya later!

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
Good luck, Sis! Be careful!
Come home soon!

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
And tell Ryotaro we'll
be thinking of him!

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.388 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
How far are we going today?

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] As far as we
can walk before nightfall.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
I'd say it's a good 30 <i>ri</i>
from the village to Tokyo.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
So we should be there around
noon the day after tomorrow.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
If you'd like to turn back,
now's the time to do it.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
Uh. This is my brother
we're talking about here.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
I'll walk as far as
I have to to find him!

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
You know, for a
spoiled rich kid,

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
you seem pretty comfortable
sleeping outside.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm not comfortable.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center
But it's easy when
I think of Yuzu.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
The same way you get by.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
If it means I can see Ryotaro,
then this is worth it.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
I admire the way you protect and
look after all of your brothers,

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
but you have an extra
soft spot for Ryotaro.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you bet I do.
I'll always be grateful to him.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
I'll never forget the time

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
he protected something
precious to me.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Here.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
Whoa. How did this rice
ball get so lumpy?

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Because I made it.
Sorry it's misshapen.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
However, what's important is,

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
I managed to get the
pickled plum in there.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
I guess I don't have any
other options out here.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Well?

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
[RYO] Oh, wow. I've never
tasted anything so bad.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
I'm tearing up over here.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.400 position:50% align:center
What? Are you kidding me?

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
[RYO laughs]

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
I hear it's even worse in Tokyo.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
Fires breaking out in
the blink of an eye.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:30.997 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Yes, I'm told
Nihonbashi, Asakusa,

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
and Kanda got the worst of it.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.959 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] I'd stay away
from Tokyo if I were you.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
It's hell on earth out there.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
Hurry. I need to see Yuzu.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
Knowing that Yuzu needs your
help, it's changed you.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
You really think so?

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're much tougher.
Strength looks good on you.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center
I'm just pushing
myself, that's all.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
When I think of Yuzu
in this much danger,

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
my heart feels like
it's about to break.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
Before she came into my life,
I had no idea it was possible

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
to cherish another
person so much.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
I've never been so
utterly terrified

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
of losing someone, either.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
I've given her my trust,

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
so all the things I've
done to protect my heart

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
from this pain are useless now.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
I wondered what it would be like
if my big sister had lived.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.180 position:50% align:center
If we had the chance to meet,

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
would she have been as kind
to me as you are to them?

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
[RYO gasps]

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'd like to show that
people-pleaser a thing or two.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
Mainly what it's like
having an older sister

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.862 position:50% align:center
looking out for her.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I at least got to
introduce her to Big Sis Ryo.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
So does that mean
you're gonna make her

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
call you "Big Sis"
whenever you're together?

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
Ha. That's a great suggestion.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
And you know, you could
start calling me that, too,

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
while we're at it.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I think I'll pass.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Ha! Come on, don't be shy!

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Is this...?
Is this really Tokyo?

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
From what I can tell,

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
the only thing still standing
around here is Tokyo Station.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
That seems to be where
everyone is taking shelter.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
Yuzu.

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:29.949 position:50% align:center
Yuzu! Yuzu! Yuzu!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu! Yuzu!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
Yuzu!

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
I knew that had to be you.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
Tamako?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu, have you--?

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Brother?

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Tamahiko!

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness you're awake.
Can you hear me?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
Uh. Uncle Tamasuke?
Why are you in Tokyo?

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
Medical relief groups
from all over the country

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
have come here to care
for the injured citizens.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
Almost all of the hospitals
here have burned down.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
Your traveling companion
filled me in.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
I have to keep
looking for Yuzu.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.345 position:50% align:center
I think you should rest
a little while longer.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
Didn't you walk here
all the way from Chiba?

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I can't
just lie around now!

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
Listen, I know this is the
last thing you want to hear,

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
but finding a lost young woman
is going to be very difficult

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.526 position:50% align:center
under the current
conditions in Tokyo.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
If you go out wandering
in all that chaos,

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
you're bound to fail.

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Uncle, I came
out here to find Yuzu,

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
and that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

00:08:56.828 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
She's here, and I know
she's still alive.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's the matter?

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
It's just, you're
different somehow.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
There's been a change.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
I remember the cold and
empty look in your eyes

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
after you woke up
from your surgery.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
Like you could trust no one.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
And it's not just you.
Tamako's changed, too.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.063 position:50% align:center
Meeting Yuzu affected you both.

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
I would like to meet
her myself someday.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
I truly hope you find her.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.323 position:50% align:center

Some rice balls will
give you a boost!

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Kotori.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
Aw, no thanks necessary.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
[KOTORI, HAKARU]
We're friends, aren't we?

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
When did that happen?

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
When did I go from
being alone to not?

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
We're all facing such
brutal circumstances,

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
and yet, everyone's
in such high spirits.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
It's all because the spring
storm of Yuzu has blown through.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
You've brought so much
joy into my life.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
It's my turn now
to make <i>you</i> happy.

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
So please, let's go home soon!

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.231 position:50% align:center
I could easily finish
another one of these,

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.483 position:50% align:center
but I should save them.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
Wait for me, Big Brother!

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Yoko! Get up!

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Uh.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
No, don't! Please! I'm sorry!
You can have them back!

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.878 position:50% align:center
Just please don't
hurt my sister!

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
What a coincidence. I happen
to have a kid sister, myself.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
You're a very good big brother
for looking out for her,

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
so I think you deserve
to keep them.

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
[SHINYU]
Huh? You mean it?

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.851 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Thank you!

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Mh-hm.

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
We got separated
from our parents

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
and didn't have
any food with us,

00:19:58.573 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
so we're super hungry.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
That sounds awful. I'm sorry.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
Big Sis was with us, too,
but she fell down.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda scared.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
So there's three of them?

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
Then we should take her
to the first-aid site.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
Show me where she is.

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
[SHINYU]
She's in there.

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Not a good place to hide.

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
It could collapse at any moment.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
It was the best place
we could find.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, it must be difficult
for the three of you

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
to take care of each other out
here without your parents.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
Big Sis isn't really
our sister, though.

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
She just showed up here
when she heard Yoko crying

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
and helped make her feel better.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
Yeah, an' then she tied
this pretty ribbon for me!

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] You don't say!
It's very cute!

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thank you! She's the best!
I love Big Sis Yuzuki!

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu.

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
Yuzu! Yuzuki!

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
Yuzu!

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
Yuzu!

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Hey, so is your name
Mister Tamahiko?

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.394 position:50% align:center
Yes. How did you...?

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
'Cause she said it.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
She's been mumbling to herself,

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
"Mister Tamahiko,
Mister Tamahiko."

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
Listen close.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.656 position:50% align:center
If you walk a little way in
the direction of Jinbocho,

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
you'll find Kotori Shiratori.

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
[YOKO, SHINYU]
Wha--?!

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:25.452 position:50% align:center
[YOKO]
The real Kotori?

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
You two go there now.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
Tell her that you met me
and I sent you to her.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
She and her brother
are my friends,

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
I know they'll help
any way they can.

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
Before you go,
can you use this scarf

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
to tie Yuzu extra tight
to my right hand?

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.345 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure!

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
Is that you, Mister...?

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu. You're here.

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.776 position:50% align:center
Your body is warm in my arms.

00:21:57.859 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
I can hear the sound
of your breath.

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Thank God you're alive!

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:49.137 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO, YUZUKI]
In the end: A spring storm.
