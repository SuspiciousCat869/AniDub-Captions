00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:57.575 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Home. I want to go
home. Back to Mister Tamahiko.

[YUZUKI]
Momma!

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.296 position:50% align:center
Momma, it's me!

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
I've missed you, Momma.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:22.809 position:50% align:center
Yuzu, I had a dream for
you when you were born.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.645 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to be the
happiest child in the world.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.023 position:50% align:center
It pains me to see you crying.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.693 position:50% align:center
From now on, no matter
what circumstances may be,

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
promise me you'll always
turn towards joy.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.323 position:50% align:center
But, Momma, I--

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
I haven't forgotten.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.744 position:50% align:center
You'd been telling me
to look for happiness

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.496 position:50% align:center
ever since I was a little girl.

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:47.000 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I'm sorry for
leaving the way I did,

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.085 position:50% align:center
with very little notice.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.380 position:50% align:center
It's just that, when I heard
Pappa was on the hook

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
for Uncle's debts, I knew
it wasn't right to sit still

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.594 position:50% align:center
and do nothing.

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.816 position:50% align:center
You will be acting as
a caretaker for my son.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
He lost the use of his right
hand in an accident.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.155 position:50% align:center
Tell me, have you ever
heard the saying,

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
"A child is an
everlasting burden"?

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.951 position:50% align:center
Well, that useless boy
has become nothing

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
but a shackle around my neck.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
The Shima family has
no need for him.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] They must've treated
him horribly up until then.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:42.972 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Here, don't catch a cold.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:46.726 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] After all he'd been
through, he was still so kind.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
I knew then that he would
come to cherish me,

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
and that I would stay
by his side forever.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.695 position:50% align:center
So please don't worry
about me, Momma.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko always
inspires me to smile.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
Whether by a sweet gesture or
his occasional silly clumsiness,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
he keeps me feeling safe
and warm inside and out.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
I believe someday, I could be...

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
These are bellflowers,
aren't they?

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
Symbolizing "unchanging love"!

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
And if that's true,

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
then it doesn't matter
what state they're in now,

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.219 position:50% align:center
the sentiment remains the same!

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
Well, at least to me, anyway.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I wonder if maybe
I should tell him how I feel.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Hurry up and say it.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
"I think I...
I might actually..."

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.571 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
I have something
I want to tell you.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
Huh? Sure, what is it?

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, um, it's nothing.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Choosing the right words

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.960 position:50% align:center
and the right time is difficult.

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
Normally, I'd just blurt out
whatever I wanted to say.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Biting my tongue all
the time is starting to hurt.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
I have to do something.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.391 position:50% align:center
I've decided to tell
him on his birthday.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
If I can't actually say it,

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
I can at least write
it in a letter.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI grunts]

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
In the end, I couldn't do it.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
Whenever I tried to write
exactly what I was feeling,

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
I got nervous.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
Maybe those words
don't need to be said,

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
since we'll be husband
and wife regardless.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
But I still want to tell him.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
I want Mister Tamahiko
to know how I feel.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
It's fine, Yuzuki.
You go on, I'll be okay.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
I won't leave you!
We can do this.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
All we have to do is stick
together and we'll make it home.

[RYO]
Your brother asked me...

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Stare...

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
What are you thinking?

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, I was actually
thinking about you

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
and how you came through for me.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center
Right, I forgot!

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
You hungry? We've got rice
porridge. Want some?

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Uh! Yes!

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
It's delicious.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
Especially after thinking
I'd never eat anything again.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Mister Tamahiko.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you like it.
Eat up and get well soon, okay?

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Okay.

Doctor Manabe?

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
[TAMASUKE]
Hm?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
[NURSE A]
You have visitors.

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
Why's father's here?

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
[TAMAYO]
Hmm?

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
And why'd he bring Tamayo?

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
Hello, Tamasuke.
It's been a long time.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
Yes, it has. What are you
doing here, Brother?

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
I tried telephoning
you at your clinic,

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
but they informed me that
you were already in Tokyo.

00:12:56.026 --> 00:13:00.447 position:50% align:center
Excellent timing. Tamaki was
injured in the earthquake.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
Our brother was?

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
Let the other doctors
take over for you here.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
You need to come with me.

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
Huh? How dare you
make such demands!

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
I am not part of the
Shima family anymore.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
I need you to please go!

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[TAMAYO] It's interesting
you should say that.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
For someone who isn't
in the Shima family,

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
you certainly seem friendly
with Tamahiko and Tamako.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.679 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
What is Tamahiko
doing here, anyway?

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
I believe I told you he
was dead to all of us.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
Are you still spreading
that nonsense around?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
After the quake, Tamahiko
walked here all the way

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
from Chiba to find Yuzuki,
someone who truly cares for him.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
He's finally getting over
the pain you caused

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
and coming into his own.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
He's growing stronger every day.

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
I've written you a referral.
You can try and find help there.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Tamayo.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
What? We're leaving so soon?

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
Then ta-ta, everybody!
Feel better, okay?

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Father, wait!

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see
you're all right.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] We stayed in Tokyo
for a while after that.

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
We helped my uncle
with his work,

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
and it was great to see so
many smiling faces again.

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] "Aiding the nation
begins near at hand.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
There mend matters first
and then venture afar."

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
I don't know what that means.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
Well, let's think about it.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
If you want to help
your fellow man,

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
you should start with
those closest to you,

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.943 position:50% align:center
like your family and the
community in which you live.

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
That may not seem
like much at first,

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.948 position:50% align:center
but eventually, that
becomes helping your country

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
and its people.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.368 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to do
besides help my mom.

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:11.786 position:50% align:center
Do you think that would count?

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
Sure it would!

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
That's an excellent place
to start helping out.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
I wanna help my folks, too!

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.834 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN chattering]

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Uh...

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
It worked.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.259 position:50% align:center
Now everyone's looking for
something they can do.

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:30.555 position:50% align:center
I believe we'll all bounce
back again, together.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
Hot springs are amazing
and so good for your skin!

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
So true. It must be nice
to have one nearby!

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:54.496 position:50% align:center
Especially because only
the villagers know about it.

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
I still can't get over finding
out how big Yuzu is on top!

[YUZUKI gasps]

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
I bet she'd look great
in Western clothes--

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
like a wedding dress!

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center

would love to see that!

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
What about your glasses?

These glasses are part
of my beautiful face.

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
Besides, I want to take in
this mountain scenery.

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center

No, Mister Tamahiko!

Stay with us and relax
a little bit longer!

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
Hope you've got
room for one more!

This is long overdue,

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center

awful when we first met.

It's okay.

No, it's not.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
I almost got bought once, too.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.506 position:50% align:center
And I came very close to losing
something so precious to me.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
When I saw how different
we had it,

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
how happy you were,
I was jealous.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't expect
you to forgive me, but...

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
I can't forgive you because
there's nothing to forgive,

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
so don't you dare
apologize again.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
Besides, I remember
what you said

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
that time at the first-aid site.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
You called me and Mister
Tamahiko your friends,

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
so you can't take it back.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center

that out loud, didn't I?

from down there,

Yuzu.

We wanted to surprise you,

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
so we made sure all the
planning was kept secret.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center

to prepare this amazing feast.

us borrow your house.

are grateful, too,

very good at saying so.

faster than we thought possible.

Just so we're perfectly clear,
when I said I loved you before,

00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:42.696 position:50% align:center
I meant that I was
in love with you.

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:45.031 position:50% align:center
You're my first love.

00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:49.285 position:50% align:center
You see, I had so many regrets
after we were separated.

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:53.081 position:50% align:center
I kept thinking I should've
told you I loved you.

00:22:53.164 --> 00:22:56.751 position:50% align:center
And I-I had such
embarrassing thoughts.

More handholding!

a girl to think that way,

but I couldn't make it stop!

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.972 position:50% align:center
As far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing vulgar here.

When I look at you,
what I see is a pure maiden.

And I'm glad that you
discovered something

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.395 position:50% align:center
every bit as pure as you are.

all manner of hopelessness,

they can come back
even stronger.

I hope someday I'll have
the courage to grow

00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:32.912 position:50% align:center
into the kind of person who
lives their life for others,

But before that can happen,

00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:40.754 position:50% align:center
I need to prioritize what's
important in my life first,

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:44.382 position:50% align:center
and that means cherishing
you completely.
