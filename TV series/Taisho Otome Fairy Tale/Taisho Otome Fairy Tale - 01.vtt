[TAMAHIKO] Pessimist: One who
is distressed about the world,

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.471 position:50% align:center
despondent about their life,

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:16.933 position:50% align:center
and single-mindedly
discouraged about the future.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
I have to say, that describes
people like me to a T.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
Although I was born into a
family of considerable means,

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.403 position:50% align:center
I grew up without a single
display of affection

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
from any of them.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
The coup de grace?
I was in an accident.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.996 position:50% align:center
That's when I lost everything.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
I lost my mother,
the use of my right hand,

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.170 position:50% align:center
and then, my father's respect.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:48.673 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised you would lose
the use of your dominant hand.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
Idiocy has no place
in this family.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
Get out of my sight,
you're done here.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] So I was sent to our
villa in the mountains of Chiba.

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] As though my
existence were a nuisance.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.652 position:50% align:center
It was decided I
should die alone.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:13.740 position:50% align:center
Yes, this is my final dwelling.

I see them ♪

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:36.513 position:50% align:center
♪ Tiny lights that twinkle so ♪

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:43.103 position:50% align:center

starry shadows ♪

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:57.534 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] After 17 years,
my life has come to an end.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
I see nothing. No bright light
to guide my way forward.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.584 position:50% align:center
There's nothing. Nothing.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:11.548 position:50% align:center
It would be so much easier
if I simply never woke up.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:17.012 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Begging your pardon!

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.431 position:50% align:center
Is anyone home?

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.395 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Who could that be?

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.606 position:50% align:center
Deep in these mountains
on a snowy night?

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.738 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.823 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Good evening.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
You're Mister Tamahiko,
is that right?

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.120 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you,
my name's Yuzuki.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.707 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad I found you.
I'm here to be your bride.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.709 position:50% align:center
Mrs. Tamahiko!

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.377 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

[gasps]

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Come to think of it,

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
my father did mention
something like that.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.360 position:50% align:center
Well, no one in the Shima family

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
will be able to care for
you after this debacle.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
You leave me no choice.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
I'm going to have to purchase
a bride for you at this point.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Typical of my father.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
It's quite likely this girl was
being sold to cover a debt.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50% align:center
Here. Don't catch a cold.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] But what sense
does it make to send a bride

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
to a dead man walking?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
Um.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
This room is yours.
Stay as long as you'd like.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
This is entirely pointless.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:32.040 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] And another day
begins without a wink of sleep.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center

Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

Good morning, Mister Tamahiko!
It's nice to see you up!

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
Such lovely weather
we're having today.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
Look at that--last night's snow
has already begun to melt.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Would you like
to wash your face?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
Let me help you!

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
I can do it myself, thanks!

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
But I know I can be useful
if you'll allow me

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
to take care of you.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO grunts]

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I don't know about this.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
Okay, you don't
have to do that!

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
Goodness, Mister Tamahiko!

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
You have such dark circles.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
Are you having trouble getting
a full night's rest?

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
No!

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
Not really, and besides,

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
it's none of your
concern anyway.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
Please leave me alone.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
I made some breakfast for you
if you feel like eating.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I'm not hungry.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
And every day'll be like this?

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
Did I scare you?
I'm just doing some cleaning.

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
I had so much fun
shopping in town today!

[TAMAHIKO]
She certainly is strong.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
Make sure you eat
all of it, 'kay?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
No.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI yelps]

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Mister Tamahiko!

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
I noticed these had a hole,
so I patched them up for you!

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
Ah! Those are my long johns!

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
So you just go around
mending men's underwear?

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
What? Your underwear?

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and it's a little
late to be scandalized.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I was all set to
slowly rot away in obscurity,

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
but I've been completely out
of sorts since she arrived.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
That girl has made
a mess of everything.

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
How unbelievably irritating.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
I don't even have time to get
lost in thought or... or...

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
I'm coming in!

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO yelps]

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'll rinse
your back for you!

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] No, please,
don't trouble yourself!

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
Oh, I insist!

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
It must be hard to do
with one hand!

[YUZUKI humming]

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
What is going on?

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
how her mind works!

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
Well, given her speech
and mannerisms,

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50% align:center
I'd say she was one of those
pampered-princess types.

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
An innocent girl with
limited experience.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
Well, must be nice to have
no real stress in your life.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.039 position:50% align:center
How dare you, sir!

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
I have plenty of things
to worry about.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.835 position:50% align:center
Two of them to be specific!

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Uh...

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
Really? Just two?

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
Um, yes.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
But you see,
both of them are very real

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
and important issues to me.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
That's right.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
I forgot she was sold
to pay off a debt.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
The unspeakable agony of
coming into the world.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
One of these worries...

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.487 position:50% align:center
...is the fact that
I have too much hair

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
and it's so thick and wavy.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I know it
looks wild and crazy,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
and it's way too fluffy!

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
I wish I had straight, shiny
hair, but nothing I try works!

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
All I can do is braid it back!

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
That's your stress? Your hair?

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Ah!

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:10.884 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I shared
my vulnerability with you!

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Uh. I'm sorry.

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:24.189 position:50% align:center
I was wondering what you might
look like when you laugh.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
I am so glad I was able to
make you smile tonight.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
And if it was
because of my hair,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
then I can learn to like it!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI giggles]

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] That's enough.
Leave me in peace!

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] She's seriously
on my last nerve.

You've got to try these, too.

[MACHIKO]
These are also yummy!

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
You sure it's okay?

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
I'm just worried it's annoying

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
that I'm always eating
everyone else's treats.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
You're not. It's fine.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
After all, whenever
you're on meal duty,

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
we always seem to wind up eating
way more than usual somehow!

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
It's a sin for a maiden
to eat even one bite more

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
than she wants to!

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll have to atone
for my sins, then, won't I?

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
Atta girl!

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
Yuzuki! I just fell down!

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
And look! My sleeve is
a torn-up mess now.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] That's awful!
I'll sew it up for you!

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
She's just like a mom.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
[SACHIKO, MACHIKO]
That's what I was thinking.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
It's perfect. Thanks, Yuzuki!

But why? This is
so sudden, Yuzuki!

I've been kind of embarrassed
to talk about it,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center

accumulated a lot of debt.

Yes.

Except, circumstances
being what they are,

And yet my life remains
exactly the same.

I can't fall asleep.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center

and keep you company
for a while?

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center

That girl is such a bother.

I wish she were just a maid

How do you not hate this?

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
Hate what, exactly?

Being chased into the mountains

and then given as a bride
to someone like me.

Of course, you do.

Be honest--why wouldn't
you hate it?

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
Marrying a pessimistic recluse
with no prospects and no future?

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center

It's very sweet and so warm.

sugar to boost its flavor.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
I want to be with you.

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
I want to see all
your different sides,

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
and I want to love them.

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Good night, Mister Tamahiko!

00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
What on earth?

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.203 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.496 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I can't sleep.

00:20:56.923 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
Another entirely
sleepless night.

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Good morning!

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Rise and shine, Mister Tamahiko!

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO grunts]

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
And of course, Happy New Year!

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
I've made us a
delicious breakfast.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
I hope I've prepared it
all to your liking.

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
What's this?

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
Hittsumi soup.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
Thought I'd make
something different

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:29.581 position:50% align:center
in case you're tired
of New Year's dishes.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
Be honest, do you like it?

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO gasps]

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
She really is an annoying girl.

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
She claims she wants
to love me, huh?

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.935 position:50% align:center
Um, may I have seconds please?

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.063 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I am a pessimist
who hates everything

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
this world has to offer!

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
Therefore, it's highly
unlikely...

00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:05.658 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Love Yuzu? Me? Seriously?

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:42.339 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I just... I want to
care for Mister Tamahiko.

00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:46.134 position:50% align:center
With genuine kindness,
and with all of my heart.

00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:48.261 position:50% align:center
I know if I do, then one day,

00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:51.890 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko will open
his heart to me, too.
