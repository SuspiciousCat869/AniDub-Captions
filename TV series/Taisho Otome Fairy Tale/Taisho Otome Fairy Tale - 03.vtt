[NARRATOR] Otome: A maiden
smelling sweet as a flower,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center
a single bud blooming
in a tranquil garden,

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
pure and dignified.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
Too shy to ever speak
of love or romance,

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
she dares not allow herself
to even dream of a kiss.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
Even so, she blooms again today.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
Seeking, ever pursuing
happiness beyond the stars.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.380 position:50% align:center
Don't you see this
is my home now?

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.965 position:50% align:center
You can't just drop on by!

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
Like I care about
imposing on a dead man.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.677 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.013 position:50% align:center
And who knows?

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I'll grow attached
and move here myself.

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.852 position:50% align:center
--[TAMAKO giggles]
--[VILLAGER B] Excuse me, miss?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:26.813 position:50% align:center
I believe we brought in
the last of your bags!

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.314 position:50% align:center
Ah, thank you very much.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.191 position:50% align:center
Here's something
for your trouble.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.610 position:50% align:center
Will ten yen suffice?

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:33.695 position:50% align:center
Is that not enough?

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.071 position:50% align:center
It's more than
enough, really!

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
We couldn't possibly
accept this!

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Of course you can!

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:39.826 position:50% align:center
You were a much-needed help

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
bringing them all the way
here from the station.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.371 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Uh?

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center
[ALL chuckle]

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
[ALL] Well, if you insist!
Thank you very much!

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.631 position:50% align:center
And I suppose you must
be his betrothed, yes?

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.
Hello, my name is Yuzuki.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Hmm...

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.513 position:50% align:center
So, Miss Yuzuki,

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
this must be a lot for someone
as young as you are to handle.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50% align:center
Exactly what year of primary
school are you currently in?

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50% align:center
Huh?! That's so rude!

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
Ahem.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
I would think it's clear
that I'm not a child

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.865 position:50% align:center
but a fine, upstanding adult
woman of 14 years.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
What? Fourteen years old?

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:24.496 position:50% align:center
How is that possible? You
certainly don't look like it!

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.705 position:50% align:center
The first thing
that gives you away

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
is these infantile
shoulder tucks,

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center
which no adult would
have on their kimono.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Uh! That's not true!

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
I have them because I'm
going to be taller someday.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
And when are you planning
on doing that?

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
Probably next year.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
I may be small now,
but just you wait!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be taller
than you by then!

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
Well, isn't that just special?

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO laughs]

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
Tamako, stop
embarrassing yourself

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
and show her some respect.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
She is your elder, after all.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
How?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.823 position:50% align:center
Tamahiko, she still has
her shoulder folds in.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
I can't respect someone who
is so much smaller than me

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
when I'm a full two years
younger than they are.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
She's 12 years old?

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO laughing]

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
As much as I want to,
I can't even argue with that.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Typical.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
My little sister
asserting herself

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
by carelessly tossing out words

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
that land like knives
in the heart.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
You know, you're
barely a teenager,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
so maybe you should let
go of this silly notion

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
that you're a fully
grown adult woman.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.149 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Um... Okay.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] That's a good girl!
Right answer!

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Evil. Pure evil.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
Here you go, Miss Tamako.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
Use this room as
long as you'd like.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
Too small. I can't
possibly stay in here.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI yelps]

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
I think this one will do.
It gets excellent sunlight.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:05.055 position:50% align:center
Then I'll bring your
things. One moment.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll be very
comfortable here.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
Gimme just a second to
air out the guest futon!

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
Are you getting hungry?
I made you a tea-sweet.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
Please try it if you'd like.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
The best thing about this room

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
is that it's right
next door to mine.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
So please let me know if
you need anything else.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
I don't!

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI humming]

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
I apologize. I never would've
guessed she'd show up.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:35.627 position:50% align:center
Please don't worry about it.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
The more, the merrier,
I always say.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
Did you say "merrier"?
You really are amazing.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center
Do you mean that?

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
I certainly do. Not everybody
can handle Tamako.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
Of the four of us,
she's the brightest sibling.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
The problem is, you never really
know what she's thinking.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
For the longest time,

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
she's also been isolated,
but in a different way.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
I thought attending girls'
school might've mellowed her,

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
but seeing her today,
I'm not so certain.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center
Maybe not, but she's
still your sister,

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
and because of that,
I'd like to be her friend.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I don't think that's possible.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
Oh! Hello, Miss Tamako!

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
I was about to head to your room

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
and ask if you'd
like to join us.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
Since tonight is your first
night and welcome party,

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
I'm really excited about dinner!

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Ridiculous.

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
Would you kindly stop acting so
childish? It's rather annoying.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI whines]

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
That's enough. Why exactly
did you come out here?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.567 position:50% align:center
It's not for a friendly visit.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
The rest of our family
considers me dead.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.197 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that's right!

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
You should've seen the
way Tamaki and Tamayo

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
were hamming it up for their
clueless marriage prospects.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
They are quite talented
entertainers.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
"If only our beloved baby
brother could've been here!"

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
And, "I would give my own life
to bring Tamahiko back!"

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center
They ate it up!

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
Father even conjured up
a tiny tear to wipe away. Ha!

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
It was hilarious!

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO giggles]

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.767 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI gasps]

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I would prefer
to dine alone.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
You may bring my dinner
to me in my room.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
I'll pass on sharing a table
with my dead brother.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
Then I guess it's just us.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
I think I'll have dinner
in my room tonight, too.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
It's better for
everyone this way.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center
Tamahiko despises me,
of that much I'm certain.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Mister Tamahiko, are you awake?

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
Are you hungry? What would
you like for breakfast?

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I have no appetite.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
You don't even wanna
eat something small?

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.231 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
This is just difficult.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
Tamako slapping me in
the face with reality.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
I thought I understood
before, but I was wrong.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center
I have an idea if
you're interested.

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
Since we're both up,
why don't we go for a walk?

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
There's something
I'm dying to show you.

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
C'mon, what do you say?

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
Uh... Um, actually, I--

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO groans]

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
As long as it's not too far.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
You ready? Let's go!

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
It's this way!

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
It's just a short climb
from where we are now.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
We're practically almost there!

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO groans]

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] What could
possibly be worth seeing

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
at the top of this mountain?

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] It'll all make sense
once we get there!

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
A river?

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] There's a spring
a little further up.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
The water tastes great!

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I had no idea.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
I've lived here for
so many months now.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
How did I miss such beautiful
scenery all around me?

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
Almost there! Please watch
your step on this last part!

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
Here we are!

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
It's a huge tree.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
So...

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.657 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI chuckles]

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
Get right up close and take
a look at what's inside!

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
Inside?

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
It's a little Inari statue!

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Did you ever
see anything cuter?

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
You hardly ever find
tree-hollow shrines anymore.

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's the guardian deity
of this mountain, you know?

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
It's so wonderful!
Like some kind of fairy tale!

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
A fairy tale, huh?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I have to say,
in this moment, I agree.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
The whole world feels
like a fairy tale.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
You were right. It did feel
good getting to see this.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Well, finally seeing
you smile feels good to me.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
I've been wanting to
share this with you.

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
I was just waiting for the right
moment to ask you to come.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you liked it!

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I must've had her worried.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
Given that all I do is
mope around the house.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Oh, right!
There's also the spring.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
It's over this way.

00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
It's so delicious and cold!

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
Go on and try it yourself,

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
then you'll see what
I'm talking about.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
Try this. Here ya go!

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
Uh, that's all right,
I'm not really that thirsty.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] How could I put
my mouth on her hands?

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50% align:center
It's delicious. Are you sure?

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
You're right. Uh?

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
That tickled a little bit.

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that!

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
It's fine!

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
So did you have a
good time out here?

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO grunts]

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
I did, too. I really
enjoyed myself.

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
I think we should come back
again sometime soon!

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:07.644 position:50% align:center
Wow, it's so beautiful!
Do you see it? Look!

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] It's official:
Spring is finally here!

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Just when I was
thinking the cold, dark winter

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
would last forever, suddenly,
a gust of wind came

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
and blew the darkness away,
replacing it with a clear sky.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
Yuzu... coming into my life
like a welcome spring storm.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Add 15<i>monme</i> of wheat
flour to 60 <i>monme</i> of sugar.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
Add two <i>go</i> of milk and mix well.

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.891 position:50% align:center
Okay, now reduce
heat to a low flame

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
and stir until it reaches
a glue-like consistency.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:54.232 position:50% align:center
What exactly are
you making there?

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Milk caramels.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.861 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
You don't honestly know how to
make those from scratch, do you?

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
I do!

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
It's so obvious you two
are brother and sister!

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Huh?

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Sometimes Mister
Tamahiko will stand right there

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
and watch me just like that.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
It was an accident!

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Now we pour it into
a shallow, buttered mold.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
They'll take about
an hour to firm up

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
and then we can eat them!

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
That seems like a pain.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I can't believe
you'd do all that

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
just to make my brother smile.

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
After all, weren't you sent here

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
against your will
to settle a debt?

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
Deep down inside,
I know you must hate it.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
You're wrong. I don't.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
Whenever I feel that I'd like
to do something for him,

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
my body just sort
of moves on its own.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
I enjoy seeing him smile!

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
You're a strange child.

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh? Am I really?

00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
Without question.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
Whoa...

00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
You made these all by yourself?
And you're giving them to me?

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:01.800 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Yes!

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
I thought you might like
a snack while you read.

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:08.098 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Huh. Thank you.
You shouldn't have.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
For one thing, I've never
had caramels before.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
What if I don't like them?

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
Then what a great
way to find out!

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
Ahh...

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Uh.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
How long are you gonna leave
your finger in my mouth?

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!
I didn't even notice!

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
Besides that, what do
you think? Is it good?

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
Wow, it's delicious.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.585 position:50% align:center
It even has a warm
taste somehow.

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Did I just say
candy had a "warm taste"?

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with me?

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
Then you can tell?

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center
I put a lot of heart into
every single piece!

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you like it.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
"Heart"?

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
Oh, give me a break.

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
Uh! I'm sorry. Would you
like to try one, too?

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
It does not have a warm taste!
It's just a wad of melted sugar!

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO sighs]

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.153 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] You're both idiots,
you know that?

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
You deserve each other.

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
Miss Tamako.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO crying]

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Father. It's Tamayo.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
She grabbed my book away from
me, and then it ripped and--

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
I don't have time
for this right now.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
You there. I need you to deal
with Tamako. Would you mind?

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE]
Oh! Of course, sir.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:51.117 position:50% align:center
All right then, Miss Tamako,
I am at your service.

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
How would you like to spend
the afternoon today?

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
It doesn't matter.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.748 position:50% align:center
No one will ever help me.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] There goes
the Shima family maypole.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] She's obnoxiously
tall, with an attitude to match.

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
Honestly though,

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
who would want
a bride like that?

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] Back home
at the girls' school,

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
everyone hates me.

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
Everyone.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
This room is right
next door to my own.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
So please let me know
if you need anything.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Yuzuki.

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
It's just thunder.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Miss Tamako?
What's wrong?

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
Nothing's wrong--why do you ask?
I just need to use the lavatory.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
Oh, goodness.
I'll let you go now.

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
I assume you know
where to find it?

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:03.732 position:50% align:center
No, I don't! I need you
to walk me there right now!

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center
Getting around this place
is so hard. It's dark!

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
And all the thunder
and lightning

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
certainly doesn't help, either.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
You're right, there's a lot
more of it than usual.

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
I wonder if it'll strike nearby.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.621 position:50% align:center
There it is!

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:21.416 position:50% align:center
That was a little
frightening, huh?

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI gasps]

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Miss Tamako,
please come with me.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO squeals]

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Quick! In the tub!

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
I'll get the fire going!

00:17:56.117 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI coughing]

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
How can she...?

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Wow, Miss Tamako,
your hair is so beautiful!

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
Like combing through
strands of silk.

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
You don't have to flatter me

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.306 position:50% align:center
to get me to stop crying.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.433 position:50% align:center
That's not what
I'm trying to do.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:24.896 position:50% align:center
You see, I have wavy hair,
so I appreciate yours.

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Such lies.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
No one really cares about
anyone else's feelings.

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
If someone's holding you back,
cut them off without mercy.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
Why would she be so nice
when I've done

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
and said such awful
things to her?

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO gasps]

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
It's okay to be afraid.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'll help if we
sleep here together.

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
I've never slept with anybody
else next to me before.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
Not even your family?

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
In my family, coddling
anyone was forbidden--

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.475 position:50% align:center
even when we were very little.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
I thought once I got
to girls' school,

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center
I'd finally make some friends,
but I was mistaken.

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
All they ever did
was gossip about me.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
I didn't see the point
in continuing.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
When I took time off school,
Father was furious.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
He asked me if I wanted
to end up like Tamahiko.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
After a while,

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stand being
at home, either,

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
so I came here.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry that happened.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
It must've been hard having
to go through all that alone.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
If depending on others
or asking for their help

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
only leads to pain,

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
then I'm better off staying
strong and living on my own.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
If it were me--I mean,
if I were your big sister,

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:53.860 position:50% align:center
I would never let
you feel insecure.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
I'd be there and you
wouldn't be lonely.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
I don't need your lies!

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
Who in their right mind
would want a little sister

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
with a giant body and
a giant attitude to match?

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
If you were my big sister,
you would hate it!

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
And you'd hate me!

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
That's silly!
Of course I wouldn't.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:16.257 position:50% align:center
It would make me very happy.

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
There's no way you
honestly mean it.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.805 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
I do! Rest easy knowing that.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center
And please try to
get some sleep.

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
You're all right, I promise.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
It's just a little
spring thunder,

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
letting us know the long
winter is finally over.

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
You sure?

♪ In the moonless sky
I see them ♪

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
♪ Tiny lights that
twinkle so ♪

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center
♪ There in those
starry shadows ♪

00:20:56.506 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] What is happening?
Am I dreaming?

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
Make sure you mix
everything in.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
I'm doing my best, Sis!

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
Though I'm not really sure
how helpful that is.

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
I've never tried making
almond macarons in my life!

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.482 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they'll come out
wonderful, don't worry!

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Thanks, Yuzu!

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] What happened
last night? Who cares?!

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.364 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
We did it!

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI, TAMAKO]
It's so good!

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI, TAMAKO giggle]

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I've never seen
Tamako look so animated.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Why are
you staring at me?

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
Would you like to try a
macaron, Mister Tamahiko?

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
He can't have any!

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.091 position:50% align:center
Uh. Uh...

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate it if you
wouldn't interrupt our moment!

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:45.805 position:50% align:center
Uh... I do not know
what's going on.

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] The spring
thunder visited last night

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
and brought a new season
for me as well.

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.201 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I still don't understand.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.754 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] It's going to be
another hot day today,

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:42.922 position:50% align:center
but I'll dive in and do my best.

00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.550 position:50% align:center
First I'll make breakfast,
then do the laundry,

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.303 position:50% align:center
maybe some dusting,
I'll clean the floors,

00:23:48.386 --> 00:23:51.056 position:50% align:center
and then who knows
what else after that?
