Will you stop calling me that?

" <i>Sensei</i> " is a title for
someone worthy of respect,

What are you doing out here?

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
It's too chilly to be
wearing just a kimono!

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
Thank you for being
so thoughtful.

00:10:55.739 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I'm sorry. I guess
I got lost in my own thoughts.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
About what?

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Well, um...

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Actually, today...

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.172 position:50% align:center
Today was my 15th birthday,

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
which means I'm old enough
to become your bride

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
instead of just your companion.

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, are you
positive about that?

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Today was
really your birthday?

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Wh-What? Why didn't you tell me?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.525 position:50% align:center
But that means,
last New Year's Eve...

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I'd be
happy to be your wife

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.698 position:50% align:center
whenever you feel like
you're ready to marry.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I'm sorry, but I can't.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
The only family I know is mine,

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
and they want nothing
more to do with me.

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
Which has kind of
made me bitter.

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:58.927 position:50% align:center
I've never been able to imagine

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
what a happy home
would feel like.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
You're way too good
for me, Yuzu.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
I mean, compared to you.

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:11.064 position:50% align:center
My right hand and I
are simply pathetic.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
I'm too much of a burden on you.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
Somebody like me is
better off being alone

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
for his entire
miserable existence.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
It's more fitting that
I should die quietly,

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:21.908 position:50% align:center
without anyone knowing,

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
and without causing
any more difficulties.

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
But that's not true--

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
I'm useless to you.

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
A man like me will never
be able to make you happy.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
But... I want to change.

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
I want to be open--to be able
to feel joy in any situation.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
I've actually been considering
going back to school.

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
I've written my father to ask
his permission to return,

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
so we'll see.

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
He hasn't replied so far.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
But I want to study the subjects
I'm supposed to be learning

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
so I can catch up.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
After that, I'll find
a proper career

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
where I can make use of my
skills, on my own terms.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Anyway, that's why I can't
get married right now.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
But someday...

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
No rush.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
Every day I spend together
with you is a happy one,

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
because you're so kind.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
I get to cook for you and see
the soft smile on your face

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.723 position:50% align:center
as you enjoy the meal.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
And I get to hold you
while you rest your head

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
in my lap and fall asleep.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
So I promise you,
nothing this past year

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
has been a hardship for me.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact, just being
by your side has made me

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
feel like the luckiest girl
in the whole world.

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
Married or not makes
no difference.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
All I want right now
is to be with you

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
in whatever way
you'll have me.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
But I want to know
what you want.

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
Yuzu...

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
What I want is...

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Oh, wow they're soft!

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
So completely soft!

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunting]

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
Hey, did you hear that?

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
I believe it was the
New Year's Eve bell!

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
That means we should get
going to sleep, right?

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:32.372 position:50% align:center
We wanna be fresh
for New Year's Day!

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a good idea!
Let's go to sleep!

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
[FUTOSHI]
Today was so fun, Rich-boy!

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN]
See ya later!

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Be careful getting home!

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
[RYOTARO]
Rich-boy.

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
Uh! What is it?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
I forgot to tell you.
I hope you're not mad I'm here.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
Look, Rich-boy,

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
I want to say thank you
for all you've done.

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hey, why so formal?

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you're saying
goodbye or something.

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
Because I am saying goodbye.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:16.791 position:50% align:center
[RYOTARO] You see, I'll be
starting a new job soon.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.835 position:50% align:center
I found this great
place in Tokyo

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
that I'm sure I'll love--
it's a big shop!

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.632 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
Well, see ya.

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center

Your bath is ready.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
It should be just the right
temperature for you now!

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Mister Tamahiko?

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
We've led such different lives.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
At his age, I never had to worry

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
about getting a job
to support my family.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
I tried to think of
something to say

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
that would comfort him,
but I couldn't do it.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
[banging]

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
Who could it possibly
be at this hour?

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
He's gone.

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
Ryotaro's not at our place
and I can't find him anywhere.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
You haven't seen him
around here, have you?

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
No, he isn't here.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
Let's split up and go look.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Ryotaro!

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Ryotaro, you out there?

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
[RYO] Ryotaro. He's the one
who protected me.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
No!

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
[RYOTARO]
Get away from my sister!

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
Don't do it, Sis, please!

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
It's not worth it!
You'll only be miserable!

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
[RYO] If anything
happens to my brother...

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
Ryotaro! Ryotaro!

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Mister Tamahiko! Over here!

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
What's he doing hiding in here?

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
Your sister's looking for you.
She's worried sick.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:53.907 position:50% align:center
Rich-boy, I-I, uh...

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.909 position:50% align:center
Maybe...

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
I'm not ready to go off
and work in the big city!

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.247 position:50% align:center
Ryotaro, I--

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
It's just-- If I do, that's
the end of my life as it is!

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able to come
back to my home again!

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
And I'll never see my sister and
brothers and father again, ever!

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
I would really hate that!

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] As ineffective
as I may be at most things...

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
All these hard questions
are so much easier to figure out

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
when you help us with them!

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I still want to
do whatever I can to help.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.984 position:50% align:center
Listen, it isn't that bad.

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
This is embarrassing,
since I've never had my own job,

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:34.989 position:50% align:center
but for as long
as I can remember,

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
my family's had lots
of live-in help.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
It's true they
always worked hard,

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
but we made sure they got time
off to visit their family.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
We once had someone
working for us

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
who invited their family to
Tokyo to show them around.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you
could get time off.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
That person and their family,
did they look happy to you?

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they most certainly did.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
And what's more than that,
they looked very proud.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness you're here!

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Ryotaro!

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, Sis!

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad nothing
happened to you!

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to worry
you like that.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
Do you really have to
be all over each other

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
right this second?

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
knocked him into me!

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
Ryotaro, look.

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
It's okay if you're not ready
to go work in the city yet.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
I don't want you to feel
like anyone's forcing you.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50% align:center
I'll go!

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
I'm not so worried anymore.
I think I'll be just fine.

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I'd better be
going now. My train's here.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
Take care of them, okay, Sis?

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
I'll miss you.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:56.571 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
[RYOTARO]
C'mon, guys, don't cry.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
Hi, Rich-boy!

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised to
see you two here.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy you came.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] We brought you some
caramels to eat on the train

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
if you get hungry.

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
Please write to us
if you need anything.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I will!

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sis? I promise I'm gonna
work as hard as I can!

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
And then I'll invite
you to visit Tokyo,

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
so all of you better come!

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
I want to show you
around the big city!

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50% align:center
We'll visit all kinds
of interesting shops

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
and eat at lots of
yummy restaurants!

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
Tell her, Rich-boy!

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
an amazing time.

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
Hey, I finally got you
to smile for real!

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:43.827 position:50% align:center
[RYOTARO chuckles]

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.622 position:50% align:center
You big baby. You
always make me smile.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
[RYOTARO] I want to say
thank you for everything.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
And I'll be back to
see you, Rich-boy.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
No. I mean, Sensei!

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
[STATION STAFF A]
The Ryogokubashi train

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
is about to leave!

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
Hey, make sure you practice your
arithmetic from time to time!

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
I will!

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN]
See ya later!

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
[RYO]
It's been hard on him.

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
He's never had our
father's attention.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
So you gave him something
he'd been missing.

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
Thank you for making him happy.

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.628 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
It was my pleasure.
I'm just glad that I could help.

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] As usual, I feel
unworthy of praise, and yet...

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hi, Mister Tamahiko!

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] In the same
way spring arrives

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
after a cold winter, I want
to change for the better.

00:21:57.317 --> 00:22:02.864 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] And someday, I'll be
a man who can keep you safe.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.545 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Mister Tamahiko
has begun studying

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:43.298 position:50% align:center
in preparation for his
return to school.

00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:47.761 position:50% align:center
I'm so proud of him,
and honored to be by his side.

00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:50.138 position:50% align:center
May he always be smiling,

00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:53.767 position:50% align:center
and may he have all
his desires in life.
