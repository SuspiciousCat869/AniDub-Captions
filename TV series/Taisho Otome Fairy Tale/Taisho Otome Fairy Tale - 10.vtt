[NARRATOR] Otome: A maiden
smelling sweet as a flower,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:17.392 position:50% align:center
a single bud blooming
in a tranquil garden,

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
pure and dignified.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
Too shy to ever speak
of love or romance,

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
she dares not allow herself
to even dream of a kiss.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
Even so, she blooms again today.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
Seeking, ever pursuing
happiness beyond the stars.

[TAMAHIKO]
Dear Uncle Tamasuke,

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
I hope this letter
finds you well.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.555 position:50% align:center
My high school is currently
on summer recess.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:22.475 position:50% align:center
The children still come to
study, no recess for them.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.436 position:50% align:center
And with my classmate
often visiting,

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.022 position:50% align:center
the house is livelier than ever.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.898 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you and Tamako
would love it.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.735 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll find time
to join us soon.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
Is that another
letter from Midori?

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.787 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.540 position:50% align:center
Whoa! That's impressive!

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
But how could you tell
from over there?

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
Because even from a distance,

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
I can see the way your
eyes sparkle with joy

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.090 position:50% align:center
whenever you read
one of her letters.

Huh?

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:00.680 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
Ah! Wait! Oh my goodness! What?

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:05.602 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI yelps]

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. I don't
know what to say!

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
Huh? What about?

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
Her letter!

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
Midori's getting married,
and she's going to have a baby!

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center
I feel like she may have
skipped a step or two!

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
It does seem incredibly sudden,

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
but I heard she started seeing
someone earlier this year.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50% align:center
What was his job again?

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
A journalist at a
newspaper or something.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
Wow. Interesting.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
I know she may be doing
things a little out of order,

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.633 position:50% align:center
but it's still wonderful news
and I'm happy for her!

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center
It's nice to hear your friend's
so excited about her future.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
Midori and I have
been super close

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
ever since we started
at the girls' school.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
We've seen each other
through everything.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
Good times and bad.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'll ever have
another friend like her.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
That was a once in
a lifetime gift.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center
Sounds nice.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] In her letter, she said
she's going to be moving

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
sometime soon to Kyushu,
where her partner is from.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
But she's still living
in Tokyo for now.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
And, um, she asked if I could
maybe come out to the city

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
to visit her before she moves.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.591 position:50% align:center
It could be the last time
we see each other, so...

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
So you should go see her.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
Uh. What's wrong?

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
But what about you?

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
Will you really be okay
if I go for a while?

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
Won't it be way too hard
for you to get dressed

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
and cook for yourself?

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
Yuzu. You want to
see her, don't you?

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
She's a special friend.
One that can't be replaced.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
So go be there for her.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Do it as a favor to her.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
I'm sure having you there will
give her some peace of mind

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
about moving to Kyushu.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
Not to mention the
strength she'll need

00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center
to get through childbirth.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
True, but still...

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
Go. I'm fine.
I'm not a child, you know.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
I think I can manage
to keep myself alive

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
for a day or two.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, I was
alone for a whole week

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
before you came along.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
I have an idea!

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I heard about this
place from my students--

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
they like to come
out here to play.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
It's a shrine dedicated to
a god of easy childbirth.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.541 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Wow, really?

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko?

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
Thanks for bringing me here!

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
We'll have to remember it when
we're expecting our own baby!

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hmm?!

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
Can-Can you wait here a moment?

00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Here you go.
Please give this to Midori.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
That's very kind of you.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
I know this'll be
a great help to her.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
Thank you. I will go.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to
give this to Midori

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
and cheer her on with wishes
for a healthy and happy baby!

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.252 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Please take care.
I'll be back soon.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
Have a safe journey, okay?

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
Thank you. I need
your honest opinion.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
Does this outfit
look strange on me?

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since I've worn it.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
I hardly recognized you!
In a good way!

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
You look so, uh... cute.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Oh, by the way,

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.451 position:50% align:center
you won't have to prepare your
meals on your own after all!

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
I've asked Miss Ryo
to come over and help.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
Wait, you did what?

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I considered cooking
them all in advance,

00:06:57.334 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
but food spoils so
quickly in the summer.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
Okay, but why her?

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
Because I couldn't stand
the thought of you

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
hurting for food
for even a moment.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
Though, to be honest,
she was surprised, too.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
[RYO] You want me to
cook for Tamahiko?

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:13.266 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Please.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.476 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
After all the twisted
things I did to you,

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
you're asking me for help?

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
That must be hard, knowing
just how much you hate me.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
I don't hate you!

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
Aww. Why not?

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.739 position:50% align:center
My parents say I used
to have an older sister.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
But I never got to meet her.

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
She became ill and died
before I was born.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.539 position:50% align:center
When I saw how kind you were
to your little brothers,

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.249 position:50% align:center
it made me think of her.

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50% align:center
I wondered what it would be
like if my big sister had lived.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.129 position:50% align:center
If we'd had the chance to meet,

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
would she have been as kind
to me as you are to them?

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
It was comforting to
imagine her that way.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
You're way too nice.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
But you did help when my brother
got lost, so I owe you for that.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much,
I appreciate it!

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.068 position:50% align:center
Though I can't promise
you that I won't go

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center

to full-fledged wife

What's wrong?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.046 position:50% align:center
I'll miss you.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
You've been looking forward
to this so much, though.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
To the trip, yes.
But not leaving you.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
I feel the same.
I'll miss you, too.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.851 position:50% align:center

Wait! What's the matter with me?

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.323 position:50% align:center
I can't be doing that
sort of thing in public!

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
I made a huge mistake!
I'm so sorry!

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
Please. Just forget
that ever happened!

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center

we'll-we'll have plenty
of time to do that.

[MIDORI]
Yuzuki, hey!

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
Midori, it's you!

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it!
You're really here!

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
Let me take a good
look at your face!

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've missed you
so much, Midori!

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center
Congratulations on everything.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Yuzuki.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
[MIDORI] I shouldn't have made
you come all the way to Tokyo.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
I should have been the one
to go see you in Chiba.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't hear of it!

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
Especially not in such
a delicate condition!

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
That's very thoughtful.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
Ah... I've made such
a mess, haven't I?

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
Getting pregnant before
getting married.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
My entire family let me know
how disappointed they were.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
The good news is,

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
he promised he would
do everything he can

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
to make sure me and
this baby are happy.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
He did a complete tour,

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
apologizing to my parents
and the rest of my relatives.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
He sounds like such
a wonderful man.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
Tell me about you, Yuzuki.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
Is that fiancée of yours
still treating you right?

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:15.342 position:50% align:center
Oh, I forgot. Here,
he asked me to give you this.

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] We visited a
shrine before I left

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
to pray for your easy labor.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's so sweet.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you've found
a good one, Yuzuki!

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
I'm very lucky.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.273 position:50% align:center
He's a smart man
with real integrity.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
I do have to keep an
eye on him sometimes,

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
but I kind of like doing that.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
[MIDORI] Well, here we are.
I hope you like it.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
It looks magnificent.
Is this where you live?

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
Yes, but my boyfriend's going
to be staying at the office,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.794 position:50% align:center
so it'll just be the
two of us tonight.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to put you both out!

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center

00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
[MIDORI]
Isn't it tiny?

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
It's fantastic. I love it!

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center

Oh, looks like there's
a lot of shops nearby, too.

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
[MIDORI]
Yes, it's very convenient.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Here ya go.
I made some beef stew.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center

Oh, wow!

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
It's just as delicious
as always!

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Ah! I can feel how
big it's getting already!

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since we've done this.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
It reminds me of the times
we'd have sleepovers

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
back in the dorms.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that was really fun.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you two haven't
gotten married by now.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko says
he can't quite yet.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
And he's not sure when.

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
But that's okay,
I don't mind waiting

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
until he feels like
the timing is perfect.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:21.384 position:50% align:center
I see. But what if he
never finds a perfect time?

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.845 position:50% align:center
I'm going to stay by
his side no matter what.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
Oh! But what if we wait so
long, we never have children?

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
That's right. You want
kids, don't you?

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do! I want lots of them!

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I'm relieved.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
I was all ready to drag
you with me to Kyushu

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
to get you away from a
miserable life with a man

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
you had no say in marrying.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
Huh? Do you really mean that?

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad it isn't necessary.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
[MIDORI]
What beautiful weather!

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
And after getting hit with all
that wind and rain this morning.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
I think that's normal for
early September, right?

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
Yuzuki, I'm so glad

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
I had the opportunity to see
for myself how happy you are.

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
I can get married
without any regrets

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
now that I know you'll be okay.

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
I'll be just fine.

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center

Goodness.

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.034 position:50% align:center
You and I shared so much
with each other, didn't we?

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
The men we hoped to meet,

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
what we dreamed our
marriages would be like,

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.624 position:50% align:center
the homelife we'd create.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
We certainly did.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
We still have the same
dreams we had back then,

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
but now those dreams are
evolving through our tomorrows,

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
as though we'd only
just created them.

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center
True.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
What's more, even if this is
the last time we see each other,

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
it feels wonderful knowing
you're living a life

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
that makes you happy.

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
I am!

friend is doing so well

her to go to Tokyo.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
Yuzu. Please come back soon.
I don't want to be alone.

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
[HARU meows]

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
[HARU meowing]

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
It's coming from Yuzu's room.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
[HARU meowing]

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Haru! You made it!

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Happy birthday!
I hope you have a great one.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
I made these for you this year
since you're always cold.

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
I thought you might like them.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
Even if you can't use them now,

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
I know they'll come in handy
in the coming seasons.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
It's a scarf and gloves,
the color of bellflowers.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center
With every row I would knit,

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
I thought about how
wonderful you'd look

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
wearing a scarf in this color.

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
So sweet.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.484 position:50% align:center
But why would she make
one for the right hand?

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
I wonder if she realizes

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
that hand doesn't even
feel the cold anymore.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
This may sound silly,

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
but I actually made one
for myself as well.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
I thought it might
be fun to match.

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
I can think of nothing better.
Can't you picture it?

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:30.003 position:50% align:center
Riding together on your bicycle,

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
wearing these scarves to protect
us from the piercing wind.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
I hope we can try it once
it gets a little colder.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
Yours, Yuzu. September 1st.

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
She can think of nothing better?

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
She's still a girl
of few wants, I see.

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
Matching scarves, though?
Sounds pretty embarrassing.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
We'd make quite a pair.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I was wondering
what you might look like

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
when you laugh.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
Delicious. It really does
have a warm taste.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I'm going to stay
by your side, no matter what.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
You're not going
to do this alone.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
As for me, I'll be just fine.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.180 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm not a
fragile little girl

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
like you seem to believe I am.

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
Right. You're the strong one.

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
An unstoppable spring storm.

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
You'd breeze right out
of a collapsed building,

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
extinguish any flames,

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
keep ne'er-do-wells away
with a strong headwind,

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
because you're tough.

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
Tougher than I'll ever be.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I realize I'm the worst.

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
I dive straight into
the old doom-and-gloom.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:50.709 position:50% align:center
All I could do my whole
life was give up

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
when things got too complicated.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
But I don't want
to give up on you.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I can't give up on you.

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
I'm determined to
make you happy.

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
And I want to be happy with you.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu, the truth is,

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
I know for certain
that I love you.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
That's the door I opened

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:32.292 position:50% align:center
to meet you for the first time.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] We'll come back here
together, to our home.

00:21:56.858 --> 00:22:00.320 position:50% align:center
Yuzu, I'm coming for you.

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
To Tokyo!

00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:41.796 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I'm here, Yuzu. In Tokyo.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.257 position:50% align:center
But where could you possibly be?

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:49.346 position:50% align:center
Wherever you are, believe me,
I will find and rescue you!

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:52.724 position:50% align:center
So please, Yuzu,
keep yourself safe.

00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:55.226 position:50% align:center
We'll go home together soon!
