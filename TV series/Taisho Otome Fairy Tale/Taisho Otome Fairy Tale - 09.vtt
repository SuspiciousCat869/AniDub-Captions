in a tranquil garden,

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center

Too shy to ever speak
of love or romance,

Even so, she blooms again today.

Huh?! Are you serious?

You see, there's
this girls' magazine

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.195 position:50% align:center

a column for.

Love and relationships.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.677 position:50% align:center

to support and celebrate

through those intense emotions.

Except I've never been in love.

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that make writing
the song a bit tricky?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
Exactly! So you can
see the problem!

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
You see, after Hakaru
told me your love story,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50% align:center
I knew that's what I
wanted to write about.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
So that's why I
came to meet you.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
What? Oh my goodness!
What do you mean "love story"?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
And unfortunately, I can't.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
But my music can comfort
them wherever they are!

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
I can transform myself
into a song that speaks

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
to what they're going through,

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center

I can be a friend to
a lonely lovesick girl,

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
I can make someone who's
crying smile again,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center

with low self-esteem.

I admit I was worried
about meeting him,

everything started to change.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
I thought, "It's gonna be okay.
There's something about him.

I know in my heart he'll
grow to cherish me."

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
I was so bewildered
by the feelings

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
that were bubbling
up inside of me.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
There was a tightness in
my chest I'd never felt.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
It was kinda like
the panic you get

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
when you're not sure about
a decision you made.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
But, um, without... the fear.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:02.185 position:50% align:center
When did it begin? I'm not sure.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
It happened every
time I saw him.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
Whenever I saw his integrity
or awkward kindness,

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
I'd get butterflies.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it became unbearable.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
I couldn't control
the feelings inside.

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:17.450 position:50% align:center
I didn't trust my heart

but what if--?

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
Was it love? Tell me!

Does it feel like you can't ever
stop thinking about him?

fun you have together?

just imagining being with him?

That doesn't mean
it's always easy.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center

you feel uncertain.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center

because you love him.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center

a little group reading

Uh, yeah.

But, anyway, I've actually had
something else on my mind.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
It feels like Shiratori
might be avoiding

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center
talking to Kotori
for some reason.

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I've noticed
that, too, I'm afraid.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
this even matters,

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.746 position:50% align:center
but Kotori told me it was Hakaru

But, um, I was wondering,

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
did you and Kotori have
some kind of falling out?

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
Uh.

No, not really.

the full story to understand.
