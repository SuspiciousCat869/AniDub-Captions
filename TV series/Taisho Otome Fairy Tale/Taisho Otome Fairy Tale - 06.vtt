WEBVTT

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.083
[RYO] Looks like I got
a bonus tonight!

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:16.166
Happy birthday!
May there be many more.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.291
[TAMAHIKO] She can have
anything in that wallet,

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:20.291
just not the bookmark!

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:25.125
Somebody else was
in here. A woman.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.291
Huh?

00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:02.667
It's her.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.959
[RYO'S FATHER]
Ah, Ryo! You're back!

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.291
[YAMATO]
Welcome home, Sis!

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:11.417
How'd it go?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.000
Didn't I tell ya'
the Shima place'd be

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:15.125
overflowing with cash?

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:16.458
Whatcha got for me?

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:17.709
[grunts]

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:20.291
Don't do this with them
standing right there!

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:23.917
Besides, this is for us
to make ends meet!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.417
Aw, c'mon, it's fine.
Good kids do as their dad says.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.250
Take it easy.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:29.750
[RYO]
Some dad you are!

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:31.959
Making your daughter
do this stuff,

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:36.166
especially while you spend
the whole day drinking!

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.125
--[slap]
--[gasps]

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.750
How dare you talk back to me!

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:44.625
Sister!

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.834
--[KEITA] You okay?
--[YAMATO] Big Sis!

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.125
This is all you were
able to nab from them?

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:52.000
How'd ya manage to
screw this up so badly?

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:53.250
Give that back!

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:56.000
The boys need that to eat!
It's not for you!

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:57.500
[RYO'S FATHER]
Shut up!

00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.792
[RYOTARO]
Daddy! Stop it!

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:01.083
[RYO'S FATHER grunts]

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:03.709
Be quiet!

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:06.417
I don't have the time
to deal with you.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.417
[RYO'S FATHER]
This is all your fault!

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.083
You little brats are so useless!

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.959
[TAMAHIKO]
I-I'm so ashamed.

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:22.458
[YUZUKI]
Welcome back!

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:25.709
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:28.250
I was starting to get
worried about you.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.291
Look, all better. I put
the caramels in a new jar!

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:35.333
And I picked up all the
broken glass as well!

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:40.709
I'm tired.

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:42.250
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:52.667
[TAMAHIKO]
So much for my birthday.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.166
Yuzu did her best to celebrate,
but just like every other year,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.875
nothing good ever comes of it.

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:15.917
Mister Tamahiko! Why don't
we go do something?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.959
I'd love to go visit
the Inari shrine again

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:19.333
if that sounds like fun!

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:22.667
[TAMAHIKO] Sorry, I already
have something planned.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.041
Oh. No problem at all, then.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.583
[TAMAHIKO]
Thanks for breakfast.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:29.750
Huh? Would you like some more?

00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:30.875
[TAMAHIKO]
I'm fine.

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:32.458
Huh?

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.333
[TAMAHIKO] I'll get that
bookmark back today,

00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:44.458
come hell or high water.

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:48.250
Although I do hope her
father's not around.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.375
I'm sorry to disturb you!

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:02.166
Huh? Is no one there?

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.083
[YAMATO laughs]

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:04.709
[YAMATO]
Look, Big Sis! Look!

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:06.000
[KEITA, YAMATO laughing]

00:05:06.083 --> 00:05:08.959
[RYO]
Hey! I told you to behave!

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:11.125
[KEITA]
It's like a water pistol!

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:15.583
[TAMAHIKO]
They're in good spirits.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:17.000
[KEITA]
Take that!

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.000
You play with us, too, Big Sis!

00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:20.125
[TAMAHIKO gasps]

00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:21.417
[RYO]
Huh?

00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:25.959
[TAMAHIKO stammering]

00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:28.667
Wh-What the heck are you
staring at, you jerk?

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.667
It was a total
accident, I swear!

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.333
I am so sorry. Really.

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:38.208
My intention wasn't
to peek on you.

00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:42.542
Plus, I'm nearsighted, so I
didn't see much of anything!

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:43.625
Hundred yen.

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:44.834
Wha--?

00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:47.417
You witnessed a fair maiden,
18 years of age,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.959
partaking in a bath.

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:52.333
I'm not asking much.
It's quite the bargain, even.

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:53.208
Pay up!

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.875
Uh. Look, maybe you forgot,

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:58.291
but you're the last one
who saw my wallet!

00:05:58.375 --> 00:05:59.667
[RYO]
Tch.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.709
Ah. I really messed up.

00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:05.291
Rumor has it you're a
gloomy rich-boy shut-in,

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:07.083
so I figured you'd just
cry yourself to sleep

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.500
over this whole thing.

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:11.083
[TAMAHIKO]
What is with her?

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:13.041
The way she talks combined
with that attitude

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.250
makes me think she's
a troublemaker.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.041
Am I dealing with a delinquent?

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:19.583
Well? What is it?

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm guessing you came here
looking for your money?

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:23.458
No, I didn't!

00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:24.625
Huh?

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:27.583
Actually, I want the
bookmark you stole!

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:29.417
I'd like it back, please!

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.750
I took what now?

00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:33.458
A bookmark decorated
with pressed bellflowers!

00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:36.333
It's a very precious item
to me, so that's why I--

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:37.959
[RYOTARO]
Big Sis!

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:44.375
Hey, I don't understand this.
Could you help me?

00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:47.792
[RYO]
Hmm... Let me see here.

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:49.291
Uh!

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:53.166
Sorry, Ryotaro. I'm honestly
not very good at arithmetic.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.834
Ah!

00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:57.125
[RYO chuckles]

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.375
But Rich-boy over here

00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.375
said he would be
happy to show you!

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:02.041
Huh?

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.583
Yeah!

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:07.000
He reads tons of books and knows
all about this kinda stuff.

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:10.000
Wow, great!
Thank you so much, mister!

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:13.041
Now, tell him! You'll gladly
help him out, right?

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:15.709
Huh?! So you do have it, then!

00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:17.458
You want this thing back?

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:20.208
Be a shame if something
happened to it, huh?

00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:22.125
[TAMAHIKO growls]

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.750
[TAMAHIKO]
I'll take a look.

00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:25.417
Here ya go!

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.625
That's what I like to hear.

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:30.291
Great job. Now, carry
that number here.

00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:33.208
[RYOTARO] Oh! That's how it's
done. I think I'm starting...

00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:34.834
[TAMAHIKO] How did I
get roped into teaching

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:38.041
all three of these children?

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.709
I suppose I don't have
much of a choice

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.041
if I want my bookmark back.

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:45.917
Hey. Why are you so obsessed
with this dumb thing anyway?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's from the girl who's
going to be my wife soon.

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:53.625
She made it. Said the flower
reminded her of me.

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:55.291
So it's one-of-a-kind.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:58.709
The sort of thing that
you could never replace.

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:08.208
Really?

00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:13.041
Hey, Rich-guy! Lookie here!
Do you see my paper?

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.208
Did I do okay on
this calligraphy?

00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:18.208
[RYOTARO] He's still going over
my math work right now!

00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:20.291
You can wait, Yamato and Keita!

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.417
[YAMATO, KEITA]
Aww...

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.125
It's no fair that
you get to go first!

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:28.083
You got an A+, huh?
That's fantastic!

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:30.000
You sure have a knack for this!

00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:32.583
You think so?

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:35.750
[TAMAHIKO] Beautiful
brushwork. Very legible.

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:39.959
Look at this!
Wanna see my picture?

00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:41.125
[KEITA]
Look at mine, too!

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.625
[RYOTARO]
I'm all finished with these!

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:43.917
Did I get 'em right?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Whoa! One at a time please!
Let's take turns!

00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.333
Good job, guys!

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:50.875
Isn't it nice having Rich-boy
look at your work?

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:51.917
[BOYS]
Yeah!

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.959
Ahem.

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:54.625
While I appreciate
the playfulness,

00:08:54.709 --> 00:08:57.041
I do have a proper
name, you know.

00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:59.291
It's Tamahiko Shima.

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:00.917
Tamahiko Rich-boy?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.625
[BOYS laughing]

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.709
Let's just go with that, huh?

00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:06.583
Yeah, thank you, Rich-boy!

00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:12.375
No! It's Tamahiko Shima!

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:15.083
All right.
Let's wrap it up here.

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.333
[BOYS]
Nighty-night!

00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:18.959
Thank you for helping
us out today, Sensei!

00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:22.291
Huh? They said <i>sensei</i> ?

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:25.291
You're good at teaching.
Nice, Tamahiko!

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:26.875
Just give me my bookmark!

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:29.500
[RYO'S FATHER]
Hey! I'm back!

00:09:29.583 --> 00:09:32.333
Dad? He's home already?

00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:35.166
Head out the back. If he finds
you here, he'll hurt you.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.875
[TAMAHIKO]
Yeah. Okay!

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:40.625
[RYO'S FATHER coughs]

00:09:40.709 --> 00:09:43.083
Wait, give me my bookmark!

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.208
I'll get it to you later!

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:51.000
[RYO'S FATHER]
Uh? Did we have a guest?

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:53.625
No, not really, sir.

00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:55.250
[sighs]

00:09:56.208 --> 00:10:00.000
[TAMAHIKO] All that work,
and I left empty-handed?

00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:02.500
I don't know how I'll
be able to face Yuzu.

00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:04.000
Darn it.

00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:06.959
[sighs]

00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:17.542
[YUZUKI]
Welcome home!

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:19.375
The bath is ready for you!

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:22.834
Oh! But maybe you'd
like to eat first?

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:24.375
Mister Tamahiko?

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.875
[TAMAHIKO] I can't take her
kindness, it's too much!

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.041
Huh?

00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:30.667
[TAMAHIKO]
Sorry, I'm utterly exhausted.

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:35.458
I'm just going to head straight
to bed again tonight.

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:55.125
[TAMAHIKO]
Couldn't sleep a wink.

00:10:56.542 --> 00:11:00.000
[YUZUKI]
Mister Tamahiko? It's morning!

00:11:00.083 --> 00:11:03.917
[TAMAHIKO] Should I just go back
to the way I used to be?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.083
No! I'll come clean to Yuzu.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:11.542
[RYO]
Good morning, Tamahiko! You up?

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:12.583
Huh?!

00:11:12.667 --> 00:11:13.583
[YUZUKI]
One moment!

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.000
I recognize that voice.

00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:18.709
[RYO, YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:20.458
[RYO]
Hey, Tamahiko!

00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:22.792
[YUZUKI]
Good morning.

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:27.375
Say, would this happen to be the
girl who was purchased for you?

00:11:27.458 --> 00:11:28.667
Come to think of it,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.083
I've seen this one around
the village before.

00:11:31.166 --> 00:11:35.000
I would've never guessed that
you prefer them so little.

00:11:35.083 --> 00:11:37.917
Hey! You need to watch
how you talk about her!

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.417
Yuzu is...

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.917
She's a sweet girl and far too
good for the likes of me.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.583
[gasps]

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.000
I see the appeal.

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:53.291
She makes the perfect little
homebody to look after

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:56.417
everything in the house
for you, doesn't she?

00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:01.709
[gasps] It's that same scent.

00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:04.000
Clearly, it's so you can
be out and about town

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:05.834
having fun with me,
your mistress.

00:12:05.917 --> 00:12:07.166
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.375
C'mon. 'Bout time you let
the cat out of the bag.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:12.000
Tell her how we were together
all day yesterday.

00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:13.667
I had a good reason for that.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.667
We shared an intimate moment
when you saw me naked, too!

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.375
I didn't do it on purpose!

00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:21.583
And what's more...

00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:23.875
...you gave me this bookmark,
don't you remember?

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:26.375
You said these flowers
remind you of me.

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:27.917
[gasps]

00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:32.542
I'm done listening to this!
That's enough of your lies!

00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:34.250
Give it back to me already!

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:37.834
Oh? If you want it so badly,
just make me your mistress

00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:39.375
and let me live the high life!

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:41.000
[TAMAHIKO]
Hand it over!

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.500
Yuzu, please don't
listen to this woman.

00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:55.333
Everything she says is a lie.

00:12:55.417 --> 00:12:57.208
She actually robbed me.

00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:59.125
I was keeping the
bookmark in my wallet,

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:01.709
so that's how she
wound up with it.

00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:08.333
[YUZUKI] It sounds like you
were involved in a situation

00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:10.834
that was beyond your control.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.542
I believe your story. Don't
worry, Mister Tamahiko.

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:22.542
[gasps]

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.250
Ah, what a shame.

00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:32.125
All done. Say no more.
We'll let this be the end of it.

00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:35.125
But, Yuzu!

00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:45.583
Yuzu.

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:47.125
Boo-hoo, tragic.

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:49.000
Your precious
treasure's in pieces.

00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:51.667
I almost feel guilty about it.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.375
She didn't have to go quite
that far if you ask me.

00:13:55.458 --> 00:14:00.333
[TAMAHIKO]
Leave. Leave.

00:14:00.417 --> 00:14:04.000
Please, just leave.

00:14:04.083 --> 00:14:08.625
If you insist. I'll see you
later then. Buh-bye.

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:12.667
[RYO chuckles]

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.375
[RYO] Well, that was
certainly amusing!

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:18.250
What is with that girl anyway?

00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:22.083
She seems way too happy for
someone who was bought.

00:14:22.166 --> 00:14:25.166
I suppose I should hurry
up and get back home.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.917
Bet those boys are
getting hungry.

00:14:44.458 --> 00:14:47.667
[YUZUKI]
Mister Tamahiko! I'm coming in!

00:14:48.792 --> 00:14:51.291
Just letting you know your
breakfast is ready now.

00:14:51.375 --> 00:14:53.333
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:54.792
[TAMAHIKO]
What?

00:14:54.875 --> 00:14:56.583
There's no hurry, of course,

00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:59.458
but maybe you'll want to
change your clothes first.

00:15:10.917 --> 00:15:15.875
[YUZUKI humming]

00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:21.542
[TAMAHIKO]
She really seems unbothered.

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:24.291
Is that all it took
to settle the matter?

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.041
[phone ringing]

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:28.583
[YUZUKI screams]

00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:30.375
W-Was that a telephone?

00:15:30.458 --> 00:15:32.625
[TAMAHIKO] Uh. There's
one in the storeroom.

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:34.875
Ah! I'll get it!

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:37.000
[TAMAHIKO]
Who could it be?

00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:40.500
Mister Tamahiko.
Miss Tamako is calling!

00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:42.792
Hm? I wonder why.

00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:47.417
[TAMAHIKO]
Um, hello?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.458
[TAMAKO]
What took you so long to answer?

00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:51.709
You shouldn't keep
your sister waiting!

00:15:51.792 --> 00:15:53.125
[TAMAHIKO]
Yikes!

00:15:53.208 --> 00:15:56.917
Right, my apologies.
How are things going?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.417
Kobe really is a lovely area.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.583
I've transferred into
a girls' school here,

00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:03.959
and I've made lots
of friends as well!

00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:06.625
I even hosted a tea
party recently!

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:09.041
That's wonderful!
I'm happy for you.

00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:10.375
Keep it up!

00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:11.917
And there's more!

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.333
We have baking parties where
we bond while making cookies!

00:16:14.417 --> 00:16:15.834
It's great!

00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:17.458
Next time I'm really looking
forward to teaching everyone

00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:19.959
how to make Yuzu's caramels
and almond macarons!

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:22.709
They're gonna love them,
I just know it!

00:16:22.792 --> 00:16:24.000
Uh.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:26.000
Wait! I totally got sidetracked.

00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:28.166
That wasn't the
reason I called you.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.750
[TAMAHIKO] Huh? Why is she
getting mad at me for that?

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:36.834
[TAMAHIKO] Sorry. What did
you have to tell me, then?

00:16:36.917 --> 00:16:42.417
Uh, happy birthday, Tamahiko.
I hope it was a nice one.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.834
Huh?

00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:48.125
I-I fully intended to call you
on your actual birthday,

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:49.667
but I was too embarrassed!

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.875
I mean, busy! That's it!

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:54.333
I was busy, so I'm
sorry I'm late!

00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:55.792
You're very kind.

00:16:55.875 --> 00:16:57.667
I'm fairly certain
Yuzu put together

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.917
a little celebration
for you, right?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.875
She did, but, um...

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:03.417
Hold on, did something happen?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.417
Wha--?

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.000
There's no use
hiding it from me!

00:17:06.083 --> 00:17:07.208
I could hear the disappointment

00:17:07.291 --> 00:17:09.458
in Yuzu's voice
when she answered.

00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:11.875
And besides, you don't sound
all that happy for someone

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:14.625
who just had a birthday
party thrown in his honor!

00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:17.875
All right.

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:19.750
So, there you go.

00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:22.959
It doesn't seem to be
bothering Yuzu, though.

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:25.125
I see.

00:17:25.208 --> 00:17:28.125
But tell me something:
Did you ever stop to wonder,

00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:31.792
out of all the things she could
have chosen, why bellflowers?

00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:37.291
Huh? They remind her
of me, or so she says.

00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:39.208
Have you heard of
flower language?

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:40.959
It's popular with schoolgirls.

00:17:41.041 --> 00:17:43.625
They sometimes use it
to express themselves.

00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:45.250
Flower language?

00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:46.208
[TAMAKO]
It's more emotional

00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:49.500
than just saying
things out loud.

00:17:49.583 --> 00:17:53.458
Bellflowers, for example,
mean "unchanging love."

00:17:53.542 --> 00:17:54.959
[gasps]

00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:58.333
[TAMAKO] It's a flower I'd give
to my own special someone.

00:17:58.417 --> 00:18:00.041
I bet that's Yuzu's meaning.

00:18:00.125 --> 00:18:01.875
She's most likely trying
to let you know

00:18:01.959 --> 00:18:03.250
that she would pledge
her love to you

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:04.875
for the rest of her life.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.583
Must be rough for it
to have been stolen,

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:10.959
and then to have to see it
in another woman's hands.

00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:13.125
It's completely heartbreaking,

00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:15.917
I can barely stand
to think about it.

00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:24.166
Um, hello? Are you still there?

00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:26.917
[gasps]

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:31.166
[TAMAHIKO] The bellflower
means "unchanging love"?

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.333
Expressing feelings
with flower language?

00:18:35.417 --> 00:18:39.250
Pledging her love forever?

00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:43.583
[TAMAHIKO]
Well, heck,

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:47.834
that's absolutely
something Yuzu would do.

00:18:47.917 --> 00:18:50.709
This bookmark, torn into shreds.

00:18:50.792 --> 00:18:54.333
[YUZUKI] Happy birthday!
May there be many more.

00:18:54.417 --> 00:18:56.875
[TAMAHIKO] I wonder
if the same could be said

00:18:56.959 --> 00:18:59.208
of Yuzu's own heart.

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.667
Dinner is ready.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.542
Would you like to come
and eat, Mister Tamahiko?

00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.625
Sorry, did you hear me?

00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:29.458
Oh my goodness.
He must have nodded off.

00:19:29.542 --> 00:19:31.917
He could catch a cold.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.458
Huh?

00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:43.041
I guess I fell asleep.

00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:45.625
[TAMAHIKO yelps]

00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:48.542
[YUZUKI] I'm a bit surprised
to see you still have that.

00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:50.583
You don't need to keep it,

00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:54.000
especially not in
that condition.

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:55.959
These are bellflowers,
aren't they?

00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:57.834
They symbolize
"unchanging love"!

00:19:57.917 --> 00:19:58.667
[gasps]

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.000
[TAMAHIKO]
If that's true,

00:20:00.083 --> 00:20:02.250
then it doesn't matter
what condition they're in!

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:04.667
The sentiment remains the same!

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.667
Um, to me, at least.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.834
Now, let's see.

00:20:17.333 --> 00:20:19.500
I'm so sorry!

00:20:19.583 --> 00:20:22.083
I feel just terrible
about what I did!

00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:23.834
Please forgive me!

00:20:23.917 --> 00:20:25.959
What are you apologizing for?

00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:28.125
You haven't done
anything wrong, Yuzu!

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:31.792
[YUZUKI] It's just, I wish you
would've told me right away

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:34.375
that the bookmark had
been stolen from you.

00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:36.083
I can see now that you
were worried about

00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:38.500
how it would make me feel.

00:20:38.583 --> 00:20:41.417
But when you stopped eating
your meals with me,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.625
I thought you were avoiding me,

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.917
or that I'd cooked
a dish you hated.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.709
I didn't know what
I had done wrong.

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:51.458
I was so incredibly
lonely and terrified

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:53.458
that I had messed something up.

00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:58.000
[TAMAHIKO]
Oh, what a fool I am.

00:20:58.083 --> 00:21:01.500
Forgive me. I really am sorry.

00:21:01.583 --> 00:21:03.291
[YUZUKI]
It's all right.

00:21:03.375 --> 00:21:06.917
But no more taking on everything
all by yourself, okay?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.083
Honestly, what I find
most unforgiveable

00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:11.625
is you getting friendly with
such a beautiful woman.

00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:12.834
Uh.

00:21:12.917 --> 00:21:16.000
I mean, you have me,
Mister Tamahiko,

00:21:16.083 --> 00:21:18.291
you big old stinker.

00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:23.458
You're just plain awful!
The absolute worst!

00:21:23.542 --> 00:21:26.333
My apologies, again.
I'm sorry, Yuzu.

00:21:26.417 --> 00:21:27.583
[YUZUKI]
And after I cooked up....

00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:29.333
[TAMAHIKO] I sat there
and let Yuzu pummel me

00:21:29.417 --> 00:21:32.875
until she finally got the
frustration out of her system.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.041
[TAMAHIKO]
And then...

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:40.250
[TAMAHIKO]
It's finished!

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:43.500
Well? What do you think?

00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:46.959
Oh my gosh! It really
came out wonderfully!

00:21:48.792 --> 00:21:52.041
There's glue, but it also
has your scent on it.

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:53.375
Huh?

00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:56.625
[YUZUKI]
Did you know, Mister Tamahiko?

00:21:56.709 --> 00:21:58.750
Bellflowers have
another meaning,

00:21:58.834 --> 00:22:01.875
they represent "integrity."

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:06.500
And if you ask me, that fits
your character to a T.

00:23:39.792 --> 00:23:41.542
[YUZUKI] Mister Tamahiko
has begun helping

00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.875
the village children
with their schoolwork!

00:23:43.959 --> 00:23:47.375
Our home has suddenly
become so lively!

00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:51.291
Do your very best,
Mister Tamahiko!
