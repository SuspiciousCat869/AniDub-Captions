[NARRATOR] Otome: A maiden
smelling sweet as a flower,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:17.392 position:50% align:center
a single bud blooming
in a tranquil garden,

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
pure and dignified.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
Too shy to ever speak
of love or romance,

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
she dares not allow herself
to even dream of a kiss.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
Even so, she blooms again today.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
Seeking, ever pursuing
happiness beyond the stars.

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hmm...

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.344 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I've
already finished

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:19.347 position:50% align:center
every single book
I brought with me.

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.393 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
A textbook.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.061 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I miss school.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.856 position:50% align:center
Coming from the
notorious Shima family,

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.608 position:50% align:center
I was never surrounded
by friends.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:34.362 position:50% align:center
But that certainly didn't affect
my passion for learning.

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:38.491 position:50% align:center
No matter. It's all
in the past now.

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:44.414 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
Be honest, tell me
what you think!

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.923 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to say--
you look stunning!

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.009 position:50% align:center
Kotori would be proud.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see
how it looks on you!

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Oh, no,
I could never do it justice.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Don't be silly.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.559 position:50% align:center
Just sit still and
I'll tie it up for you.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:11.900 position:50% align:center
See? I told you.
This always happens.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
I can't get over how adorable
and fluffy it is! Wow!

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
It's so soft and bouncy!
And look at that healthy shine!

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
Um. It sure is lively
in here, isn't it?

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
Oh. This must be Kotori Shi--

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
What are you doing in here?

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
Don't you know it's
a crime for you

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
to peek inside a
maiden's bedroom?

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I'm sorry!
I didn't know, I promise!

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! I better get started
on the housework.

Hard at work, I see.

[TAMAHIKO]
It's been more than half a year

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
since Yuzuki and I
started living together.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
I want to be with you.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
I want to see all your
different sides.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
And I want to love them.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.015 position:50% align:center
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] She sounded sincere,
but I wonder...

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Hm?

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Who cares?

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
What difference does it make
if she likes me or not? None!

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
Oh. Some nice cold barley
tea will help you cool off.

[TAMAHIKO gasps]

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center
Yuzu, hey! Are you all right?

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
I'm sorry. I'm a little dizzy.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.836 position:50% align:center
Huh? I didn't mean
to fall here! Ah!

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Don't force yourself.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
I don't mind you leaning
on me for a bit,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
if it doesn't bother you.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
What about your
right hand, though?

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
There's a lot I can't do.
This much I can, at least.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly mean that?

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess it's
okay for a while.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I am a rock. I am a rock.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.786 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your help,
Mister Tamahiko.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
I feel so much better now.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
Be right back. I'm going to
get you that barley tea.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Is she just saying
she's okay for my sake?

What do I do now?

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] I swear, I have the
noisiest brother in the entire--

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with Yuzu?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
Uh! I need help.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
Stay with us, Sis!

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
She's burning up.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
She doesn't look well.
We have to get her to bed.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
Wait. Let me carry her!

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
With one hand?

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly think
you could manage that

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center
without dropping her?

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO gasps]

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.296 position:50% align:center
My room's a lot closer,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
why don't we get her
set up in here for now?

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.468 position:50% align:center
And my futon's still out.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
Are you certain that it's
clean enough for her?

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it is--
Yuzu cleans it every day.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
Her belt's in the way.
We'd better take her kimono off.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.652 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, "okay"?
Turn around this instant!

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Sorry!

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
There we go.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
Is Mister Tamahiko here?
I smell him.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
Can you hear me?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
Yuzu!

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko? Are you hungry?

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50% align:center
I made soup. I left it there
on the fire for you.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
I put lots of wild
herbs and veggies.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
There's plenty for you,
too, Miss Tamako.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
Please, just try to rest.

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:16.978 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
The pickles...

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.897 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Is she losing her mind?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
How is she trying to coordinate
lunch in her condition?

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
I'm going down to the village
to bring back a doctor.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
Do you know where
I could find one?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
Me? Well, um, unfortunately not.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
I'll ask around
until I find one.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
Wait! I'll go with you!

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
I just need you to stay here
and keep Yuzu's forehead cool.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
That doesn't require
more than one hand.

[groans]

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Tamako's thinking
more rationally than I am

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
at the moment.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
She knows I'm uncomfortable
with strangers

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
and there's no way to find a
doctor without talking to them.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
But that's fine.
Yuzu needs me here, anyway.

[grumbles]

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll do it. Thanks.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
May she get well soon.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] Thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate your help.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
Oh, um. Thank you.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
For coming here all
this way. Both of you.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50% align:center
Thank you! Please. This is for
the examination and medicine.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center
It's true what they say
about the Shima family:

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
You've got attitudes
to match your height.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
I don't know what you get
out of paying for services

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
just to mock them.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
If you cared for that girl,
you would know she's overworked.

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
All of this exhaustion
was wearing her down,

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
and she couldn't bear this heat.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center
You must've been
running her ragged

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
from morning till night
for this to have happened.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
You can't forget that
servants are people.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
She's not a servant. Yuzu's--

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
She was bought, wasn't she?

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
I heard all about it.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50% align:center
That poor dear.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
Taken from her family in
exchange for an unpaid debt.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
I can't believe they'd
force a young girl

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
to live out here alone
with a grown man.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
People are quite angry

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
with your little sister, too.

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
Treating everyone like
a Shima family servant.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
Thinking they won't care

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
as long as she's paying
for their misery.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
how rich you are!

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
Money cannot fix everything.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center
Just like that right
hand of yours.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
I suggest you be very careful,

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
or this could all
blow up in your face.

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] That'll be all, Doctor.
Thanks for coming out.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Please allow me to walk
you to the door.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
Tamako, please.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
So what if members
of the Shima family

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
are a little taller
than average?

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
I was having a hard
time at the station.

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
Some villagers noticed and
offered to bring me here.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:08.293 position:50% align:center
I thanked them for
their kindness.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
Yuzu is not a servant
in this house

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
and there's nothing shameful
going on between you two.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I know.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
If you knew all this,

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
then why didn't you say
anything to that doctor?

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's the matter?

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.810 position:50% align:center
He said... He said
Yuzu was overworked,

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
and it's my fault for
not noticing that.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
I've been a monster.

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
You're not the monster, I am.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who barged
in out of nowhere.

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
So it's my turn to
look after her now.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:42.786 position:50% align:center
Tamako, wait!

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO gasps]

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
Be careful. She's still weak.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
I know she is!
I don't need advice from you.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I'm thankful Tamako
happened to be here today.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
I don't know what I would've
done without her.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Poor Yuzu...
Taken from her family so young

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
and sold to my father.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
Someone as good as her
deserves to find happiness.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
But the longer
she stays with me,

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50% align:center
the more time that's lost.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] One day, we could
be past the point of no return.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
Be very careful,

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
this could all blow
up in your face.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
Good evening, dear Yuzu!

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
I've come to give you
a nice warm sponge bath

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
and help you get changed
for the night!

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's going on?

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Oh! I'm sorry.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.020 position:50% align:center
I've already gotten
changed, but thank you.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
Huh?! When did this happen?

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
No! You're not supposed
to be overdoing things!

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
I promise, I feel fine!

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
But what about Mister Tamahiko?

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen him
in quite a while now.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
I wonder how he's getting on.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
Has he eaten his dinner yet?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
Or taken a bath,
or brushed his teeth?

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
Be honest, Yuzu.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.249 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
Are you truly happy living
with that brother of mine?

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
He'll always be completely
useless at times like these.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
You deserve to marry
someone better than him.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
I can't marry anyone else!

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
If I do, then Mister Tamahiko

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
will end up all alone
out here again!

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
Some years back, I had a friend

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
whose mother mistreated
her so badly

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
she became incredibly
depressed.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
I remember her saying things
like, "I wish I were dead,"

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center
and "I'm so unhappy,

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
I need to find a
way to disappear."

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
That sounds exactly
like my brother.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
I desperately wanted
to help this girl,

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
so I asked my mother
for her advice.

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh? Why's she so sad, Momma?

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me how to
make her smile again?

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
Listen, once someone has
locked their heart away,

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:03.426 position:50% align:center
it's very difficult to get them
to wanna open it back up.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
When it's locked,
it's protected,

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:07.597 position:50% align:center
and she's afraid
that it will break.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
I won't let it break! I promise!

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
But I have to find some
way to cheer her back up.

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case, all you
can do is stay by her side.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
Believe that time will heal her.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.529 position:50% align:center
Her path may not always
be a straightforward one,

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
but she'll keep on learning
as she goes along.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
And then she'll look
for happiness again.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
One day, having a consistent
friend in her corner

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:34.874 position:50% align:center
will reassure her that
it's okay to change.

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
No matter how long it takes,

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
always be the one who
never stops believing.

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
Stay by her side and
show her you're there

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
when she needs you.

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
And so, I'll stay by his
side and believe in him.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
I know that one day Mister
Tamahiko will want to be happy

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
and I want to show him
it's okay to change.

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
You've given this
a lot of thought.

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
You really do care
about Tamahiko

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50% align:center
a great deal, don't you?

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
Of course, I do.

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
After all, he's going to be

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
my beloved husband
one day, remember?

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
Ah! "Husband"? What am I saying?

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
I didn't think about it
until I said it out loud!

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:14.539 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
You need to lay down, Yuzu!

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:17.500 position:50% align:center
Your fever appears
to be spiking again!

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
Whenever I feel that I'd like
to do something for him,

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:33.224 position:50% align:center
my body just sort
of moves on its own.

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:34.434 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
It's like my body moved
all on its own. Wow.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
Yuzu. I wonder if
she's all right yet...

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
You don't need to do
anything, Brother.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of her.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Yuzu? Are you feeling
any better now?

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.139 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.105 position:50% align:center
Uh! Yuzu!

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
Is that blood?

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
I can't breathe.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
What's this?

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
I can't. My breathing hurts.

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
Miss Tamako,
help me take this off.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
It's too tight, please.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
So you just skinned your hand
trying to take off the bandages.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank goodness.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you weren't
coughing up blood.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Please, take it off.

00:16:56.725 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Tamako, where are you?!
I need your help right now!

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll have to do it.

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
Huh? What the heck?

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
It's on so tight,
it's squeezing her ribs!

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
No wonder she can't breathe!

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
I need to find a way to
take that thing off of you.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me, Yuzu.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
I'm saving a life.
I'm just saving a life.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO gasps]

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
That feels so much better.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:57.869 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Miss Tam-- Ah!
I'm so sorry, Mister Tamahiko!

00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean for you to see
such a disgraceful sight!

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
Um, the size of my
chest is something

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
that I've struggled to
accept for a while now.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
When I started going
to the girls' school,

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
I was so embarrassed,

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
I wore a bandage
every day to hide it.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:14.844 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I wonder if this is the second

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
of her two worries
she mentioned.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
It's so unfair!

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
I never get any taller, but
these keep getting bigger--

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
like they're parasites absorbing
all my body's nutrition!

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
They don't fit in a kimono.
They make me look fat.

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
My shoulders ache, and the
bandages are unbearable!

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I'm sorry!

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
I'm just... I'm the worst
possible man for you.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
I make you sick and then can't
even care for you properly.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
When I finally
think I'm helping,

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
I wind up embarrassing you.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
Everything keeps backfiring.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
I can't...

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
There's a lot I can't do.
This much I can, at least.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
But I failed.
I can't even help you.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
Before I do something to you
that I can never take back,

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
I think it might be best for us
to break off this relationship.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
I'll tell my father I can get
by fine without a caretaker.

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
I'm sure your family has
been missing you a lot.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:18.158 position:50% align:center
You need to go
back home to them.

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
I know it was only a short time,
but I'm grateful to you.

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
I want... I want you
to be happy. Please.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
I'm not leaving you alone.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
I'm going to stay by your
side, no matter what.

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
You're not doing this alone.

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
As for me, I'll be just fine.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm not a
fragile little girl

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.647 position:50% align:center
like you seem to believe I am.

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Yuzu is... so strong.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
Much stronger than,
well, than me.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Good morning, Mister Tamahiko!

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
How are you today?

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
Were you able to get
a good night's sleep?

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Yuzu! What are
you doing up and about?

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] I'm fine!
In fact, I'm good as new.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
I always did have a
strong, healthy body!

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
You should rest at
least one more day!

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
Just to be on the safe side--
so I know you're all better!

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
Thank you for thinking of me.

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
But really, I promise you,
I'm as fit as a fiddle.

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
Now take a good sniff and tell
me what you smell cooking!

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
Ah! <i>Hittsumi</i> !

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
They're nice and fresh, too!

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
And Miss Tamako made some rice
balls to go with it. So good!

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
Come on. Hurry up!

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
I know you're gonna love it.

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
In that moment,

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
my heart was caught
in a squeezing grip

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
and something shot through
my brain like lightning...

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:06.891 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I want to make Yuzu happy.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:12.063 position:50% align:center
Me. I want to be the
man who can do that.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] And where are these
thoughts coming from anyway?

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center
I mean, how presumptuous of me.
What could <i>I</i> do?

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
Lately I keep forgetting
that I'm a pessimist.

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:32.500 position:50% align:center
I've really got to remind
myself who I am

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
and who I was born to be.

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
This is getting out of hand.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
I am a pessimist,
I am a pessimist,

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
I am a pessimist,
I am a pessimist.

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
Ahem. Yuzuki and Tamahiko,
please listen.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
I have something
to tell you both.

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
Why are you being so
formal all of a sudden?

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
Because I've decided I'll be
returning home tomorrow.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:21:56.775 --> 00:22:00.403 position:50% align:center
Also, I'm thinking of pursuing
a career as a doctor.

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO, YUZUKI]
Huh.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.115 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:41.629 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Miss Tamako and I may
not have grown up together,

00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:44.924 position:50% align:center
but she is as precious to me
as a real little sister.

00:23:45.008 --> 00:23:46.676 position:50% align:center
From the bottom of my heart,

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.846 position:50% align:center
I want her to know that she
has my support at all times,

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:52.515 position:50% align:center
and I'll always be by her side.
