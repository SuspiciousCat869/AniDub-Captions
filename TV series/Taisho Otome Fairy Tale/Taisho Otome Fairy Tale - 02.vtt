[NARRATOR] Otome: A maiden
smelling sweet as a flower,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:17.392 position:50% align:center
a single bud blooming
in a tranquil garden,

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
pure and dignified.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
Too shy to ever speak
of love or romance,

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
she dares not allow herself
to even dream of a kiss.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.489 position:50% align:center
Even so, she blooms again today.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:36.161 position:50% align:center
Seeking, ever pursuing
happiness beyond the stars.

Please close your eyes,
Mister Tamahiko!

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
Don't look at me!

I wasn't looking!

[YUZUKI]
I'm so sorry about earlier!

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.784 position:50% align:center
That was terribly
disgraceful of me.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:43.580 position:50% align:center
Well, I assure you, I didn't
see anything upon entering.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
I'm nearsighted in both eyes

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
and the room was
extremely steamy.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.587 position:50% align:center
It was all rather hazy.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
Right, thank goodness
for that. I'm so relieved.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.761 position:50% align:center
Here. I've deboned
a delicious fish for you.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center

Hold still please,
you have rice on your face.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] I know she'll
be my bride someday,

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:24.871 position:50% align:center
but it feels strange having such
a young girl looking after me.

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
And besides, I am a pessimist

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
who hates everything
this world has to offer!

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
[MAILMAN A]
Good morning!

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:36.633 position:50% align:center
Special delivery
for Tamahiko Shima.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's me.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
Do you know who sent it to you?

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.640 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
My father.

[TAMAHIKO]
"Hello, Son.

Tamaki and Tamayo have
received offers of marriage.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
But if the other families
were to learn of you"...

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
[TAMAYOSHI] ...that there
is a younger brother

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
who lost use of his
right hand, quit school,

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
and is now living
in the mountains,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
it would bring shame
on the Shima family.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
This embarrassment could
destroy their matches.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.205 position:50% align:center
In order to protect
these fine marriages,

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
I, as the Shima family head,

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
have reported that you died
in the accident instead.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
Consider your upholding
this the sole act

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
of familial duty you are
capable of carrying out.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Mister Tamahiko,
dinner is ready.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
I hope you're hungry!

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
I've made <i>hittsumi</i>
dumpling soup.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
From what I recall,
you like that, don't you?

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko? Are you okay?

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
Please answer me!

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
I need to be left
alone, please.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
I'm worried about you.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
You didn't eat anything
for lunch today either.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
I said, just leave me alone!

[YUZUKI]
Mister Tamahiko. Excuse me.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to overstep, but
your health is going to decline

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
if you don't eat something.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center

it makes for such a

I wish I were dead.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
Why would you say that?

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
Because it's true.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
I should just put an end
to it all right now.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
It's what they want.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
My father and siblings,
I'm a disgrace to them.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I would
be relieved to go.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
You'd better lie back
down and get some rest.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
I could even free you
of your obligations here.

[TAMAHIKO laughs]

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50% align:center
It's funny, thinking about
all the people whose lives

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
would improve by the
simple act of me dying.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
It's not like anyone
cares about me,

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
so they probably wouldn't
notice right away.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:53.014 position:50% align:center

I need a plan.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
How would I actually
go about doing this?

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
Hanging would be easy,
or drowning. Maybe poison?

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:09.656 position:50% align:center
A resentful death that curses
the world I escaped from.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
That'd be right up my alley.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50% align:center
Why are you saying
all this to me?

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
It's not funny!
Please stop laughing!

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
I can't help it. I have to.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:26.339 position:50% align:center
I won't survive if
I don't laugh about it.

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
My father declared me dead.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center

for everyone if I'm not alive.

I mean... I just can't.

If the words make you cry,

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
then there's no reason
to try to speak.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
Don't say them aloud.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:49.654 position:50% align:center
If it hurt to hear those things,
why tell them to yourself again?

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
Or to someone else so that they
might use them against you?

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Uh, I, um...

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center

Why did I come here, exactly?

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
I didn't think I would ever
leave the house again.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
Sure is nice to get
out once in a while!

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Ugh. That brings
back bad memories.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI giggles]

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Seeing it all makes me dizzy!

00:11:57.926 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
Wow! Thanks for
bringing me here!

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
However, I have to make amends.

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's go.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI gasps]

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
Wow. Wow. Wow!

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
It's like a dream come true!

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
All these choices, and
that's just for the collars!

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:48.685 position:50% align:center
Ah! So much fabric!

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
Just like an excited child.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to help if you'd
like to take a closer look

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
at one of our beautiful fabrics.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:01.156 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko? Are you sure?

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
Please don't feel obligated
to buy anything for me.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
Yours was ruined.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
It's my fault, and I
want to make it right.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
Thank you! That's so generous!

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
I guess if you insist, I don't
mind taking you up on it!

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.378 position:50% align:center
Is there something specific...

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I can't imagine having

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
only the clothes on
your back to wear.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
It's too pitiful.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Mister Tamahiko!

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50% align:center
Which one of these
do you prefer?

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
I'm immediately drawn
to the lighter pink one.

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
Hmm. But that lavender is
very attractive as well.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
Agreed! They're
both so wonderful.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
Gee. What a tough
decision to make.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we should buy them both.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
What?!

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
No! We can't do that!

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
I already feel so guilty

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
that you're buying me
anything at all!

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] This one's 12 yen,
and that one's 10.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
Ah! It figures they'd be
shockingly expensive, too!

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
It's all right.
I do have money.

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
Miss, we'll take both
of them, please.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
[SALESWOMAN A] Of course.
Excellent choice, sir.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI sighs]

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much!

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.070 position:50% align:center
I'm so grateful for
your thoughtfulness.

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.572 position:50% align:center
I've never owned such
fine fabric before.

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
If a seventh heaven exists,
I believe I'm in it now!

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
How is she this happy?

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Um, I apologize.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:38.670 position:50% align:center
It wasn't intentional,

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
but I ruined one of the only
possessions you had.

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:43.550 position:50% align:center
I was wondering if it held

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
any sort of sentimental
meaning for you?

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.848 position:50% align:center
I hadn't thought
about it, but maybe.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
I mean, it was
the very first one

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.476 position:50% align:center
I'd ever sewn when I was little.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.896 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Ah! I knew it! I'm a monster!

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.274 position:50% align:center
Whether I meant to do it or not!

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
No new kimono can ever
replace her first one.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
But it's okay.

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
This amazing fabric
you bought for me

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:12.704 position:50% align:center
is all I can think about now,
and I can't wait to use it!

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:16.791 position:50% align:center
Because one day, this will
become the first kimono

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center
my lover ever bought for me,
and the first piece of clothing

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
that my beloved
husband ever gifted me.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
It'll be a treasure,

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
one that grows even more dear
to me as the years go by.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.847 position:50% align:center
And who knows, maybe I'll
give it to a daughter

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.432 position:50% align:center
or granddaughter someday.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.434 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO grunts]

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:36.644 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
I can't believe she said that.

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
How is it possible she's
not even blushing?

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
Now I'm sorry I ever
brought it up.

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
What is her problem? Ugh.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
Oh, who cares?

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
So, um, I'm going to make one
outstanding kimono with this!

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center
Aww. It's just so adorable.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:58.500 position:50% align:center
It reminds me of something
Kotori Shiratori would wear.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
Shiratori?

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
You mean you haven't
heard of her before?

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.298 position:50% align:center
She's an excellent
musician and singer.

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
She's cute, plays all
sorts of instruments,

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
and her voice is one of the most
beautiful I've ever heard!

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
She was unbelievably popular
at the girls' school.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI humming]

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
Mister Tamahiko, look!
It's a real escalator!

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center
We have to ride!

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center

Oh, wow! It's the Ryounkaku!

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Hm?

Here you go, my dear!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
Take your time and enjoy!

[YUZUKI giggles]

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
I've never had ice cream
in a department store before!

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
We're so fancy!

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
It's good!

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised
you're not too cold.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
I could never eat ice cream
when it's chilly outside.

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
But it's delicious.
You should at least try a bite!

[TAMAHIKO yelps]

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center

[TAMAHIKO gasps]

[CUSTOMER A] I know what you
mean--young people these days.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER B] Back in our day,
we had manners...

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center
Hey, you have to stop that!

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
Can't you see people
are looking at us?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
Oh! I'm so sorry!

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
I, um, I was just having
fun like I did at school.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
You can't treat me like one of
your giggly little girlfriends.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO] Honestly, this is
all because we came to Tokyo.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
But at least, for now,
Yuzu's enjoying herself.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
That's good enough.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
Here goes!

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
What do you think? Is it yummy?

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
Yep! It's really yummy!

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
[FATHER A laughs]

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad to hear that.

Make sure you eat enough.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the ice cream.
It was so incredibly delicious!

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess we should
get going, right?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
We really don't wanna be late
catching our train home.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's right.

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
Actually, I told my
parents the same thing.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
The day I left, I told them I
wanted them to think of me

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
as though I'd passed away

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
so that it might be
easier for them.

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't really die.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
But they knew that they
would never see me again,

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
which is just like a
death where you know

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
your loved one's still
there in a way.

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
I told them, think of me
and know that I've gone on

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
to a better place and believe
that I'm happier now.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
That's an impressive way

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
to think about what's
happened to you.

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Thank you.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.881 position:50% align:center
We can get through the worst
that life has to offer

00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
as long as we stay positive!

Sometimes the things she says

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
can point daggers
straight at the truth.

Huh?

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
It's all right.

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
I'll always be right here
beside you, Mister Tamahiko.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
She got to work

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
and spent every spare moment
she could sewing her new kimono.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
It's finally finished!

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
Tell me the truth,
what do you think?

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI]
Please tell me!

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
I feel like it makes me look
a little more grown-up.

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Huh?

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
Is she serious?

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
It can still be let out at
the shoulders like a child's!

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
Well? So? Don't you think
I look just like Kotori?

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Mister Tamahiko,
you're staring at me.

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO]
What? I most certainly am not!

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
It's okay. Please don't
be embarrassed.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I won't!

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI giggles]

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO]
Well, hello there.

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:14.149 position:50% align:center
Greetings and
salutations, Tamahiko.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
I hope I'm not interrupting.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
[TAMAHIKO gasps]

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] You're different
than I remember you.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:25.452 position:50% align:center
Maybe because you seem
to be enjoying yourself.

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see you're not
afraid of girls anymore.

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
What are...? What are
you doing here?

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
Sorry, who's this?

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
My little sister Tamako.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
Go on. You can bring
my things inside now.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS]
Yes'm!

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.095 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's with
all this baggage?

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
And you never mentioned
why you're here!

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKO] I came to visit
the family villa, of course.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
Don't you see this
is my home now?

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
You can't just drop on by!

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
Like I care about
imposing on a dead man.

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:58.026 --> 00:21:59.277 position:50% align:center
And who knows?

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:02.280 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I'll grow attached
and move here myself.

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.920 position:50% align:center
[YUZUKI] Miss Tamako is
so beautiful and demure--

00:23:41.004 --> 00:23:43.089 position:50% align:center
very much a fine lady.

00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:45.300 position:50% align:center
However, I'm afraid
she doesn't like

00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:50.096 position:50% align:center
me and Mister Tamahiko together,
or maybe even at all.
