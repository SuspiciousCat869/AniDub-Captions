[SHO] This isn't just a matter
of bulking up, okay?

12

Our focus is on training

the muscles necessary
for cheerleading.

Mm. Thanks a lot.

If you're okay with it,

17
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,958
I think we should start
practicing stunts.

Don't you remember?
Sho doesn't want to.

Yeah, me neither.

25
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,291
A stunt is a
difficult group feat

to gain attention!

[ICHIRO, GEN, TON]
Woo!

00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:18,208
We have a number of stunts
to choose from, as you know.

36
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,750
These drawings are garbage.

[WATARU] He makes Kazu

I think we're missing
the point here.

Cool, let's have a look.

43
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,625
So, I think it'd make sense to
start things off nice and simple

44
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,916
by learning the Elevator stunt.
Let's see. Where is it?

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,958
[SHO]
It's this one.

46
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,291
First, the bases lift
the flyer into the air

47
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,333
to chest height.

48
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,958
Then they do an Extension.

49
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,750
They straighten their arms and
push the flyer straight up.

50
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,000
Then, of course,
there's the Basket Toss.

51
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,708
That's where you start
with the Elevator

52
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:11,125
and then throw
the flyer into the air.

53
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,791
[laughs]

54
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,708
Perfect.

Thanks a lot, kids!

59
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,500
We'll need a practice facility
with a non-leaky roof.

60
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,583
Anyone have suggestions?

61
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,333
We could try out the local gym.

62
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,333
It's free, if we
win their lottery.

63

Yeah, I'm definitely
down for not paying.

64

[KAZUMA]
Should we collect dues?

I know it sucks,

66
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,750
but we'll have to pay for stuff
like uniforms eventually.

But the truth is...
I'm afraid of heights.

I'm so sorry, guys.

I'm the one who should
apologize, Haru.

I wondered why you
sucked so bad.

they'll let us postpone?

302
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,625
any guesses why?

You take care to
master the basics.

304
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,583
[SATSUKI] Yes. Basics are
important. But what else?

305
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,083
[KAZUMA]
Technique?

306
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,916
[SATSUKI] All right. Technique's
a big part of it, too.

307
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,125
You boys are obviously trying
to get through these stunts

with sheer force.

309
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,833
But if you had decent technique,
your stunts would look better,

310
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,916
and you could
practice for longer.

311
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,791
Still, the most important
element is trust.

If you and your teammates
have faith in one another

there isn't a move you
can't accomplish.

You shouldn't be afraid
of falling when you fly.

00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,083
Not if you know that your
squad'll be there to catch you.

00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,458
Your problem is you
don't have any trust.

[gasps]

318
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,083
That's why you can't stand
up during the Elevator.

319
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,416
Until you overcome it,
you'll never get better.

320
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,291
How can I not trust them? Jeez.

321
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,625
[CHIHIRO] Looks like you're
drinks good to go.

322
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,375
Are you following me?

323
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,875
No, I didn't know you
were a member of Dreams.

324
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,375
I'm Chihiro Sakai.

325
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,833
Okay.

326
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,875
[HARUKI]
See ya.

327
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,333
[CHIHIRO]
Coach is tough.

328
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,166
But if you were hopeless,
she wouldn't waste her time.

329
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,625
[HARUKI]
What?

330
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,791
So don't give up kay?

331
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,625
Uh.

332
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,666
Uh-oh.

333
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,083
[CHEER COACH 4A] Exceptional
work today, ladies! Well done!

334
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,958
Where in the world did Haru go?

335
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,750
I dunno.

336
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,625
[WATARU, KAZUMA]
Uh.

337
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,291
Huh? You two? Why're you here?

338
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,583
[ALL gasp]

339
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,041
[HARUKI]
Kazu! Guess who I jus--?

340
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,250
Uh! These are the idiots
I told you about.

341
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,291
The wannabes from our last show!

342
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,250
What are you talkin' about?

343
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,416
[SATSUKI] Hey there.
What can I do for you?

344
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,791
Hello ma'am.

345
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,041
Next month's joint
demonstration, remember?

346
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,750
We scheduled a meeting.

347
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,750
[SATSUKI]
Of course.

348
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,875
Guess I should make
some introductions.

349
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,958
This is Captain Domoto of the
Yomay University Cheer Squad.

350
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,291
Called Sparks.

351
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,791
You can call me Jin

352
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,458
I'm Kaoru Hanasaki.

353
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,750
Hi. Nice to meet you.

354
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,458
Hey, Coach. What exactly is
your connection to these guys?

355
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,208
[SATSUKI] They're the Men's
Cheerleading Club of Meishiin.

356
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,750
Are you serious?

357
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,125
I don't think I've ever heard
of an all-Men's team before.

358
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,291
Thanks!

359
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,958
Always nice to meet more
cheerleading fans.

360
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,458
But, if you're just in
this for the limelight,

361
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,333
you might as well give up now.
Cause cheering's no joke.

362
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,375
Uh!

363
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,958
It's easy enough to start;

364
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,208
sticking around is
the hard part.

365
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,791
Cheerleading isn't a sport for
amateurs who delude themselves.

366
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,416
[ALL gasping]

367
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,416
Jin's absolutely
right about that.

368
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,833
To get better at this,

369
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,708
you're gonna need to work
with an experienced coach.

370
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,958
So tell me, have you
guys found one yet?

371
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,208
Well our friend Sho has
been training us.

372
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,083
We wanted him to come today
but he said he had to work.

373
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,166
[SATSUKI] Sho? Wait,
do you mean Sho Tokugawa?

374
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,666
Yeah, that's the guy,
how do you know him?

375
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,041
I guess he didn't give up
on cheering after all.

376
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,875
He'd be better off
if he had though.

377
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,416
I wonder what happened
between them.

378
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,083
Everybody has secrets, right?

379
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,833
He'll tell us when
he's good and ready.

380
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,041
[phone chimes]

381
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,375
[KAZUMA]
It's him.

382
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,625
I've got an idea: you guys have
time for a meeting tonight?

383
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:28,666
As long we don't have it at
Café Sunflower, I'm good!

384
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,958
My place. That cool?

385
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,291
[ALL]
Huh?

386
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,875
[KAZUMA gasps]

387
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,125
The fall here would be lethal.

388
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,375
No, it isn't that bad.

389
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,375
Are you kidding me,
it's like four floors?

390
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,458
[groans] Sorry.

391
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,916
[sighs]

392
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,333
[ICHIRO] That really wasn't
cool of me, my bad, Haru.

393
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,791
[GEN] You know... this isn't
a bad place to practice.

394
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,500
[WATARU]
Yes, I concur.

395
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,625
[KAZUMA] How 'bout we call
this meeting to order?

396
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,708
If there's one thing
we regret today...

397
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,875
...it's that we
didn't get a chance

398
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,500
to talk to any beautiful babes.

399
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,750
Although, we did hit
it off with the OG.

400
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,375
Yeah, I guess that's true.

401
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,250
What's OG stand for, anyway?

402
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,791
It means old girl, but you
know, she's still got it.

403
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,708
[BOTH laughing]

404
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,958
[HARUKI]
Sho. Take a seat.

405
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,208
It's higher up here
than I thought it'd be.

406
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,041
We're tryin' not to mention that
in front of you know who.

407
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:22,333
[SHO] Gotcha. So, tell me, how
did it go with the Dreamers?

408
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,750
[ICHIRO]
Honestly? Not that good.

409
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,791
Those cheerleaders were
a million times better

410
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,250
than we'll ever be.

411
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,875
It sort of kills me to admit
this, but they were great.

412
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:37,208
[ICHIRO] The only thing we ruled
at was failing. It was rough.

413
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,625
Complete and total suck patrol.

414
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,000
That bad, huh?

415
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,500
Their coach said it's that
I don't trust my teammates.

416
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,500
Uh!

417
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,833
This was my fault.

418
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,041
[SHO]
You're wrong.

419
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,541
[HARUKI]
Uh?

420
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,750
[SHO] Look. In cheering, it's
never one person's fault.

421
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,000
When the people who jump are
in sync with the people

422
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,208
who catch them, when everyone
trusts each other...

423
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,041
...that's when
perfection is possible.

424
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,708
"If you give up when
things go wrong,

425
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,208
then a failure stays a failure.
But if you persist

426
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,458
until you succeed, that
failure becomes a success."

427
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,291
The founder of
Panasonic said that.

428
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,333
They make great
consumer electronics.

429
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,125
Good thing we're not
giving up, then. Right?

430
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,333
[TON grunts]

431
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,291
--[ICHIRO] Heck yeah!
--[GEN] I'm all in!

432
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,708
And Sho?

433
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,541
We'll be counting on your
expertise moving forward.

434
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,791
Sounds good.

435
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,833
[TON] And, we still need
to think of a team name.

436
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,875
[WATARU]
The Wataru Seven?

437
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,375
[ICHIRO]
Yeah, not gonna happen.

438
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,708
[WATARU]
The Wataru Boys.

439
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,041
[GEN]
That one either, buddy.

440
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,041
[WATARU]
Well...

[ICHIRO]
I vote for Team Risujiro!

[SHO]
I like that one.

You know. I wanna
break some things.

444
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,041
The assumptions of those

445
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,500
who won't recognize
men's cheerleading.

446
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,291
The taunts of those who
say we can't succeed.

447
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,375
I wanna break through
Wataru's quotes

448
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,708
and see what he has to say.

449
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,291

[KAZUMA] Tono, I want to help
you break those insecurities.

Uh!

00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,916
[KAZUMA]
Haru, your sense of guilt.

453
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,250
And Sho. Whatever it is
that's weighing you down.

454
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,000
I wanna break somethin'.
Like real bad.

455
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,833
Do you mean your dry
spell with the ladies?

[KAZUMA, SHO]
Uh?

461
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,041
[HARUKI] I wanna break
apart my old self.

So let's do it.

[HARUKI]
Uh?

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,250

of all the naysayers.

this, not break, but--

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,708
It's pretty cheesy,
but it works.

475
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,541
We'll save Wataru Boys
for next time.

476
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,833
[KAZUMA]
This feels right, guys.

477
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,875
Together, we seven'll
break it all!

478
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,916
Ha!

479
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,166
[KAZUMA]
All right.

480
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,833
[ALL]
Go, fight, win!

481
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,958
Let's go... Breakers!

482
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,125
[ALL laughing, chattering]

483
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,250
[SHO]
Risujiro's Breakers!

484
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,541
[SHO]
Don't look so down.

485
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,250
[GEN] Who would have guessed
you'd be our dark horse?

486
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,333
[WATARU] Guess this is
the end of the Wataru Boys.

487
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,375
[KAZUMA] If you can really
strut your stuff onstage,

488
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,708
you're sure to pick up a girl.

489
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,000
[TON]
Two girlfriends?

490
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,208
[HARUKI]
Maybe, yeah.

491
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,708
[KAZUMA] Let's break it
all to smithereens.

492
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,250
[HARUKI, KAZUMA] Next Time:
"Let's Go, Breakers!"

493
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,166
Go... Fight... Win!
