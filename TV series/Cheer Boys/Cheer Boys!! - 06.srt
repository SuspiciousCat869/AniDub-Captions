You really are from a
restaurant family, aren't ya?

00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,333
It's Wataru's Deluxe Fried Rice!

00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,166
You named the dish
after yourself?

Well, it certainly smells good.

It's how much love we put
into the doing of it."

00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,333
And I put my love
inside this rice.

it now that I've heard that.

We can do intros later on.

I actually came to the show
to watch Dreams perform.

So I didn't get a chance
to see you guys.

But, when I heard you
were an all-men's team,

I knew I wanted to be
involved right away.

excited let me just say:

84
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,166
what you did at the festival
was not cheerleading.

85
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,541
The flyers were wobbly,
the bases and spotters

86
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,500
had their heads in the clouds
and the stunts were half-assed.

No matter how hard you try,

you're not gonna be able
to muscle your way

through cheerleading.
It requires skill and finesse.

wanted to come talk to us.

00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,708
[TAKERU chuckles]

316
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,916
[HARUKI]
You okay, Saku?

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,208
[SAKU]
Y-Yeah...

318
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,250
[HARUKI]
Remind me. What's your name?

319
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,875
It's Takeru, dude.

320
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,791
Keep acting like that, I won't
have to remember it for long.

321
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,625
[TAKUMI] Come on! Why are you
wearin' my shirt, bro?

322
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,041
[TAKUYA] We're family,
what's yours is mine, bro!

323
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,250
[TAKUMI]
Dude!

324
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,166
[HARUKI] I've heard
that line my whole life.

325
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,208
What? You sayin' you got
a big brother, too, Haru?

326
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,916
[HARUKI]
No. A sister.

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,500
A sister...?

328
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,375
[WATARU] He's trying
really hard to help them.

329
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,583
[ICHIRO] It kinda feels like
he's changed, doesn't it?

330
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,333
Oh, he's changed all right:
into a total mama bird!

331
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,333
Well, I think he's pretty
good at the maternal thing.

332
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,500
That's Haru, all right.

333
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,750
[SHO]
One... two... three...

[ALL]
...Breakers!

335
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,666
[TAKAGI] Wait. I have
something to give you all.

336
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,291
What's this?

337
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,708
It's a journal for putting
down your thoughts.

338
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,750
Sit down with it every
day after practice.

339
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,666
Write down anything and
everything that comes to mind.

340
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,416
Why the heck would we do that?

341
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,291
Because you have to
face yourselves.

342
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,500
[ALL gasping]

343
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,000
[TAKAGI] When you've
set your sights high,

344
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,750
the best thing you can do is
confront your fears head on.

345
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,458
Just in case you're
short on ideas,

346
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,500
I've given each of you
a prompt to start with.

347
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,458
[TON gasping]

348
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,166
[WATARU]
Hm?

349
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,041
[ICHIRO whimpers]

350
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,666
[gasps]

351
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,291
Something wrong?

352
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,041
[HARUKI]
Well, uh... Guess not.

353
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,500
Kid.

354
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,041
Right now, Kazu can mop
the floor with you.

355
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,041
Your flexibility,
or lack thereof.

356
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,875
Your wobbly center of gravity.

357
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,875
He's got you licked in
every category. And yet...

358
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,583
In spite of all the evidence
that points to the contrary,

359
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,583
you don't think
of him as a rival.

360
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,083
Some part of you
must know I'm right.

361
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,000
Until you buckle down
and surpass Kazu,

362
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,375
you will never get better.

363
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,958
By the way, Sho!

364
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,875
Decide on everyone's positions
by Friday. Understood?

365
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,208
Sure.

366
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,208
[KIN] Coach, please permit
me to escort you home.

367
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,958
[TAKAGI]
I'll be fine.

368
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,416
[HARUKI] Hey. What'd Coach
Takagi write in your notebook?

369
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,416
Hello?

370
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,875
Oh. Nothing.

371
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,000
Just to spend a little time
thinking about positions.

372
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,000

373
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,250
Come on in!

374
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,666
I've got this one.

375
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,125
What are you drinking?

376
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,208
Oh I'll just have a...
a cappuccino, please!

377
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,125
[SHO]
Flyers: Kazu, Haru, Saku.

378

Bases: Ton, Ichiro, Hisashi,
Takuya, Takumi, Kin, Takeru.

379
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,166
Spotters: Wataru,
Gen, Gin, and Doh.

380
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,000
I only counted 14 names.
D'ya think he forgot someone?

381
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,041
Hey, I know who he left out.

382
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,916
He didn't pick a
position for himself!

383
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,166
[KAZUMA, HARUKI]
U-Uh.

384
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,000
You have to stop
running from this.

[ALL gasping]

386
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,708
I've never seen a base
as talented as you, Sho.

387
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,458
You were one of the
leaders of your team.

388
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,958
So what are you so scared of?

389
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,166

Hey man. Sorry for
running off like that.

393
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,750
If you'd rather be
alone, I get it.

394
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,833
It's fine. I just hate
everyone worrying about me.

395
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,291
And trying to guess
what my problem is.

396
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,291
It's like Kazu said,
"everyone has secrets," right?

397
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,875
Plus, no one cares.

[gasps]

00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,083
[HARUKI]
Sure, we've worried about you,

400
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,666
but no one's gonna dig.

401
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,458
My family runs a dojo, yet no
one's asked me why I quit judo.

402
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,125
I mean, it's true
I hurt my shoulder.

403
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,291
But that's not the real
reason I walked away.

404
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,000
I just couldn't win.

405
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,750
My sister's so talented she won
the National Championship, and,

406
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,041
she made it look so easy.

407
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,291
Not me. I sucked.

408
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,291
Haru. I used to be
a student at Yomei.

409
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,708
[gasps] Wait a sec.
If you went to Yomei...

410
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,666
...that must mean you
cheered for Sparks.

411
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
[SHO]
It was a long time ago.

412
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,666
Coach Takagi was teaching
there back then.

413
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,875
It was the summer
of my junior year.

414
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,833
We competed in the
last Summer Cup.

415
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,625
The team worked hard and
did everything we could.

416
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,708
We thought we had the best
two-and-a-half-minute routine

417
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,166
in the country.

418
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,083
And then, in the finals,
I screwed up.

419
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,125
I dropped her...

420
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,416
Sakura.

421
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Wait, who's Sakura?

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,500
[SHO] Sakura is the
coach's little sister.

423
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,375
[SHO]
She was the best of us.

424
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:20,500
So full of life and light,
and so talented, too.

425
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,333
She was the one who always
lifted up her teammates.

426
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,958
Until...

427
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:35,958
[SHO] Until she fell.
She couldn't even walk.

428
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,875
[SAKURA]
I'm fine.

429
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,541
I'll get better.

430
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll keep doing cheerleading,
no matter what.

431
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,791
And you will too, right?

432
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,250
You have to. When you're
my base, I feel secure.

433
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,000
Nothing's gonna change that.

434
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,000
[SHO] I'm scared.
No, it's worse than that.

435
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,291
I'm terrified that if I
try to be a base again,

436
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,083
another accident might happen.

437
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,500
Coach was right when she
said I was running away.

438
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:10,916
It's the truth. I am. I have to.

439
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,416
Sho!

440
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,708
[SHO] I'm sorry.
But I don't have a choice.

441
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,791
[HARUKO]
Yeah. I'm practicing non-stop.

442
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,458
We're definitely
gonna win this one.

443
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,125
[HARUKI]
I'm running away, too.

444
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,500
[HARUKI]
But...

445
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,875
[KAZUMA] I've gotta confirm
positions with coach soon.

446
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,000
So what do I tell her about you?

447
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,583
[SHO gasps]

448
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,291
No pressure, man. If you don't
wanna do stunts, don't do 'em.

449
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,250
Yeah, dude. I mean,
I don't understand it,

450
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,791
but it's still your
choice to make.

451
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,416
Plus, you've done
enough already.

452
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,666
What with whippin' those
newbies into shape!

453
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,291
Yeah. And you did
a number on us, too!

Oh, snap! Bando, too?

Sorry I missed your big show.

[HARUKI]
You heard right.

465
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,750
[SHO]
Huh?

466
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:25,458
We cheer. We're an All-Men's
Cheerleading Team!

Why? Is that a problem?

Hey. That's cool.

I hope we can both
make Meishiin proud.

471
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,625
See ya later!

472
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,666
[JUDO MEMBER 6B]
Let's go!

473
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,416
[JUDO MEMBERS]
Right.

474
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,958
[KAZUMA]
You okay?

475
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,000
I can't hide anymore.

476
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:49,166
I have to stop running away
from my past. And Sho does too.

477
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,916
So back in Judo.
We'd fall a lot.

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,666
But they also taught us
how to take a fall. And...

479
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,541
Well I... I think we can do the
same with our cheerleading.

480
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,375
Hey, Gen. Here.

481
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,833
[GEN gasping]

482
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,833
[HARUKI]
Think fast, Kazu!

483
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,291
[HARUKI yells]

484
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,791
Ya see? Just like that.

485
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,750
You're not going to throw
me next, are you?

486
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,916
[HARUKI] No, sorry.
My point is that yeah,

487
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,916
people fall, but we
don't have to be afraid.

488
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,125
Judo and cheerleading
are two different things!

489
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,041
I'll say.

490
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,250
I think what he means is--

491
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,333
[SHO] Believe.
That's what he's saying.

492
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,541
[ICHIRO, WATARU]
Uh...

493
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,458
[TAKERU] Come on, guys,
practice just started.

494
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,833
Let's take it slow today.

495
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,958
[HISASHI]
Slow? What are you a turtle?

496
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,250
No, on second thought,
that's an insult to turtles.

497
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,791
[TAKERU]
You jack ass!

498
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,916
[KAZUMA]
Next episode, "Strain."

499
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Let's go... Breakers!
