[ICHIRO]
This is awesome!

3
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,750
I had no idea there was a
bathhouse this close to campus!

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,166
[KAZUMA]
It's not too bad.

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,583
Yeah. I could get used to this.

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,791
[GEN] There's nothin' better
than a little r and r

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,458
after a hard day's training,
that's for sure.

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,083
Yes, this is quite lovely.

9
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,541
Too bad it's men
only, am I ri--?

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,750
Hey. Where's Haru?

11
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,875
[ICHIRO] Uh. I don't know or
care, I'm not his mother.

12
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,791
I care. Come on, man.
We should go find him.

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,500
Fine...

14
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,583
Oh, darling!

15
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,125
Haruki dear!

16
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,083
[GEN]
Shut up...

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,333
[ICHIRO]
Excuse me sir,

18
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,083
you haven't seen our
baby boy have you?

19
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,208
He's terribly shy!

20
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,958
Stop it. Jerk!

21
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,291
[ICHIRO] And there's a
big mole right on his--

22
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,791
[GEN]
Making a scene!

23
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,041
[WATARU]
Pool fight!

00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,041
[BOYS chattering, laughing]

25
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:06,166
We know how to joke around.
But can we cheer?

26
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,625
[sighs]

27
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,958
[ICHIRO] Yo, dude! Pass the
spice blend, would ya?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,291
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

29
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,791
Sup, Haru? Why the
cold-shoulder, man?

30
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,875
[GEN] It's because you were
makin' fun of him... Right?

31
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,166
Huh? No, uh. It's nothing.

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,250
So what?
You shy or somethin'?

33
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,583
That's right!

34
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,250
I can't believe it, I almost
forgot to tell you!

35
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,208
I started a group thread so we
can stay in constant contact

36
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,500
about practice and events
and stuff like that.

37
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,708
How cool!

38
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,166
Yup! And remember, everyone,

39
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,250
you should be stretching and
practicing those handstands

40
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,333
at least once a day.

41
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,708
Now we'll always be together!

42
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,166
[laughs]

43
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,166
Listen, every time
you laugh like that,

44
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,666
I picture you killing cats.

45
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,958
Sorry, but I've never been on
a group text chain before.

46
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,125
That doesn't mean you
should spam us all!

47
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,833
[KAZUMA chuckles]
We're up to six members.

48
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,083
Add one more, and we
can make our debut.

49
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,708
Yeah. But who?

50
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,458
[ICHIRO, GEN]
Uh...

51
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,083
Not to worry boys.

52
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,958
Ichiro and I know just the
guy for this kinda job!

53
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,708
[WATARU]
He certainly is good looking.

54
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,333
That man right there
is Sho Tokugawa.

55
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,166
We won't find a better
recruit in the whole school.

56
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,708
Well, he does look the part.

57
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,083
But let's see if he's as
good as you say he is.

58
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,375
He's got a strong, athletic
build, doesn't he?

59
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:18,375
Oh! Kazu, you naughty boy.
My eyes are up here!

60
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,458
He's just yankin' his chain!

61
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,208

[gasps]

66
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,041
So. You're taking gym
today, too, are you?

67
00:04:56,125 --> 00:05:00,000
Uh. Well... Yep.

68
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,958
Your uh-- Is it okay?

69
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,791
Oh! Yeah. I fell on
the mat earlier,

70
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,458
face first, and got a
bloody nose, that's all.

71
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,916
[CHIHIRO]
Hey.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,541
Thanks for caring. That's
really sweet of you. Bye!

73
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,750
[ICHIRO]
You guys! Showtime!

74
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,208
[KAZUMA]
That was a solid round-off.

75
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,000
His back handspring's good, too.

76
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,458
And his backflip is savage!

77
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,708
He's quite agile.

78
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,500
He's the one, you guys.
Let's go and get him!

79
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,291
Jackpot!

80
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,791
[GEN]
Tokugawa!

81
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,583
[ICHIRO]
You rocked it out there, buddy!

82
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,166
[ALL]

00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,250
[STUDENTS chattering]

84
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,958
[SHO] So, what's up?
What do you want from me?

85
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,916
Hey, is that Risu on your shirt?

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,416
[KAZUMA]
Risu?

87
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,666
Isn't he from one of
those nut advertisements?

88
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,750
Yeah. He's the greatest
mascot of all time. And?

89
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,625
[KAZUMA] Nothing!
Let's get down to business.

90
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,125
Me and the fellas
want you to join

91
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,416
the Men's Cheerleading Club.

92
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,250
Look, here's the deal.

93
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,541
We snuck into your class

94
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,291
because we've been thinking
of recruiting you.

95
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,250
And damn, you're the best
acrobat I've seen in person.

96
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,250
If you were to join us,
it would be quite the honor.

97
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,291
You'd make a great fit.

98
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,500
You're a Men's Cheer
Club, are you?

99
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:44,958
That's interesting. We already
have a female squad here.

100
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,333
But I guess you do
things differently.

101
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,625
[KAZUMA] Oh yeah.
This club is one of a kind!

102
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:57,708
[sighs] My answer is no.

103
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,833
Sho, please. We're meant
to be. I can feel it.

104
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,833
So...

105
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,458
Oh yeah, that sounded weird.

106
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,583
Why won't you join us?
Talk to me!

107
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,208
I saw your performance.

108
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,166
If a person can
even call it that.

109
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,250
Handstands and shoulder sits?

110
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,916
Did you really think you
were ready for a show?

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,958
I didn't see a single thing that
even resembled tumbling.

112
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,250
Those two jokers
did what they could.

113
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,791
But, the rest of you were
completely pathetic.

114
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,333
Listen, cheering isn't
something you just decide to do.

115
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,208
It takes years of dedication.

116
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,833
Not to mention you're
an all Men's Team.

117
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,333
Which sounds like it's meant
to be a practical joke.

118
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,166
But I'm not laughing.

119
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,708
You can't cheer, you can't
tumble, you can't do stunts.

120
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,291
You don't even have the training
to know how to practice.

121
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,791
Honestly, I don't want to join
a team of naive amateurs.

122
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,250
You can count me out.

123
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,500
[gasps]

124
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:59,500
We may be amateurs, but we're
not naive. We're dead serious!

125
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,250
[ALL gasp]

126
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,125
And we'll prove it!

127
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:06,208
In gym class,
one week from today!

128
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,083
So, how are you planning to
prove we're worth his time?

129
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,958
Oh. I have no idea.

130
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,208
[ALL groan]

131
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,458
You just said that off
the top of your head?!

132
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,875
Well, so much for that.

133
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,708
At least he gave us some things
to start thinking about.

134
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,083
Speaking of, what did
he mean by stunts?

135
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,625
[TON] They're the kind of moves
you see in group gymnastics.

136
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,875
You can't really do
cheerleading without them.

137
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,541
Guess Sho's not the only
one who knows his stuff.

138
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,000
Just a little bit. I looked up
a couple things last night.

139
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,125
[KAZUMA]
Listen.

140
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:42,916
[ALL]
Huh?

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,791
Wataru had the right idea.

142
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,333
We need to let Sho know
we mean business.

143
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,500
He knows this stuff
better than anyone.

144
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,333
We may not have his
level of experience,

145
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,166
but we do have heart!

146
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,875
If we work our butts off,
he'll respect the effort.

147
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,083
So that's how we can
change his mind.

148
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,875
So, what're you proposing?

149
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,708
The round-off back handspring.

150
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,875
If we learn that,
he'll change his tune.

151
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,791
You're joking, right?

152
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,250
Come on, Kazu. How are we
supposed to learn that move?

153
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,041
Work. If we try hard enough
we can do anything.

154
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,041
And when once we
have gotten it right,

155
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,833
he'll see that we're
not playing around!

156
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,875
He'll know for a fact that
we're serious about this.

157
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,750
Then he'll be begging us
to join the Cheer Club!

158
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,416
[TON]
