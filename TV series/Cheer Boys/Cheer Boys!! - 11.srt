I'm taking you to
the doctor. The end!

Stop arguing, it's pointless.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,458
Takumi, maybe you
should listen to him.

41
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,583
The way you've been coughing,

42
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,041
you probably should
go to the doctor.

Look, I'm good, my brother
just worries too much.

Oh do I? Plus, someone has to.

You sure don't take
care of yourself.

I appreciate your concern, man,
but I don't need a doctor.

He's your brother.

But you have to let
him be his own man.

Yeah, well, that's
easier said than done.

We've always been together.
In elementary school...

In high school and college, too.

But it won't always be that way.

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,708
So, I don't know,
it just makes me sad.

[HARUKI]
When I walked away from judo,

56
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,875
I wonder if she
felt the same way?

57

Was she sad? Does she miss me?

But he can't, we have work.

Your brother's way
nicer than my sisters.

164
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:51,208
It just drives me crazy
how naggy he can be.

165
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,541
The guy's got problems
of his own.

166
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,458
I want him to worry about
finding a job, not me.

167
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:01,291
The thing is, if it doesn't work
out for him, I'll blame myself.

You know?

00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,166
Totally. I guess every
family has drama, huh?

too, don't you, Haru?

[HARUKI]
Yup.

172
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,916
We did judo together for years.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,041
But she was always stronger
and way more talented.

174

That's rough.

I get it.

In my family, my brother's the
more accomplished one, too.

I'm real glad I came over today.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The only reason I
showed up initially

180
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,666
was to avoid having to
deal with my brother.

181
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,958
But it helps to know other
people are in the same boat

182
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,375
as me, know what I mean?
It makes me feel less crazy.

[SAKU] Mm. I guess that makes
us the Little Brothers Trio.

Pretty sure I owe my
brother an apology.

He only worries
because he cares.

Well, uh, if you don't mind,

196

I could use your help
with something.

Kazu's the reason I decided
to try cheerleading.

And I'm grateful to him. This
is my way of saying, "thanks."

203
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,291
So tell me, what kind of
chocolate does he like the most?

the kind with almonds in it.

Almonds? Awesome!

206
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,041
I'll glaze them with chocolate.

Then I'll dust 'em
with hot cocoa!

I've been trying to say.

I'm sorry I walked
away from judo.

I've wanted to tell you that
from the beginning, Haruko.

And there's something else, too.

229
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,958
The truth is, I didn't quit
because of my injury.

230
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,708
I'd been thinking about it for
a long time, and then one day,

231
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,083
I realized I had
to stop thinking

232
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,708
and do something about
it. I had to act.

Thing is... I had it easy.

I was a guy so I was a
lot stronger at first.

never gonna be my thing.

[TON] Mm-hm. She said there's
a restaurant around here

with a pretty great recipe.

325

Apparently, someone who
works there gave it to her.

spicy curried noodles
with a pork cutlet heart!

349
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,125
[TAKUMI] Ah. But if I eat it,
I'll break its heart!

350
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,250
[ZI XUAN] I guess that makes
them 'Heartbreak Noodles!'

351
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,041
Chihiro says her and Ton
dropped off your slice of cake

at the restaurant and that
Sho will bring it by later.

You made that up?!

366
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,833
[WATARU] Yes, indeed. I've been
using my own words lately.

367
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,250
It's totally awesome.

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,125
Until recently, I was no better
than a parrot, yapping away.

369
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,333
Albeit, a genius parrot,
but a parrot, still.

370
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,750
But then I decided to
join the Cheer Club.

371
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,875
And now I see things
in a new light.

372
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,583
Things I couldn't even
begin to comprehend before.

373
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,208
Ain't that the truth.

374
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,041
Before this, when
I played baseball

375
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,250
all I cared about were
my own achievements.

376
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,000
But the Cheer Club
taught me selflessness

377
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,083
and the value of working as
a team to achieve a goal.

378
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,916
Same here. I've learned
a lot from Cheerleading.

379
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,916
And from all my teammates.

380
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,583
Me, too. Other people
are quite different.

381
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:32,958
I've learned that that's both
annoying and strangely exciting.

382
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,750
[TAKERU]
True dat!

383
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,791
I learned that something
can be difficult and fun!

384
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,083
Now I think I
prefer it that way.

385
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,833
I agree.

386
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,666
I learned a lesson, too.

387
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,750
If you wanna make
someone else smile,

388
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,541
first, you gotta figure out
a way to smile for yourself.

You've all overcome so
much. It's incredible.
