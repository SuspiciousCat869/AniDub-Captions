Maybe we should perfect
the stunts we're already on.

30
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,208
Why bring in new material
that's super difficult

the old stuff yet?

You ask me, that sounds like
a recipe for disaster!

Yeah, but no one did
ask you "Broccoli Head."

I'm glad you're here. We were
talking over the stunts.

Question is, do we try
harder ones or not.

Coach Takagi said it
was our decision.

Thing is, we bite off more than
we can chew, it won't be.

They're juniors now, so they're

they took off today.

I take no issue with
the harder stunts.

But we'll have to
practice even more.

That's true. But if we really
wanna get past regionals,

the best I've ever had.

471
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,458
It's Kin's special recipe!

472
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,125
[bell tolls]

473
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,875
You did a great job!

474
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,250
Anyone know why the
temple bell's ringing?

475
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,291
Yeah. It's almost New Years!

476
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,791
What a place to spend it!

477
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,166
Hey, let's check out
the shrine after this!

478
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,125
We should watch
the sunrise, too!

479
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,166
Sounds good!

480
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,500
Hey, you know what?

481
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,416
You and I watched last year's
first sunrise together, too.

482
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,166
Oh yeah, up on your rooftop.

483
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,583
Crazy, huh? If you'd
asked where we'd be now,

484
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,458
well, let's just say that I
never would've guessed it.

485
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,250
[KAZUMA]
All right. Here we go!

486
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,000
[BREAKERS]
Go, fight, win.

487
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,625
Let's go--

488
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,416
[TAKERU]
Broccoli!

489
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,208
Why ya gotta ruin
our chant, bro?

490
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,375
Yeah, you totally
just killed the mood!

491
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,541
Huh? I was just trying
to make everybody laugh.

492
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,750
Laughter requires comedy.

493
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,500
All right. One more time!

494
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,166
[BREAKERS]
Go, fight, win.

495
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,708
Let's go... Brea--!

496
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,166
[HISASHI]
Buh-roccoli!

497
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,625
[BREAKERS]
Huh?!

498
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,041
[gasping]

499
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,625
Hisashi!

500
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,000
He's finally lost it.

501
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:01,291
No. He broke his
old self. Am I right?

502
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,583
[HISASHI grunts]

503
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,083
[TAKERU gasps]
Dude! Way to go!

504
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,375
[KAZUMA] Looks like Hisashi's
a full-fledged Breaker!

505
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:13,166
[BREAKERS chattering]

506
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,541
Our routine's only two
and a half minutes, boys.

507
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:22,041
That's 150 seconds.
It's a flash of time.

508
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,541
So, make sure you take
advantage of every moment!

509
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,041
[ALL]
Right!

510
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,125
[SAKU]
Kazu's taking today off?

511
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,708
[WATARU] He's been shot
with Cupid's arrow.

512
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,625
[KIN]
I too am drunk on love.

513
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,875
[GIN, DOH]
For real?

514
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,666
[TAKUMI] Maybe he tried
to kiss her goodnight

515
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,916
and she slapped his face?

516
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,875
[ZI XUAN] Or perhaps she
broke his fragile heart.

517
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,625
[TAKUYA] Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

518
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,291
[KAZUMA] Next episode,
"Tears of the Sun."

519
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,375
Go... Fight... Win!
