1
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,083
[HARUKI]
Dynamic jumps.


2
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,125
[HARUKI]
Powerful moves.


3
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,375
[HARUKI]
Smiles suspended in space.


4
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,291
[HARUKI]
They support those who need it.


5
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,708
They inspire them.


6
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,583
They make them smile.


7
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,875
[HARUKI]
And when they soar?


8
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,041
It's like the sun lighting up
the entire world.

00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,125
[HARUKI gasps]

10
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,500
Go! Fight!

[HARUKO grunting]

12
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,500
Come on!

13
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,416
Haruki. Sit down, man.

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,125
[HARUKI]
Uh?

15
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,500
You cool?

16
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,250
Yeah. I'm all right.

17
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,583
You know what?

18
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,208
The only time you ever
raise your voice like that

19
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,625
is when you're cheering
for your sister.

20
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,333
Huh?

21
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:37,041
[HARUKO grunts]

--[CROWD cheers]
--[REFEREE 1A] Point!

She won! She really won!

26
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,291
Holy crap dude! Your
sister's a Judo Master!

27
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,291
Uh. Right. Oops...

28
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,458
Don't worry about it.

29
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,416
It feels way better!

00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,333
[CROWD cheers]

31
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,291
Now that's my girl!

32
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,583
Haruko!

33
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,708
Jeez, could my parents
be any more embarrassing?

34
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,125
Give 'em a break.
It's a really big deal.

35
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,000
The Meishiin University
Women's Judo Club

36
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,000
has never won
first place before!

37
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,125
And they've gotta be proud

38
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,500
that your sister was
the one to do it.

39
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,791
It's kinda weird.

40
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,125
This is the first time

41
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,375
I've ever watched a match
without my uniform on.

You're almost there, Captain!

Power through! You can do it!

What's wrong? Feelin' full?

50

[HARUKI]
Hi.

55
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,875
[sighs] You know, you
could try answering them

56
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,625
with a little bit of
pep in your voice.

57
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,041
[HARUKI]
Uh.

58
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:08,000
You're in college now, Haruki,
so stop acting so shy.

59
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,416
Where are Mom and Dad?

60
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,041
[HARUKO]
They went home already.

61
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,625
Said they wanted to
completely rethink

62
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,125
tomorrow's training schedule.

63
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,500
Where's Kazu?

64
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,625
I think he went to visit
with his grandma.

65
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,666
[HARUKO]
Oh, okay.

00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:22,750
Hey, Sis?

67
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:23,416
Huh?

Go find my rude brother
and bring him back.

You know, I could hear
you rooting for me.

This'll sound weird, but...

74

Huh?

75
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,958
It's the reason I won.

76
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,250
Hearing your voice.

77
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,875

I'm gonna shower.

Oh, crap.

00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,583
[KAZUMA]
Figured I'd find you here.

116
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,666
What a surprise.

117
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,958
You barged into my house
uninvited again.

Well, I was plannin' to use
your shower real quick.

119

Then choke down your medicine.

[KAZUMA]
So, what gives?

127
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,583
You don't come up here unless
you have somethin' on your mind.

128
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,708
[HARUKI sighs]
I'm fine.

129
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,125
You got somethin' on yours?

130
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,375
[KAZUMA]
What?

131
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,666
You come up here for the
same reasons that I do.

132

Uh! I'm cool.

133
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,000
[KAZUMA]
You're right though.

134
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,916
You and me have been
hanging out on this rooftop

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,291
since we were just
a couple of brats.

136
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,041
Hey, uh...

137
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,333
[KAZUMA]
What's up?

138
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,083
Is your Grandma doin' okay?

139
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,541
Yeah, Granny's fine!

140
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,291
She sure hasn't
lost her appetite;

142
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,833
That's great.

143
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,708
Maybe next time you
visit I'll come too.

144
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,250
Eh, you don't wanna do that.

145
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,625
I just talk her ear off
and then walk on home.

146
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,333
Speakin' of family though,
damn your sister's strong.

147
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,625
Still can't believe she won.

148
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,541
[HARUKI sighs]

149
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,625
[HARUKI]
It's not fair.

150
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,000
[KAZUMA]
What?

151
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:21,125
[HARUKI] Why'd I have to
be born into a Judo family?

152
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,875
[KAZUMA] So there is
something on your mind.

153
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,916
[HARUKI] I'm just saying,
I knew I was gonna be stuck

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,875
on the sidelines cause
of my shoulder.

155
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,500
But even without the injury,

156
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,291
I'll never be as
cool as my sister.

157
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,041
[HARUKI]
Ow!

158
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,833
You are cool, dude.

159
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,041
Uh.

160
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,541
You're different than
her, but that's okay.

161
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,375
Every time you landed a hit,

162
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,125
you looked like you'd
been hit yourself.

163
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,291
You fought with sympathy
and compassion,

164

Haru! What a crazy
twist of fate!

just fell on your nose!

Yeah. So what?

You've heard of the famous

If a rain drop hits your nose,
do you know what happens after?

Heh. Nah, but tomorrow you're

to tell me the truth!

So are you gonna explain why

208
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,833
you're quitting the

[HARUKI] Sorry, but why
would you quit Judo?

You're crazy talented.

00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,291
Seriously, you made it to
the regional tournament

00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,500
in high school.

214
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,250
Yeah, I lost in round two.

215
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,375
At least you were there!
That's more than I can say.

216
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,625
And I'm a son of the Bando Dojo.

217
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,166
Not a day goes by I don't wonder

218
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,541
if I deserve to be on
the team at all.

219
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,791
I wonder if they wanted
me for my talent,

220
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,375
or if they just tolerate me
because of my family name.

221
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:44,833
In a way, I was relieved
when I injured my shoulder.

222
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,041
It gave me a legit excuse
to quit the team.

223
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,125
But what's yours?

You gotta be kidding me, man.

When I was transferred here
after my parents died,

227
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,125
I didn't know anyone
at this school.

228

first friend I made.

[KAZUMA]
My best friend.

230

The only reason I did
Judo in the first place

231
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,166
is cause you asked me to.

Kazu, you can't just--

I timed it exactly right.

with an attitude like that.

don't find more members

to join the club, we can't
