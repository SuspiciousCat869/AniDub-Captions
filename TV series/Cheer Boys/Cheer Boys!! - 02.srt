you're stiffer than a board.

As you can see,

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,041
you add <i>ma</i> to the end of
most interrogative sentences.

23
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,541
And in Japanese,
you add <i>ka</i> to <i>desu</i>

24
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,458
at the end of a sentence
to make <i>desu ka</i> .

any questions?

[HARUKI]
Ton?

Clearly, Ton is short for Tono.

You can't just give

[WATARU]
Too late!

100

"Haru"and "Kazu."

102

you to call me "Mizo."

Well. Uh. I don't know,
220 pounds?

109
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,958
What's your background;
did you play any sports?

110
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,833
Oh. No. I'm so sorry.

111
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,125
There's no need to
apologize at all.

112
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,500
Best thing about this sport is

113
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,875
there's a position for
every type of person.

114
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,708
One question: Why cheerleading?

115
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,541
[TON]
Because I want to change.

116
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,000
That's great.

117
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,083
[WATARU] I'm thinking of a
famous quote that applies here.

118
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:23,125
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life."

119
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,166
Okay... I feel like "there's
no time like the present"

120
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,500
would be more appropriate?

121
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,333
What's more appropriate
than Lester Burnham

122
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,250
in the film <i>American Beauty</i> ?

123
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,791
That is a good movie.

124
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,541
[TON]
Mm-hm.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,375
So, uh. Earlier you said
that there's a role in

126
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,375
cheerleading for every type of
person, does that include me?

127
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:53,333
Well yeah, of course it does!

128
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,375
The girl holding her hands up
in the air is called the flyer.

129
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,666
All positions matter equally,
but for the audience,

130
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,625
the flyer is the
star of the show.

131
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,583
They do lots of acrobatics, so
they need to be small and light.

132
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,416
As well as spry.
That's me and you, Haru.

133
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,083
Wait, me?

134
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,916
[KAZUMA] The people supporting
the flyer are called the bases.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,083
They carry the flyer on their
shoulders, and steady them

136
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,750
with their palms.
Bases need to be big and sturdy.

137
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,333
Like Ton.

138
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,666
[KAZUMA] The person in the
back is called the spotter.

139
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,625
It's their job to
assist the bases.

140
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,583
Sort of like a tripod leg.

141
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,666
The most important thing that
spotter's have to do is

142
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,875
is decide when to
lift up the flyer.

143
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,000
They have to be intelligent.

144
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,666
[WATARU]
That's me to a T. I'm in.

145
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,541
I made copies in case
you wanna watch later.

146
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,375
But wait. Even with me,

147
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,791
we don't have enough
members, right?

148
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,291
If we want to compete
in a tournament,

149
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,916
we'll need 17 people.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,708
But for now, our goal is to
get seven official members.

151
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,250
Once we have 'em...

152
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,875
...we can make our debut at
the school festival in October!

153
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:13,833
[HARUKO]

Hey, Sis.

Are you quitting Judo?

Just answer me.

160

[HARUKI]
Mm-hm.

161
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,125
Because of your shoulder?

162
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,541
Not really.

163
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,875
[HARUKO]
So... why then?

164
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,708
I'm asking as your
sister. Please.

165
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,333
Don't walk away.

166
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,208
Whatever you do, don't quit!

167
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,750
[inaudible]

168
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,125
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,916
[HARUKO] If you aren't
happy with your progress,

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,250
you should practice harder!

171
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,916
[HARUKI]
Sis?

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,791
There's something I want...

173
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,125
It's not important.

174
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,666
[HARUKI]
Let's see...

175
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,791
Kay, so there's the flyer,
the bases, and the spotter.

176
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:41,166
I forget, which one am I?
I think I'm that one.

177
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,291
[HARUKI grunts]
No way. I can't do that.

178
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,125
[ALL gasping]

179
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,500
Who wants to give it a try next?

180
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,250
[WATARU]
Me. I'll go first!

181
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,541
Guys? Stand back!

182
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,375
[WATARU grunting]

183
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,125
You're up, Ton.

184
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,375
Uh. Okay!

185
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,291
[TON grunting]

186
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,666
[WATARU]
What are you doing?

187
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,875
Well, look! It's a headstand!

188
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,333
You gotta learn to do that
on your hands though.

189
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,458
Well? Haru?

190
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,875
[WATARU]
He's walking!

191
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,625
Yeah, it's way easier to
stay balanced that way.

192
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,750
Haru, can you stop?

193
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,083
Handstands build up
strength in your core.

194
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,416
They can also improve
your sense of balance.

195
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,625
So do them every chance
you get, understand?

196
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,791
You should be stretching
every day, too.

197
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,250
If you're not flexible,
you run the risk of injury.

198
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,000
It also affects your tumbling.

199
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,750
Wait... tumbling?

200
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,000
You know what tumbling is.

201
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,500
Backflips, somersaults,
acrobatics.

202
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,083
You're gonna be
one of our flyers,

203
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,958
so start practicing
on a trampoline,

204
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,041
we don't want you
breaking any bones.

205
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,208
Uh! Look, this whole
flyer thing...

206
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,166
It's just-- It's not for me.

207
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,125
If you work hard,
you can do anything.

208
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,166
I'm gonna nail this handstand
soon. Just watch!

209
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,750
Me, too.

210
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,916
Now that we covered tumbling,

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,708
it's time to talk
about attitude.

212
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,041
When cheering, you need charm,
heart, enthusiasm,

213
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,666
and a smile!

214
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,458
[TON, WATARU]
Yeah!

215
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,166
[KAZUMA]
All right, everyone, line up.

216
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,833
Call and response time!

217
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,541

00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,333
[WATARU, TON]
Go! Fight! Win!

220
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,500
[KAZUMA] Smile more, boys!
Come on now, I can't hear you!

00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,375
[HARUKI grunts]

00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,000

[ALL]
Go! Fight! Win!

224
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,791
[KAZUMA]
Let me see that big smile, Haru!

225
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,083
[BOTH sigh]

226
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,666
Hey. You feelin' all right?

227
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,416
What?

228
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,916
You know, with this?

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,833
Oh. For sure.

230
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,791
I'm having a good
time, it's just...

231
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,625
I'm kinda worried about
the handstand. It's hard.

232
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,291
And I've never been much
of an athlete to be honest.

233
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,583
[HARUKI]
You'll be fine.

234
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,000
[TON]
Huh?

235
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,708
It's kinda weird. I hate being
the center of attention

236
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,791
more than anything.

237
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:14,500
But since Kazu asked me to do
it, I feel like I have to try.

238
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,541
You sought this out
yourself, though.

239
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,791
You took the initiative

240
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,750
because you wanted to
make a change, right?

241
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,750
I think that's awesome.

242
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:27,375
Do your best.
And let's have fun.

243
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,125
Thanks a lot, Haru.

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,500
[WATARU]
Whoa!

245
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,625
They're tambourelling!

246
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,708
Think you mean tumbling.

[HARUKI]
Hey! Don't we know him?

00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,333
The one who lost the fried
pork curry challenge.

250
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,958
[KAZUMA]
Is he in the Tennis Club?

251
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,458
I can do 'em, too!

Uh. That's the ladybug guy.

Oh, wow!

That's nice, but it has
nothing to do with tennis.

No, it doesn't.

Well. You guys seem
pretty lame to me.

Just cuz you join the
best club around,

doesn't mean you're guaranteed
to get chicks any you know.

I'm old enough to drink.

into is comedy!

put the bottle down.

I think you're just jealous.

309
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,875
So, you played
baseball and soccer.

310
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,583
What made you decide you
to join the Tennis Club?

311
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,625
Well. All boys' clubs are fun,

312
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,166
but they're not as fun as girls.
Since we're both in college now,

313
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,500
we decided to join a club
with a little bit more style.

314
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,125
How can you talk about
style with hair like that?
