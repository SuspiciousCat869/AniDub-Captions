where you left off, Jin.

317
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,708
After you graduated, Sho and
Sakura were the Team Captains.

318
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,375
They worked as hard as
anyone I've ever seen.

319
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,958
The rest of the team was so
inspired by their work ethic,

320
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,666
they bought in 100%.

321
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,041
[KAORU]
Yeah.

322
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,458
Everyone who did High School
cheerleading back then

323
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,708
knew about Sho and Sakura.
They were well respected.

324
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,125
It was just before the cup...

325
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,208
We've decided we need to
increase the difficulty

326
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,083
of all our stunts!

327
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,250
[TEAMMATES muttering]

328
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,625
Starting right now?

329
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,500
But the Summer
Cup is next week!

330
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,041
If we really wanna
win this thing,

331
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,916
we need to amaze the audience!

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,666
I know that we can do this!

333
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,958
But we hafta take one last leap!

334
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,583
[JIN] You think you understand
what this is all about, Sho,

335
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,625
but you're dead wrong.

336
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,416
[SHO]
What are you talking about?

337
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,083
Cheering's not a Circus.
You get my drift?

338
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,083
[BOTH]
Uh!

339
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,416
[SHO]
One, two, three, four!

340
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,458
That's all wrong, guys!
Do it again!

341
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,083
Flyer! Your cradle
posture is way too weak!

342
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,291
This isn't a circus act,
understand?

343
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,625
Right...

344
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,333
[SHO] Base, you're off-center
during the catch!

345
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,666
Your stunts are sloppy!

346
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,875
I'm sorry...

347
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,583
It doesn't matter how
hard our stunts are,

348
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,666
if we screw up, we're
dead in the water!

349
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,458
Without a perfect, flawless
performance, we can't win.

350
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,125
Do you want that or not?

351
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,375
Whaddaya think we're doing out
here, putting on a circus?

352
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,000
[JIN gasping]
Sho...

353
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,708
Sakura's accident
was partly my fault.

354
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,791
I wish I could
make it up to you.

355
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,583
I've told you a thousand
times before, you're wrong.

356
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,541
Jin, it's not true.

357
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,333
I take an incredible
amount of pride

358
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,541
in competing in cheerleading
competitions.

359
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,500
But still. That doesn't
mean I've forgotten

360
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,208
cheerleading's
fundamental purpose.

361
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,166
This is my chance.

362
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,958
To finally put on a
perfect performance.

363
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,000
To prove to Jin that I can
do it. That I'm fine.

364
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,416
Gotcha.

365
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's not what he meant when
he said it wasn't a circus.

366
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,916
He didn't mean you
have to be perfect.

367
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,166
Uh?

368
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,375
Cheering has never been
about perfection, Sho.

369
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,125
I gotta question!

370
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,416
How long do you plan to
keep mopin' around for?

371
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,291
Huh?

372
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,041
Uh. May I take your, uh--

And you're...?

374
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,666
Kaoru Hanasaki,
I'm from the Sparks!

375
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,916
And you make me sick
to my stomach!

376
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
[SHO]
Uh...

377
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,416
Don't you realize
everyone you know

378
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,041
is worried about you right now?

379
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,208
So many people wanna
see you succeed.

00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,333
That includes Jin!

381
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,000
Coach Takagi! And Sakura, too!

382
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,250
Get it together...
So we can compete!

to fight you at your best!

Uh?

You been to a Circus?

00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,250
Everybody in the
audience is on edge.

388
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,041
'Cause they're all anxious.

389
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,083
They don't wanna see one
of the performers fall.

390
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,333
That's what Jin was
trying to say.

391
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,833
[SHO]
Uh...

392
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,875
[KAZUMA] Cheering is about one
thing and one thing alone.

393
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,791
Making other's smile. You guys
reminded me of that once,

394
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,708
so now I'm reminding you.

395
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,083
Jin tells us the
same thing daily.

396

Sorry but that's
not good enough.

The Breakers have to be perfect
at Nationals. Because...

00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,125
If not, I don't think
I can face Sakura!

about it, Haru?!

If you don't believe me,
ask Coach.

That's why she's been
filming at practice!

409
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,500
So that Sakura can see
how far you've come!

it a secret from him for now.

get over this?

you could, Haru?
