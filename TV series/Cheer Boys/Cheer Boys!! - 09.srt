1
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,583
Let's try the Full Turn
Extension next.

2
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,500
[WATARU]
One, two, down, up!

3
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:28,875
[SAKU gasping]

4
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,875
Do it again!

5
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:34,416
Right. I'm sorry, Coach.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,125
[BREAKERS]
One... two... three, Breakers!

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:41,541
[BREAKERS chattering]

8
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,166
Uh? What do you need?

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,041
Oh, nothing!

10
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,666
It's nothing at all, Miss!

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,791
Step back. That's "Coach"
to the two of you.

12
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,458
[BOTH]
Uh! We're sorry, Kin!

13
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,583
[HARUKI]
Hm...

14
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,375
Kirari. Come on!

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,666
You've already read my message

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,708
so why the heck
won't you just reply?

17
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,208
Kirari?

18
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,208
Stop invading my privacy and
mind your own business, man!

19
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,333
Hey, you're the one
thinkin' out loud.

20
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,208
Gen. Do you know
where she is?

21
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,416
[GEN]
Not a clue!

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,583
[ICHIRO] Hey, come back!
You know something!

23
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,458
All right. What's going on?

24
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:16,458
Why do you think everyone's
acting so weird today? Kazu?

25
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,250
Hello?

26
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,875
Uh! Oh. Yeah. Sounds good.

27
00:02:54,416 --> 00:03:00,958
[STUDENTS chattering]

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,583
Kazu, you okay?

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,458
Uh! Yep. I'm great!

30
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,625
Are you sure?

31
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,416
I'm just a little worried
about regionals.

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,041
Working on new stunts
for 'em sounded fun,

33
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,416
but it's gonna take a whole
lot of practice, you know?

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,166
Hard work's never bothered
you before, Kazu.

35
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,625
Yeah, you're right. My bad.

36
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,166
It's easy enough to turn over
a few heads of broccoli.

37
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,708
But turning over
an entire team

38
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,500
and making them the best in
the show is no small task!

39
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,458
True dat. Right on, bro!

40
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,750
[TAKERU]
Don't call me that.

41
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,500
Takumi. Stop calling
everyone "bro."

42
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,375
[TAKUMI]
Yeah, whatever you say, bro.

43
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,625
Sho, is there a trick to
the Full Turn Extension,

44
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,291
or does it just take time, bro?

45
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,500
He's not your bro, bro!

46
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,416
A trick? Not really, you
just have to get it right.

47
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,375
When you lift up the flyer, use
their heel as an axis point.

48
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,458
When they start to rise,
that's when you twist.

49
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,500
[TAKUMI]
Huh?

50
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,875
[TAKERU]
What? Sorry, I blacked out.

51
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,125
Hey, that's good advice.

52
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,875
I suck. Big time.

53
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,041
I completely screwed
up the Full Turn.

54
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,875
How do I get better at it? Kazu?

55
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,833
Uh. Yeah.

56
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm in a hurry. Gotta go.

57
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,375
[HARUKI] I know something's
wrong with him. But what?

58
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,000
[HARUKI]
Uh?

59
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,750
[gasps]

60
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,875
Hey, Sis.

61
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,041
Uh? What's up?

62
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,291
Are you okay?

63
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,541
Why wouldn't I be?

64
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,708
Nevermind. Just thought I'd ask.

65
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,291
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

66
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,541
I saw you and Kazu. Cheering.

67
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,041
[gasps]

68
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,166
[HARUKO] Why would you do
that at the school festival

69
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,708
in front of all those people?

70
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,291
Do you like getting that
kind of attention?

71
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,208
The Men's Cheer Club?

72
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,583
Come on. What do
you think you are?

73
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,541
Welp. Good talk.

74
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,541
[HARUKI sighs]

75
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,125
[SAKU] What? For real?
Kazu's taking today off?

76
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,833
[TAKAGI] Yes. He sent me a
message letting me know.

77
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,083
It's news to me.

78
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,708
Haru. Did you know
anything about this?

79
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,333
I didn't.

80
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,583
[SAKU exhales]

81
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,541
But the regionals are
right around the corner.

82
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,000
Where could he be?

83
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,250
No clue. But without him,
there's not a lot we can do.

84
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,250
At least not with
the new material.

85
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,291
Worry about yourselves,
not the Captain!

[DOH, GIN grunt]
Yes, sir!

87
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,333
And look me in the eyes
when you talk to me!

00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,958
[BOTH]
Yes, sir!

89
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,333
Well, there's nothing we can
do about it now, right?

90
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,708
Let's buckle down and get
outta here early, guys!

Hey, Gen. You're in a good mood.

92
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,458
Did something happen?

93
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,625
Nope, not really.

[ICHIRO growling]

95
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,000
Haru. I fear our friend
has been afflicted.

96
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,000
With what?

97
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,208
It's perfectly obvious.

98
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,375
Not to me.

99
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,250
With love!

100
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,083
Oh! Wow!

101
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,333
[WATARU]
It's plain as day.

102
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,083
How would you know, you
haven't been in love?

103
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,000
[WATARU]
Ouch.

[BREAKERS chattering]

105
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,916
[HARUKI]
Mm? Hey.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,916
I'm afraid that she
might be in love.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,666
Oh?

108
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,916
Wait. Who's this?

Kirari, duh!

110
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,541
I still don't know who that is!

111
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,666
My sister!

112
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,166
I didn't know you
had a sister, too.

113
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,291
She's way too young
to fall in love!

114
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,833
Well, then go and
ruin it for her.

115
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,541
That's what older siblings
do best, right?

116
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,041
I'm trying, dude!

117
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,416
But it's kinda hard when she
already has a freakin' date!

118
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,541
How do you know about
that? She tell you?

119
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,083
No, she didn't tell me.

120
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,041
I got all ninja and listened
in on her phone call.

121
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,833
She won't even tell me the name
of the guy she's talking to.

122
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,250
She's super pissed 'cause she
caught me eavesdropping.

123
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,583
Apparently, I'm not as good at
the ninja-thing as I thought.

124
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,500
Which is exactly why I
need you to help me, Haru!

125
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,791
What?

126
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,666
[ICHIRO]
She should be here any second.

127
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,625
[HARUKI] Are you sure you don't
have "ninja" confused with

128
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,791
"creepy stalker"?

129
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,541
Oh, it'll be ninja, my friend.

130
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,958
Cause once her date shows up I'm
gonna go Bruce Lee oh his face!

131
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,583
Right, but considering
what happened,

132
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,708
isn't this just gonna
piss her off even more?

133
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,666
You don't have a little sister,
okay? You wouldn't understand.

134
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,166
You're right, I wouldn't,

135
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,291
which is why you should ask
someone besides me for help.

136
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,750
Like Gen?

137
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,666
I can't. He's been acting
like a total weirdo lately.

138
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,958
And Kazu has too.
What's that all about?

139
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,625
Well...

140
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,833
Maybe they're both--

141
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,708
What? In love?!

142
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,916
Come on, dude, there's
no way that's it.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,625
If he was into a girl? He'd
totally tell me about it.

144
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,250
She's pretty cute, huh?

145
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,083
Her? Well...

146
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:37,458
Yeah. I guess. Like
in her... own way.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,958

And Gen?

148
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,291
[HARUKI]
I don't know, in my opinion,

149
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,333
he seemed like he was in
a pretty good mood today.

150
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,208

Mm!

Ah, it's all good.
I just got here myself.

[KIRARI]
I'm glad to hear it!

So, is he her date then? Yikes.

little sister behind my back!

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,875
Slow down!

162
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,125
That's a really lovely
outfit you have on.

163
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,666
It matches your eyes.

164
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,458
[ICHIRO growls]

165
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,583
Shall we? I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go.

166
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,416
For the day's duration, consider
me your knightly escort.

167
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,458
[ICHIRO growls]

168
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,458
Who's knightly now,
you jerk off?!

169
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,500
[HARUKI]
Ichiro!

170
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,833
Huh?!

171
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,000
Bro...

172
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,625
[KIRARI]
Huh?

173
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,333
[ICHIRO growls]

174
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,291
[KIRARI]
Hey, Ichiro.

175
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,208
[ICHIRO growls]

176
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,166
[GEN]
Are you okay?

177
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,583
[ICHIRO screams]

178
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,583
Kirari picked this out
just for me!

179
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,000
She was worried
cause she didn't know

180
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,208
what to get you
for your birthday,

181
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,333
so I agreed I'd help her
look for something.

182
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,083
So yeah, it wasn't weird.

183
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,458
I'm glad we got
that cleared up.

184
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,583
[WATARU] Hijinks.
What a comedy of errors.

185
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,125
Speaking of...

186
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,375
There's something we feel
that we must show you.

187
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,250
[HARUKI]
Huh?

188
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,875
Coach Takagi sent us this video

189
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,416
and it's peculiar to
say the very least.

190
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,750
[SHO]
Everybody focus!

191
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,416
Your cradle's loose, bases!

192
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,458
[GEN]
What am I watching right now?

193
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,208
[HARUKI] I mean... It looks
like a Sho fan video.

194
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,833
That's exactly what it is!

195
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,291
And when someone
makes one of these,

196
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,500
there's only one
possible reason!

197
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,791
She's fallen in love
with Sho. Right?

198
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,375
Like, what else could it be?!

199
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,625
Oh snap!

200
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,500
Sweet! That's like every
man's secret fantasy!

201
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,125
The thing is, we can't bring
ourselves to tell Kin.

202
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,125
Yet we feel completely horrible
for withholding the truth!

203
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,458
This is hell!

204
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:36,083
Haruki, please. You gotta
help us out here, buddy!

205
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,291
What? The video I sent to Gin?

206
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, right! That wasn't meant for
him. Total mistake on my part.

207
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,458
I did put it together.

208
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,666
But I intended to send it
to... one of Sho's fans.

209
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,166
Which fan?

210
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,833
Thing is... I'm keeping it
a secret from him for now.

211
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,166
But I'll explain everything
when the time is right.

212
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,000
Uh. Cool.

213
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,041
Oh, man. Glad that's done!

214
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,666
Thanks for sorting it out.

215
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,083
Yeah, for sure.

216
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,833
Just remember not to jump
to conclusions next time.

217
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,291
[HARUKI]
I bet Kazu's fine, too.

218
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,791
[SHO]
Well?! Let's get started, guys!

219
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,291
Hey. Hold on.

220
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,583
It looks like Kazu's out again.

221
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,208
It's not like him
to miss practice

222
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,541
without letting us know.

223
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,333
[WATARU]
No. It isn't.

224
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,833
He's definitely okay. Right?

225
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,333
I hope.

226
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,000
[TON] I can't believe Kazu
just no-showed on us.

227
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,291
[HARUKI] He's not checking
his messages, either.

228
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,666
[SHO]
Something's definitely going on.

229
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,458
[TAKUYA]
I just hope he's all right.

230
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,750
Same here. He never
did this in judo.

231
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,208
I can't imagine what would make
him no-show without telling us.

232
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,500
He's been shot with
Cupid's arrow.

233
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,708
Right through his poor,
tender heart.

234
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,458
If music be the food of love--

235
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,958
Then play on?

236
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,708
I, too, am drunk on love.

237
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:52,875
[GIN, DOH]
For real?!

238
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,833
So what, he ditched
practice for a date?

239
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,208
Maybe he tried to
kiss her goodnight

240
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,833
and she slapped his face?

241
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,625
Or maybe she punched him right
where it hurts the most. Huh?!

242
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,500
Or perhaps she broke
his fragile heart?

243
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,291
I just don't see Kazu
missing practice

244
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,750
over something like that.

245
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,916
Yeah. Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, guys.

246
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,333
[SAKU]
Mm...

247
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,875
[bell rings]

248
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,125
[BREAKERS chattering]

249
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,625
Hey, Sho? I think I should
drop by his place.

250
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,875
Please do. Thank you.

251
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:23,583
[SAKU]
Haru.

252
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,125
[HARUKI]
Uh?

253
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,875
Look. I lied.

254
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,916
I actually do know
where Kazu is.

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,625
I was worried about him.

256
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,750
So I decided to follow
him after school.

257
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,583
The thing is... It's
his grandmother.

258
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,291
I don't think she's doing well.

259
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,666
Yeah, Granny's fine!.

260
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,458
She sure hasn't
lost her appetite,

261
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,583
girl eats a dozen apples a day.

262
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,166
She talks and talk and talks

263
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,625
and when I try to leave
she won't let me!

264
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,958
[HARUKI exhales]

265
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,166
I'm on it. I'll try going
by the hospital first.

266
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,375
[SAKU]
Mm.

267
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,416
[gasps]

268
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,750
Uh!

269
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,208
[KAZUMA]
Hey, bud.

270
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,541
Thanks a lot.

271
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,375
[KAZUMA]
I'm sorry about practice.

272
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,583
[HARUKI]
I get it.

273
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,750
Really though. I feel bad.

274
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,208
Coach told me that a team's
Captain is like its sun.

275
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,750
This is, I'm not feelin' very
bright at the moment. Sorry.

276
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,000
It's funny. The crazy stuff
the guys were saying.

277
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,250
Like how you got dumped.

278
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,708
By the secret girlfriend
you've been hiding.

279
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,291
[KAZUMA laughs]
That's ridiculous.

280
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,833
Kazu, is your Grandma sick?

281
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,000
Truth is, I've been lying to
you this whole time, Haru.

282
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,166
About her having
a good appetite.

283
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,541
About her talking so much
she wouldn't let me leave.

284
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,291
I wish that were
all true, I really do.

285
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,083
But it's not...

286
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,708
Granny doesn't even know
who I am anymore.

287
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,708
[gasps]

288
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,541
One by one, she's slowly
losing her memories.

289
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,250
She can barely remember her
own name, much less mine.

290
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,458
But one day,

291
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,541
she saw some cheerleaders on TV.

292
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,583
[GRANDMOTHER]
Kasu...

293
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,041
[KAZUMA]
Uh?

294
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,333
Kasumi.

295
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:41,000
"Kasumi." Yeah. She just said
my Mom's name out of the blue.

296
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,791
It was the cheerleaders.

297
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,500
Somehow, they jarred her
memory and opened it up.

298
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,458
And that's when I got an idea.

299
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,666
If I did my parents'
cheer routine,

300
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,958
then maybe somehow she'd
remember me, too.

301
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,791
I wanna do that routine
at the school festival.

302
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,500
Just like my parents
did back in college!

303
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:04,166
Look. I thought about telling
you so many different times.

304
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,041
But, I...

305
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,458
I was scared to say it out loud

306
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,291
cause I thought I'd
lose my courage.

307
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,708
And if I lost that I was afraid
I'd lose her forever, too.

308
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,875
Dumb. I know.

309
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,625
Not dumb.

310
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,500
[KAZUMA] But it's all over now,
so what difference does it make?

311
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,458
I'm done cheerleading.
I've lost the will for it.

312
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,041
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,208
I know I told you I wanted to
start something new with you,

314
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,000
but it was for selfish reasons.

315
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,625
And now I've dragged
everyone else into it.

316
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,916
I feel like a jerk.

317
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:39,166
[KAZUMA]
Haru. I'm all alone now.

318
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,083
My family... The people
