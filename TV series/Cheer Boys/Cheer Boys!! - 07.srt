1
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,083
[KAZUMA] Well, guys?
Today we practice stunts.

2
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,375
[ALL gasping]

3
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,875
But first, we're gonna
put on a demonstration.

4
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,791
This is to benefit our new
recruits, so watch closely.

5
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,750
[ALL]
Mm.

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,666
[KAZUMA] Haru you're flying.
Wataru, you're the spotter.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,625
And the bases'll be Ichiro and--

8
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,125
[SHO]
I'll do it.

9
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,875
[GEN, TON gasping]

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,041
Are you sure?

11
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,708
[SHO exhales]

12
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,500
Let's go.

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:51,791
[WATARU]
One, two, down, up, down, up!

14
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,375
[gasps]

15
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,166
That was crazy!

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,333
I blinked and then I
was all the way up!

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,041
[ICHIRO gasping]

18
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,541
Hey, way to go!

19
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,041
[DOH] That was awesome!
Damn he's good.

20
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,791
Did you see how he positioned
the flyer in one push?

21
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,416
That's what perfect technique
looks like, people.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,041
You totally nailed it, Sho!

23
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,708
Dude... that... hurts.
Cut it out.

24
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,208
I barely had to do a thing.

25
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,833
I've never seen
anything like that!

26
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,375
[ICHIRO]
He overcame his past!

27
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,708
I thought it was gonna haunt
him for the rest of his life.

28
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,083
It looks like we have
four stunt groups now.

29
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,416
According to my math,
we're one flyer short.

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,416
[ZI XUAN]
Yoo-hoo!

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,541
[ALL]
Uh?

32
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,333
[ZI XUAN]
Way to go, Sho! Ha, ha, ha!

33
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,375
You lifted him up so high!

34
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,083
[ICHIRO, GEN]
There's our last flyer!

35
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,541
He is bendy.

36
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:40,791
[ZI XUAN]
Oh?

37
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,375
If you do cheerleading,
you'll finally be cool!

38
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,416
And all the hotties'll want ya!

39
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,458
You like fried curry?
You can eat mine.

40
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,958
If you dance like a squirrel,
you'll fly like one, too.

41
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,291
[ZI XUAN]
Hm?

42
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,875
Come on. You wanna do
something exciting, Chen?

43
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,875
Then why not join
the Men's Cheer Club?

44
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,625
You mean it?

45
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,791
Yeah, for sure.

46
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,291
If you really wanna
be in the Breakers,

47
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,666
all you have to say is say so!

48
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,625
I want in!

49
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,208
[ALL]
All right! [laughing]

50
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,833
[SHO] Let's talk formations
for regionals.

51
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,833
We have 16 team members now.

52
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,125
Which means we'll have
four stunt groups.

53
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:56,333
The bases are Ichiro,
Ton, Hisashi, Takeru,

54
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,958
Takuya, Takumi, Kin, and me.

55
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,291
[SHO]
Here are the spotters:

56
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:07,291
Wataru, Gen, Gin, and Doh.

57
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:14,333
[SHO] The flyers are Kazu,
Haru, Saku, and last, Chen.

58
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,333
There're several stunts
I'd like us to perfect.

59
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:23,083
First up, we'll need to learn
the Single Base Extension.

60
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:28,125
After that, the
Half-Turn Elevator.

61
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,041
And last, there's the
Three-Layer Pyramid.

62
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:37,416
This one's complicated, but
when it works, people love it.

63
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,625
I know you two are bases
first and foremost.

64
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,375
But I'd like to put you in the
middle for the Pyramid Stunt.

65
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,875
I'm a prideful man. I'll
not refuse this request.

66
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,625
Awesome! I've been waiting
for my chance to stand out!

67
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,750
Listen up boys. Our goal here
is a routine that's masculine

68
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,375
and dynamic, but doesn't
rely on strength alone.

69
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,333
It's tough. But it is doable.
If we work hard enough,

70
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,333
we can surpass the Dreams
and the Sparks!

71
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,041
[ALL chattering]

72
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,625
Also, starting today I'll be
recording our practice sessions.

73
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,625
That way we can monitor
our progress. Got it?

74
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,125
Right on! Let's get
crackin', guys!

75
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,750
For the new members,
just focus on the basics.

76
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,125
Once you have those down,
you can move onto stunts.

77
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,083
[ALL]
Yeah!

78
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,458
[TAKERU]
Buh. Buh. Buh-roccoli!

79
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,708
[TAKAGI laughs]

80
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,291
The OG really will laugh
at anything, won't she?

81
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,208
What is he, in kindergarten?

82
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,458
Hey, Takeru! Save standing
out for regionals, 'kay?

83
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,291
This is to prepare you for
tumbling, so everyone, focus.

84
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,166
Stop joking around
and get in position.

85
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,875
[SAKU groaning]

86
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,333
[SAKU]
It's too hard!

87
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,041
[crash]

88
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,125
I can't keep up yet.

89
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,625
Ahh! Too hard!

90
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,250
Of course it is. That's
why you hafta practice.

91
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,250
I can't do it. I'm just
not strong enough, yet.

92
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,125
I think I'm gonna go home
and take a power nap.

93
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,166
If you can't even do a
handstand you're useless.

94
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,583
Where do you get off
screwing around

95
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,708
when you still haven't
mastered the basics?

96
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,000
[BOTH gasp]

97
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,125
Please, Captain. They need
additional training.

98
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,583
If you want them to improve,

99
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,208
they'll have to build
a little muscle first.

100
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,458
This a training program
you'd recommend?

101
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,791
Oh, no! This is gonna turn
me into a musclehead!

102
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,000
[HISASHI]
You can't get any better

103
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,833
as long as you're this
weak. So work out.

104
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,958
Eh, I'll get serious
eventually, dude.

105
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,041
[HISASHI] Do you know
who makes excuses like that?

106
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,000
Losers and dropouts.

107
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,083
Take it back!

108
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,708
[SHO]
We're in the middle of practice.

109
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,916
[TAKUYA]
Sho's right. Knock it off, guys.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,916
[KIN] You don't disrespect
your teammates. Got it?

111
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,625
[HARUKI]
Uh.

112
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,833
[BREAKERS]
One, two, down, up!

113
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,875
Go, fight, win!

114
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,458
I just remembered.
I gotta be at work soon.

115
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,625
Like, now-ish.

116
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,875
Uh?

117
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,041
[TAKUMI]
Oh, yeah. I've got work, too.

118
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,375
[TAKUYA] Well? Don't tell us,
tell the coach.

119
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,416
[GUYS] Thank you very much,
Coach. We'll see you tomorrow!

120
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,625
[HISASHI] We're all pieces
of the same puzzle.

121
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,708
When one person isn't here,
the whole team suffers.

122
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,875
Tell them to schedule
their jobs around practice.

123
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,750
Are you the Captain
or aren't you?

124
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,791
[KAZUMA sighs]
Of course I'm the Captain.

125
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,416
But I can't force
them to do that.

126
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,916
[HARUKI]
Uh.

127
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,708
[HARUKI] Well, you sure are
early. Doin' some stretches?

128
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,625
Stretching's pretty
important for flyers, too.

129
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,333
But that would require them
getting here early.

130
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,958
Earlier than now.
Before their bases.

131
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,916
Huh?!

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,125
[HISASHI] We're about to
start and no one's here.

133
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,750
This team is a friggin' joke.

134
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,333
[KAZUMA]
Where's Kin?

135
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:53,666
[GIN] He said his teacher
wanted to meet him after class.

136
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,500
[DOH] I know it's a
really big day for us,

137
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,916
but there's nothing
he could do.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,041
When your grades are on the line
you do what you're told.

139
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,291
[TAKUMI] My brother said he'd
be running late, as well. He--

140
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,541
He slides, and he's safe!

141
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,875
The hell he is...

142
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,958
Sorry I'm late again, Coach.

143
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,416
If 'sorry' made it right,
we wouldn't need punishment.

144
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,000
[ALL gasp]

145
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,708
I don't suppose you've heard the
saying, 'time is money" before?

146
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,166
I got an idea.

147
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,583
You gotta pay ten bucks for
every minute you're late!

148
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,500
Math isn't exactly my specialty,

149
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,666
but I think that means you
owe at least a hundred.

150
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,291
Yeah, I'm not payin' you a cent!

151
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,708
[GEN, ICHIRO laugh]

152
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,583
It's a good thing, 'cause
you'd be flat broke.

153
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,791
You know what, maybe a
fine's not a bad idea.

154
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,750
Well guys? Starting now,
if you're late? You pay.

Every time Hisashi opens his
mouth, it's like my heart stops.

157
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,125
He always has to
have the last word.

158
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:48,166
[KAZUMA] No, he just
needs to... loosen up.

159
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,125
We have to do something
about this, fast.

160
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,125
Uh?

161
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,125
Hisashi!

162
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,791
[HISASHI]
Uh?

163
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,375
You wanna come eat
lunch with us, man?

164
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,708
I guess. If you insist.

165
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,291
Looks healthy.

166
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,250
So what's the deal,
you on some kinda diet?

167
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,750
Obviously, yes.

168
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,333
It's important that we build
up our muscles properly.

169
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,291
Which means cutting
down on carbohydrates

170
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,750
and eating high-quality
proteins.

171
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,583
Wow, you're even
drinking protein.

172
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,375
[HISASHI] I see none of you
are cutting back. Of course.

173
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,500
[KAZUMA, HARUKI, SHO]
Uh...

174
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,208
[TON grunting]

175
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,125
Good. But don't look down.
And don't sway!

176
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,708
Right. Sorry, Sho.

177
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,000
[SHO] Ton, do you need
to take a break?

178
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,583
[TON]
Uh. Yeah.

179
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,958
I'm sorry, guys.

180
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,333
[ICHIRO] S'all good.
Don't push yourself too hard.

181
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,208
All right. You're in, Hisashi.

182
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,416
Good.

183
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,333
Come on, Tono.
You're better than this.

184
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,875
What?

185
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,916
Well? Let's go!

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,125
[WATARU]
One, two, down, up!

187
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,375
[TAKAGI]
Yes! Just like that, boys!

188
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,250
You're in a great
position, Hisashi.

189
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,500
Don't forget how this feels.

190
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,875
Right!

191
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,666
[HARUKI] Hisashi sure was
full of energy today.

192
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,750
[SHO] He's a natural. I think
he'll make a really solid base.

193
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:26,833
[HARUKI grunts]

194
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:27,916
[SHO]
What's going on?

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,041
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

196
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,458
Just cause your
shift's about to end

197
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,333
doesn't mean you
get to slack off!

198
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,125
[BOTH]
We're very sorry, sir.

199
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,708
[HARUKI]
Hm?

200
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,833
[KAZUMA]
You want us to practice more?

201
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,333
Yessir.

202
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,500
Regionals are only
two months away.

203
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,875
Yet some of us still
can't do stunts.

204
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,750
If we want to make
it to Nationals,

205
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,875
then we have to
step up our game.

206
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,583
It's either that, or we fail.

207
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,125
I think we're doing well.

208
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,208
Slowly but surely,
everyone's getting better.

209
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,083
And we have Coach
Takagi on our side.

210
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,708
Let's not rush things.

211
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,458
Your optimism is admirable.

212
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,750
But how will you feel
when we don't qualify?

213
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,000
The blame for that
will fall on you.

214
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,166
Hisashi. You have to remember,

215
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,833
not everyone can work
at this like you.

216
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,208
Try to have a little patience.

217
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,083
[HISASHI growls]

218
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,500
[KAZUMA] They're not
as strong as you are,

219
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,291
and they don't have as
much free time, either.

220
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,541
That's bull!

221
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,833
The real problem is they
don't take it seriously.

222
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,958
They just goof around and
treat everything like a game.

223
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,791
Isn't the Captain supposed to
punish them when they act up?

224
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,625
You need to do your job!

225
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,333
I'm trying, man.

226
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,500
[gasps] Forgive me. Please.

227
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,000
But if we're going to compete.
We'll have to outwork them.

228
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:50,458
This is really the Sparks'
training regimen? It's intense.

229
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,958
[HISASHI]
That's all I wanted to say. Bye.

230
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,291
Hey, Hisashi, hold on!

231
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,791
[HARUKI, SHO gasp]

232
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,916
What's up?

233
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,666
We thought up a dance.
Think you'll like it.

234
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,958
We dig the routine.
But what would really make it

235
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,708
is if we threw a little
'pop and lock' in the mix.

236
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,083
This is gonna be an awesome
addition, thank you.

237
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,208
Check it. We made you CDs.

238
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,833
You can practice at home now.

239
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,583
[WATARU] I am a poor dancer.
But I will try.

240
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,750
Thanks a lot, you two.
This is great.

241
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,791
Wanted to make up for
being late before.

242
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,041
Speaking of being late,
where's Kazuma?

243
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,291
[door opens]

244
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,375
[KAZUMA]
Sorry I kept you waiting.

245
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,500
[ICHIRO] You're usually
the first one here, man.

246
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,041
I was just busy blowing
up these balance balls.

247
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,041
Happy to pay a fine though.

248
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,666
--[ICHIRO laughing]
--[SAKU gasping]

249
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,833
I bought 'em today.

250
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,000
Sparks train with these
so we should, too.

251
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,291
Hold on. How do you
know about that?

252
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,041
Well... Because Hisashi told me.

253
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,375
Ohh.

254
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,583
That's not all. There's
a lot we can incorporate.

255
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,291
For example, we should start
working on squat standups.

256
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,166
[HISASHI]
Huh?

257
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,000
Good idea. Keep 'em comin'!

258
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,958
Ugh. I'm sorry
I'm late everybody.

259
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,833
So what's your excuse today?

260
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,083
[TAKERU]
Uh. Traffic?

261
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,333
Your fine's 2,000 big ones!

262
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,500
Here take these instead!

263
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,000
I appreciate the gesture,
but no thank you.

264
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,291
We're in the middle of
practice now. Let's eat later!

265
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,250
[TAKERU] If we don't dig in
while they're still hot,

266
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,750
then what's the point?

267
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,291
Come on, guys, practice just
started. Let's take it slow.

268
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,333
[HISASHI]
Slow? What are you, a turtle?

269
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,500
[TAKERU]
Hm?

270
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,333
[HISASHI]
No, that's an insult to turtles.

271
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,625
You're much worse.

272
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,666
Look bro, you need to
take a chil pill!

273
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,416
Working hard and having fun
aren't mutually exclusive,

274
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
don't you know that?

275
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,375
In your mouth...

276
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,750
Listen up, Takeru.

277
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,458
You may not give a rat's ass
whether we win or lose,

278
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,666
but I do. So stop
acting like a moron

279
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,375
and try to show the
team some respect!

280
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,041
I already said I'm sorry.

281
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't know what else
you want from me, man.

282
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,750
Just relax, it's fine!

283
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,208
Oh yeah? Then show
me your handstand.

284
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,791
[TAKERU]
Huh?

285
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,125
You've followed the program I
made for you and Saku, right?

286
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,000
If it's fine, then
what's the problem?

287
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,958
There's no problem!
Just watch this!

288
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,375
[BOTH gasp]

289
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,500
I don't understand why you're
always so mean to him.

290
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,916
We're all on the same team!

291
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,875
[HARUKI]
Oh, wow.

292
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,416
[KAZUMA] You can do it
without leaning on a wall!

293
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,166
Yeah, well a handstand
won't win us any prizes.

294
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,291
At least I'm trying. Jerk.

295
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,500
[TAKERU] Why the hell do you
always have to tear people down

296
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,291
the minute they step in
the right direction!

297
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,458
You're as cold as ice!

298
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,625
Like I care what you think,

waste of space!

[KAZUMA]
Come on, guys, stop it!

303
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,416
There's no reason for us
to fight each other.

304
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,125
[ALL shouting]

305
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,250
I guess that fight was
a long time coming.

306
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,250
Yeah, no kidding.

307
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:29,125
They're just polar opposites.
There's no changing that.

308
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,208
They go together
like oil and water.

309
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,791
I wish we could think up a way
to help them get along better.

[DAD]
Why're you apologizing?

311
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,041
[HARUKO] I lost.
My winning streak's over.

312
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,208
[HARUKI, KAZUMA gasp]

313
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,125
[DAD] All that matters
is the next match.

314
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,958
If you win that, you'll get even
stronger. I believe in you.

315
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,791
[HARUKO] Thanks, Dad.
I won't let this happen again!

316
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,875
I know you're worried about her,
but there's no need, Haru.

317
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,000
She's gonna be just fine,
trust me.

318
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,916
Your sister's always been
as tough as nails.

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,666
[HARUKI]
Yeah...

320
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,166
[HARUKI] Now that I quit,
it's all on her.

321
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,291
[phone chimes]

322
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,625
[HARUKI]
Uh?

323
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,916
[KAZUMA]
A team Christmas party?

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,083
Indeed.

325
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,125
But we don't have any
girls on the team.

326
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,791
So we're deckin' the halls
without any Hollys.

327
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,166
What about your girl?
You think she'll mind?

328
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,958
Not if she can still
give me my present

329
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,000
the night before Christmas.

330
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,166
Naughty boy!

331
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,791
I'm worried about
Hisashi and Takeru.

332
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,833
They're upset...
And they need to make up.

333
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,583
I agree and a party's a good
way to make it happen.

334
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,708
Well, if Hisashi's
willing, it is.

335
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,166
Who knows, maybe the party'll
break him out of his shell!

336
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,041
If the Breakers can't pull
it off, then nobody can!

337
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,166
[HARUKI]
Good call. Whaddaya say, Cap?

338
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,541
[KAZUMA] I'm down!
Let's do this together!

339
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,833
[ALL]
Right!

340
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,125
[ZI XUAN]
My goodness, what a feast!

341
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,500
[SAKU]
Oh, wow. This is great!

342
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,750
Best Christmas ever!

343
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,500
[GIN]
So, uh...

344
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,875
That cake look
kinda weird to you?

345
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,916
I'll give you a buck
if you try it first.

346
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,208
[TAKUMI]
This some kinda decoration?

347
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,000
[TAKUYA] Looks like they spent
all their money on food.

348
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,375
This sucks.

349
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,125
How come we couldn't invite
the girls team along?

350
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,375
Well, I invited Coach Takagi.

351
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,708
But she said she was busy and
that I needed to get a life.

352
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,625
[BOTH sigh]

353

Ladies, and gentlemen, too!

356
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,416
There ain't a single
lady here and you kno--

357

[ALL gasp]

358
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,500
[WATARU] Yes, well... Thank you
all for gathering here today.

359
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,833
We sure hope you guys're
ready for a good time!

360
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,875
[ICHIRO]
Who's your date, Haru?

361
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,708
[HARUKI]
Hey! Cool it with the pictures!

362
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,416
Go ahead, make me a star.

363
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,708
[GEN] Put that tail
away, Bunny Foo-Foo!

364
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,333
And now for a few words
from our fearless leader.

365
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,625
Why don't we forget about
cheering for today?

366
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,833
Let's eat, drink and be merry.
Here's to the Cheer Boys!

367
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,958
All right! Grab your cups!

368
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,333
[BREAKERS]
Merry... Breakers!

369
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,625
[BREAKERS chattering, laughing]

370
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,583
[TAKUMI] Come on. Can't I just
have like one little bite?

371
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,541
No way dude. You'll just
break out in hives again.

372
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,833
You allergic to shrimp,
Takumi? That sucks, man.

373
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,916
[TAKUMI sighs]

374
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,208
Hisashi, you can eat it.
You wanna bite?

375
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,250
No thanks. Chili shrimp
has way too many calories.

376
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,375
You're joking.

377
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,750
Okay. Try this.

378
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,291
It's Bang-Bang Chicken.

379
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:47,000
[HISASHI]
Uh? Thank you very much.

380
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,375
[KIN]
Hisashi. Your cup's empty.

381
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,458
Oh, well thanks a lot.

382
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,375
[HARUKI] Who's ready to
open their presents?!

383
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,625
Ready or not, here it comes!

384
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,750
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

385
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:06,541
Like they say, "To the
victor goes the spoils."

386
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,875
Oh, hell no,
this is not my gift.

387
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:19,291
[TAKERU] This is awesome!
Rice crackers are munchie gold!

388
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,375
Really? My parents
actually made those.

389
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah? Tell 'em thanks for me!

390
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
I told them I was trying
to cut back on carbs,

391
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,375
but they insisted
I bring them anyway.

392
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,291
I'm so sorry.

393
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,666
Well, come on. There's
no need to be sorry,

394
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,666
these rice crackers are
freakin' delicious, man!

396
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,416
Yeah, what is it?

397
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,791
I went too far the
other day. My bad.

398
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,166
Uh?

399
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,666
Yeah, me, too. I'm sorry.

400
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,458
No, please. Really

00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,791
[TAKUMI]
Yeah, uh, my name's Takumi.

405
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,375
You don't say?

406
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,291
Do me a favor and bring me
another one, would ya, Hisashi?

Whoa! Hey dad!
It's so good to see ya!

That's really cool, Chen.

410
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,583
I had no idea you were
training to be a gymnast!

411
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,750
Sure was.

412
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
That's why I can bend
my leg like this.

413
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,708
It's so much fun to be on
a real team with my friends!

414
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:34,708
Anyone who bends like he
does is a friend of mine.

415
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,208
Harder to find a job
than I thought it'd be.

416
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,708
Yeah, it's a time suck,
that's for sure.

417
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,250
So how many places have
you applied to?

That's not that many.

420
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,750
No, but between that and
school I'd sure like a break.

421
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,125
I could use one.

422
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,416
I like breaks! How does some
'r and r' sound, guys?

we're never gonna
perfect the pyramid!

Every time you take time
off, you hurt the team.

You're not a kid anymore
so stop acting like it!

You can't leave without

quitting the Breakers.
