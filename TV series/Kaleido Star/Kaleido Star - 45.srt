00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,666
Hello everyone!
Kaleido Star is about to begin.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,291
While you're watching
Kaleido Star,

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,250
make sure to keep
your room brightly lit,

4
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,458
and don't sit too
close to the telly!

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,000
Cheers!

6
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,208
Well well well.
Rosetta here!

7
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,416
Did you guys see my trapeze act?

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,625
I was so excited to
perform with Sora.

9
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:40,000
I admire her so much.
I'm gonna train hard like Sora

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,083
and become an even
better trapeze artist.

11
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm gonna give it another shot
during our next circus tour.

12
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:49,291
I've met a very special person
on tour, and that person is...

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,416
I'd better not give
it away just yet!

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,333
Let's perform
together again today!

15
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,625
Let's, let's, let's!

16
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
But... uh...

17
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,458
So that's the deal. I've even
gotten the boss's permission.

18
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,791
Hold on!

19
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,666
I've gotta meet my mom,
so I'm heading out early.

20
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,208
Oh, oh yeah, that's right.

21
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,000
Here are eight plane
tickets. Take 'em!

22
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,250
Thanks, but I...

23
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,333
There's also some info
on where we're going.

24
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,416
Uh, sure. But what do I...

25
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,458
Okay, see you in France.

26
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,041
Um... right.
See you in France.

27
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,125
In France!!

28
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,833
Leon's Amazing Past.

29
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,791
I get it.

30
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,250
So she must have had her mother
Anne get all of this together.

31
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,666
I guess Mr. Kennth's show
sparked a fire in Rosetta.

32
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,708
Apparently the only condition
is she has to do Diabolo

33
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,291
in the show that
Anne has planned.

34
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,666
So that's why she left a week
early, to practice Diabolo.

35
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,708
I can't speak for everyone,
but the Clown team

36
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,208
never dreamed of an
opportunity like this.

37
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,875
Aren't you excited, Ken?

38
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,333
I'm not a clown right now,
I'm your manager.

39
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,291
You know, we haven't
been back to France

40
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,000
since the circus festival.

41
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,666
That's why we have to make sure
this trip is a happier one.

42
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,000
--That's right.
--Mm hmm.

43
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,541
Excuse me?

44
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,833
Is she smiling?

45
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,958
How long are you going
to stand around chatting?

46
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,666
You're wasting my time.

47
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,833
We should have known it
was too good to be true.

48
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,000
Follow me, I found
the taxi stand.

49
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,125
What would you kids do without
me?

50
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,833
This'll be fun, let's go!

51
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,500
Yeah...

52
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,708
I finally figured it out
at Mr. Kenneth's show.

53
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,916
When Sora performs,
she watches the audience.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,708
I was always too busy
watching Sora or Leon perform.

55
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,458
What Sora has that I've
been missing is the ability

56
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:23,375
to please the audience. She has
the power to create smiles.

57
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,708
Now that I know her secret,
I can learn to do it as well.

58
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,875
All I have to do is get my own
smile back first.

59
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,208
That's what Miss Layla was
trying to teach me.

60
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,625
Um... Um... Um...

61
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,375
Uh... Um... Um... cirque noir?

62
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,958
Ah, oui mademoiselle.

63
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,875
Oh good, I think
he understands me!

64
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,416
Well we have to take two taxis,
so I hope you can do it again.

65
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,125
Nous? Um... allez, cirque noir?

66
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,416
Time to wake up Mr. Cabbie!

67
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,708
I know the French like to nap,

68
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,375
but you've got customers
waiting on you.

69
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,041
Oui oui mademoiselle!

70
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,333
I welcome you to the
Noir Circus, Miss Rosetta.

71
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,958
Thanks, I'm very excited.

72
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,583
The others should
be arriving soon.

73
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,583
Do you think it'd be okay
if I wait here for them, sir?

74
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,125
Of course!
Make yourself at home.

75
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,291
I was wondering... I don't
suppose you'd be interested

76
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,958
in doing a little
Diabolo performance

77
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,916
in our show starting tomorrow?

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,208
I could, but I'd have
to charge extra.

79
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,666
In the deal that was worked out,
you were able to contract

80
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,083
former top star Sora Naegino and
circus festival winner May Wong

81
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,125
at one low price.
The only condition was

82
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,208
that you had to cast me
as a trapeze artist.

83
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,625
So Diabolo would
be an extra fee.

84
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,708
Alright, that is
enough, I get it.

85
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,458
Just pretend we never
had this conversation.

86
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,125
I may be inexperienced, but
I've been training really hard.

87
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,083
I promise, I won't disappoint
you or the audience, sir.

88
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,416
I've got high hopes for you.

89
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,041
That is our star, René.

90
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,625
Wow, that was an awesome move!

91
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,958
Looks like you're in
top form today René.

92
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,291
No different than any other day.

93
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,833
Hey!

94
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,250
--Allez.
--Not you again.

95
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,208
Don't get so angry,
I'll be leaving soon.

96
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,541
Huh?

97
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,041
I thought I asked you
not to come here anymore.

98
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,458
That's not very nice.

99
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,083
Do not forget everything
I taught you.

100
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,000
I haven't been your
student for a long time.

101
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,791
You see, the thing is,
I've run out of cash.

102
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,000
You need money to buy alcohol?

103
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:49,666
You know me all too well, uh?
This will be the last time.

104
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,916
Ridiculous.

105
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,000
Merci René, I'll stop by
to pay you, I promise.

106
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,375
I don't want your money.

107
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,333
Just promise you won't
come back here again.

108
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:06,166
You're so generous.
So long, René.

109
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,750
I can't believe him.

110
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,083
Who was that man?

111
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,666
That's Alan Rubel.

112
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,000
He used to be the best trainer
of trapeze artists in the world.

113
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,875
Trapeze artist?!

114
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,666
Alan was what you'd call
a freelance trainer.

115
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,541
He'd scout kids who
seemed to have talent

116
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,541
and train them to be
first class trapeze artists.

117
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,708
He trained many of
the world's finest.

118
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,541
In fact, René was
one of his students.

119
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,916
His skill as a trainer
was world-renowned,

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,916
but he quit several years ago.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,250
You've seen what
he has become now.

122
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,416
A world-renowned trainer
of trapeze artists.

123
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,583
Hey, Rosetta!

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,458
Excuse me!

125
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,541
My name's Rosetta, and I'm
from Kaleido Stage.

126
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,125
Please, I want you to
teach me the trapeze!

127
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,083
I promise I'll work
really hard, please sir!

128
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,583
Hey, wait!

129
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,083
So you're the Kaleido
people? You're late!

130
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,916
What? But doesn't the
show start tomorrow?

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,291
What are you talking about?!

132
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,541
We'll start rehearsal
immédiatement.

133
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,833
Okay.

134
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,500
Following me won't
do you any good.

135
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,500
Sorry, but I'm not giving up
until you teach me the trapeze.

136
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,875
This is... This is a
circus training area!

137
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,583
Right now it is nothing
but a room full of junk.

138
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,458
Can I get on the trapeze?

139
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,041
You're not very good at it.

140
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,000
Kaleido Stage must be slipping

141
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,541
if they are letting amateurs
like you on stage.

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,125
Don't talk bad about
the Kaleido Stage.

143
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,250
I'm only learning the trapeze
because I want to.

144
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,500
I have to say,
that's pretty impressive.

145
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,208
You're a strange girl,
but you've got talent.

146
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,208
What's going on?!

147
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,416
Sora! Hey, nobody
told us about this!

148
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,875
Don't be silly. This has always
been our main attraction.

149
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,166
You must be joking!

150
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,166
Trois, deux, allez!

151
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,583
Help me!

152
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,875
Wait a minute, put those down!

153
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,500
I don't wanna die!

154
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,041
Brilliant!

155
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,875
So umm... this is the
Noir Circus, right?

156
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,250
No, this is the Etoile Circus.

157
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,333
Sorry we're late.
We're the Kaleido Planets.

158
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,833
We're scheduled
to perform today.

159
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,833
 Excuse me?!

160
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,791
I thought I was about to die.

161
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,541
Sure it wasn't what we expected,
but wasn't it thrilling?

162
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,250
Welcome to Noir Circus.
We have been expecting you.

163
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,750
I'm so sorry we're late.

164
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,250
We're the touring team
from Kaleido Stage.

165
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,625
Has our friend
Rosetta arrived yet?

166
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,958
Yes, she is here, but I think
she may be over at Alan's place.

167
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,500
Alan?

168
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,250
What's the matter?
You are ready to quit?

169
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:14,458
I won't. Sora never gave up
on Leon's special training.

170
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,166
--Huh?
--I won't give up.

171
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,458
Leon? Are you talking
about Leon Oswald?

172
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,166
Yeah, that's him.

173
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,583
How do you know him?

174
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,666
He's performing with the Kaleido
Stage. So you know Leon?

175
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,291
I know him well.
He was the last student

176
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,708
I ever trained on the trapeze.

177
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,875
Bonjour!

178
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,291
Hello? Is there anyone here?

179
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,791
Sora!

180
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,333
Rosetta!

181
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,083
Sora?

182
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,625
You taught Leon the trapeze?

183
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,875
Yes, it's been about 10 years

184
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,875
since Leon and his little
sister Sophie trained here.

185
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,166
Little sister?

186
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,875
Their parents died when
they were both very young.

187
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,791
After that, they were
taken in by their relatives.

188
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,666
But they must not have been
on good terms with them.

189
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,750
When I asked to take the two
of them in as my students,

190
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,666
their relatives were
eager to give them up.

191
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,958
They were brilliant students.

192
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:28,625
They mastered the basics of
the trapeze in no time at all.

193
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,083
Now Leon! Pull Sophie up
and throw her into the air!

194
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,250
No good! Start again
from the beginning!

195
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,041
Oh, Leon.

196
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:52,041
So was Sophie really capable
of being Leon's partner?

197
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,750
Yes. In fact, in my opinion,

198
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,875
Leon wasn't talented enough
to be Sophie's partner.

199
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,041
She was more talented than Leon?

200
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,166
I didn't think
that was possible.

201
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,666
I think Sophie would have
been able to do it one day.

202
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,583
A "Perfect Angel's Maneuver."

203
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,458
The "Angel's Maneuver"?

204
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:17,041
Yes. That was my dream.

205
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,916
I assumed, to perform a
"Perfect Angel's Maneuver,"

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,916
the woman's partner needed
a lot of upper body strength.

207
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,375
So, I started training Leon.

208
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,291
You dropped the ball, kid.
Here, I'll get it for you.

209
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,291
This ball, it's... made of lead!

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,875
However, no matter how
much I trained Leon,

211
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,083
they still could not complete
an "Angel's Maneuver."

212
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,041
That's when I began
to wonder if it was

213
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,208
an impossible goal for me.

214
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,125
Sophie!

215
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,666
Leon!

216
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,750
Then, Sophie pulled herself up

217
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,791
as if she were as
light as a feather.

218
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,250
When I saw that,
I finally understood.

219
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:11,041
The "Angel's Maneuver" did not
just require one strong partner.

220
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:15,166
It required that the other
partner have an innate instinct

221
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,916
to sense the flow of that
strength during a performance.

222
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,666
I figured if she could perfectly
maintain the pose,

223
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,750
then they could really achieve
a perfect "Angel's Maneuver."

224
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:31,000
That's when I decided to start
training Sophie harshly as well.

225
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,291
Sophie! Are you okay?

226
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,166
Get off the stage!

227
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,625
I am sorry, Leon.

228
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,208
We want our money back!

229
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,833
My sister's been training and
she's tired! It's not her fault!

230
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,500
--Like I care!
--You brat!

231
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,708
Don't forget that you're
here to entertain us!

232
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,500
Yeah, quit mouthing off!

233
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,750
Alan, I am sorry, but I cannot
pay them their fee now.

234
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,708
You have to stop
the special training.

235
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,875
What did you say?

236
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,250
Sophie can't handle
much more of this.

237
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,666
It's okay, Leon.

238
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,166
Sophie? But are you
not exhausted?

239
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,666
Alan, do you know
about "True Stars"?

240
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,916
--Huh?
--"True Stars"?

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,500
Some people from
the circus troupe

242
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,625
we were working with
told me about it.

243
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,500
They told me that the
performance of a true star

244
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,833
brings everybody's
hearts together as one.

245
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,291
I think the "Angel's Maneuver"
could be the only way

246
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,375
for us to become
true stars someday.

247
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,041
Leon, I think that
we could do it.

248
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,375
I want to perfect the
"Angel's Maneuver."

249
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,583
I want us to become true stars.

250
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,541
Then the people
who see us perform,

251
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:38,000
the audience, other performers,
their hearts will become one.

252
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:42,291
Even if they are not related.
They'll be just like family.

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,166
The "Angel's Maneuver" is a
way to become a "True Star."

254
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,583
At the time I thought
she was just talking

255
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,416
like a silly little girl.

256
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,291
But somewhere along
the way I began thinking

257
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:58,291
that I wanted to bring a
"True Star" into the world.

258
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,333
"Only a demon can
raise an angel."

259
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,875
I remembered someone
from a circus troupe

260
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,750
I was in a long time
ago saying that.

261
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,791
As we aimed to perfect
the "Angel's Maneuver,"

262
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:14,125
I had no choice but to make
my special training more cruel.

263
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,541
That special training...

264
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,125
It's the same as that
special training I did

265
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,291
before the circus festival.

266
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,750
Sophie...

267
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,041
What's wrong with you?!

268
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,375
You'll never do a perfect
"Angel's Maneuver" like that!

269
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,708
You're both really
going to leave?

270
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,458
There is nothing more
we can learn from you.

271
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,500
What?!

272
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,791
I'll perfect the
"Angel's Maneuver."

273
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,458
I'll make Sophie a "True Star."

274
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,250
You're just a stepping
stone towards our goal.

275
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,500
You think you can do it Leon?

276
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,625
Do you really think
you can become a demon?

277
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,666
After a few years had
passed I heard a rumor

278
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,500
that Sophie had died.

279
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,375
And that was it.
My dream was dead.

280
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,958
To think he had
that kind of past.

281
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,708
Leon's special training...

282
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,958
I thought it was just him
trying to break Sora's spirit.

283
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,208
He really knew
what he was doing.

284
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,833
So the "Angel's Maneuver"
is connected

285
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,500
to becoming a "True Star"?

286
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,500
No. The "True Star"
business is just a fantasy.

287
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,375
It is impossible
to become a star

288
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,958
without being hated or
resented by someone.

289
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,875
Everyone would be envious.

290
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:45,250
Especially if you could perform
a "Perfect Angel's Maneuver."

291
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,500
You're wrong. I think
"True Stars" really can exist.

292
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,375
Sophie thought the
"Angel's Maneuver"

293
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,500
was the path to
becoming a "True Star."

294
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,666
I believe that too.

295
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,333
I want you to teach me to do
a "Perfect Angel's Maneuver".

296
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,958
I don't believe in
such a thing anymore.

297
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,125
I'd just drag you down.

298
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:13,500
If we had met about three
years ago, then maybe I would.

299
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,208
Rosetta? You want
to keep practicing?

300
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,083
Uh, yeah.

301
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,541
Alright. I won't bore you with
stories of the past anymore.

302
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,375
Sora's eyes... They're
burning with a fire

303
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,375
that I've never seen before.

304
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:32,208
I've finally found the path to
becoming a true Kaleido Star.

305
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,833
No matter how
much time it takes,

306
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,750
I'm going to take that path.

307
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,791
I will become a
true Kaleido Star!

308
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,958
Imagine that you become
part of the trapeze.

309
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,833
Don't go against the flow!

310
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,125
How many times do
I have to tell you?

311
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,083
Picture where the bars
will be three seconds ahead.

312
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,208
Picture them three
seconds ahead.

313
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,541
I did it!

314
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,875
Don't get too excited.

315
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,333
We're moving on to
the next step now.

316
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,041
She is pretty good
on the trapeze.

317
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,583
She's so much better,
in one day!

318
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,583
--Cater!
--Pillar!

319
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,125
Pillar!

320
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,083
Any villain who would
try to kill the princess

321
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,666
will have to fight me first.

322
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,333
I accept your challenge.
Hahahahaha!

323
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,541
I will fight. But why do I
always have to play the villain?

324
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,666
Wow, awesome!

325
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,791
Say your prayers, evil queen!

326
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,125
You underestimate me!

327
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,125
Sora's moves are much bigger
than they were in rehearsal.

328
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,791
She was like this
at the last show too.

329
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,958
This isn't just being able to
make the audience smile.

330
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,833
She's inspiring
everyone around her.

331
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,458
And as another performer
it excites me somehow.

332
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,041
This is Sora's true power.

333
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,625
Southern Cross Illusion!

334
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,916
Gigashock Explosion!

335
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,125
Infinity Tornado!

336
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,291
Fantastic Firestorm!

337
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,958
Four Thousand Legend
Cosmic Dream Spin!

338
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,583
For someone who didn't wanna do
it, she's really into this show.

339
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,708
Galactica Unbelievable
Splash Thunder!

340
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,041
That girl's performance
is drawing out

341
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,208
the other performer's charm.

342
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,875
I have to defeat you,
we're running out of time!

343
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,375
I don't wanna let you beat me,
but I'll do it... this time.

344
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,916
Fine.

345
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't remember
that in the script.

346
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,500
I guess May's just
having fun in her own way.

347
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,250
I won't forget what
you've done to me!

348
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,791
On the next one, Rosetta.

349
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,333
Right!

350
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,250
Good job!

351
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,875
That's just what I'd
expect from you, Sora.

352
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,208
You've easily bounced back

353
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,666
from your depression after
the festival. Amazing.

354
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,583
Hm? I know that man...

355
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,833
--Hello.
--Hm?

356
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,625
The performer who played
the prince is Sora Naegino.

357
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,666
She's pretty good,
don't you think?

358
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,625
Judging by your physique,
I'm guessing

359
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,958
you're a trapeze
artiste as well.

360
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,916
She certainly does have a
strange charm about her.

361
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,625
She could be the one to make

362
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,666
that "True Star"
thing a reality.

363
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,083
I'm glad to know
you think so too.

364
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,833
Hm? But wait,
I've seen you before.

365
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,291
Why, you're...
you're Yuri Killian!

366
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,166
Uh, yeah.

367
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,791
My instincts are telling me

368
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,958
that Kaleido Stage
is up to something.

369
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:32,208
I bet they're plotting
something big, eh?

370
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,666
Well, that is a
possibility, sir.

371
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,416
I've finally decided the
path I'm going to take.

372
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,416
I'm going to master
the "Angel's Maneuver."

373
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,583
I know I can do it!

374
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,333
I thought I'd give you a chance
to get your revenge, Leon.

375
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:07,708
The Kaleido Stage
is reopening! But...

376
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,125
The truth about what happened
between Leon and Yuri

377
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,291
three years ago
will finally be revealed.

378
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,666
The cruel demon who slashed
an angel's innocence to pieces.

379
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,416
That's enough, stop it you two!

380
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,750
Next time on Kaleido Star:
"The Amazing Fated Duel"!

381
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:27,000
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
