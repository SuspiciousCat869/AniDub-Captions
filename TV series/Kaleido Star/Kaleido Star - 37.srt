1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,083
Okay, everyone,
Kaleido Star is about to start.

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,958
So make sure that your
room is brightly lit

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,833
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,833
Well, everyone, it's me, May.

5
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,666
I've been so depressed.
I failed last time. I failed.

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,166
And I've been moping
about it all by myself.

7
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,375
But I realized something
after Meryl talked to me.

8
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,166
I've just been
looking for excuses.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,333
I've been blaming
things on somebody else.

10
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is May Wong.

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,208
I'm an athlete who never
gives up, who never surrenders.

12
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,166
I won't let anybody
get in my way.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,833
I'll work hard and win!

14
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,416
Sora, you're not the only one

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,041
trying to get to the
place where Layla is!

16
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,250
Congratulations!

17
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,875
Thanks, really. But I'm
wondering if this is okay?

18
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,125
Yes, it's okay.

19
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,291
Really?

20
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,333
Yeah, she's right.
Leon said you passed.

21
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,416
He's acknowledged you, Sora.

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,583
You think so?

23
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,791
Uh-huh.

24
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,916
Yeah, you're going
to the festival.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's great. Good luck, Sora.

26
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,833
Thanks. I'll do my best.

27
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,458
Are you worrying
about May, Sora?

28
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,458
What?

29
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,958
Because I'm useless...
Because I'm useless...

30
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,791
I know how you feel.

31
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,125
But for now, you should keep
your mind on the festival.

32
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,291
He's right, Sora.
Your goal is...

33
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,666
Okay, say it, everybody:

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,041
Victory!

35
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,458
Yeah, I know that.

36
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,291
Only one of us can
participate in the festival.

37
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,958
So if I want to go,
I can't think like this.

38
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,625
I have to beat May.

39
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,791
Yes, yes, yes.

40
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,250
Hello there.
Oh, it's you, Kalos.

41
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,666
What? Sora is here
with us, but...

42
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,916
Huh?

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,333
What?! Is that right?
There's a final test?

44
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,250
What?!

45
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,250
Did I hear you say ...
"final test"?

46
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,625
"The Two Amazing Demons."

47
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,458
I'll have them prepare for
the final test right away.

48
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,666
If she's going to
participate in the festival,

49
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,500
she has to take this test.
There's no way around it.

50
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,375
But if she has one misstep,

51
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,083
her career on the
stage may be over.

52
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,833
Are you prepared for that?

53
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,125
Sora can pull through this.

54
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,375
I believe that.
Just wait and see.

55
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,708
The final test.

56
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,583
If I can pass this, that
Phoenix Ticket will be mine.

57
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,916
No, I mustn't think about May.

58
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,041
This makes me so nervous.

59
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,000
I wonder what
kind of test it is.

60
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,666
No matter what it is,
she'll ace it.

61
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,625
Everyone is cheering you.

62
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,583
Thank you.

63
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,750
Hi, Layla...

64
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,500
Sora, I'll ask you one
more time. Be honest.

65
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,833
Do you seriously want to
participate in the Festival

66
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,000
no matter what happens to you?

67
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,250
Yes!

68
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,083
Well. That's fine, then.
Please do your best.

69
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,833
Yeah.

70
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,750
I have to pass this test.

71
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,916
No matter how difficult
the maneuver is, I have to.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,458
There's no other alternative.

73
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,250
I'm ready. What should I do?

74
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,958
Go to the top.

75
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,458
Alright, what do
you want me to do?

76
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,875
Let's see. Why don't you
do a Layout Somersault?

77
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,041
What?

78
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,166
--What did he say?
--What's this about?

79
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,791
Hey, what's a Layout Somersault?

80
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,625
It's one of the most basic
maneuvers on the trapeze.

81
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,916
The performer spins once,
and grabs the catcher's hands.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,958
That's all I have to do?

83
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,041
That's right.

84
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,291
Okay then.

85
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,958
Wait.

86
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,791
Remove the safety net.

87
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,666
WHAT?!

88
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,833
No! No way! You can't do that.

89
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,416
When you perform
in the festival,

90
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,958
there's no safety
net or lifeline.

91
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,208
Yeah that's true, but...

92
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,500
A basic maneuver like this
shouldn't require a safety net.

93
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,625
Do as I ask. I will give
you a chance to show off.

94
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,583
That's what he said to May.

95
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,833
Okay, I will give you a chance.

96
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,625
I will give you
the perfect chance

97
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,166
to show off in today's show.

98
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:37,208
Will you fail the final test
before you even take it?

99
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,500
Alright then. Remove the net.

100
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,375
Huh?

101
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,500
Remove it.

102
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,916
Yes.

103
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,750
A good attitude, Sora.
Now the moment of truth is here.

104
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,416
Show me how prepared you
are to be a real star.

105
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,458
Okay, let's go.

106
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,333
Next time, I'll jump.

107
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,541
Sora...

108
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,375
Hesitating is dangerous.
Jump like you mean it, Sora.

109
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,791
The timing's perfect.
I can do this!

110
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,750
I can't jump.

111
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,250
Sora!

112
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,500
Oh, no.

113
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,916
I thought "What would I do
if he didn't catch me"...

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,125
and then I couldn't jump.

115
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,583
P-Please let me try again.

116
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,416
When you do it for
real in the festival,

117
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,125
will you ask me to do it again?

118
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,125
Bu-But please!
Let me try one more--

119
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,666
Sora!

120
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,875
It's unseemly.

121
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,208
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,791
The way it is now,
this year's festival

123
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,958
could be no participation.

124
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,291
I know.

125
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,291
Leon walked away so easily.

126
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,041
I thought he would want to
participate in the festival

127
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,750
to erase the shame of
withdrawing three years ago.

128
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,291
But it seems I was wrong.

129
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,291
Why does he stay here?
It doesn't make any sense.

130
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,833
There was this rumor I heard.

131
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:01,041
He was looking for a partner
who could meet him at his level.

132
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,666
But he's had no luck.

133
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,041
All his partners so far
have left the stage.

134
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,458
Because he treats them all
like he treated May Wong.

135
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,166
But if that's the reason they
decided to leave the stage,

136
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,666
they never belonged there.

137
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,458
They're better off to quit
and get another career.

138
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,958
Leon knew that, yet
he still invited Sora.

139
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,541
Maybe he thought Sora
could be the partner

140
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,166
he had always been looking for.

141
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,750
And that with her,
he could win in the festival.

142
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:32,833
Even now, Sora is still trying
to follow in your footsteps.

143
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,333
In order for her to
surpass Layla Hamilton,

144
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,291
she has no other choice
but to win in the festival.

145
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,416
I think that's
the starting line.

146
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,416
So you still haven't
given up on your wish.

147
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,958
That's right.

148
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,875
You're the one who was first
attracted by Sora's potential.

149
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,458
You even pressured her
into appearing on the stage.

150
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll do just about anything
if I can make money.

151
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,125
Kalos, if you were
actually capable of that,

152
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,416
Kaleido Stage would
never end up in a pinch.

153
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,750
I meant that as a compliment...

154
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,375
I wonder if Sora's all right.

155
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,041
She could have never done it.

156
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,416
Especially after she saw
what happened to May.

157
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,583
We should probably leave
her alone right now.

158
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,083
Okay.

159
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:20,916
I've endured so much. I even
endured that special training.

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,458
But I wasted everything today.

161
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,416
I disappointed myself;
I disappointed Layla.

162
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,750
Stupid! Stupid, Sora!

163
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,833
I just don't have confidence
in Leon as a partner.

164
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,708
What am I going to do?

165
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,875
You were able to perform

166
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,708
the legendary great
maneuver with Layla.

167
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,458
So why is it you can't do
a basic maneuver with Leon...

168
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,833
I could trust Layla.
But I can't trust Leon.

169
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,416
I just can't.

170
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,250
And that's why you fail.

171
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:54,666
A real star doesn't change her
light depending on who's there.

172
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,125
Are you saying ...
I can't be a real star?

173
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,958
I don't know that answer.

174
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,083
But by the way
you're acting now,

175
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:07,083
you're very far away from
ever becoming a real star.

176
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,000
It's far... far away?

177
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,208
Endlessly far away.

178
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,708
Sora!

179
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,208
Yeah?

180
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,583
May's missing!

181
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,500
She hasn't been in her room
since before last night.

182
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,125
No one knows where she is!

183
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,666
What? May's missing?

184
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,125
Get the ball, big sis!

185
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,500
Over here, over here!

186
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,958
Watch what you're doing.

187
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,333
Okay...

188
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,500
What's wrong with her?

189
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,875
Meryl...

190
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,000
I thought you would
be here. Found her.

191
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,708
Sora...

192
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,583
Why are you here?
Did you come to laugh at me?

193
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,166
What? No, no!

194
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,583
May, there's something I
want to talk to you about...

195
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,875
Stop it! What else could
you have to say to me now?!

196
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,291
Leon chose you over me.
You won fair and square.

197
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,541
So be proud of your victory.

198
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,750
And laugh at the pathetic loser!

199
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,750
May, I'm not here
to laugh at you...

200
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,750
Cut it out! You're making
me sick! Don't you get it?

201
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,541
I was a newcomer who picked
a fight with the top star.

202
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,458
And I grabbed the leading
role away from you.

203
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,208
I was feeling like hot stuff.

204
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,750
But I wasn't anything
but a tool to train you...

205
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,916
He injured my shoulder,
and I ran away.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,958
Isn't it funny?
Go, laugh at me.

207
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,958
Laugh at me.

208
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,375
C'mon, laugh! There's no way
I want your sympathy!

209
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,833
You're wrong, May.

210
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:22,333
You see, I wasn't able
to pass Leon's final test.

211
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,791
It's true. I'm afraid of Leon.

212
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,750
When the moment came,
I couldn't let go of the swing.

213
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,083
I just couldn't.

214
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:34,916
What? Then, his partner
hasn't been decided yet?

215
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,541
No, not yet.

216
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,541
Oh...

217
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,625
You've been away
from the dormitory.

218
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,583
And you didn't
hear what happened.

219
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,958
So I knew I had to find
you and tell you this.

220
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,791
So you're not Leon's partner.
What can I do about that?

221
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,708
Uh, you could... Um...
Well, I don't know.

222
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,291
But I don't know what
I should do either.

223
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:05,375
What I want to say is...
Well, I'm not sure...

224
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,041
Where did you get that?

225
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,666
Your indecision
is so irritating.

226
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,416
--Sora!
--Um, yeah.

227
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,166
Is this why you came
all the way here?

228
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,250
So you could tell
May about your test?

229
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,791
Well... kinda...

230
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,375
--May!
--Yes, Meryl?

231
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,416
Really now. When did you
start giving up so easily?

232
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,458
I-I'm not giving up!

233
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,125
If you act like that,
you would be better off

234
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,625
had you listened to me
and kept on skating!

235
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,083
You can't do anything?

236
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,541
You don't know what
to do or where to go?

237
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,583
What malarkey. It seems to me
you just don't want to do it.

238
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,000
How can you say that?

239
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,375
It's not my fault. I was
abandoned by Leon!

240
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,708
You're wrong. Those are excuses.

241
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,958
You were injured because you
don't have enough skills.

242
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,583
To think you can't even handle
a little ad lib like that.

243
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,791
If you want to
blame it on something,

244
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,000
blame it on your lack of skills.

245
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,916
Don't act like
you're some victim.

246
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,125
The one who abandoned
you is you, May!

247
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,208
You did it to yourself!

248
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,000
The May I remember
was different.

249
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,958
When you were told "no,"
you wouldn't quit.

250
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,375
You worked so hard
that the person would

251
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,333
never be able to say
"no" to you again.

252
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,333
You never said you
couldn't do something.

253
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,833
You kept trying, no matter what!

254
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,875
Hey lady!

255
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,625
Lay off my sister!

256
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,791
Sister?

257
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,916
You, dumb kids!

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,875
Come and get us!
Come and get us!

259
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:30,666
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na!

260
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,583
Yeah! Yeah!

261
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,125
We're number one!

262
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,375
There's a chance.
I may still have a chance.

263
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,041
May...

264
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,500
Thank you, Meryl.

265
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:57,166
Thank you for making me remember
how bad I am at giving up.

266
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,041
So, I'll challenge
Leon one more time.

267
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,916
It sounds like
you're motivated now.

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,166
Yeah, I am. I also have
to thank you too, Sora.

269
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,333
Thank you for taking your time

270
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,083
and coming all
the way down here.

271
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,583
I'm glad you let me know
you were disqualified.

272
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,083
I won't let this
chance get away.

273
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,083
I'll be his real
partner this time.

274
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,958
But ... aren't you
afraid of him?

275
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,958
In his dreams! Once he
sees my new maneuver,

276
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,041
I'm sure Leon will grab
hold of my hands this time.

277
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,083
And with that maneuver,
I'll get into the festival.

278
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,333
And I'll win.

279
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,875
And I'll make the world
acknowledge me

280
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,500
like they did Layla.

281
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,916
A new maneuver...

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,625
Yeah. And its name
is Demon Spiral!

283
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,000
Demon Spiral. What is that?

284
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,958
I don't know yet. I just
came up with the name.

285
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,958
As for the practice room,
I'll be using it.

286
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,541
Hey guys, I'm going
back to Kaleido Stage.

287
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,000
So do me a favor and
tell Mom and Dad, okay?

288
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,750
Yeah! Our big sis
is back to normal!

289
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,541
Really, she's so much trouble.

290
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,250
Well, Sora, what are
you going to do?

291
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,666
Are you going to just
stand there and watch?

292
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,958
Uh, no... But...

293
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,666
Did you say you can't
trust your partner?

294
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah.

295
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,458
You're just the same as May.

296
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,500
Blaming your lack of
skill on your partner.

297
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,666
That's just an excuse.

298
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,791
What?

299
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,333
Before you start
blaming your partner,

300
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,000
I suggest you look
closer to home.

301
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,666
Are you doing enough to
earn your partner's trust?

302
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,000
You're still not
fit to be my partner,

303
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,833
so I'll be reducing
your role even further

304
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,208
for tomorrow's show.

305
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,625
Instead of worrying
about something like that,

306
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,458
get the skills good
enough to satisfy me.

307
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,375
I agree it's important
for me to improve,

308
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,250
but I think Kids' Stage
is equally important.

309
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,208
You talk pretty, but aren't
you just running away?

310
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,166
Tell me, didn't you face Layla
Hamilton with all your might?

311
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,666
Did you hold anything back?

312
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,000
So then, why don't you
do the same thing now?

313
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,416
Because...

314
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,833
If you stay like this,
your path will be blocked.

315
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,166
You're the only one who can
cut your way through it.

316
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,208
Get it together!

317
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:06,291
Meryl, thank you.
I won't forget.

318
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:18,041
It's true. Back then, I faced
Layla like a daredevil.

319
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,208
But I don't have confidence
to act the same way with Leon.

320
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,750
How on Earth can I...

321
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,791
I don't like his attitude!
Let's dump him!

322
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,125
That's right!

323
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,625
Yeah, but if you ask who
else can play his role...

324
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,916
--There isn't anybody.
--Oh, that's true.

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,416
If we want to have an eye on
winning, I guess it's him...

326
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,375
Hey, why can't Sora
do it by herself?

327
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,791
Oh yeah!

328
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,875
Unfortunately, the rule is
she has to have a partner.

329
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:38,875
--Aw...
--Oh no.

330
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,250
That guy better watch out!

331
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:44,041
In three years, I'll do
all of his maneuvers easily.

332
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,916
Go, Rosetta! Go, go!

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,583
Excuse me, but I
asked everyone here

334
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,750
because I wanted
to encourage Sora.

335
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,083
So, if you're going to encourage
someone, please encourage her.

336
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,750
Uh... that's okay.

337
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,291
I'm thankful for the way
you all care about me.

338
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,416
But I'm going to have to
solve this problem on my own.

339
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,041
Really...

340
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,541
Sora, let me show you
this amazing martial art.

341
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,416
It can't be drawn
by human hands!

342
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,666
Oh no... Sarah...

343
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,916
--Here I go! Hiyaaah!
--Uh-huh. It's amazing!

344
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,458
She's right. No human
hand could draw that.

345
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,791
Sora, is this helpful?

346
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,750
Well... kinda...

347
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,041
Since nobody's here,
the air is cool.

348
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,833
That's right, the cool
space where I'm alone.

349
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,583
It's where I belong.

350
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,875
I only decided this after
I joined Kaleido Stage.

351
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,375
I was a newcomer.

352
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,791
And I wanted to bring
down a top star like Sora.

353
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,583
To do it even one second
or one minute faster,

354
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,500
I couldn't hang out
with the others.

355
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,708
I couldn't afford
to goof around.

356
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,750
If they don't like me,
they don't like me.

357
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,791
If they hate me, they hate me.

358
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm going to win...
no matter what!

359
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,875
That move. He didn't have
both hands on the bar.

360
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,375
That's why he could make
that unexpected move.

361
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,458
If I can use it and
create a new maneuver...

362
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,250
One more time...

363
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,541
I will perfect this maneuver.

364
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,208
There's no other path
forward. Not for me.

365
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,541
To surpass Layla.
To become a real Kaleido Star.

366
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,458
That's why I want to participate
in the Circus Festival.

367
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:42,208
No matter what, I'll get there.
I'll get there! I'll get there!

368
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,000
But... I still don't
know what I should do.

369
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,666
And May has already
found something

370
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,083
and started running toward it.

371
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,541
Taurus escaped the darkness.

372
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,750
But it still
engulfs Sagittarius.

373
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,625
Sora, if you expend
effort without focus,

374
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,708
you'll just spin in place.

375
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,750
Then, tell me what
I'm supposed to do.

376
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,416
There you are. Sora!

377
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,333
Oh, Rosetta. Good morning.

378
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,750
No time for small talk.
C'mon, let's hurry.

379
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:30,833
What?

380
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,583
May's going to
challenge Leon again.

381
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,291
May's... doing what?

382
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:43,916
Who knew you would be the one
to ask me for another challenge.

383
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,666
I was intrigued
by what you said.

384
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,791
This new maneuver is
supposed to satisfy me?

385
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,750
Of course, it will, Leon.

386
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,958
You're the only one can
catch my Demon Spiral.

387
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,750
If you screw up even slightly,
I'll fall for sure.

388
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,083
If you're the God of Death,
then I will be a devil.

389
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,750
The Demon Spiral is a challenge

390
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,083
from a devil to
the God of Death.

391
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,541
I expect you to accept.

392
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,791
Here I go.

393
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,708
Whoa!

394
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:33,250
That's right. This is
the match with my fate!

395
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,625
Now...

396
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,625
Demon! Spiral!

397
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,541
A-Amazing!

398
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,583
When I was at Kaleido Stage,

399
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,416
I don't remember looking at
the faces of the audience much.

400
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,416
And so, May created the
Demon Spiral. It was amazing!

401
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,958
I can't back down now.

402
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,916
Besides, being bad at giving
up is something I've patented!

403
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,458
Well, if it's with him...

404
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,125
All right! I'll show them
what I can do when I'm serious!

405
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,750
I'll show them! I'll show them!

406
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:25,583
Next time on Kaleido Star,
"Amazing Angelic Counterattack."

407
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,458
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
