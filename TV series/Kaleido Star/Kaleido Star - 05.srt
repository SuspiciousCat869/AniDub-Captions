1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,125
Hey, everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,875
so make sure your room
is brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,333
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:32,250
My name is Sora Naegino.
Ever since I was a little girl

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,958
it's been my dream
to perform with Kaleido Stage.

6
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,125
So a few months ago I came
to the U.S. to give it a shot.

7
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,666
Boy, has it been an experience.
Everything is new to me,

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,500
and sometimes I'm a little lost.
But that's not going to keep me

9
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,000
from doing my best.
There's nothing I can't do

10
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,166
if I work hard!

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,708
Well, well, well.

12
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,291
Do you tell your Mom and Dad
your true feelings about stuff

13
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,583
like what you dream of doing?

14
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,833
Of course, I don't wanna
make my parents worry,

15
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,500
but I don't want
any regrets either.

16
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,458
I wish I could tell them
how I really feel, y'know?

17
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,333
Y'know? Y'know? Y'know?

18
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,666
'My Amazingly Distant Family'.

19
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,666
It's fifteen minutes
'til curtain, folks.

20
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,791
Was your grandmother's
surgery okay?

21
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,125
I called few minutes ago.
Everything's fine.

22
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,125
I'm so glad.

23
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,833
Huh? Thanks, Anna.

24
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,916
How do you
like my new nose job?

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,291
Gimme those things.

26
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,791
Oh come on, if I can't make this
Fairy Godmother thing funny

27
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,916
I'm gonna explode!

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Back me up here, Sora.

29
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,000
Great. She's not even listening.
Too busy getting ready

30
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,833
for your second
Kaleido Stage triumph, huh?

31
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,166
Maybe not...

32
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,208
Sora?

33
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,791
Miss Sarah?

34
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,208
She sure cleans up
pretty good, doesn't she?

35
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,875
Hey! I always look this nice! 

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,416
She really needs to get
better with those nun chucks.

37
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,500
Excuse me, Officer,
where is Kaleido Stage?

38
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,500
Kaleido Stage, huh?

39
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,541
Uh, I-- yes.

40
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you Japanese?

41
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,333
I am.

42
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,833
You're a lucky man.
You got here just in time

43
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,791
to see Japan's finest
performer make her debut.

44
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,291
Who's performing?

45
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,875
My friend Sora.

46
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,125
That's my daughter.

47
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,375
Come here!

48
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,833
Uh. No thanks.

49
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:40,708
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare
yourselves to be swept away.

50
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,583
The performance will
begin in a few moments.

51
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,291
The three of us
have to be perfect today.

52
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,000
Right. Let's do this.

53
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,416
There's not an empty seat in the
house. Break a leg, you guys.

54
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,708
It's a full house?

55
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,750
I uh didn't mean
to freak you guys out...

56
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,833
Everybody gets nervous
on opening day you know.

57
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,958
Even her? But Layla's
done this a million times.

58
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,708
Remember you made it into the
show by the skin of your teeth,

59
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,625
so don't you let me down.

60
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,875
Right.

61
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,833
I appreciate it, but you really
don't have to escort me there.

62
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,500
Of course I do, Big Daddy.
You can't miss Sora's show.

63
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,958
It's amazing how
comfortable she looks on stage.

64
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,958
Then again, opening a show
is nothing new to her anymore.

65
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,583
But she's better than
she was in rehearsal.

66
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,333
It's like the audience brought
something new out of her.

67
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,041
And we've gotta be
even better to match her.

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,333
The Fairy Godmother routine
starts as soon as Sarah

69
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,375
finishes her song.
Are you guys ready?

70
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,125
Let's do our best.

71
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,500
If we do that, there's no way
we can fail. Am I right?

72
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,500
Let's go.

73
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,958
It's Sora...

74
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,750
You can do this.

75
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,583
Remember to watch your timing.

76
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,916
All right!

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,958
So far so good! Now it's
time for the tricky part--

78
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,416
the Triple Illusion.

79
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,875
Oh no! I was late!

80
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,791
I'm on.

81
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,875
But they haven't...

82
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,666
They messed up,
now gimme some effects.

83
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,750
Okay got it.

84
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,125
Miss Layla?

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,541
She's covering our mistake.

86
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,333
Sora!

87
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,000
Sit down! I'm trying
to watch the show!

88
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,833
Smile, idiot!
Let them see you're okay!

89
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,875
I'm so sorry, boss.

90
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,458
It's my fault.
My timing was completely off

91
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,833
So Sora here couldn't
stay on her feet because

92
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,750
your timing was off?

93
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,125
I'm so sorry. You would've
been fine if I hadn't messed up.

94
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,583
No, Mia. Kalos was right:

95
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,833
I shouldn't have been thrown
by Miss Layla's entrance.

96
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,916
Sora! Someone's here to see you!

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,333
What?

98
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,125
Sora.

99
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,875
Dad it's you!

100
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,958
You you're Sora's father?

101
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,375
Uh, you don't think he's here
to make her go home, do you?

102
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,583
He wasn't too happy about her
coming here in the first place,

103
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,416
so you could be right.

104
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,708
It's good to see you. 

105
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,208
How rude of me! These are
my friends, Anna and Mia.

106
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,333
It's nice to make
your acquaintance.

107
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,583
Uh, thank you...

108
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:58,500
Why didn't you tell me you
were coming. Did Mom come, too?

109
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:02,958
Uh no. I came by myself.
It's a business trip.

110
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,750
I wish she could've come.

111
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,833
Yes. She worries about you
being so far away.

112
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,666
She shouldn't worry...

113
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,666
Uh, excuse me...

114
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,375
Dad, this is Ken.

115
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:17,625
I thought you might be thirsty.
So I brought you some soda.

116
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,666
I'm so glad you got
to see me perform today.

117
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,416
But I wish I'd
done a better job.

118
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:36,000
Huh? Oh, this? That's
just one of my battle scars.

119
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:36,541
Sora--

120
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,916
What?

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,041
Oh... noth--.
Nothing. Nothing at all.

122
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:45,750
So... It's too bad
you're leaving so soon.

123
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,250
I wish I had time to do
some sightseeing with you.

124
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,958
Maybe next time. Oh. I know.

125
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,625
Why don't you and I
have a nice dinner?

126
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,083
There's a Japanese
restaurant at my hotel.

127
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,875
I don't know.
I have a long practice

128
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,041
with Anna and Mia tonight...

129
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,583
One hour.

130
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,250
Right. I mean,
I'll have to eat anyway.

131
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,708
I might as well eat
with you while you're here.

132
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,625
Don't worry about it.
Well. Practice hard.

133
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,916
Okay.

134
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,125
Uh, Dad? Are you
coming back tomorrow?

135
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,916
Ah, yes. I think I see now.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,041
The people you call 'Mom and
Dad' aren't your real parents.

137
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,666
Sora! Sora please!
My hair is caught!

138
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,833
Dad came all this way
just to see me.

139
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,333
I'm not gonna let him down.

140
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,791
Oh, this is terrible!

141
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,500
Now everyone has to
suffer for their mistakes.

142
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,875
Good morning, you guys.

143
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,500
That wasn't very nice.
I wonder what their problem is.

144
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,875
It's a review of
yesterday's performance.

145
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,416
"In Kaleido Stage's new
production of 'Cinderella,'

146
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Layla Hamilton
shines once more.

147
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,125
The only major misstep of the
evening was in casting three

148
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,333
obvious amateurs
in the demanding role

149
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,000
of the Fairy Godmother."

150
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,291
I almost wish we'd been fired.

151
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,666
There's no way we can recover
from a review like that.

152
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,541
Mia. Just forget about it.

153
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,000
What are you doing?

154
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,375
Oh boss...

155
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,208
This isn't about that review
in the newspaper, is it?

156
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,833
I can cover for your mistakes,

157
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,125
so stop moping and get
your heads in the game.

158
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,500
Mia and Anna aren't jumping
as high as they were yesterday.

159
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,375
Hey, aren't those Fairy
Godmother people the ones

160
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,333
that got a terrible review
in the paper this morning?

161
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,333
Yeah. They almost
make Layla look bad.

162
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,875
Right this way, Mr. Naegino.

163
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,083
What were you
thinking out there?

164
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,208
If you can't do better
than that you have no business

165
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,708
being on stage.

166
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,958
This is an important scene.
If you can't do it, resign.

167
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,875
We're sorry, Miss Layla.

168
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,208
I can't believe
they did it again.

169
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,083
I know! Poor Layla...

170
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,916
Sora?

171
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,708
Can I talk to you?

172
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,333
Sora, come back home.

173
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,791
What?

174
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,708
Come back to Japan.

175
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,041
But, Dad...

176
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,875
To tell you the truth,
I came out here to check on you.

177
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,166
Your mother is very
worried about you.

178
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,041
She and I agreed that if you
weren't doing well out here

179
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,500
I'd bring you home.

180
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,916
I'm sorry to say this, Sora,
but I just... I don't think...

181
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,791
I don't think that
Kaleido Stage is where

182
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,333
you need to be right now.

183
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,333
I should never have allowed
you to come in the first place.

184
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:04,958
Such a dangerous job. Besides,
I can't stand to think of you

185
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,625
having such a
hard time over here.

186
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,291
Sora, you're getting out of
this place. I'm won't get on

187
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,291
that plane tomorrow unless
you agree to come with me.

188
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,666
What?

189
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,375
Sora!

190
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,625
You were gone for so long
we thought you'd run away.

191
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,791
You okay?

192
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,666
Yeah. You guys are
sweet to worry about me.

193
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,750
What did your Dad
wanna tell you?

194
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,041
Uh...

195
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,041
What's wrong?

196
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:44,333
He wants me to return
with him... to Japan.

197
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,083
What did you say? You're
not going, are you? Well?

198
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,916
What else can I do?
I want to stay,

199
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,916
but they're so worried
about me. I can't hurt them.

200
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,625
I know we can't replace them.

201
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,708
But we'll always
be here for you, Sora.

202
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:17,041
My biological parents
died when I was very young.

203
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,791
I hadn't even started
primary school yet.

204
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,666
I've never felt so abandoned.

205
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,541
My father's cousin and his
wife took me in and raised me

206
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,125
as their own daughter.

207
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,208
Do you think maybe that's
why he doesn't understand

208
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,125
how you feel about this place?

209
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,666
I mean, if he's
not your real Dad...

210
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,708
He is now. He and my
mother are great parents,

211
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,291
and I know they'd
do anything for me.

212
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,083
They've always had
my best interests at heart.

213
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,708
How could I tell them
I don't want to go home?

214
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,250
So you're lying to them? Nice
way of showing your gratitude.

215
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,458
Hey, are you okay?

216
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,833
Sora, something awful has
happened to you-- your Dad!

217
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:14,666
What?

218
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,250
He's had a heart attack!

219
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,791
A heart attack?!

220
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,416
The police just called to let
us know. The paramedics took him

221
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,125
to Cape Mary Hospital
on 9th street.

222
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,333
But the show starts in an hour.

223
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,625
We're supposed to be
backstage in ten minutes.

224
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,833
Sora! Oh, no...

225
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,208
If I don't show up for the show
I'm gonna be fired for sure.

226
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,416
But I can't go on
if he's in danger.

227
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,625
I'll bet Miss Layla
would've gone on anyway.

228
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,625
She would've been able to
perform like nothing was wrong.

229
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,041
She's a real professional.
I guess I'll never be...

230
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:05,666
Dad! Are you okay?

231
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,333
Sora...

232
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,666
Dad, I I'll do it.

233
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,583
I'll leave Kaleido Stage
and go back with you to Japan.

234
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,458
Sora...

235
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,750
I wouldn't be able
to forgive myself if

236
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,041
something happened to you
while I was away.

237
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,583
But I...

238
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,208
It's okay.

239
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,166
What on earth was
that girl thinking?

240
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,416
She's worried about her father.

241
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,375
We all have worries, but
none of us are missing a show.

242
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,583
We'll find someone else
who can do it.

243
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,625
With five minutes to
curtain? I don't think so.

244
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,708
Layla, you cover for her.

245
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,583
They must've started by now.

246
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,416
Wait!

247
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,875
Came back, did you?

248
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,250
I'm so sorry.

249
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,750
And you think that
makes everything okay?

250
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:27,958
It doesn't. I just wanted
to tell you I'm quitting.

251
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,458
I'm surprised. I thought
it would take more than

252
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,125
a disappointment to make
you give up your dream.

253
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,208
I wonder if she's serious.

254
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,125
You sound disappointed.

255
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,416
But you don't want to quit.

256
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,041
Maybe you should
sleep on it, Sora.

257
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,916
I'm sorry,
but I've already decided.

258
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,500
But we can't do the
Triple Illusion without you.

259
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,791
If you talk to Kalos,
I'm sure he'll let you back in.

260
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,125
You can find someone else
to do the routine.

261
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,916
But I'm the only daughter

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,916
that my Mom and Dad
are ever gonna have.

263
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,625
And you know what,
I'm happy. I got to perform

264
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,875
with Kaleido Stage, even if
it was just for a little while.

265
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,666
The Moon represents
wavering emotions.

266
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,000
But when the clouds clear,
your indecision will vanish.

267
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,625
Are you sure
you're okay to fly Dad?

268
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:59,458
As long as you're with me
Sora, I can do anything.

269
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,666
Thanks.

270
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,625
Hey, Dad?

271
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,916
Hm?

272
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,750
I wanted to ask you how
you liked Kaleido Stage.

273
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,750
Because you hadn't been before.

274
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,000
It was nice.

275
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:17,041
Don't you think
Layla's amazing? And Yuri?

276
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,250
I still can't believe I got
the chance to perform

277
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,458
with the two of them.

278
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,833
I mean, when I came for the
audition, I never dreamed

279
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,750
I'd get in. Then I did.

280
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,541
And you and Mom were so
supportive even though I knew

281
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,666
you hated the thought
of me being so far away.

282
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,625
But you supported me anyway.

283
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,375
I wish that you'd come on a
different day that you'd seen

284
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,708
a better performance.

285
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,583
Where I didn't mess up.

286
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,583
I'm sorry you never got to see
the Triple Illusion the way

287
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,208
we practiced it.

288
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:01,250
Because it's really kinda
cool when we do it right.

289
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,708
Sora...

290
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm just really disappointed.

291
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:11,166
And I... I don't... I don't
want to quit Kaleido Stage.

292
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,208
I've dreamed of
being on stage there

293
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,125
as long as I can remember, Dad.

294
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,041
But I don't want
to hurt you and Mom.

295
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:23,083
Sora. I'm going.
But you should stay here.

296
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,541
You should have told me how
you felt about this before.

297
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,291
Your mother and
I want to protect you,

298
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,500
we don't want
to make you unhappy.

299
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,958
But, Dad...

300
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,958
Take care of yourself Sora.

301
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,583
Dad?

302
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,958
Thank you, Dad.

303
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,750
I'm so sorry.

304
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,416
I don't want to quit
Kaleido Stage. I never did.

305
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,000
Please, give me another chance.
I won't make any more mistakes.

306
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,333
I promise!

307
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,083
That's fine, but we're
not the only people

308
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,416
you should be apologizing to.

309
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,250
Ever since we've opened,
none of our audiences have seen

310
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,041
what the Fairy
Godmothers can do yet.

311
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,666
They deserve your
best performance.

312
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,500
Right!

313
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,875
Someday I want my Mom
and Dad to see me perform

314
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:35,000
when everything goes like
it should. I can't wait!

315
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,875
Oh my gosh. I found a seal!

316
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:44,791
Huh?

317
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,250
I'll call him Jonathan.

318
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,375
But, Sora, we're not
allowed to keep any pets.

319
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,750
And how are you
going to feed it?

320
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,875
That's gonna
take money, you know.

321
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,916
Well, why don't we take part
in a juggling contest.

322
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,083
We can feed him with
the money we win! Okay?

323
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:57,958
Okay.

324
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,250
Okay.

325
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,666
Next time on Kaleido Star,
'The Amazing Seal.'

326
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,625
My wings are my dream,
and on towards the sky...
