1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,125
Hey everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,000
so make sure that your
room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,666
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,458
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,500
Hi, it's me, Rosetta.

6
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,291
This time around, I've decided
to try my luck at the trapeze.

7
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,083
I just can't forget
how awesome it was

8
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,333
to see Sora and Layla's
legendary great maneuver.

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,500
Sora is the person
I admire most.

10
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,458
She taught me
what was important.

11
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,333
Now it's my dream to fly
through the sky with her.

12
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,791
Otherwise, there's no reason for
me to be here at Kaleido Stage.

13
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:56,041
When I'm with Sora, I feel I
can do anything. I can! I can!

14
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,166
Precisely because
we have a past,

15
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,250
we also have a
present and a future.

16
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,541
And toward that future,
someone is now moving.

17
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,125
A little lamb has
started to walk.

18
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,125
Aries girl.

19
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,500
Rosetta Passel.

20
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,458
Sora! I'm in trouble!
I'm in trouble!

21
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,625
It's a crisis.

22
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,083
Hey, Sora!

23
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,458
Did you flood the
washing machine again?

24
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:02,250
No, no, no! You have to
give me special training!

25
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,291
Please be my teacher.

26
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,166
I have to be able to do the
trapeze in three days from now,

27
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,000
and if I can't, I'm quitting
Kaleido Stage forever.

28
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,708
"Amazing Rosetta of
Sweat and Tears."

29
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,666
Hello?

30
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,500
B-Boss!

31
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,000
Sorry to wake you, but I
thought you should know:

32
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,000
you'll be appearing
on stage next week.

33
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,583
Performing diabolo?

34
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,750
That's right.

35
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,291
With the way your
diabolo has improved,

36
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,791
I'm certain it will be a
big hit with the audience.

37
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,791
But I wanted to do the trapeze.

38
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,416
Rosetta, you're not ready
for the trapeze, yet.

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,916
First off, you've never even
appeared in a trapeze show.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,875
And you still haven't finished
with your basic training.

41
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,375
I've already had
enough basic training!

42
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,083
Rosetta, you're going
to do diabolo first.

43
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,500
If I knew you would
only let me do diabolo,

44
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,000
I would have never
joined Kaleido Stage.

45
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,375
Just gimme three days
to learn the trapeze.

46
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,708
It can't be done in three days.

47
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,541
If I can't learn to
do it in three days,

48
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,041
I'll quit Kaleido Stage.

49
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,791
Rosetta! Are you there?

50
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,041
Oh good grief.

51
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,291
That's the story.

52
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,708
In three days? You're kidding!

53
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,000
Sora, you mastered ice skating
in only three days, right?

54
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:32,041
So help me! Help me to
learn the trapeze, Teacher.

55
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,041
Did you say "teacher"?

56
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,916
Uh, sorry.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,458
It's okay.

58
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,041
I can't believe that a girl who
is so proud of her abilities

59
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,500
could bring herself
to call me "Teacher."

60
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,791
I was born in Belgium and
started studying in France.

61
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,583
How are you supposed
to be my caretaker

62
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,458
when you know nothing about me?

63
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,875
I wanna hear your explanation
for this in my dressing room!

64
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,541
When you first came here, you
used to call me a caretaker.

65
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,500
Sorry. I was so young back then.

66
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,416
I'd say you're still
pretty young now.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,625
Anyhow, I'm ready to
learn the Golden Phoenix.

68
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,541
Well, we could give it a try.

69
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,041
What? Really? Oh, wow!

70
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,125
Thank you, Sora!

71
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,875
All right, Teacher Sora,

72
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,541
I'm gonna change into
my clothes right now!

73
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,041
Here we go.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,875
Hello, Boss? We need
to talk about Rosetta.

75
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:32,708
You handle her.

76
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,625
Wha?

77
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,916
She's very headstrong,

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,791
and you'll just have
to deal with it.

79
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,708
But Boss!

80
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,166
Now if only you would
listen and get off my car.

81
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,250
Well, he's no help.

82
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,125
Tada!

83
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,458
Look at me, Sora!

84
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,291
I'm all ready for my
training, Teacher Sora.

85
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,375
The next three days will
be hard work, Rosetta.

86
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,083
I can't believe that
it was once Rosetta

87
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,541
who was training
me to do diabolo.

88
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:07,458
This... this... this
is totally impossible!

89
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,458
We only have one day left
until our performance.

90
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,666
This is no time to lie around.

91
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,208
I just don't think
Rosetta's ready

92
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,958
to do the trapeze yet, Sora.

93
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,416
That's why she's going
to be training me.

94
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,708
That's right, I am.

95
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,000
What's this?

96
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,833
Rosetta's gonna do the trapeze?

97
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,166
And Sora will be her teacher?

98
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,458
Odds for either one
aren't very good.

99
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,541
If a beginner's going to
do the show in three days,

100
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,541
it's going to take
super special training.

101
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,166
When I coached you in diabolo,
I was ruthless in your training,

102
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,500
and I expect you to
be just as ruthless.

103
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,291
Ruthless? Well, I'm not
sure I can do that.

104
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,333
Please! Train me
rigorously, Teacher Sora!

105
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,333
Rigorous special training?

106
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,000
In that case,
we need Sora to give us

107
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,791
rigorous special training in
how to be gag characters, too.

108
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,666
--Right, Ken?
--Huh?

109
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,083
I don't need that
kind of training.

110
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,708
Why would you want me to teach
you to be good gag characters?

111
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,208
If you make people
laugh without trying,

112
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,000
you're a gag character!

113
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,833
Sora most definitely
has this talent,

114
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,791
but there are signs
Ken also has it too.

115
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,333
If Sora trained us,
Ken and I would be

116
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,166
the best gag characters ever!

117
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,125
They don't need you, Anna.

118
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,875
What am I doing wrong?

119
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,625
Well, I haven't seen
that look for a while.

120
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,583
You're so cool.

121
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:24,041
Okay, let's get started
with training, Rosetta.

122
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:26,916
Rosetta?

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,916
--What are you doing?
--Training.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,125
You don't say.

125
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,291
I wanna be like Layla
as soon as possible.

126
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,250
Huh?

127
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,500
Some day, I'm going to do

128
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,916
the legendary great
maneuver with Sora.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,250
Oh really?

130
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,750
Roller-skate Jump!

131
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,250
If so, then you'll have
to get special training

132
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,250
from a top star like me.

133
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,166
When did you become a top star?

134
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,083
I became a top star
when I was chosen

135
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,083
to be Leon's partner
in the show.

136
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,916
Sora's just a
washed-up has-been.

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,583
Who cares about Leon?

138
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,250
If I'm Sora's partner,
Sora'll be a top star, too.

139
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,375
Rosetta, I think we
should start practicing.

140
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,458
You're holding onto the
swing like a little monkey,

141
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,458
just moving your
legs back and forth.

142
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,750
Looks like I'll have
to help you out, then.

143
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,791
Here it goes!

144
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,875
Wait! May!

145
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,916
Don't, May! Rosetta's
only a beginner!

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,458
--Sora!
--Here we go!

147
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,291
Excellent Top Star Swing!

148
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,875
Stop, May!

149
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,250
Sora, we can stop
them with these ropes.

150
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,583
Okay!

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,750
How is it, Rosetta?

152
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,291
No, not yet.

153
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,375
Pull now!

154
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,541
Pull, Jonathan, pull!

155
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,958
Finally stopped.

156
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,083
I got ya.

157
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,625
I don't feel good.

158
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,791
Like I said, you're not ready.

159
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,500
Hang in there.

160
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,541
Maybe you should
go back to diabolo.

161
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,625
Sorry Sora.

162
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,916
Rosetta, I think the
first thing you should do

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,583
is strengthen your body.

164
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,166
The same goes for you.

165
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,500
Huh?

166
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,375
Up until now, you've focused
on training yourself

167
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,000
to challenge Layla
with specific maneuvers.

168
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,000
But you never really developed
the rest of your body.

169
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,333
That's your greatest
weakness, Sora.

170
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,416
So why not do basic
training with Rosetta?

171
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,083
Sora.

172
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,708
Let's build up our body
strength together.

173
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,083
Weak abs can make you lose
your balance in the air,

174
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,000
so maybe that's where
you should begin.

175
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,333
Ready, go!

176
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,750
One, two...

177
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,208
Hey, that looks like fun!

178
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,916
--Three more days.
--I think it's highly unlikely.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:48,250
Six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve.

180
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,666
This is bad.

181
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,875
All I did today was train her
in strengthening her body!

182
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,958
Why did she make that
stupid promise to quit

183
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,208
if she couldn't do the
trapeze in three days?

184
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,750
Well, Aries do have trouble
restraining their enthusiasm.

185
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,083
With them, it's all or nothing.

186
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,958
Once they commit to
being your friend,

187
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,416
they'll want to show that
friendship in all sorts of ways.

188
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,416
Like "How 'bout a nice little
kiss between two friends?"

189
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,500
Please, Sora,
I was just kidding.

190
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,958
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine,
one hundred.

191
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,458
Okay, next.

192
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,666
Something is burning.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,166
Huh?

194
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,166
That looks like Rosetta's shoe.

195
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,291
Wah!

196
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,291
Rosetta!

197
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,708
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,166
You almost started
a fire in your own room!

199
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,750
You added too much detergent,

200
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,583
and didn't shut
the door properly!

201
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,416
Milk cartons are recyclable!

202
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,625
Milk cartons?

203
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,833
Separate them from the rubbish.

204
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,708
Rosetta! Are you okay?

205
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,666
What's wrong?

206
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,958
Hmm. What's with all the
milk in the refrigerator?

207
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,291
Are you a cow?

208
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,541
Well, you see, I'm trying
to build up my muscles.

209
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,458
A diet of only milk isn't
going to build up your muscles.

210
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,958
You need well balanced meals.

211
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,416
And we should talk, Sora.

212
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,666
Yes.

213
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,416
Sora, Rosetta is your charge.

214
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,958
Didn't Kalos ask you
to look after her?

215
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,125
Yeah. He did.

216
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,541
You're like an elder
sister in this, okay?

217
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,958
It's important to
keep your promise,

218
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,625
but you also have to
keep her out of trouble.

219
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,958
You're going to have to
quit in two days anyway.

220
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,458
Hey, Sora!

221
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,083
It's about time for me to update
the Kaleido Stage website.

222
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,333
So, do you want me to
add a section on Rosetta?

223
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,541
That's a great idea!
You should do it!

224
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:50,208
Oh, yay! I'm so happy now!

225
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,625
Boy, oh boy.

226
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,000
Sora.

227
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,291
Uh-huh.

228
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,416
Huh? You're in a sweatshirt?

229
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,208
It's for training.
I'm going out to run.

230
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,208
You shouldn't push
yourself, Rosetta!

231
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,000
Only two days left.

232
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,958
Winners never quit,
and quitters never win.

233
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,291
Only two days left.

234
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,541
Rosetta, look, look!

235
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,916
Here I go!

236
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,875
Amazing.

237
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,166
Unlike yesterday, today
will be real training,

238
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,041
so I'm hooking you to
a lifeline for safety.

239
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,541
Is the belt too tight for you?

240
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,375
Uh-uh. It's fine.

241
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,250
Ah, there she is.

242
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,333
Rosetta, here's your webpage.

243
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,208
I think there should be a
banner at the top which says,

244
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,833
"Rosetta could be betta."

245
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,166
Let me see! Let me see!

246
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,958
What's this? Oh it looks great!

247
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,166
And that's not all!

248
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,541
How 'about "Rosetta
setta the bar too high"?

249
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,708
You did a great job.

250
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,416
Or maybe "Rosetta
fell into the netta"?

251
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,625
You look kinda tired.

252
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,875
Have you been in constant
practice all this time?

253
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,250
Maybe we could say-

254
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,875
Hey, Rosetta!

255
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,125
Rosetta?

256
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,583
Oh, no.

257
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,625
Shh. Don't worry, you guys,
she's just sleeping.

258
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,666
Sleeping?

259
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,750
Rosetta went to bedda.

260
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,000
Anna, stop it.

261
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,250
Can't you see she's exhausted?

262
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,041
Maybe we should just let her
take the rest of the day off.

263
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,541
Okay.

264
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,333
Oh, there's something else about
Rosetta I should tell you.

265
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,666
Before dozing off,

266
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,000
she said she'd never even
been on a swing before.

267
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,625
Huh?

268
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,125
What time is it?

269
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,750
Oh, no, I overslept!

270
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,916
Huh?

271
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,250
A note from Sora?

272
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,416
"To Rosetta, I have
the show today,

273
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,791
so we'll do the rest tomorrow.

274
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,875
We'll go to a secret
special training place,

275
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,166
so rest well until then. Sora."

276
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,750
Sora's in the middle
of the show right now,

277
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,125
but I'm not just gonna
lie in bed resting.

278
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,416
There's only one day left

279
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,916
until I have to make
good on my promise.

280
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,000
Sora, where's the secret
special training place?

281
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,333
It's Marion's elementary school.

282
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,041
You mean we're practicing
on kiddie swings today?

283
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,791
I've already got the teacher's
permission, so it's all set.

284
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,583
A-Are you trying to
humiliate me, Sora?

285
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,333
I'm serious about this.

286
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,708
Kalos said I was
ready for the stage.

287
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,125
But all I've managed to do
is cause everybody trouble.

288
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,708
And if things stay like this,

289
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,125
then going against my mother's
wishes and joining Kaleido Stage

290
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,375
will have been for nothing.

291
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,083
Marion, I know it's early,
but why don't we have lunch?

292
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,208
Yeah!

293
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,208
You too, Rosetta. Come on.

294
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,875
Okay Jonathan.

295
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,458
Rosetta, is it true you've
never been on a swing before?

296
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,708
Yeah.

297
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,958
In fact, I've never
even played in the park.

298
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,208
The only thing I've done
is practice diabolo.

299
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,708
Every day and every night,
since I was little.

300
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,333
In my case, I think I was three

301
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,708
when I first managed to
ride a swing by myself.

302
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,708
Of course, back then I
never gave a single thought

303
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,333
to appearing on stage.

304
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,708
I just wanted to
have fun playing.

305
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,583
Fun playing?

306
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,291
You have fun when you play.

307
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,458
It's what we're gonna
be doing today.

308
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,541
But Sora, I made a
promise to the boss that-

309
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,041
Here.

310
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,041
It's herb tea, to relax you.

311
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,833
Oh, thank you.

312
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,750
Hey, no fair, you gave
some to her and not me.

313
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,625
Leaving aside your
promise to the boss,

314
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,583
I would really like to see how
you and I do on the trapeze.

315
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,125
Oh.

316
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,583
I wanna perform diabolo with
you if you're still interested.

317
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,625
I'd like that.

318
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,000
I'd like to see that too, Sora.

319
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,708
All right, let's get going.

320
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,916
Okay.

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
Let's go!

322
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,416
The buildings we see over
there are Marion's school?

323
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,333
Yep, isn't it big?

324
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,375
You're kidding.

325
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,750
Huh? These are really
great swings.

326
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,583
Yeah, they are!
Let's play, Jonathan!

327
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,083
Here ya go!

328
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,250
Let's get on the swing, too.

329
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,000
What? Uh, okay.

330
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,291
The first thing you
should concentrate on

331
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,000
is learning how
to rock the swing.

332
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,291
--Oh.
--Now, sit down.

333
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,291
Uh, okay.

334
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,041
Rosetta!

335
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,416
Sorry, are you okay?

336
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,958
Sora, are you getting
tired of training me?

337
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,166
You can tell me.

338
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,791
No, not at all.

339
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:03,000
Or could it be that you
just don't like me anymore?

340
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,416
Hey, it's true.

341
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,916
Teacher Rosetta!

342
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,791
Me? Teacher?

343
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,291
Wow, it's really her.

344
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,458
And she's younger
than I thought.

345
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,833
Hey Rosetta, some of my
friends came by to meet you.

346
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,125
--I'm Maria!
--Hey there, I'm Ben.

347
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,458
--I'm Andy.
--They were wondering if maybe

348
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,625
you would teach them
how to juggle, Rosetta.

349
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,166
Huh?

350
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,000
Hello, Rosetta,
my name's Maggie.

351
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,250
And we've been trying
to put together

352
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,833
a juggling show for a
friend's birthday party.

353
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,333
But we just can't
seem to get it right.

354
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,041
We tried to learn by
watching a magician's video.

355
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,500
Isn't juggling one of
your specialties, Rosetta?

356
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,958
Uh, yes.

357
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,833
The birthday party's tomorrow.

358
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,125
Please teach us.

359
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,375
As a favor to me!

360
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,875
Okay. The first thing to do
is let me see how you juggle.

361
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,666
All right!

362
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,833
This one is called the
bouncing ball routine.

363
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,166
So we'll juggle the balls as
we bounce them on the ground.

364
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,166
Each of us will use three balls.

365
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,875
Ready, set, go!

366
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,375
Very good, very good.

367
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,916
All you guys are much
better jugglers than I am.

368
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,041
Oh, you really think
we're good jugglers?

369
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,708
We can't perform like this
in front of our friends!

370
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,291
When I first started,

371
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,416
I had a hard time learning how
to handle two balls at a time,

372
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,583
let alone three.

373
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,375
So all you guys have talent.

374
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,250
Wow, you guys were just
praised by a genius!

375
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,041
Everyone do your best!

376
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,250
Sora, that means
you too. Come on!

377
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,208
Okay, then I'll start
teaching you one at a time.

378
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,916
If you stay focused
and keep your cool,

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,333
I'm sure you'll all improve.

380
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,916
Here's a count: one, two, three.

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,833
Now follow me. One, two,
three. One, two, three.

382
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,291
I think I'm getting better.

383
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,750
The most important
thing is rhythm.

384
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,000
Whoa!

385
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,791
You're worse than
Jonathan, Sora.

386
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,250
Everyone has
gotten a lot better.

387
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,416
I practice every day,
and I still can't-

388
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,750
Rosetta!

389
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,000
Move your hands
the way I move mine.

390
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,041
Don't be impatient.
Keep your shoulders relaxed.

391
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,208
Kay.

392
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,416
--One, two, three...
--One, two, three...

393
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,958
Ha. Wow, I can do it!
I can do it!

394
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,500
Now don't get impatient.

395
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,083
If you try too hard, you'll
only end up losing the rhythm.

396
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,041
One, two, three.
One, two, three...

397
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,916
I see. I've also been
impatient with myself

398
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,125
for only being
able to do diabolo.

399
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,500
I've taught you all
I can about juggling,

400
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,791
and now the thing you need to do

401
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,958
is practice on your
own until tomorrow.

402
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,375
Thank you!

403
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,875
Excuse me, but is it true

404
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,708
that you don't know
how to use a swing?

405
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,416
Hey, Andy it's rude to
say things like that.

406
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,625
Oh, I don't mind.

407
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,625
It's true, I don't know
how to use a swing.

408
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,958
And if I can't learn,
I'll have to quit Kaleido Stage.

409
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,625
Huh?

410
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,291
--For real?
--Are you serious?

411
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,291
But it's really simple to learn.

412
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,875
First you sit down like this.
Then rock back and forth.

413
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,541
That's all you have to do.

414
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,166
Thank you, Andy.

415
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,625
Come on, then.
Let's see you give it a try.

416
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,250
Here Rosetta, have
a seat right here.

417
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,166
This time it's
your turn, Rosetta.

418
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,166
Rosetta, don't be impatient!

419
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,083
Keep your shoulders relaxed.

420
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,000
The most important
thing is rhythm.

421
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,666
Don't worry, I know what to do!

422
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah!

423
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,041
I'm ready.

424
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,541
Okay, sit down in my lap.

425
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,291
All you have to do is relax,
and I'll do the rest.

426
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,541
Okay, are you ready?

427
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,583
Now!

428
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,666
W-Wait, Sora!

429
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,750
I saw Kaleido Stage!

430
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,750
Where? Where?

431
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,791
Behind us!

432
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:48,958
I can't see it!

433
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,500
I saw it when you
first pushed off.

434
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,750
I wonder if I didn't
swing high enough.

435
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,875
If that's the case,
then we should swing higher!

436
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,958
Let's go way up!

437
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,166
Now look!

438
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,833
Wow, I can see it!

439
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:03,708
Rosetta!

440
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,125
What, Sora?

441
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,083
Do you realize you're the
one rocking the swing now?

442
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,083
What?

443
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,208
I'm not doing anything at all.

444
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,583
This is amazing.
I can rock the swing!

445
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,750
But I doubt that this'll
be good enough for Kalos.

446
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,041
Don't worry. I'll go
with you to say sorry.

447
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,750
You're a great friend.

448
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,625
Let's be together
all the time, Sora.

449
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,000
We weren't able to
keep the promise, Boss.

450
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,291
We're very sorry.

451
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,208
I don't recall
making any promises.

452
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,875
I promised to withdraw
if I couldn't learn

453
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,250
the trapeze in three days.

454
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,583
Oh, that promise.

455
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,083
So, I'm here to quit.

456
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,166
Rosetta.

457
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,625
Three years.

458
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,958
--Huh?
--What?

459
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,083
Rosetta, I expect you
to be the top trapeze star

460
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,416
within three years.

461
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,041
Does that mean...

462
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,083
Well, there's no point
holding you to a promise

463
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,916
that I can't seem to remember
agreeing to in the first place.

464
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,791
Sora, I, uh...

465
00:21:58,875 --> 00:21:59,916
Isn't this great?

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,291
We're gonna be
on stage together!

467
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,791
I'm so happy!

468
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,250
Don't let yourself
get complacent

469
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,083
or decide to skip a practice.

470
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,458
The three years will be
up before you know it.

471
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,000
Then don't worry.

472
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,125
I'm gonna practice hard and
become good on the trapeze,

473
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,041
so I won't be able
to do my diabolo show

474
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,791
more than three times a week.

475
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,125
You-You're serious?

476
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,708
Yes, I am.

477
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:23,875
Let's go, Sora.

478
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,166
Oh sure! See ya.

479
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,083
Three years from now,

480
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,666
I'm gonna do the legendary great
maneuver with Sora for sure.

481
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,625
Rosetta has already started
walking on her own two feet.

482
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,541
If I'm gonna be
a real Kaleido Star,

483
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,916
I'm gonna have to start
walking forward too.

484
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,541
Forward! Forward! Forward!

485
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,875
Layla!

486
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,458
What?

487
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:07,291
I can't believe it. I'm gonna be
co-starring again with Layla?

488
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,791
Just wait a second.

489
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,541
I'll be the one who gets
chosen as Layla's partner!

490
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,333
Oh, May, please
don't get in my way!

491
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,833
Oh, how I wanted to
see you again Layla.

492
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,541
Layla! Layla!

493
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,708
Next time on Kaleido Star:
"The Ever Amazing Miss Layla."

494
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:26,083
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
