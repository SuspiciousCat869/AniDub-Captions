1
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,625
Hey, everyone, Kaleido Star
is about to start,

2
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,833
so make sure that
your room is brightly lit

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,458
and that you're not sitting
too close to the TV, all right?

4
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,833
Let's go!

5
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,833
Kaleido Stage.

6
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,541
It is a place where lighting
and sound can create

7
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,208
what seems to be magic.

8
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:41,000
To many, it is the best
theatre in the world,

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,500
the place that first captured
their hearts and let them dream.

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,500
Once upon a time, there was
a girl who aspired to be

11
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,166
part of this theatre...

12
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,291
Help! Help me!

13
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,416
Help me! Help me!

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,166
Help me!

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,166
Help me!

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,375
I am so sorry!

17
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,375
Allow me to introduce myself.

18
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:16,791
I am the spirit of
the stage, The Fool.

19
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,500
I will be your guide today,
as I bring you up-to-date

20
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:23,291
on Sora Naegino's short
but remarkable career.

21
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,791
She came from Japan, aspiring
to be part of Kaleido Stage.

22
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,125
I'm finally here!

23
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,458
Sixteen year-old
Sora had arrived.

24
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,708
...and become a
big huge mega superstar!

25
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,625
I can, I shall, I will!

26
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,833
She came with such high hopes,

27
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:17,416
but a run of bad luck threatened
to shatter her dreams forever.

28
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,625
She used her strong will

29
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,958
and athletic abilities
to stop the thief.

30
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,375
Poor guy.

31
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:34,625
Finally, Sora arrived at
Kaleido Stage for her audition.

32
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,375
Oh, no, I can't
believe I'm so late.

33
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,291
Oh thank God I'm here.

34
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,541
Uh, and you are...?

35
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,750
Uh, my name is
Sora Naegino, sir.

36
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,250
I apologize for my tardiness.

37
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,583
Oh, I'm sorry Miss, but the
auditions have already ended.

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,333
Huh?

39
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,541
But I came all the way

40
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,041
from Japan just to be
in these auditions.

41
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,666
Huh? Well, perhaps we have
time for one more performer.

42
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,833
Oh, thank you so much.

43
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,791
You won't regret this, I-

44
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,166
No.

45
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,375
Oh, uh, Miss Layla.

46
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,958
The auditions are over.

47
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,708
Layla Hamilton, I can't
believe it's really her.

48
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,833
Uh, but wait,
there's a reason I'm late!

49
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't you know that

50
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,166
a stage production
always starts on time?

51
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,291
But, I-

52
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,041
Go back home.

53
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,666
No, wait, you don't even
know what I can do, yet!

54
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,333
Miss Layla, please!
I absolutely, positively,

55
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,458
just really want
to join the Kaleido Stage!

56
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,166
Oh, please, Miss Layla.

57
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,458
I made a promise to my parents,

58
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,333
that if I failed today,
then I'd quit.

59
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,291
Sora could feel her
dreams slipping away.

60
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,041
If they wouldn't
see her audition,

61
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,791
she could never even hope
to be a Kaleido Star.

62
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,416
The show is starting soon,

63
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,333
would you like
to come and see it?

64
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,250
Huh? Is that okay?

65
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,958
Well, it's the least
I could do for you,

66
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,250
since you came all this way.

67
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,333
Wow, thank you.

68
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,708
Oh, by the way, I'm Ken.

69
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,875
So Ken took Sora
backstage to watch the show.

70
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,750
And that's when...

71
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,791
Hey look out!

72
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,708
She ended up injuring
one of the cast members.

73
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,583
By accident of course.

74
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,666
Then someone
unexpected showed up.

75
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,375
The boss.

76
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,875
The boss?

77
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,500
You will fill the role.

78
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,750
I-I...

79
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,125
She was actually going
to appear on stage.

80
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,625
But when the show started,

81
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,916
she didn't know whether
to be elated or terrified.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Lookout!

83
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,208
Oh, Sora.

84
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,250
No! I can't do it!

85
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,708
I can't perform!

86
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,208
I'm gonna fail.

87
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,541
Huh?

88
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,000
That's right.

89
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,000
I can't say that I can't do it.

90
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,000
I can do it.

91
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,541
I can do it.

92
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,375
Miss Rabbit!

93
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,500
I can't see below.

94
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,416
Sora!

95
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,708
Move it!

96
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,000
Yuri?

97
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,833
Just keep smiling
until the end.

98
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,500
Okay.

99
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,333
And so the show ended.

100
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,666
Sora had her chance to appear
on stage after all, but...

101
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,458
You're a naive little girl.

102
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,458
Don't you understand
that by now?

103
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,083
Yeah.

104
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,166
There's no place for you here.

105
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,791
Yeah.

106
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,750
Sora knew she
hadn't performed well.

107
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,375
And now it looked like her first
performance at Kaleido Stage

108
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,083
was destined to be her last.

109
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,000
Sora!

110
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,708
Huh?

111
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,791
Boss said that you passed!

112
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,791
You're passing
an unknown amateur

113
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,083
who didn't even audition?

114
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,500
Some day, the audience

115
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,791
will come here just to see
this little girl perform.

116
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,666
Now that the owner of Kaleido
Stage recognized her talent,

117
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,250
she was allowed
into the company.

118
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,500
Still, many more excruciating
ordeals were in store for her.

119
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,500
Hmm.

120
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,541
The Golden Phoenix.

121
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,416
Uh, good morning.

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,833
Yeah, if you like cleaning
that much, you can go ahead

123
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,125
and do all of ours
while you're at it.

124
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:21,833
Huh?

125
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,208
The company didn't like

126
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,666
that she'd been admitted
under special circumstances.

127
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,833
And on top of that,

128
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,625
Layla Hamilton made
a demand of her own.

129
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,541
Well, I didn't- I didn't mean...

130
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,583
Go ahead then... Why don't
show us your Golden Phoenix?

131
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,166
The Golden Phoenix-

132
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,958
an extremely difficult
maneuver only Layla could do.

133
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,125
...I won't acknowledge
your presence here.

134
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,958
You don't belong on the stage.

135
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,333
All right then. I'll do it!

136
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,250
I'll show you that I can
do the Golden Phoenix!

137
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,875
Really? I will
look forward to it.

138
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,416
Show me in a week,

139
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,583
but if you can't do it

140
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,583
after claiming so
boldly that you could,

141
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,416
you will leave here immediately.

142
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,041
Fine.

143
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,500
And so Sora's fight to gain

144
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:16,166
the company's acceptance
at Kaleido Stage began.

145
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,750
Are you okay?

146
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,250
Yeah, I'm fine.

147
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,875
If you fall, make sure you
land on your back. All right?

148
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,000
You don't have enough
momentum! Just let go!

149
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,250
Whew.

150
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,458
During the day she studied,
and at night she trained.

151
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,666
With this rigorous schedule,
she soon found it impossible

152
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,875
to hide her fatigue
from those around her.

153
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,416
Check her out.

154
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,583
She really must
be working hard.

155
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,916
Sora!

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,583
We brought you something!

157
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,916
We know you haven't
eaten anything.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,916
And so, Sora's hard work
even won her the friendship

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,666
of some of her colleagues.

160
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,125
I can't believe
she's really doing it.

161
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,208
If only she could
grab that bar!

162
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,541
No, not yet.

163
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,958
She still can't keep a
beautiful pose in the air.

164
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,458
Even before she catches the bar,

165
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,375
what she is doing can't be
called a Golden Phoenix.

166
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,958
Go, Sora!

167
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:25,833
By tomorrow... It has to
be perfect it by tomorrow.

168
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,000
The day of Sora's test
had finally arrived.

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,791
I cannot wait to see

170
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,583
what kind of Golden Phoenix
she's going to show us.

171
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,875
I know.

172
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,125
I've gotta do it.
I must believe!

173
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,208
It was foolhardy for her
even to attempt it.

174
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,666
But would Sora be able to
complete the Golden Phoenix

175
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,625
and stay at
Kaleido Stage after all?

176
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,916
Her audience waited in
breathless anticipation.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,916
Sora's entire future
depended on this moment.

178
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,625
This was a once
in a lifetime gamble.

179
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,458
The one I need to aim
for is not the bar.

180
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,250
My aim is my love.

181
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,666
My aim is Romeo.

182
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,625
And then...

183
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,500
 Then I'll be Juliet!

184
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,083
The Golden Phoenix!

185
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,333
She did it!

186
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,750
Oh my G-

187
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,625
Sora, are you all right?

188
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,791
Yes, thank you.

189
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,833
You're really something.

190
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,541
Oh, Layla.

191
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,333
You didn't get
the last part right,

192
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,208
but it was definitely
the Golden Phoenix.

193
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,416
You deserve credit
for pulling it off.

194
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,875
Yuri, let's go.

195
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,833
Sora, you can stay
at Kaleido Stage!

196
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,166
And that is how Sora became
a member of Kaleido Stage.

197
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,208
Later, with her new
friends Anna and Mia,

198
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,791
she would learn how
to be a real company member.

199
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,958
And perhaps more importantly,

200
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,041
Sora would pass on her
newfound knowledge to others,

201
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,833
giving them a greater
love of the stage.

202
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,708
As with the lonely
little girl, Rosetta.

203
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,791
Who is she?

204
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,916
Don't you know?

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,500
She's that diabolo
prodigy from France.

206
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,083
She's great, a total genius!

207
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,375
Well, I'll see you later then.

208
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,750
I look forward to it.

209
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,083
Rosetta was extremely arrogant.

210
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,333
On stage, she gave the kind of
performance one would expect

211
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,458
from a world diabolo champion.

212
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,000
But it still left
something to be desired.

213
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,833
She is amazing.

214
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,875
But why isn't she
more fun to watch?

215
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,166
Watching her is like
watching a diabolo machine.

216
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,041
Mama, I'm bored!

217
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,083
I was going to
terminate your contract.

218
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,416
Oh.

219
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,708
I'm going to pay you
for the rest of this week,

220
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,958
but I don't want to
see you on stage again.

221
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,083
Those words hurt
Rosetta's pride.

222
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,958
Sora saw this and wanted
to do something for her.

223
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,375
She can do better if
you just let her try!

224
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,583
I'll give Rosetta another
shot on one condition.

225
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,250
Yes, what is it?

226
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,916
You do the show with her.

227
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,500
What's that?

228
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,208
Six days.

229
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,375
But Boss, wait!

230
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:59,250
I've never done
diabolo in my life.

231
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,125
But there was an
even bigger concern.

232
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,000
Would Rosetta even agree
to share the stage with Sora?

233
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,583
What was Kalos thinking,
pairing me with you?

234
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,916
I don't go on stage
to make mistakes.

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,875
What's the point of doing it
if you can't do it flawlessly?

236
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,458
Rosetta's words were harsh, but
they couldn't discourage Sora.

237
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,666
Ken, I think I've got an idea!

238
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,166
She performed on
the outdoor stage.

239
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,583
Catch!

240
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,500
Whoa, what's going on here?

241
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,041
Just jump in!

242
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,041
Caught it!

243
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,583
Haha she's so bad!

244
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,166
You're incredible, Sora!

245
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,208
Weird, isn't it?

246
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,708
What is?

247
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,000
When I watch her perform,

248
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,166
I get really nervous
she'll make a mistake.

249
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,666
I'm always on
the edge of my seat.

250
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,208
It's always so
exciting to watch her,

251
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,166
because she does
make a lot of mistakes.

252
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,041
But every once in a while,
she pulls off a trick,

253
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,500
and it's unbelievable.

254
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,708
Like magic!

255
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,541
You should go watch her tonight.

256
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,375
See what you think.

257
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,291
Watch Sora perform?

258
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,333
So Rosetta stayed to
see Sora's show that night.

259
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,791
Afterward, she was struck by the
audience's thunderous applause.

260
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,416
It's amazing.

261
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,833
Nothing like the
performances I give.

262
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,791
Sora!

263
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,708
Rosetta, you came
to see the show!

264
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:45,791
I want to perform diabolo with
you if you're still interested.

265
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,166
I'd like that!

266
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,541
And now, it's time for

267
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:57,916
Kaleido Stage's first
ever diabolo battle!

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,875
In this corner, we have the
world champion, Rosetta!

269
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,208
And in this corner,

270
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,500
with only five days diabolo
experience, is Sora.

271
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,041
Ready? Battle!

272
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,875
Lookin' good! Let's go, Sora!

273
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,666
You can do it, Rosetta!

274
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,875
Here!

275
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,833
And Rosetta wins it!

276
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,791
They sounded like
they'd never stop cheering.

277
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,208
At that moment,

278
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,916
Rosetta realized what
she should have known before:

279
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,125
that to please an audience is
the reason one should perform

280
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,291
in the first place.

281
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,541
Thanks for everything, Sora.

282
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,041
And then Sora moved

283
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,958
one step closer to
her goal of being a star.

284
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,000
An opportunity arose for her to
perform in the Little Mermaid.

285
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,708
Sora's talent and determination
caught the eye of an investor,

286
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,500
who insisted that she
be given a shot at the lead.

287
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,791
Amazing!

288
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,333
Her audition
went extremely well.

289
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,625
You're our new Kaleido Star.

290
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,250
Even Layla, who had been so
quick to dismiss Sora before,

291
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,333
had to acknowledge her talent.

292
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,541
I'm looking forward to it, too.

293
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,500
And so, Sora finally got

294
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,875
the chance to perform
with her idol, Layla.

295
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,500
However, the difference in
their skill level was obvious.

296
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,833
One, two, three...

297
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,916
They couldn't seem to
get their timing right.

298
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,625
Sorry!

299
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,750
So Layla took unexpected action.

300
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,541
Yes?

301
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,083
But Layla, what are you-?

302
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,625
I leave you kids to it.

303
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,458
Thank you.

304
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,833
Yeah, okay.

305
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,708
So, what's up?

306
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,750
I'm going to be staying
with you, if you don't mind.

307
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,041
Wha-?

308
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,208
Oh, that's just-

309
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,875
That's exactly why I came here.

310
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,000
I need to observe the way
you move in day-to-day life.

311
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,416
By living in close quarters,

312
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,875
I hope we can understand
each other's movements better.

313
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,208
So we understand each
other's movements better.

314
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,208
Right.

315
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,166
Sora! Wanna get some food?

316
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,916
And thus was the start
of their new partnership.

317
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,875
Sora tried hard to adjust
herself to Layla's pace,

318
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,875
even though she was
unsure of herself.

319
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,250
However,

320
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,250
there weren't many
days left until

321
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,833
the opening of the show.

322
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,666
Their performance was
far from being perfect.

323
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,416
And around that time...

324
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:53,958
Jump!

325
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,958
That was too close!

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,083
I think we should
tone down the climax,

327
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,125
or else the show's
gonna blow up in our faces.

328
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,250
So you're saying you wanna
make the fight scene easy?

329
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,250
Yes.

330
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,375
Unacceptable.

331
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,791
But Layla, I'm-

332
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,083
We can't hold
back on the climax.

333
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,500
The show'll fall apart.

334
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,125
All we need is one more day.

335
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,166
They only had one day left.

336
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,583
They had to make
a drastic move.

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,083
Excuse me, but-

338
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,458
We're going to
practice out here.

339
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,916
What?

340
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,791
Having the fight
be perfect isn't enough.

341
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,833
It's the same kind of choice

342
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,666
I've been making
on stage for years.

343
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,041
What are you saying?

344
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,416
This has to be a real fight,
between the two of us.

345
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,166
A real fight?
Between me and Layla?

346
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,458
So what?

347
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,291
Will you do it or not?

348
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,625
Right.

349
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,875
Then, their real life fight
without a lifeline began.

350
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,541
She's really
serious about this!

351
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,083
If I drop my guard
for one second,

352
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,791
she's gonna toss
me into the ocean!

353
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,666
Make that mistake again,
and you're gonna be shark bait.

354
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:18,125
But what fate had in store,
neither could possibly foresee.

355
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,333
One more day until
the opening of their show.

356
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,500
Sora and Layla's intense
training continued even during

357
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,250
a violent storm.

358
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,708
They're like... machines.

359
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,000
Are you ready to give up yet?

360
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,458
No way!

361
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,041
Oh, really?

362
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,625
No, Miss Hamilton!

363
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,916
You still in one piece?

364
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,916
Yeah!

365
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,041
Then the day of
their opening arrived.

366
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,125
Would their first performance
together be a success?

367
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,333
Sora!

368
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,291
Thank you, Layla.

369
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,458
It's been a really long time

370
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,416
since I've heard the
audience applaud like this.

371
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,125
I'm so happy!

372
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,625
I don't know what to say.

373
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:43,041
I don't want this
moment to ever end!

374
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:47,541
Through her performance with
Layla, Sora had grown up a lot.

375
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,458
But she had just started down
the path to becoming a star.

376
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,000
She still knew very little

377
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,666
about the kind of
ordeals that lay ahead.

378
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,291
Kaleido Stage is going
to be taken over by Yuri.

379
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:11,958
Suddenly, Layla and Sora's
partnership is jeopardized.

380
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,166
What will happen
to Sora's dream now?

381
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,000
Then, Sora flies to the
Grand Canyon and embarks on

382
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,916
a rigorous training
regimen with Layla

383
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,541
in order to attempt the
Legendary Great Maneuver,

384
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,750
a move which has cost
many performers their lives.

385
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,250
What will happen?

386
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,166
Next time on Kaleido Star:
'Amazing Prologue to Stardom.'
