1
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,375
Hey, everyone, we're
gonna watch Kaleido Star,

2
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,250
so make sure your room is
brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,125
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,041
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,750
Do any of you have siblings?

6
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,958
Older brothers or sisters
who take care of you,

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,625
or little brothers and
sisters that you take care of?

8
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,750
In my family it's always
been just me and my parents,

9
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,750
but soon there's
going to be a new baby.

10
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,250
I should be really happy, but
part of me is kinda nervous.

11
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,541
What do I do, what do I do?

12
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,583
I know. But you
don't need to worry.

13
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm going to get an apartment
with some of my friends.

14
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,958
And we've decided to make
our own theatre company!

15
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,833
Well, yes, I know it'll be
hard, but we've gotta try.

16
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:37,041
So I guess I won't be visiting
you for a little while.

17
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, wow that's really... I
guess what I'm supposed to say

18
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,083
is congratulations.
That's great news, Mom.

19
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,083
I'm really happy for you!

20
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,291
I what? I sound weird to you?

21
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,083
No, no, nothing's wrong...

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,791
'Amazing Family Ties.'

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,000
All right, as of today
I'm starting a new life.

24
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:15,625
A new life... I should
be happy for them.

25
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,083
Why am I being so selfish?

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,666
No need to look so glum, Sora.
I am coming with you after all.

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,291
You're gonna live with us?

28
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,333
That's so sweet. You were
afraid you might lose me.

29
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,791
If I catch you peeping at Mia

30
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,000
or Anna I'm feeding you
to Jonathan, you hear me?

31
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,083
Uh right.

32
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,208
Thanks for waiting!

33
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,291
Come on, you're late.

34
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,750
Are you finally ready to go?

35
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,583
Yes.

36
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,750
Then let's get out of here.

37
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,500
Your family's great
to take us in until

38
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,000
we find can find a place.

39
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,583
They've really been looking
forward to meeting you guys,

40
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,458
especially --

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,375
Hi, Sarah.

42
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,375
You're all packed up
and ready to go I see.

43
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,916
Where are you going?

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,333
Right now? To training.
See you later...

45
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,750
To training?

46
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,291
You think she meant
for her singing?

47
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,375
Knowing her, I think it's
probably for martial arts.

48
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, that sounds
more like Sarah's style.

49
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,833
Seriously, Ken, your
family's a lifesaver.

50
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,208
My grandmother would've

51
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,166
made me come home if I
didn't have a place to stay.

52
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,375
Yeah, I was gonna wait
to tell my Mom about this,

53
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,125
but Yuri's buy-out is
already all over the news.

54
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,625
Well, there was no way I was
going to stand by and let

55
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,083
the three of you be homeless.

56
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,125
Wow you sound so manly, Ken.

57
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,500
Stop making fun of me.

58
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,916
Sorry...

59
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,291
Sora?

60
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,541
Is something bothering you?

61
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,916
No, I'm fine, really.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,041
Sora!

63
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,833
Your suitcase!

64
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,791
Hey!

65
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,250
Just one more thing:
before you meet my family,

66
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,791
there's something
I need to tell you...

67
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,958
What is it?

68
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,416
Now, I've already
talked to her about it,

69
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,416
but my younger sister might...

70
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,750
This is it.

71
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,791
Wow, this is like a little park!

72
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,333
Yeah my father built
all of this himself.

73
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,416
He built this? That's amazing!

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,916
Yeah, I know, but about
my little sister..

75
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,791
Anna! I can't believe it's you!

76
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,291
This is for you!

77
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,125
Now pose with it!
Come on, pose!

78
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,666
This is my little sister,
Lucy. She's Anna's biggest fan.

79
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,083
You're kidding, right?

80
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,625
Ken!

81
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:31,458
It's rude to keep our guests
outside. Please. Come in, girls.

82
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,333
This way, Anna.

83
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,750
Uh, this is my Mom-- oh, boy...

84
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,541
Ben! Wake up.
Our guests are here.

85
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,500
It's nice to meet you!

86
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,041
Oh, uh, thank you.

87
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,333
Really, napping in
the middle of the day...

88
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,041
I wasn't napping, I was
thinking of design ideas.

89
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,166
I've heard that before.
Now, welcome our guests, Ben.

90
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,958
My father's a designer--
of furniture mostly.

91
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,291
Oh.

92
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,458
Don't be shy, girls,
come on in and have a seat.

93
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,708
Does everyone like coffee?

94
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,041
Yeah, that sounds great.

95
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,666
Hey Anna. Come on, sit down.

96
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,416
Make yourself at home.

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,708
Wow! I can't believe
Anna's sitting on our couch!

98
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,958
Somehow... Anna's different
than I expected...

99
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,333
Sorry about that.

100
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,291
You don't like it?

101
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,083
Well not really.

102
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,666
You're right, posing like a
monkey is such a tired cliché.

103
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,833
Oooh!

104
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,708
Yeah! That's great!

105
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,041
...And this is the last one.

106
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,750
The three of you will
be staying in here.

107
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,208
Right. Thank you.

108
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,083
Awesome!

109
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,375
Glad you like it. This
used to be the playroom,

110
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,083
so sorry if it's
a little childish.

111
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,625
No. It's wonderful!

112
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,541
Did you design all the
furniture in here, too?

113
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,041
Yep, and if you find anything
you like, I want you to take it

114
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,166
with you when you move
into your own apartment.

115
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,333
You mean it?!

116
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,083
Here. It's something
new to pose with.

117
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,083
Put me down! Put me down! I
wanna stay with Anna! Daddy!

118
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,250
So I, uh, guess I'll
see you guys at dinner.

119
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,458
Anna! Daddy!

120
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,458
We have got
to find our own place.

121
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,958
And quick.

122
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,291
This used to be the play room.
Once my mother and father's

123
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:19,916
real child is born,
I wonder if I...

124
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,166
Sora, are you all right?

125
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,916
You've been really
quiet all day today.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,208
No I haven't!

127
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,416
How'd he get in there?

128
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,541
Sora?

129
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,750
He's gone.

130
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,208
Where is he?

131
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,416
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,958
Is it a bug or something?

133
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,125
Sora?

134
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,458
What the heck are you doing?

135
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,500
Gotcha!

136
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,125
I'm sorry. I made that noise.

137
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,750
Do you think I can make up for
by helping you prepare dinner.

138
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,291
We'd like to help, too.

139
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,583
Well, thank you, girls. And
don't you worry about the noise.

140
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,666
It was getting too
quiet around here.

141
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,208
Ken used to jump off of
that top bunk all the time

142
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,416
when he was a boy.

143
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,916
Really?

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,791
Yes. He always dreamed of
being a star at Kaleido Stage.

145
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,416
It's really too bad
he had such a weak heart.

146
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
His condition doesn't prevent
him from living a normal life,

147
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,291
but I'm afraid becoming
an acrobat was simply

148
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,791
out of the question.

149
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,041
It was hard for
him to give it up.

150
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,166
He fought against it
for a long time.

151
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,458
But, as his mother,
I'm glad he's done with it.

152
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm always afraid he's going

153
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,375
to come home one day and say
he's started performing again.

154
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,000
Ken! Give me my camera back!

155
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:37,416
No way. You've already pestered
Anna enough with it today.

156
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,166
I need pictures or my friends
won't believe she's here!

157
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,958
Why don't you just
invite them over, then?

158
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,208
So they can see for themselves.

159
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,416
Good idea!

160
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,708
Dad, will you please
stop encouraging her?

161
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,750
Oh how funny my little brother

162
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,250
and I used to fight like
that all the time, as well.

163
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,791
Sometimes I used to argue
with my mother like that.

164
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,791
At home I don't
think we ever fought.

165
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,666
Hey, who's hungry?!

166
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,750
Sora?

167
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,625
Ken?

168
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,750
Can't sleep, huh?

169
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,916
No, it's just
so nice out here...

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,958
Sorry my family's so noisy.

171
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,875
Oh, no, I think
it's kinda nice.

172
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,291
I mean, how all of you can say
exactly what's on your mind,

173
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,750
just like a real family.

174
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,541
What are you
trying to say, Sora?

175
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,041
That your parents don't
feel like real family?

176
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,375
Oh, of course not. I didn't
mean it the way it sounded.

177
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,041
Do you mind if I ask you

178
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
what you've been so
worried about today?

179
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:41,291
I'm not worried. Actually,
I just heard some good news.

180
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,416
My mother's going
to have a baby!

181
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,291
So you're gonna be
a sister. You excited?

182
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,458
They always wanted kids.

183
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,875
I used to wonder if they'd never
had their own because of me.

184
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,375
That they didn't want to
make me feel like an outsider.

185
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,541
Silly, huh?

186
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,041
Sometimes it's not
easy having a sibling.

187
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,208
It was rough
when Lucy was born.

188
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,708
Seemed like my parents spent
so much time caring for her

189
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,041
that they didn't
notice me anymore.

190
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,708
I used to be bad on purpose

191
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,708
just so my mom and dad
would pay attention to me.

192
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,708
I'm too old to do something
like that. I've never even

193
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,708
argued with them,
I don't want to start now.

194
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,833
Besides, I'd be afraid of...
breaking our family bond...

195
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,750
I don't think that's possible.

196
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,583
Well, don't be afraid of arguing
with me. I mean maybe you and I

197
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,833
can be the kind of
family you want.

198
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:42,250
You're right, Ken.
We are kind of like family.

199
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:42,958
Sora...

200
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,291
You, me, Mia and Anna.

201
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,541
Because the four of us

202
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,875
are going to make our
very own Kaleido Stage.

203
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,291
There's no time
to sit around moping.

204
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,250
First thing tomorrow morning
we're gonna find an apartment.

205
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,291
Good night, Ken!

206
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,875
But that isn't
what I meant at all.

207
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,458
That's right. I've got a family
here that I can turn to.

208
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,833
And we're gonna make

209
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,375
a theatre company my parents
will be proud to see!

210
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,500
Don't ever stop
being my friends.

211
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,125
That Sora...

212
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,041
She should be ashamed
of the way she treats me...

213
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,250
The Empress?!

214
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,291
See you later!

215
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,166
Are you all right?

216
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,791
Mm-hm.

217
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,333
Wow, this one has
it's very own front yard!

218
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,750
Too much.

219
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,833
A rental house in the
suburbs might be a good idea.

220
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,666
Too far.

221
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,916
How about this?

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,250
It's not as expensive
and it's closer to town.

223
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,333
No way.

224
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,208
Oh, hi.

225
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,583
What's wrong with living here?

226
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,666
Well, this building gets
broken into every other day.

227
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,916
Oh...

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,166
We're never gonna find
an apartment, are we?

229
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,208
Huh... Maybe I can help you...

230
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,416
Well, this is it.

231
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,000
You're kidding.

232
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,666
Aw, c'mon, it's not as bad as it
looks. It's in a great location,

233
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,166
the rent is cheap and --

234
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,291
You'd have an excellent
downstairs neighbor.

235
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,875
Doctor Kate?!

236
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,708
This is it.

237
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,500
Wow...

238
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,500
So?

239
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,333
It's just what
we're looking for.

240
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,666
Told ya.

241
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,041
It's a lot cleaner than
it looks from the outside.

242
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,750
And it's so big!

243
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,458
What a great view.

244
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,750
Yeah. It's perfect.

245
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,916
Right.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,875
You know, I think
I'd like living here.

247
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:48,666
Me too.

248
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,916
Then it's settled.

249
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,125
From here we're going to
start our own Kaleido Stage.

250
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,000
Nothing can get in our way!

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,458
And I live right downstairs,

252
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,541
so just let me know if you girls
need anything at all, okay?

253
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,958
It's perfect, isn't it?

254
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,291
Well, come on.

255
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,166
Let's go to my place and
I'll make you some coffee.

256
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,000
We're going to your apartment?

257
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,625
You can move something if you
want to sit on the chairs.

258
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,458
She's totally hot
but she lives in filth.

259
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,208
Maybe it isn't so perfect.

260
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,583
We're gonna have to come down
here and clean this place

261
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,500
if we don't want
a bug infestation.

262
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,666
But that's a small price to
pay for such a great place.

263
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,375
Jerry, what have you
done with the coffee?

264
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,583
Jerry?

265
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,750
I didn't know his name
was Jerry, did you?

266
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,625
It's cute!

267
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,083
You know it suits him.

268
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,916
Watch it! You'd better
not make fun of my name!

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,083
Who'd have thought
we'd find a place so soon?

270
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,875
I know, we're lucky!

271
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,625
But Lucy's gonna
be so disappointed

272
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,958
that we're moving out.

273
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,333
Maybe we should
leave Anna there?

274
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,375
Not funny.

275
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,625
Who's Ken talking
to over there?

276
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh, Sora!

277
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,708
Sora.

278
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,541
It's my Mom and my Dad.

279
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,083
Thank you very much.

280
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,541
Oh, sure.

281
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,291
That was a really long trip
for Mrs. Naegino to make.

282
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,666
I wonder if they want
to take Sora back home.

283
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,625
And right when we
finally found an apartment...

284
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,291
You should've let me
know you were coming.

285
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,708
I would've come to meet you.

286
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,375
We decided to come
at the last minute.

287
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,625
We went to the dormitory--

288
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,208
they said you'd been kicked out.

289
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,375
Oh, sorry. I was going to call
you once we found an apartment.

290
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,666
Is it okay for you to travel,

291
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,625
I mean since it's so
close to your due date?

292
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm perfectly fine.

293
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,875
Your mother insisted on
coming here to check on you.

294
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,041
Because you sounded just
terrible over the phone.

295
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,875
Did I sound that bad?
I'm so sorry.

296
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,500
But you don't have anything
to worry about, 'cause I'm fine.

297
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,000
I can't tell how
you're doing over the phone.

298
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,833
Oh really? Um I'm good--
we found a new apartment.

299
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,250
My friend the policeman,
you met him, Dad, you remember,

300
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,666
he showed us the place.
Isn't that great?

301
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,708
And his friend Kate
lives downstairs from us,

302
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,958
she's a doctor.

303
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,541
I think he's secretly
in love with her, too,

304
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,250
but he says there's
nothing going--

305
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:56,458
Sora. I want you
to come back Japan with us.

306
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,333
Now that you're not
with Kaleido Stage,

307
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,583
I don't know how you're
going to make a living here.

308
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,625
Well, you see, my friends
and I are going to--

309
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,291
I know, you want to create
your own Kaleido Stage.

310
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,375
But why can't you
do that in Japan?

311
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,583
You wouldn't have to work,

312
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,500
so you'd be free to
come up with new ideas.

313
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,416
And your father and I wouldn't
have to worry about whether

314
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,958
you were getting
enough to eat. We--

315
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,250
Once you have your own child

316
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,708
you won't have time
to worry about me anymore.

317
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,791
I'm not going to matter to you.

318
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,250
Sora...

319
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,500
You're being ridiculous!

320
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:33,916
How could we ever forget about
you? You are our child, Sora.

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,083
I didn't mean...

322
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,958
This isn't how
I wanted this to happen.

323
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,333
I'm sorry, Sora. I just--

324
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,583
Midori?

325
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,125
Mom?!

326
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,291
Oh my goodness. Ken,
call an ambulance, quickly.

327
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,000
Right.

328
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,875
Ben! Get the car ready!

329
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,250
Midori! Hold on!

330
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,375
Please lay down. The
ambulance will be here soon.

331
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,875
Midori? Midori!

332
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,750
Mom!

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,250
A Cesarian section? But she's
only in her seventh month.

334
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,916
This is an emergency. You
have no choice, Mr. Naegino.

335
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,916
Ben, please. Stop pacing,
you're making me nervous.

336
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,958
Right.

337
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,708
What have I done?

338
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,291
Sora, don't worry. Your mother
is going to be all right.

339
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,375
I said such a terrible thing
to her, Ken. And now she...

340
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,250
Sora this isn't your fault.

341
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,458
No. I've been so dumb.

342
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:37,208
I just thought that once she
has a baby once she has a baby

343
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,625
of her own she
won't need me anymore.

344
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,958
So even though I know
she's so excited about this,

345
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,583
I haven't I haven't been able
to be really happy for her.

346
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,625
I hated myself for feeling
this way, and I knew that if

347
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,000
I went back to Japan
she'd see how selfish I am.

348
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,583
That's why I I said
all those things.

349
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,916
She was trying so hard

350
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,750
to be a good mother to me
and I pushed her away.

351
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,666
And now now she might lose
the baby because of me.

352
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,916
Sora. A truly selfish person
could never be this worried

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,458
about someone else.

354
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,916
You don't want anything bad
to happen to her or the baby.

355
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,083
That's what being
a family's about.

356
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,833
Nothing you say could
ever destroy that.

357
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,583
You'll be there for
each other, no matter what.

358
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,041
Your mother and the baby
are working hard in there.

359
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,666
Let's cheer them on.

360
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,500
You're right. Thank you, Ken.

361
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:44,458
Oh, Mom, please be all right.
And the baby...

362
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:51,291
Please, please let it be born
safely. That's all I want.

363
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,250
They're both okay.
And it's a girl.

364
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,916
Your mother's taking
a rest right now.

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,416
She's had a long evening.

366
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,541
Thank you for everything.

367
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,625
She's so tiny.

368
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, she was
two months premature.

369
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,416
She's all right, Sora.

370
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,875
This is just like
when you were born.

371
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,791
You were premature and had to
be kept in an incubator, too.

372
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,750
I remember your mother

373
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,291
and father were
so worried about you.

374
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,541
They blamed themselves,

375
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,291
too and they hated not
being able to hold you.

376
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,958
Every time they'd
come to visit you,

377
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,000
they'd tell you to grow up
strong and healthy.

378
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,833
I remember it like
it was yesterday,

379
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,416
the two of them cheering you on.

380
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,125
They couldn't wait
to take you home.

381
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,833
When you told me you
wanted to join Kaleido Stage,

382
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,083
the first thing I thought was,
'What would her father say?'

383
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:05,083
And I guess I'll never
know what he would've done.

384
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:09,000
But I think they would have
let you go just like we did.

385
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,666
And they would've been just as
worried about their little Sora,

386
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,875
even though their little
Sora's all grown up and able

387
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,250
to take care of herself.

388
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,583
But I guess that's just
what mothers and fathers do,

389
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,833
don't they.

390
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,000
They never stop worrying
about their children.

391
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:27,500
Just like Midori and I can't
stop worrying about you, huh?

392
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,750
Thanks, Dad.

393
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,583
Sora. Why don't you go
visit your mother now?

394
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:48,166
Sora. I gave you
all a scare, didn't I?

395
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,291
Mom, I-- I'm so sorry.

396
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,625
For what? Sora, nothing that
happened today was your fault.

397
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:57,958
But, Mom. I said those terrible
things to you. And then this.

398
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,625
The worst part is
I knew I hurt you.

399
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,958
I knew you couldn't leave

400
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,166
and I said something that
drove you into a corner.

401
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,583
I was being
really unfair to you.

402
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,541
So you said something you didn't
want to say. I pushed you.

403
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,083
No.

404
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,875
I'm sorry. To tell the truth,
your father and I came here

405
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,958
because I wanted you
to be at home with me...

406
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,333
I wanted you to be there
when the baby was born.

407
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,958
After all, you're the
only older sister she's got,

408
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,750
and when you told me on the
phone you weren't coming home

409
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,375
Well, I lost my composure
and I made your father get us

410
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,666
on the next flight to Cape Mary.

411
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,125
But I guess
I got my wish anyway.

412
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,500
You were here for
your sister's birth.

413
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,041
I'm so glad.

414
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,125
Will you come
closer to me, Sora?

415
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,416
Sure.

416
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,416
I'm so proud of
the way you've grown up.

417
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,958
When we adopted you, I was
afraid Chikara and I would never

418
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,041
be able to fill your parents'
place in your heart.

419
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,625
I think you were worried about
that, too. I still remember

420
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,833
the first time you ever
called me 'Mother.'

421
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,458
I was so happy I felt
like crying for a week.

422
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:09,583
Even though you're all grown up
you're still our little girl.

423
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,333
We'll always worry about you,

424
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,250
but when we know that you're
doing well, we're happy.

425
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,333
We love you very much, Sora.

426
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,083
Oh, Mom.

427
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,416
If you ever need anything
don't be afraid to ask.

428
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,791
And Sora?

429
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,125
Yes?

430
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,958
I'd like you
to name your sister.

431
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,458
Are you sure you want me to--

432
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,166
I've always wanted you
to name my baby.

433
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,458
Oh...

434
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,625
Mom just called,
they're both all right!

435
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,333
That's great!

436
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,500
I'm so glad!

437
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,500
Come on, let's celebrate!
Call everyone!

438
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,458
Everyone?
Who else needs to know?

439
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:48,791
The Empress card is also known
to foretell childbirth...

440
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,166
She's lovely.

441
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,750
She really is. Congratulations.

442
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,000
Thanks.

443
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,458
We are so grateful for
everything you've done.

444
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,333
Oh. Well, we didn't do
anything extraordinary...

445
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,375
You should both be
very proud of your son.

446
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,041
Proud of me? Oh, wow!

447
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,750
You're here, little sister.

448
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,875
You've made our dreams
come true. And from now on,

449
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,833
I'm going to do my best
to achieve my dreams, too.

450
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,000
That's it!

451
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,375
What?

452
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,125
I thought of a name for her!
Yume! What do you think?

453
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,750
It's perfect.

454
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,916
That means 'dream,' right, Dad?

455
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,708
Did you say Dad?

456
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,208
Uh, I mean...

457
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,958
Yume... I can't wait
to see you grow up!

458
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,333
I want to do something
to repay Sora's kindness.

459
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,833
So we're doing our own show,

460
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,250
and it's full of
exciting new challenges.

461
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,458
And even though Layla
rejected our invitation...

462
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,791
...Rosetta came to help us
put together a new company.

463
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,541
And a mysterious masked
performer keeps showing up

464
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,916
from out of nowhere.

465
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,666
But who is she? Who? Who? Who?

466
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,166
Join us next time for 'Amazing
Change from Zero to Hero.'

467
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,916
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
